 The others in the series were great, and I really looked forward to A Breath of Snow and Ashes. It read like it was all Gabaldon's discarded notes for the previous installment.  I felt really cheated to have spent my time and money on this book.  
 I had high hopes for this book, having recently attended a seminar put on by Peter Montoya's agency - but at best it is a blatant sales pitch  for Mr. Montoya's advertising agency.  After looking at the glowing reviews listed here, I was at first surprised to see a review from a "Topher" - the speaker at the seminar I attended was named "Topher".  A coincidence?  Possibly. Until you notice that almost all of the reviews come from Southern California - the very location of Mr. Montoya's agency.  Amazon.com readers might be better served if some one other than Mr. Montoya's "friends" actually wrote some reviews 
 This one makes sense, because the fact that Kidz Bop is in existence is very, very scary.  You know someone was gonna say that sooner or later 
 i am a big talking heads fan.david byrnes career and songs post theads is a mixed bag to me.i thought rei mambo had a lot of terrific songs but none on on this dvd.the bands intensity is low key,the crowd is subdued, alot of songs just arent that great.native melody which i love just isnt that good.overall very disppointing.not much improvisation accompanying the basic tunes.you want some great concert dvds-u2 at sloan casle or elevation tour,bruce springsteen in spain or nyc,meatloaf in melbourne australia,cyndilauper.another disappointing one is david bowies latest concert dvd 
 This book reads like the authors' notes for giving presentations - which I'm sure it is. There is a ton of repetition, and it obviously wasn't edited at all. Plus, the grammar and punctuation are what you might get if you asked a third grader to write with the dense verboseness and gobbledygook of a military tech-writer. This is the first book on the subject that I have read, and there was some good, basic information, as well as some unintentional laughs. But surely there are better books out there, at a better price. The hard information in this could have easily been condensed down to a pamphlet 
 I loved Peter Robinson's "Gallow's View." "A Dedicated Man" slipped a bit. Now there's this one, which I didn't even finish. Too much procedure, not enough Banks. Not enough Jenny. The poor wife is nonexistant. That's where the story lies, not with Maggie's Farm. I will try some more Banks, but I don't know if I can keep going if they fail to engage 
 So far I've seen 67 out of 68 positive reviews for this book, and I say "Hurrah" for Richard Russo for all his positive praise. However, I disagree. The book has a flimsy to nonexistent foundation, that being backstory which takes circuitous twists and turns, and those turns take further turns.. So far I'm averaging 3 to 4 pages a night, and I'm a prolific reader. Why is Russo so fearful of forwarding the plot? Why the back and forth, the past histories upon past histories of every minor character? Just too much "muchiness" as the Brits would say 
 I have never read anything by Katha Pollitt that suggests even remotely that she thinks for herself.  This book is no exception.   I'm definitely a progressive, politically. But for once it would be nice to see Katha Pollitt take a position that isn't precisely on the leftist party line.    The fact that she doesn't suggests very strongly that her essays are all produced ex post facto:  First she makes sure she knows what the party line is -- no problem, given her The Nation. milieu.  Then she comes up with an intellectual-sounding justification for the position.  Mega-yawn 
 This novel was advertised as being funny but most of its humor is more stupid than funny. The basic idea of a LasVegas casino geter becoming an NFLowner had promise but Lupica just goes over the top in his satire. Good satire requiresat least some nuance as well as a degree of moral seriousness and Lupica displays  none of this in the novel which was full of cariacatures but no characters. I will continue to read his nonfiction but I doubt I will ready any  more of his novels 
 Having read Kerry Downes' standard monographs on Hawksmoor, Du Prey's "Architecture and Theology" is very disappointing. Du Prey does not, to begin, bring the book to its logical conclusion; despite commencing with a gushing account of Anglican Divines in Augustan England (Atterbury and Aldrich, though not, rather surprisingly, Sacheverall), the way in which contemporary religious thought might have conditioned the form of the churches built is inconclusive and not argued with the conviction that made an old article on the matter by Du Prey himself (ie., 'The Basilicas of the Primitive Christians') worthwhile. Furthermore, broad, out-of-context and misleading generalisations (such as a description of the Tory party of 1711 as 'right-wing') mixed with pockets of narrative make the book extremely irksome to read.  As if that were not bad enough, Du  Prey proves himself a brazen and misguided name-changer: St. George-in-the-East becomes 'St. George's-in-the-East', whilst St. Alfege, Greenwich, is nicely modernised as St. Alphege (which is, in fact, in dioscean records, a completely different church!).  These observations might seem pedantic, but such mistakes are quite surprising from a Professor of Architectural History.   Du Prey does not mention the churches of Gibbs (St. Mary-le-Strand, St. Martin-in-the-Fields), Archer (St. John Smith Square, Westminster, St. Paul, Deptford) or John James (St. George Hanover Sqaure), even though the latter collaborated on St. John Horselydown and St. Luke Old Street with Hawksmoor himself! Neither of the churches, not surprisingly, are studied at all.  This is a flaw which Kerry Downes highlighted in a review of the book; it ought to have elicited a little caution on my part, because "Architecture and Theology" is definately not worth the asking price 
 I read the reviews for the TS4GSD150 (the 4GB version of this card) and it seemed that that version seemed to work perfectly in Palms.. ..so I tried this 8GB version hoping for the same results.  Unfortunately, after two cards and a whole lot of frustration, I now realize that these do not work in the current generation of Palms, Canon cameras (I tried it in my new Canon S2 IS), IBM laptops (new Z60m), or a Dell Inspiron 6000 series.  Sooo, I'm not really sure what this card is suppose to work in. Maybe the stuff coming out later this year will be compatible. Until then, stick the with TS4GSD150 4GB version 
 The info in this book is ridiculously elementary for anyone with even intermediate experience with a camera.  The models are not particularly attractive.  And, while I appreciate the idea of making average-looking women look great in the image, even the resulting images are just average-looking and amateurish.  Most of the shots do not look professionally done at all, but just look more like they were done my some guy with his new-fangled digital camera.    Sorry... but there are far better books out there on this topic, even for beginners 
 Of Rick Moody's books, I've read "The Ice Storm" and "Garden State."  I liked both of them, although I prefer the film version of "The Ice Storm" to the novel.  So I picked up a paperback copy of "Demonology," thinking that it would be equally engaging.  I was wrong.  I couldn't make it past the first few stories, they were all very thin and flat, and as I was reading, I couldn't help but think, "Who cares?"  The first story, "The Mansion on the Hill," was unbelievably slow and tedious to get through, the same was true as I gave him another chance and started reading the subsequent stories, hoping in vain that things would get better.  A real disappointment.  I would drift off as I was reading, and could have skipped pages and still known what was going on in the plot.  A very empty, unsatisfying read.  Like expecting a steak dinner and only getting a rice cake 
 Very disappointed in the cheap quality and dull color. It doesn't look as nice as what they show on the internet. I returned it for a refund 
 This is yet another book in a long line of books from either the far right or the far left that do nothing but try to divide the country.  There is no issue that is black and white, there are more sides to issues than just the right or left.    This book may be for you if you are a mindless sheep who is to lazy to think for yourself.  And this is only my opinion.  Judge it for yourself.  
 The Bourne Identity by this author was great but this is a contrived, monumental bore.  Intricate plotting is only worth following if the themes and characters are worthy of attention.  This book is some kind of desperately single-minded, looney-left hate fest.  OK, you can say Hoover was a monster, and say it again 10 times, maybe even 50 or 60 times, but that does not a book make.  The world presented here is sick, but the sickness is the author's monomania 
 I'd read most of King's stuff during the uh decade of  my UTe.  Salem's  Lot and Pet Cemetery being  the hook on the line and     The Stand, Shining, Christine  and   IT reeling me in.  I thought he'd never come out with a book  that I didn't want to read cept anything of or related to his wife's stuff and the Gunslinger series.    Then one day I started to read Insomnia and I couldn't make it to the halfway point, the antiChristian Proabortion garbage was too thick for me to ignore and I found myself throwing Insomnia away, I did that with Cider House Rules by John Irving too.  Even Needful things with it's anti evangelical stuff could be ignored cause there is some truth to the anti Catholism and hypocrisy  but Insomnia was just plain mean spirited. 
 I had never read a Brother Cadfael book before this and I don't plan on reading any after.  This book was bland, boring and butchered the English language.  It was set in a sanitized version of the middle ages where everything sparkled besides, of course, the prose.  If you want to read a good book with similar elements, try The Name Of The Rose by Umberto Eco.  It's also about heresy, a mysterious book and a monk who investigates crimes during the middle ages.  However, unlike The Heretic's Apprentice, it's good 
 Paul Williams has put out a book, with a big emphasis on sources and footnotes and a scholarly appearance. Professionally put together it seems. He warns that Osama has dozens of nukes within the United States already and that the "American Hiroshima" is coming soon.   As a 911 resident, I started this book with considerable expectations and concern, but ended it almost not even wanting to bother finishing it. But I did. In some ways I see it now as another internal USA partisan type of publication, and frankly I am distracted by a "Clinton bad/Bush good" type of writing as opposed to sticking to the big issue, evaluating the threat of terrorism. I marked in my copy dozens of notes of dubious claims that are generally founded on the basis of the conspiracist logic rather than the logic of a factual analyst.   Examples:  1.  Author claims that TWA 800 flight was downed by the elusive terrorist Mughniah. I understand there are people who claim TWA 800 was shot down but NO SUCH proof has been put out, and in fact when the plane went down, the FBI took the case on as a criminal case but in the end found no evidence of a bomb and the case is definitely explained as a faulty wiring in the central fuel tank. Not a terrorist attack as Williams claims.   2. The author claims that radiological bombs (dirty nukes) pose a really serious threat. The reality is that they do not pose a disastrous threat, are slightly above conventional bombs. Radiological materials could cause fear, but the reality is that walking out of the radioactive zone is in all probability sufficient to survive. Whether as Williams claims, the "American economy would go into a tailspin" is simply not based on fact.   3.  Author claims (my copy page 186) that an Islamist in Florida named Hamdi brought Osama a replacement battery for OBL cell phone in May 1998. And that in August the embassies were bombed in West Africa. Allright, but Mr. Williams goes on to claim that "Bin Laden would have been incapable of orchestrating this without Tarik Hamdi and the replacement battery." Hard to prove these sort of claims. But my two questions are:  a) How can someone be responsible for OBL bombs in Africa by buying OBL a replacement cell phone battery? You know, they do have cell phone batteries outside of the USA.  But more importantly; b) how in the world can OBL not be able to get a battery for his darn cell phone while having at his disposal up to 20 nuclear bombs within the USA and a team of nuclear experts to maintain them? This is an absolute impossibility, this cell phone battery business.  4. "When will it happen?" Asks Mr. Williams about the nuke threat. He claims that Sept 11 was an important date because of a terrorist conviction in NYC. And that Aug 7 (embassy bombings) coincide with Bush1 decision to commit to Saudi. This sort of speculative pseudo-science analysis is merely rhetorical nonsense and is a simple distraction from the event of thousands of people being murdered by psychotic mass murderers.  5. Williams quotes Cheney as "proof," during the Bush 2004 campaign trail, oh, those precious truthtelling moments! Cheney speaking of nuclear threats coming up soon. "Cheney, on the campaign trail, warned that a nuclear attack by al Qaeda appears to be imminent." If I am not mistaken, most Americans see through this sort of politician rhetoric and know that the now long discredited Bush-Cheney ticket says all sorts of things to get what THEY want.   I have at least a dozen of other examples of these sort of issues. I dont want to spend more time on them. But in my view they totally deprive the book of legitemacy, in spite of many areas being informative and great writing. I just don't know whats true there, if I, of all dumb people, can find so many errors. I hoped to be able to use the book as a reference for my fact-soup, but that is not possible without to much salt.  This leaves the issue of nuclear threat altogether up in the air as the book can not properly address the issue. Sorry to say.  So anyway, I am filing it in my bookshelf on the right side of the middle uh, well, kinda right between the far right and the middle-right.   Still waiting for the good analytical book about a nuclear threat and terrorism. The last time "they" came to our neighborhood, it was not a nice day. Any recommendations for a book without a political slant and author creativity 
 If you are interested in a very traditional approach from a professional photographer, this book will provide lots of information.  It also provides valuable tips about controlling the dog.  But  for my taste, I found the photographic results to be uninspiring - too much posing, too much portraiture lighting, not enough of just plain capturing that  wonderful dog as it is 
 This English text of Serlio was made from a Dutch translation of Serlio's original Italian - it is a translation of a translation! The work also includes woodcuts borrowed from (amongst others) Albrecht Durer and never  used by Serlio. All those interested in what Serlio really wrote and drew  should consult the modern translation with original woodcuts published by  Yale UP in 1996 
 So, I bought this book thinking I was going to learn how to "open up to sexual creativity and erotic expression" but mostly what I got was "The World According to Susie."  While some of her insights were actually quite good, I found the book disjointed.  Rarely did it deliver what the title promised 
 This book lost almost all his credibility. Why ? How, in a book called "FRENCH ACES OF WW II", the writer dedicates only five lines ( that's right, five lines !! )to the greatest of them all, Pierre Clostermann of the RAF ?!! ( according to French official sources quoted by the author himself ). It seems that the writer want to avoid the controversy surrounding Clostermann scores: the British ( for whom he flew during all his career in WW II ) credit him with between 11 and 15 air victories, and the French give him 33 !! Ohter than this, the book doesn't even mention Rene Mouchotte, a great leader of the first Free French squadrons in RAF - numbers 340 and 341 ( although he was not an ace ). Weird distribution of topics, because Frenchmen in the RAF have only six pages to their credit ...It seem the writer got completely lost in the vast ammount of information he probably had, and the result was this catastrophic, disappointing book !! 
 This book seems to be a good eye catcher because of the color and the simplicity of the title. It definitely caught my attention to buy it. Was I sorry it did. This book provides nothing whatsoever. Everything is very straighforward and commonsense unless you are a five-year-old, then yes, you should buy this book. You ever get this feeling when you are reading a book that it seems you are reading a whole lot but not getting any information out of it? This is exactly the feeling I was getting while reading this book. If you truly want to KNOW about investing then get "A Random Walk Down Wall Street". This book summarizes what investing and the stock market is all about and the writing is superb 
 50 westerns, seems like a bargain?!  Well... maybe, depending on your tolerance for sub-par film transfers.  There are some great films here to be sure, but at least a third are pretty bad transfers, and the rest are mostly just marginal at best. Virtually all of the more commonly available films offered here can be found in significantly better quality elsewhere.  Virtually all of the half dozen or so of the films from the 1960's are total trash - you can not watch these without getting a headache - totally unwatchable!!!  For example, check out "The Grand Duel" starring Lee Van Cleef in the sixties - a totally washed out, blurry disaster, probably one of the very worst film transfers I have ever seen on DVD (note: a much better film transfer of this movie is available on the Platinum issued Lee Van Cleef DVD).  On the other hand, in this collection you get an early 1940's era film like Howard Hughes' "The Outlaw" in near pristine condition.  Most of the other films in this collection fall somewhere in between quality wise.    But, you should be aware that in most cases these same films can be found in significantly better quality in other generally superior DVD collections - see my other Amazon reviews for several examples. Check out "Tough Guys of the West" for a much better collection of 20 similar B-Westerns or check out any of the Platinum issued DVDs included in "The Great American Western" series.  Included in this collection are several commonly found Roy Rogers and Gene Autry films - however, these are mostly just copies from fuzzy VHS and as a result most of them have a slight out of focus look to them - you get used to it after awhile and you can watch them o.k., but just be warned that the quality is somewhat lower than your average VHS tape.  I have found that the Madacy or Platinum issued Roy Rogers films are generally as good and in some cases better film transfers than what you find in this collection (see my review for the Madacy issued Roy Rogers DVDs).  Also, you might want to check out the Roan Group issued DVDs for some other Roy Rogers titles not included here in this collection (see my review for more details on those great DVDs).  And then you have the Tex Ritter and Bob Steele films - these appear to be actually mastered from original 16mm or 35mm film - the only problem is that they tend to have a lot of scratches and splices at certain points.  In one Tex Ritter film the soundtrack gets out of synch with the action and talking for about 20 minutes.  But even so, you do get a reasonably sharp image direct from film instead of a third rate, fuzzy VHS copy.  And often these films run for quite a long time without any problems and when problems do pop up it's only for a minute or two - in other words, you can mostly enjoy the films without eye strain.  Even so, I will warn you that these particular early Bob Steele and Tex Ritter films are not really that great even considering the time period and the genre.  Both Tex and Bob have made better films than the ones offered in this collection - these are mostly just "o.k." performances - nothing great.    If you like Bob Steele you should check out a superior performance in the film credited to Roy Rogers, "The Carson City Kid" which is included in this collection.  This is an early Roy Rogers (pre-Dale Evans) film which co-stars Bob Steele.  "Carson City Kid" is very enjoyable, but again, as noted above, the transfer of the Roy Rogers films here are not very sharp (the one put out by Madacy, for example, while still not perfect, is far better than the transfer included in this collection, while the one issued by Platinum easily has the best best picture of all, but that soundtrack is easily the worst!  So, take your pick!) - but, in any case, my point is that Bob Steele's performance as the bad guy in this film is much better than the other earlier films he stars in that are included in this collection.    "Vengence Valley" with Burt Lancaster is in color and a great movie, but the image here is not very sharp and the color is severely faded out as if copied from a VHS copy someone left on the dashboard of the car a bit too long!  I have the version issued by Platinum and it is nearly perfect with pretty good color and very sharp looking. Get the Platinum version and avoid the one in this collection!   "The Kansan" and "Abilene Town" are both really great movies, but here they are both particularly fuzzy looking - again, another case of bad transfers from VHS?  "Abilene Town", for example, can be found in much, much better quality on the "Tough Guys of the West" DVD collection (see my review for "Tough Guys of the West").  "The Kansan" is also available on Alpha Video and while Alpha has a very mixed track record for some of these films, their version in this case is much better than the one in this collection - see my Amazon review).  The early John Wayne films are also a mixed bag - most are fuzzy looking, but some might actually be from film instead of VHS copies - it's hard to tell.  "McLintock" from 1963 is basically trash in this collection - very fuzzy and very faded color. Please also note that "McLintock" is being released very shortly (or has been released by the time you read this) by the John Wayne estate on DVD - you will probably want get that one!  Better film transfers of some of these early Lone Star Production John Wayne films (at least not any worse and in some cases significantly better) can found on the Roan Group DVD, "The Early Years Collection." I have a much better, near perfect DVD transfer of "Angel and the Bad Man" (from Good Times) compared to the fuzzy version you find in this set.    A couple of other films are rare in that I have never seen them offered on DVD before, so you might need to get this set for those.  "Billy the Kid Trapped" and "Arizona Stagecoach" for instance are ones I had never seen before on DVD - I found both to be very enjoyable and are from film transfers, but again with a lot of splices and scratches at various points - but still very enjoyable and very watchable.  I don't think any of the Tex Ritter films are available elsewhere.  The same Bob Steele films in this collection are also offered on Alpha Video DVDs, but I don't know if they are in any better condition on Alpha than what you find here in this collection, but my guess is you would likely be better off with the Alpha versions.  So, the bottom line is that you should get this if; (1) You need a good copy of "The Outlaw" - it's the only film here that is in pristine condition. (2) You need to have the few films that only appear in this DVD collection and nowhere else.  (3) You don't want to spend a lot of money, and don't care about quality, yet you want to sample a lot of early B-Westerns to get some idea of what the genre looks like. Actually, on second thought, you would be far, far better off in getting the 10 DVD 20 movie collection "Tough Guys of the West" if that is your goal.  That collection gives you a much better bargain in terms of quality than the "50 Western Classics."     Here's another tip for you.  If you are looking at B-Westerns for the first time you might want to check out the Hopalong Cassidy films offered by Platinium - there are 40 films total on 5 DVD volumes that you can get really cheap!  Some vendors sell these for less than two dollars a disc (each disc has 5 films on it)!  Do the math - with shipping you are looking at about $1 per film.  And they are in absolute pristine condition!  Check it out - the Hopalong Cassidy films are among the very best B-Westerns ever made.  The Red Ryder series is also available on DVD issued by VCI and I have seen most of them - they are great films with pretty good film transfers - you will not be disappointed in those.  Here is the complete list of films in this set:    John Wayne: Angel and the Badman  Blue Steel  McLintock  Sagebush Trail  Hell Town  Roy Rogers: The Carson City Kid  Colorado  Young Bill Hickok  In Old Caliente  Rough Riders Round-Up  Sheriff of Tombstone  My Pal Trigger  Cowboy and the Senorita  Bells of San Angelo  Under California Stars  Tex Ritter: Rollin Plains  Sing Cowboy Sing  The Mystery of the Hooded Horseman  Arizona Days  Song of the Gringo  Springtime in the Rockies  Gene Autry: Round-Up Time in Texas  Man of the Frontier  Riders of the Whistling Pines  Bob Steele: Paroled To Die  The Oklahoma Cyclone  Bruce Bennett: Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer  Vengeance Valley starring Burt Lancaster  Billy the Kid Trapped starring Buster Crabbe  Kentucky Rifle starring Chill Wills  Painted Desert starring George O'Brien  It Can Be Done Amigo starring Jack Palance  Gone with the West starring James Caan  The Outlaw starring Jane Russell  White Comanche starring Joseph Cotton  Phantom Rancher starring Ken Maynard  The Grand Duel starring Lee Van Cleef  Mohawk starring Neville Brand  Abilene Town and 7th Cavalry starring Randolph Scott  Arizona Stagecoach starring Ray "Crash" Corrigan  Broadway to Cheyenne starring Rex Bell  The Santa Fe Trail starring Errol Flynn American Empire starring Richard Dix  The Kansan starring Richard Dix  Gunfight at Red Sands starring Richard Harrison  Stagecoach to Denver starring Robert Blake  The Sundowners starring Robert Preston  China 9, Liberty 37 starring Warren Oates  Judge Priest starring Will Rogers  
 This is a good phone, except it has one major flaw which makes it unusable. First off, a minor flaw is that it is hard to pick up the reciever as it is locked in there, I don't like that. Another flaw is that while you are picking up and putting back the phone, it makes a VERY high and LOUD screaming pitch. This makes it almost deafening for someone on another phone in the house. This phone will be going back ASAP because it is unusable. Stay away from this phone at all costs 
 Having grown up on Rackham's sales models, I have huge respect for him and his work. When I was a sales rep at HP in the 1980s, Rackham's book changed my career and life, catapulting me from junior rep to SVP Global Sales (different company now). SPIN Selling is dead on the money in terms of what true sales pro's need to make the big bucks; it's still the best book in its field. I saw this new book from Rackham a month ago (note: it's been out there for 7 or 8 years) and bought it.  I was very disappointed.  Every great author/guru deserves one pass so I guess this is Rackham's. Rethinking The Sales Force is pedantic and tedious, filled with "consultant-speak" and the tired old models from McKinsey & Co (mgmt consultants) that every sales professional has had to labor through in internal process meetings. The "case studies" are mostly quips and 3 to 5 sentence anecdotes few of which are genuinely interesting or helpful. My real criticism of the book is it takes over 200 pages to say something that deserves one paragraph: some customers want a low-cost product and a low-end relationship, other customers want a more consultative, deeper relationship, and, pretty much, you have to know which is which to be successful. Makes sense. Worth an article in a magazine, but not a whole book.  Summary: this is just not a strong sales book.  LIke I said though, Rackham is a great figure in the sales field and his ideas have done a lot for me personally. I hope in his next book he shakes off the ennui so apparent in this last one and delves back into the original thinking 
 Leadership depends upon dynamism (action). "Go forward." (p. 53) It means application using past battles as lessons. The author was clear that Patton believed in direct action based on facts. The center of the book stresses Patton's action orientation ad nauseum. The three maxums are speed, simplicity and boldness. In presentation, Patton has the sound of genius and the subtext tells a story of impulsive foolishness, high drama and overcompensation. It is unclear if the author intended to impliy that or if it is misreading in the Paul de Man sense. Pattion was a show and, perhaps, a rebel though that is not clear in the book either. He said "Army regulations are written by those who have never been in battle." (p 248) The author suggests it has something to say about corporate management. What, the author doesn't say. Using polite military terms, the book is S.O.S.(on toast) Go figure. Eric J. Lindblom PhD Harvar 
 This is one of the most uninteresting novels I have ever read.  There was nothing in the whole book that was worth reading.  The characters are so 1 dimensional that from the get go you can see through them all and wish you weren't reading the book.  I finished the novel, just to see if it ever redeems itself.  Please don't waste your time 
 There are only two decent songs on the album.  I burned it off of a friend because it isn't worth buying 
 You know this guy did appeal to me at first, but if you have this CD youve heard American Bad Ass, right? Listen to Metallicas "Sad But True". He ripped off the guitar part completely. H e tries to be metal, hardcore rap, and country at the same time. Fails miserably. He is a talentless wigger. Wait...thats too nice. I hope he commits suicide 
 This book started out well, but it wore itself out due to monotony.   Examples were given over and over and over again about how the main character writes letters to get free stuff and bring about change.    I had to stop reading because I said to myself, "I get it! You write letters to get what you want, now get on with the story."  Bentley Little's books are all very similar.  He takes an ordinary entity (writing letters, convenient store chains, mailmen, college, homeowners association, resorts, insurance policies) and he turns it into an absurd oppressive force that involves violence and sex.  I don't understand why he is so famous or so widely read 
 I think this book should have been entitled Over 60 and Gettin' Stronger. I'm 46 and I was really looking forward to getting this book in the mail. I think it is more geared to people over 60. Quite a few of the models were much older. I won't get a lot out of this book as far as exercises go. Quite a lot of the exercises weren't using dumbbells. You get the impression from the cover that the exercises will be heavily geared to using dumbbells but this isn't the case. I was disappointed with this book. I recommend Weight Training For Dummies which gives you excellent information and exercises to do. And also, Smart Girls Do Dumbbels by Judith Sherman-Wolin. That book is loaded with dumbbell exercise.  
 I recently ordered a replacement pitcher.  I ordered the wrong pitcher.  I have e-mailed them twice and have yet to hear from them.  Now I am stuck with a pitcher and now have to find the right one.  It was my firsttime doing business with them and now my last 
 I could not put this one down- I finished it in one evening, I just couldn't wait to find out what happened next, with the family and the court case. However, I was deeply disappointed by the ending. It was lame, it was soap opera-esque, it was so unworthy of this great story. Tacked-on and totally unneeded- it should have ended ten pages sooner, that would have be a fine conclusion 
 Interesting, but I hadn't expected the "question/answers" format.  However, I am getting through it 
 This otherwise well-written book, is way too conservative when it comes to interpreting the story behind it. It is basically a remake of E. Lessing's "The Adventures of Odysseus", and E. Bradford's "Ulysses Found", and does not really present a PLAUSIBLE journey for Odysseus. It is disappointing to find that there is no critical challenge of any of the locations the Greek and Roman historians concluded upon 2000 years ago 
 OS 10.4 seeks to be all things to all men, thus it contains many MB of no possible use to most users. It needs to include a purging program to remove trash. Fonts in foreign languages, translations (how many people in the US want to convert classical Chinese to simplified Chinesw), printer drivers for printers that the user doesn't have consume a great deal of space. This book needs to be far more aggressive.  
 I just wonder if this would have been published without the author's being married to an author;  I find his stuff repetitively boring as well.  This is a simplistic story of an orphan wife who acts as though she can't stand her husband and seems to glory in anything she can do to upset him  Her friend in these endeavors is an obviously manic / depressive (sorry, term has been replace by bi-polar victim ) whose wealth seems to make her the star.  Their enemy is the EVIL (can't use that word either) Eagle Forum which is trying to close down the local store where the kids get their drug paraphanalia.  It seems that both ladies have problems (oops, not allowed any more by the political correctness police, I mean 'issues') with their male counterparts.  They act like they hate their husbands.  I'd recommend this to anyone who hates Religious people and loves to see kids getting in trouble with drugs.  A dog . .  
 Shawn reveals (indirectly) that he is a disloyal Catholic. Now before you rate this review as unhelpful I'll explain why that is relevant: It shows he is a hypocrite and that his book is therefore hypocritical. Now although a hypocrite can get things right, when it comes to morality they usually get things wrong, which Shawn certainly did do in his teachings in this book. For example:  He promotes (and worships) democracy and "liberty" over God. I'm sure some of you Catholics will be like "what? He advocates the Bible in school and school prayer" but that doesn't mean he is advocating it for the right reasons, just as the Pharisees didn't advocate religion and the Old Testament for, ultimately, the right reasons. Now perhaps some of you will think, "Well who cares as long as he is advocating what is right, who cares about his motives." Well he says what his motives are and they go contrary to the Bible, so in the end he is promoting something which is just as self-defeating as liberalism, etc.. He reveals in his book that his motives are to maintain the (publically known) Republican agenda (plus getting the bible and prayer in public schools, etc.), promoting and upholding democracy throughout the world, and indirectly promotes the whitewashed historical teachings and books in public schools (although I'm sure he wouldn't if he really knew more accurately the history of the U.S.)  So, what's wrong with promoting liberty, democracy, and the white wash in schools? Obviously no one wants white wash and most American's know the usual history text books in school are something the inquisitions might have had success using, so I'll move on to liberty and democracy. Liberty in Shawn's eyes INCLUDES the right to promote Catholocism and not just the  traditional religions. For us who are saved and many atheists know that the Catholic religion is a cult, and promoting it is treason (among other things) in our eyes. Now for democracy. The U.S. has a rigged democracy, and it is really an Aristocratic Democracy, everyone knows that, even Shawn, it just slips his mind because he lets himself get majorly distracted.  As an example of Shawn's ignorance of the more complicated parts of U.S. history, and his gullibility, he says in his book that F.D.R. was a democratic leader. Yet many teens in high school know that isn't true having heard his "New Deal". Even wiki acknowledges that that was communistic. He also perpetuates the myth that Islamic terrorists were responsible for twin tower DEMOLITION. Anyone with the net and who knows to double check facts, and who knows the evil side of America's history knows what I mean by "demolition" in reference to 9/11.  He also perpetuates this illogical goal: unity (under democracy) for the sake of it (like just supporting Bush, Jr. regardless of what he says). He doesn't say it but implies it. Unity for the sake of allowing Bush Jr. and the troops in Iraq to have a nice day is stupidity.  And check out this self-centered attitude: "some sick cell of terrorists just attacked my world." Well what happened to the people they attacked, their world, the one that ended that day?  He also picks on Clinton for reasons you can probably guess, as if he was the ONLY bad president. This book is childish, and I don't mean that in a mean way, I mean it's as if it were written by an angry, poorly educated, arrogant preteen who had a good editor.  One thing he does imply, and rightly so, is that the "Koran" is evil. But, big surprise, didn't come out and say that outright, I WONDER WHY?! So much for courage 
 I read this book because it was supposed to be one of Heinlein's classics.  I liked several of Heinlein's early works and thought I'd try this one, although I heard it was controversial.  After reading it, I can see why.  I cannot recommend this book.  It is not a classic, and if it wasn't written by Heinlein it probably wouldn't have been published, and if it was published, would have been forgotten long ago.  Other reviewers state that this is a book that questions social customs.  I'm sorry, but stories about time travel in which the protagonist meets and beds his mother as a young woman are not questioning social norms, they are the rantings of a dirty old man.  `To Kill a Mockingbird' this is not.  The Notebooks of Lazarus Long are entertaining, but they don't make up for the poor quality of the rest of the text.  I regret spending money on this book, and I really regret losing the time I wasted reading it.  7MAY06 - I've added to this review after receiving a few not helpful votes, because, in part, I was concerned that my original review was too terse.  My opinion about this novel has not changed.  This is a series of stories about the life and adventures of Lazarus Long, a man who has lived thousands of years and experienced, effectively, multiple lives.  That is, he has loved, married, and 'built a life' several times.  He has now grown weary of the tedium of life and is contemplating suicide.  The novel consists of dialogue with some of his living decendants as he tells the story of his life.  Stories, really.  Each major section in the book is a vignette in LLs life.  In theory, this was a very good idea for a sci-fi novel, but in practice, this novel is simply tripe.  There are several things that I really dislike about this novel and would not recommend it to anyone.  Like much of Heinlein's later writings, this novel explores alternate family relationship (i.e. a code for incest).  As I mentioned above, one of the vignettes involves LL travelling back in time to bed his mother.  Another relates a `complex' (i.e. sexual) relationship between brother and sister.  Additionally, most of the novel is dialogue between the characters, there isn't much action.  I generally view this as a strength, not a weakness, but in this case the dialogue can be classified only as mindless banter loaded with sexual inuendo and overtone.  The characters on Beverly Hills 90210 had better lines.  If you are looking for a good science fiction novel, this is NOT IT.  This is really a novel about alternate family relationships with some sci-fi elements (e.g. longevity and time travel) in the plot.  There are some who may find this type of novel compelling, but from my perspective, the author of `Starship Troopers' and `The Puppet Masters' fell a long way when he published this novel.  The Notebooks of Lazarus Long, a collection of witty saying interspersed throughout the book are great.  Judging from the other reviews, there are many who find this novel appealling.  Just be warned that this novel is very different than Heinlein's earlier classics.  There may be Time Enough for Love, but most people don't have enough time in their life to waste on this silliness 
 We've all seen detective series that gradually petered out as their authors obsessed with their characters and forgot that, first and foremost, you need a mystery to have a good book. I loved the previous Falco books, and Davis continues to have outstanding historical detail and character development, but I'm afraid that this plot isn't worthwhile. There's more excitement in Helena's pregnancy than in the breakup of a incipient olive oil cartel, and Falco doesn't seem to solve as much as blunder. Here's hoping that this effort was an aberration 
 The Junie B. Jones series represents thoughtful storytelling replete with the sorts of syntactic and semantic errors that all thoughtful parents try to stamp out of their children's discourse conventions. For example, my multilingual daughter, a second grader in an international school in Japan, incessantly mixes Korean, Japanese and English grammars and meanings, not to mention reproducing the very colloquial forms of casual spoken English I'm always encouraging her to readjust in agreement with more standardized forms.  The typical difficulties that young native speakers of English have in moving, say, from the comparative to the superlative or in adjusting tense forms in regular and irregular verbs are codified throughout this series. Those who might object to this critique would also have to defend why errors such as those referenced here occur not only in the dialogues among the characters, but also in the expository portions of the stories. The author makes no effort to encourage her young readers to see the differences between colloquial forms and the more widely accepted standardized forms.  Thanks to Ms. Park's efforts, young children honing their language skills now have an opportunity to model the varieties that society generally deplores. Though her stories are delightfully cute, her methods do not further the kinds of knowledge that the larger society will come to expect from informed citizens. If her editor hasn't yet been dismissed, I would encourage Ms. Park to reflect a bit more on her approach to educational texts. 
 If you want to see Matthew Bourne's choreography, your in for a major disappointment. The constant pseudo-artsy cutting, jarring close-ups, and poor shots of the dancing make this a jarring and extremely disappointing video. Be warned if you have epilepsy. The fast continuous scene switching will probably induce an episode 
 This self-aggrandizing autobiographical screenplay has virtually nothing to do with Susan Orlean's fascinating book "The Orchid Thief", which is about legal inequality at the Federal level. Instead, Kaufman insults his employers character and our taste & intelligence by insisting that no one will see any film that doesn't have drugs, sleazy sex and high speed chases - none of which appear in Orlean's fine book, but are substituted by Kaufman for the entire premise of the original work.  Some of Kaufman's past work was novel and entertaining. This screenplay is, at best, depressing. Read Orlean's book instead 
 i was told this movie was great, very humorous, but it wasn't. there were a couple parts that were funny, but the quality is terrible (even for a movie made in 1935). it hasn't been cleaned up or repaired at all and it's very, very hard to see. it's not worth the money in the slightest 
 Once Upon a Time is a lament of the loss of the old ways. While it does have Sloane's trademark illustrations and observations, it constantly compares the old to the inferior modern ways. Written in 1982, not all the complaints still apply, and they detract from his usual, loving description of early America.  I grew up with A Reverance for Wood and A Museum of Early American Tools, which I always loved. This book is not up to the standard that Sloane set with his earlier work 
 I was disapointed when I downloaded it and got 8 pages. As a customer, I expected to have the digital version of the full book and not a summary. I thought that the price difference was due to the absence of paper, printing, handling, shipping, etc. The hardcover version is more than 300 pages; if you take the price per page of the digital version, the hardcover version should cost then ten times more!!! All the examples are referred to that version and nowhere I was said that I was paying 5 dollars for a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PRODUCT.  I honestly believed that I was buying the full book. I will think better before ebuying again... 
 This was not what I expected, I love "food" movies like "Eat drink man woman", "Tortilla Soup", "Like Water for Chocolate",This movie was just a long boring trek through bad accents and poorly lit italian food, I realize that the food was supposed to be showcased here, but it didnt wet my appetite a bit, a can of chef boyardee looks more appetizing. I was glad the restaurant tanked, that louis prima didnt show up. The "big night" turned out to be a tiny blip of a movie 
 The bed warmer was described as "dual" controlled.  It comes with only one control.  The entire bed has to be at the same temperature.  The reason I wanted "dual" control was because my husband is always warm and I'm almost always cold --- hence, seperate controls were needed.  Since we had the coldest winter in years, I adapted the product to work because there was no time to return and request what was described. It does heat well though 
 This was a total disappointment, went to the used CD store within a month, blah 
 If I like the way an author writes, I give that author's genres, other than mystery, a chance. These stories have become boring.  I am going back to her FBI and crime fiction.  Her plots are still fine there 
 I generally really like well-researched historical fiction, and have been a big fan of Dorothy Dunnett and Philippa Gregory (though the latter takes a lot of liberties with history).  I was quite drawn into this book from the first sentence, and found the description of life on the manor rich and convincing.  But.  began to switch off around the time we discover Jacob Cullen is possessed?  haunted?  by a "Voice" that encouraged him to brutally kill a young boy, and then rape his new bride.  Jacob ends up in the New Model Army where he forms an intense relationship with Ferris, who is a naturally good man.  The descriptions of the war and the brutality are vivid and detailed.    After they get back to London, Ferris becomes obsessed with forming a common plot for "diggers," and he and Jacob form an intense homosexual romance.  At that point and for the rest of the book everything was rather overheated and lusty.  It seemed like every other page was a description of longing for the embrace or the sweetness between their legs etc.  I would have been equally bored if this had been a heterosexual couple, but I couldn't connect this simpering Ferris with the earlier Ferris, and Jacob's bouts of violence began to bore me.  The book ends when they've been kicked off the common brutally by the neighboring lord, with the implication that Jacob could have stopped it but just didn't, and Jacob is on a boat to America crying. The Voice is silent.   I feel as though I didn't get it. A number of readers here assume the Voice is a symptom of Jacob's schizophrenia or madness, but it's presented in the book as though it really is the devil.  Well, which? Did Jacob rape his own brother when he was a teenager, as implied in one scene?  I kind of resented the way the author withheled information from us-- it's first-person narration, but the author only conveniently reveals/remembers these types of things, when for the first 70-80 pages of the book, Jacob is presented as well-liked and decent.  It just seemed flashy.  The book's change in focus and tone felt somewhat ad hoc.      Lots of loose threads with Jacob's family.  Ultimately, I was disappointed.  After zooming through the first half, I just naturally slowed down and took a week to read the rest.  By then I was cottoning on that the author was never going to reveal the mysteries, that no one plot was going to develop in a satisfying way, and that she enjoyed vivid descriptions of violence and sex but not deeper characterizations.  She can definitely bring a period to life, but the characters were ultimately shadowy and the storytelling was disjointed 
 I'm a big fan of her other works, but this one was so fragmented and uninspired that I quit without finishing.  Life is too short to waste time reading bad books 
 Although it looks the same as the HG Wells story and the 1960 movie, this bastardization of the source material turns a frightening story about man's nature into a mildly fun sci-fi outing. Alexander's motivation for building the Time Machine is entirely different, and what he learns 80,000 years in the future could have been deduced by a more probing scientific mind (that is, if it was used to dealing with less than scientific cinematic time-travel paradoxes).  So the first half of the movie wreaks havoc on the source material and pales in comparison with the fabulous creativity of the George Pal version. We don't even find out anything about what we are about to see!  But things get worse is in the distant future. Although the writing tries to dance around the fact -- they have de-fanged the harsh reality of the Eloi and softened the horriffic underpinnings of their naivete. Instead of unknowing sheep, they are new-agey world-culture pluralists. The dichotomization of the human race really makes little sense. And there is no Rod Taylor running about castigating the apathy of his hosts.  The only reason why I give the film two stars is because it is one of the only genuine sci-fi films in years, and I found some of the special FX (the moon) and Jeremy Irons, cheesy as they may have been, fun 
 A sorry science fiction book (not a mystery novel in my judgement) not written by Ludlum but his name is on the cover to sell books (my viewpoint). The book takes advantage of todays terrorist threats and smallpox concerns to stir the readers interests but nothing in the book reflected the writings of Ludlum. I strongly suspect that Ludlum did not even write the outline for this book and the sorriest one, "The Paris Option" 
 I wanted to like this book.  I tried to like it, I really did.  But this book failed to capture me.  I love Andre Norton and grew up reading her.  The first sci-fi I ever read as a kid was Andre Norton's Solar Queen books, and I quite like the new collaborations written in the SQ universe.    Even as an adult, I can pick up and re-read with great enjoyment most of her books.  I often pull out my copies of "Catseye" or "Moon of Three Rings" or "Flight in Yiktor" for a great few hours of reading.   I'm afraid I won't be re-reading this book. For while the basic idea of this book is vintage Norton, the writing failed to pull me in like the best of her books always do.  The switching point of view threw me out of Laris' character, but then again she didn't come across as a very compelling character to begin with.  The writing was noticeably choppy to the point where I had to put the book down in frustration several times.  It's a fairly mediocre successor to the excellent "Beastmaster" in my opinion 
 This book is not worth the time or effort to read it.  And I do mean effort.  Marvel decided to be cheapskates this time out and had the binding glued.  Which means you have to pry it open and hold it with both hands to see all the art and/or Wordballons when you start getting to the middle of this book.  So I say, save your money.  Pass this one by and show Marvel that you expect better for 75 bucks then this 
 The writing is pedestrian and the plot makes no sense.  I thought something might change, that it might become an interesting ghost story, or there might be moral issues, or maybe even a character would grow or change.  The heavy-handed ending is, perhaps, intended to demonstrate how the intense oppression and suppression of women in Amish culture forces them to violence against their loved ones...but that's a pretty heavy message for a book that seems full of meaninglessness.  Are we supposed to take everything that Ellie says about the Amish in court (peaceful, gentle, incapable of murder, loving, child-centric, willing to accept an out-of-wedlock child into the community) as lies?  The ending belongs to a much darker book.  My biggest complaint though is the bad writing and editing, I kept stumbling over inconsistencies and that always inhibits my enjoyment of a story.  
 I agree that this is a beautiful product; however, I returned these earrings not long ago. The reason is that there is a half arrow at the end of the hook which is used to lock the earring. I tried to wear them, but the half arrow was too big, and I couldn't get them through my earlopes.   
 I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK 
 "When Calls the Heart" had absolutely no depth whatsoever.  The character's were one dimensional and predictable.  But, thankfully, there was hardly any religious preaching, which I was thankful for.  The chapters were very short, and were written as if they were from a child, with no meaning.  And, as always, the ending came up so quickly, and ends so abruptly.  If you're looking for a mindless read, then this is for you.  If not, then I do not recommend 
 Some of the works of art are lovely, but 2 are too violent for a child to study. In one, a man is being beheaded and another shows a nightmarish scene with a man on fire. Is this the best the author could find? Sure to turn some children away from art 
 Hoping Gregory Orfella would provide the rare opportunity to understand American history from the perspective of the Arab American,I began reading his book eagerly.  I can appreciate Orfella's pride in the achievements of hardworking first generation immigrants, but when it comes to politics please stick to facts. On page 151, he describes that "in 1948, full-scale war broke out between the Zionist forces and the idigenous Palestinian Arabs" they are described  as "poorly reinforced" and "rag-tag".   In reality, a day after it's Declaration of Independence, Israel was attached by five (5) Arab countries, Egypt,Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq.   I had hoped this would be a new important book, helping to build bridges to understanding and peace. Instead it fatally weakened by the old self serving Palestinian rhetoric 
   Phil Sheridan was a sociopath who wanted to murder the battered remnants of Lee's army just before the surrender. His bloodlust was later satisfied when he was turned loose on the American Indian. Pure genocide. I'm not sure we have ever produced uglier little man in our 400 years in this hemisphere. 
 I am a huge Artaud fan.  He was a true visionary, a prophet of brutal truth in a lazy, complacent world.  So I was really looking forward to reading this new anthology of works from his ultra-disturbing late period.  But I have to say I found it disappointing.  The translations, by noted language poet Clayton Eshleman, sound stilted and wooden to my ear, favoring cleverness over raw power.  The exhaustively researched notes don't quite make up for this poetic deficiency.  I turned to my beloved copy of City Light's "Artaud Anthology" (one of my all-time favorite books) and did line by line comparisons of Eshleman's work with the brilliant Ferlinghetti and David Rattray translations in the older book, and there was just no comparison.  It really isn't surprising that the 60's beat-era poet-translators just had a much better grasp of Artaud's earth-shattering radicalism than poets of today.  The City Lights one is the keeper for sure (it's still in print): take that one with you to a desert island and I guarantee you won't even want to be rescued and brought back to "civilization. 
 if I didn't watch the movie Green Street Hooligans first. They are almost the same movie. Green Street Hooligans is flat out more entertaining, buy that instead 
    Bryant was a great coach, but Dunnavant is a Bryant fan, plain and simple.  He tells a sweet and sugary account of Bear's storied life, and leaves out the true tales of Bear's excessive drinking and also of his extra marital adventures. A "fan" should never write a "biography" about his or her hero. I think Bryant was an outstanding coach, but you'll have to look elsewhere if you want any REAL enlightenment about the life and times of Bear Bryant.... 
 Kool Keith=Nasty Ass, weird Lyrics with a horrible flow, and on this CD they suck even more to craptastic beats... Have Fun 
 I received this as an XMas gift and can't get through it.  The book feels forced and manufactured.  There are points that are relatable but are painfully obvious, if you are a fantasy football player you are better off reading your league message board.  Everyone can relate to the overzealous owner in their league, most overzealous owners don't try to write a book 
  Nearly thirty years ago Saturday Night Live ran a hilarious TV commercial parody promoting "Puppy Uppers" and "Doggie Downers" to control a dog's behavior.  The reason it was so funny at the time is that it was totally absurd.  Nothing like that could ever happen, right?    Wrong.  Thanks to Nicholas Dodman and THE DOG WHO LOVED TOO MUCH it's now become a way of life for far too many American dogs and their owners.    Granted, when your dog is driving you crazy and you don't know what else to do, Prozac can seem like a godsend.  The only trouble is that nearly all of the behavioral problems Dr. Dodman encounters in the various chapters of this book could have been solved quite easily (okay, maybe "fairly" easily) with natural dog training techniques, which work not by desensitizing the dog to emotional triggers in the environment, but by resensualizing him, meaning by putting his instincts BACK INTO BALANCE with his environment.  (The only exception is a dog who exhibits OCD, as this is a definite neurological problem, not just a behavioral one.)  And another thing, in my fifteen years as a dog trainer in New York City, I've yet to see operant conditioning techniques, like the ones Dodman uses in this book, attain more than 15 to 20 percent effectiveness with any of the behavioral problems it's used on.  (This marked lack of success is, sadly, the main reason behaviorists are prescribing drugs more and more often.)  Dodman seems to have had even less than a 15% success ratio, though that could just be a result of his presenting the hardest cases to the reader in order to explain the necessity for these dogs to be put on psychotropic drugs.  And by the way, why do these drugs only work for about three months or so before the behavior re-presents itself or worsens?    And since Dodman (or his publishers) deliberately misused the word "love" in his title in order to sell more books, my last question is this: wouldn't it be great if Dodman loved dogs half as much as he loves drugs? 
 This is an atrocious book.  The author's "professional job search" is an excuse to trash career counselors, fat people, and Christians--people that, judging from the prejudicial attitudes expressed in this book--Barbara despises, with a capital D.  Despite her lazy job search and a faked resume--I question her ethics--Ms. Holier-Than-Thou found two jobs.  Wasn't that the whole point? As one reader below notes, she turned them down because they weren't good enough for her. She clearly has her private demons, and "professional level work" may be one of them.    Barbara's book makes me think that she must be extremely insecure.  She doesn't want anyone to think she is less than competent.  Maybe that's why she rejects help, lashes out, criticizes others, and refuses two job offers.  Insecurity.    I wanted her to take one of the two jobs she was offered, or find something good enough for her.  But she chose to do neither.  This is a book about how hard it was for poor old (sniff!) Barbara to find a job.  Brace yourself for boredom and anger.  Maybe she would have been better off in a self-help group. Spare us, Barbara!    
 I recall reading 'Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine' in the '80s, and discovering quite a few of the now long out of print paperback anthologies, which purported to be 'edited' by Hitchcock himself, along with ghost-written introductions. All of this was in the manner of the classic 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' TV series, with which the magazine is the longest-lived tie-in. The glory days of the magazine(and the anthologies) were filled with short, concise, suspenseful little tales in which the bad guy would reach a suitable end, with an appropriate  twist of fate (and plot).  Only a few such stories are in evidence in this volume, perhaps because the best work has already been reprinted in numerous places. This 'comprehensive' 50th-anniversary collection suffers from the same problem as  many anthologies, with perhaps a few too many riches. Although there are a few well-known authors, and some occasional nuggets among the stories, nothing in particular sticks in the memory, and in fact, skipping a few stories altogether won't make too much difference.  The 'Hitchcock' magazine has somewhow managed to last half a century, so it must be doing something to satisfy a (relatively) small but loyal audience. As an example of a declining breed-the a short story anthology magazine-this is worth browsing through as a curiousity, but the reader would probably be better served to dig deeper into the works of the reprsented authors. I get the feeling all are capable of better things in a different forum 
 I USE THIS AT WORK WHERE I HAVE INFANTS UP TO TODDLERS, WE HAVE TO REPEAT THE PROCESS 3 TIMES BEFORE WE EVER GET AN ACCURATE READING.  THE UNDER THE ARM, OLD TRADITIONAL THERMOMATERS ARE BETTER 
 I have also researched one of the subjects with which A Death in Brazil deals, namely the election, government and impeachment of Fernando Collor, the former President of Brazil. From 1991 to 1997, I was managing editor at Veja, the magazine with the widest circulation in Brazil, which played an influential role in bringing about Collor's impeachment. In 1992, I received the Editor of the Year Award from the World Press Review for Veja's coverage during the period.    At the end of 1999, after almost two years of full-time writing, I finished my 720-page book on the subject, entitled Notícias do Planalto: A imprensa e Fernando Collor (News From the Planalto: The press and Fernando Collor). In writing the book I interviewed 140 people and read more than a hundred books. Notícias do Planalto was a bestseller in Brazil, selling more than 80,000 copies.    Peter Robb invited me to lunch in Rio de Janeiro at the beginning of 2001. Robb praised Notícias do Planalto and told me of his plans to write a book about Brazil, Fernando Collor and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. I recommended that he read certain books and gave him phone numbers for both Collor and Lula da Silva. I never heard from him again.    When I read A Death in Brazil I was rather shocked. There were nineteen passages in Robb's book that were startlingly similar to passages in Notícias do Planalto. What we are dealing with here is not simply use of information, as is normal in intellectual work. The fact is that entire sentences, lines of reasoning and images recur with only a few words changed. I have prepared translated transcripts of the passages in question from Notícias do Planalto and the corresponding passages from A Death in Brazil.    Robb mentions my book only once. On page 313, in the section "Sources and Readings", he says that Notícias do Planalto is a "very fluid and complete account of Fernando's fast rise and faster fall as seen by the journalists of Brazilian press and television, not least of whom [is] the author". This mention in no way justifies the use Peter Robb seems to have made of my book. One wonders if he would have used my book so freely had it been published in English.   
 This is utter rot. Another stinker from the withered pen of MCall Smith. Plotless, overly peppered with Mr McCall Smith's book of quotations, up-tight, and worst of all - boring.  Mr McCall, don't give up the day job 
 If you read this expecting the humor and fast pace of a Stephanie Plum novel, you'll be disappointed.  It doesn't seem like JE did any more than wave a magic wand over these books 
 As a huge fan of "Chiefs", Stuart Woods first novel, I decided to give Dark Harbor a try.  What I found was a predictable plot, gratuitous sex, and all the marks of a "spit out thinly plotted books" machine.  Stone Barrington is informed that his distant cousin has allegedly ended his family's life and left Stone as the executor of his will.  When it is discovered that the cousin worked for the C.I.A., Stone and company begin to investigate his death to determine if it had anything to do with his clandestine work.  As they investigate and the suspects materialize, the plot grows more and more predictable.  Run from this one 
 Did you know that Burroughs was straight?  Or Ginsburg?  Yep -- not a word about their homoerotic interests, either in the poems selected (or oddly slashed up) or in the intros.  We do find out that Orlovsky was Ginsburg's "companion" -- is this the year 1928? The editor evidently thinks  so. Instead of providing an honest introduction to Beat work, she inflicts  salacious, incredibly obscure pieces upon us, like a 6-page rant from  Michael McClure about (and I quote) "woman woman woman woman woman  woman woman." This anthology tells us a lot about the editor's  personal idiosyncracies, but it is not a balanced portrayal of the Beats 
 I bought this book based on customer reviews and was disappointed.  I found not only the look to be dated but the information as well.  He actually reccomends kneeing your dog in the chest to break him of jumping  up.  This is preferable to stepping on his toes because that would be  harder for the owner to maneuver-Too militaristic/barbaric for me 
 This book, although broad in scope, fails to cover important aspects with enough depth.  It is a hefty volume, close to 900 pages, but you would expect to have a lot more information available in such massive space, but most of it is blank spaces and big titles and subtitles.  In fact, most of the information available here is available in the Excel help and MS Office support website (free).  So, if you are looking for a printed version of Excel's online help, go for it, but if you are trying to find in-depth information and guidance, this is not the book for you 
 The book is interesting but too basic. The book could possibly be of use for someone who is new to the subject. Benson only touches on material in a overview. The book would have been a better value, if he expanded on the subjects that were addressed.  Benson has written many other books that are worth buying, this is not one of them. Read Benson's other books to better understand the subject material, they covered their respective subjects in much more detail 
 Two intertwined plots, the development of the simulacra and Rosen's growing obsession with Pris - and he simply abandoned the interesting one. Even with the first-person perspective, he never managed to bring Louis and his feelings for Pris to life. The simulacra story could have been very good - early on I was conviced we were going to see Stanton rise to political power in the modern age, but he disappeared even before the rest of the simulacra plot. But the last chapters were a huge letdown 
 The kind of solutions this book gives are not aimed at someone like me, new and uncertain when it comes to linux. This is a dissapointment for me, as I have normally always been very pleased with O'Reilly books 
 The authors immediately reveal their agenda when they state 8 propositions that they think "most Americans, including most Lawyers, would endorse..." At least two of these eight would be rejected out of hand by originalists and political conservative citizens.  The authors' bias is obvious -- they believe that any solution which would unravel the welfare state, or reduce the size and regulatory power of the federal government,  is automatically absurd. Thus they quickly dismiss as impractical the only solution -- Originalism -- that would return the court to being a true judicial body rather than a "super-legislature".  
 If you're easily amused by anything that hyperactively draws attention to its "cool" sensibility, this book is for you. Stacey Richter obviously went to one too many writer's workshops where they pat each other on the back for their inside-ness and forget what real literature can be. None of her characters reveal any depth or texture. What little thematic substance the stories have is as fuzzy as a fly-away wisp of pink cotton candy. Instead, what you get is exaggerated, absurd sequences rooted in cultural fetishes and fantasies of abnormality or violence. Richter lacks the discipline or patience to build a real-life scenario; she wants to take shortcuts by way of cultural references, precious oddity, and patronizing first-person narration. Incidents tumble forward like an upturned toychest of kitschy knick-knacks collected and lovingly polished, then laid out on a tacky folding table for you to fawn over and call art. The word that best describes the whole thing is "shallow." It's as if Richter were writing moment-to-moment, giggling over her cleverness, probably sipping an Orbitz because it's "so stupid, it's sublime." After smart people start seeing through this one-trick literary con job (I'm looking down at my watch), perhaps Richter can get lucky and land a gig writing pop-up windows for Blind Date 
    White studies, what an interesting concept. Those who subscribe to White Studies are the first to tell you that there is Race is not a viable construct, except, of course-the White Race.  Hidden in this insanity is the popular trope that only white's can be racist (except the chosen white feminists.    This may remind those who have studied the rise of Nazi Germany of the melding of the hated Oost-Juden and the Jewish citizens of the German state-thus. Attempts to differentiate between the groups became impossible under the Nazis and likewise with the pushers of White Studies.     When one explores the writings of White Studies authors the bile comes out with regularity: white (the non-race) people harbor all sorts of stereotypes, predjudices, and hatreds-even whites who rarely interact with minorities are guilty of the sins of their race!  Whiteness is a problem that must be erradicated so that the perfect peace of equality can reign supreme. But, before this peace, according to Harvard's Prof. Ignatiev the white race must be destroyed!     What we should ask is how this is to be done, and what will replace the non-white race?  Will it be the hip-hop folks with their bling-bling and multi-colored underwear, the lesbian feminists with their short hair or the latino/latina with their barrio culture and enchilades?  Stay tuned-the white race is here to stay 
 This could have been an excellent study into the characteristics of manhood set by culture, society, environment, and nature. Instead it is a terribly limited view of a handful of men in one country. Sadly, it is void of enthusiasm for its topic, boring as dirt, and less interesting than reading a phone book.The author seems more intent on proving he has read a great deal on the topic by endlessly paraphrasing the work of other studies (always giving due credit), but displays little skill in using his knowledge to make his viewpoints or research remotely appealing 
 I got this because I like jazz and Pink Martini.  I'm pretty disappointed.  I guess I was expecting something different.  I'm not that thrilled with the vocalists.  The arrangements strike me as odd.  Several tracks are a lot more electronic than I was expecting.  I was shooting for something more natural and recreative of a scratchy Paris-in-the-50s jazz album.  
 I desperately need boot shapers, but these are very difficult to use. The problem is in the design. I have to squeeze them together very hard to get them to go into the boot at all, and they always spring apart at the bottom once they are in the boot, so I can't get them in all the way. They are better than nothing, but only just barely. I have other boot shapers, all of which are designed better than these 
 I didn't find this book terribly useful.  Most of the concepts presented in the book were common sense and did not specifically apply to business.  The book centered around typical social etiquette (which certainly applies  in the business world), but did not provide much business-specific  guidance.  I found that most of the concepts were covered in general  etiquette publications.  I was also disappointed to find that the book did  not provide specific solutions for breaches in business etiquette.  I guess  I was looking for some nice catch-phrases and replies for the business  user.  I do think the book was simple to read, and might be a good book for  newcomers to American business etiquette

 After reading this very badly written book my concern is how I am ever going to trust St. Martin's Press again. This book should never have been published by a company with such a trustworthy track record. Clearly, some house cleaning needs to be done at St. Martin's Press.   The plot development and character development have all the ear markings of a novice writer. Characters are trite, clichéd and very unbelievable. The lead character, Lin Breedlove, is one of the most unsympathetic and unlikable characters in current fiction. So much of Haywood Smith's personal bitterness is encapsulated in this character that you find yourself wishing Ms. Smith had spent a little more time in therapy, following the breakup of her own marriage, instead of charging readers the price of a book for her personal catharsis.   Ms. Smith has created a lead character so misguided, angry and judgmental that the story is painful to read. Some of her misguided beliefs include: Everyone in California has a sexually transmitted disease, you can get venereal disease by sitting on a chair at a wine bar, any man who wants sex without a lifelong commitment is an evil piece of trash and Democrats are bad. Smith barely misses a chance to toss an insult at Democrats, Bill Clinton in particular. So, Democrats beware. You are paying good cash to read a very bad novel and be insulted.   But even more unsettling is the self-righteous world view that masquerades as plot in this novel. It is not only bad writing but a true disregard for one's readers.  There are so many plot mistakes in this book, which should have been caught by Smith or the editors at St. Martin's Press, that I wonder if anyone actually read the final manuscript. At one point in the book, we are told Lin Breedlove first met her ex-husband in college. At another point in the book, we are told she first met him when she was 14 years old. Lin Breedlove criticizes and judges anyone and everything outside her personal sphere of experience and comfort, then harshly deals with anyone who dares criticize her.   The dialogue reads like text lifted from the latest self-help books and very bad pop psychology. What is designed to come off as a feminist point of view is, ultimately, Smith's own shrill cry of personal pain.   One of the most unsettling elements of the book is Smith's constant quoting of scripture, mingled with talk of ten-inch erections, dildos and oral sex. Both subjects, certainly, ideal components of a good novel. Mixed together by Smith's less than deft writing talent? Ummm...yuk.  And, personal note to Ms. Smith - Jerry Mather's of "Leave it to Beaver" fame is not gay.   One last point, there were so many typos in my copy of this book, that it is clear nobody proofed the final draft.   A true waste of money.  
 The only thing that kept this from being ABSOLUTELY predictable was that a dead bad guy did NOT spring back to life.  I found myself saying "Oh come on" to one plot point after another (previous reviewers have covered these absurdities).  The underlying scenario was unconvincing and un-involving (previous reviews in this thread provide details) 
 Unfortunately, Malphurs has again published a book that far underestimates his readers.  Advanced Strategic Planning does little more than lay out the basics of strategic planning; issues of greater consequence are left  untouched.  Dealing with entropy in an organization is a serious issue that  Malphurs seems to believe goes away if one's vision/goals/strategy are  rightly aligned.  I was disappointed with this book.  Better to wait for  Post-Advanced Strategic Planning 
 I purchased this for my daughter's birthday. I'm sending it back because it is not worth the 6.99. What a waste of money. Just a few pages of stickers and the page count includes the back of the sticker pages that are blank. Don't bother 
 This Russo collection of short stories didn't really work for me. I love his books like Straight Man and Nobody's Fool but I just couldn't get into this outing from him. It could very well not be Russo's fault, I tend to have issues with short stories in general

 It may be the biggest story of the 21st century, but few press outlets are telling it. In fact, until very recently, few in the U.S. were aware of the plans and even fewer denouncing what appears to be the implementation of an effort some have characterized as "NAFTA on steroids."  All American people should be very concerned at the prospect of a North American Union - and the end of hope for the free country our Founding Fathers laid before us. We must resist to the bitter end of need be and fight the push bu multinational corporations and elite bankers' push for a new world order combining elements of fascism/corporatism and and end-run around our sovereignty by unsurping the powers of Congress and the American Legal System.  Is President Bush's reluctance to control the border and enforce laws requiring deportation of foreigners who enter the country illegally part of a master plan to all but eliminate borders between the U.S., Canada and Mexico? You bet.   If President Bush's agenda is to establish a new North American union government to supersede the sovereignty of the United States, then the president has an obligation to tell this to the American people directly. The American public has a right to know.  Phyllis Schlafly, the woman best known for nearly single-handedly leading the opposition that killed the Equal Rights Amendment, sees a sinister and sweeping agenda behind the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America.  "Is the real push behind guest-worker proposals the Bush goal to expand NAFTA into the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America, which he signed at Waco, Texas, last year and reaffirmed at Cancun, Mexico, this year?" she asks. "Bush is a globalist at heart and wants to carry out his father's oft-repeated ambition of a 'new world order.'"  She accuses the president and others behind the effort of wanting to obliterate U.S. borders in an effort to increase the Mexican population transfer and lower wages for the benefit of U.S. corporate interests.  America: From Freedom To Fascism. (Unless we oppose it by any means necessary) 
 The most unfortunate thing about this book is that you should have read Pratchett's other novels to catch some jokes about Rincewind, the wizards and other characters. My intention was to introduce a friend to Terry Pratchett's hilarious writing and was not able to use this book for that reason. I would probably have to use some other book, may be "Moving Pictures".   Apart from that, this book is only moderately funny and Pratchett resorts to some cheap puns here and there, which I found disappointing. This is a novel that seems like Pratchett wrote at the insistence of the publishers, but did not really have the energy to. 
 Maybe it was the editing or the translation, but this book was a long and frustrating waste of time.    There was no spark in the writing, plot or characters.  It was as if everyone was either on Prozac or needed it!  I was really let down because the middle started getting more interesting so I kept reading, thinking it would finish strongly, but was disappointed.  Actually, the only reason I am writing this is because I was taken in by the many 4 and 5 star ratings and am pissed off that I was duped!!   
 This book is severely dated. Several advances have been made in the area of sports specific training. Some of these excercises are down right dangerous. Serious injuries could result. There are some good stretching suggestions, but a beginner's weight-lifting book has safe excercises, for those looking to incorporate weight training with their judo practice 
 i've had hk products since the 80's and generally like their products. but this is the second hk cd that broke just after a few months of light use (the first one after a couple of years). cd should last longer than that, i believe. i want to stick with hk to have the same brand name in the house, but unsure if i should throw good money after bad any more. 
 After loving all the "Dibley" series and specials and even traveling to Turville, where they filmed the exteriors for the series, I eagerly awaited the new specials.  I thought it would be wonderful to see the whole gang reunited, but all I felt was a massive wave of disappointment.    The characters are more chariactures and do not act as they should:  I'm sorry, but Geraldine sticking her whole HEAD into a chocolate fountain?  Not something she would do.  The cup of chocolate, yes.  The "baptism by Cadbury"?  Not her at all.  Alice and Hugo offering a threesome to Geraldine?  Nuh-uh.  Nope.  No way.  Buy these ONLY if you're a die-hard fan, like me.  As it is, however, I doubt I'll be watching these again unless the rest of my "Dibley"s get destroyed.  I'm sad that Richard Curtis sank so low 
 Normally I don't take the time to write a review, but this book just bugged me.  When I finished I felt like I had run a marathon.  The book was just too drawn out and I felt the descriptions were long winded.  Faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem.  The plot was good, but moved slowly.  I am typically not drawn to Danielle Steel books and probably with good reason that I never seem to like them very much.  I am glad that this book was in a box of 30+ books that I paid $15 for at a used book store.  I would have felt like I wasted my money had I actually paid full price for it 
 I brought this book because I needed to work out if a particular boat with a particular outboard would meet certain performance parameters under certain sea conditions. I was not able to do this with the information in this book. I found "Propellor Handbook" by Dave Gerr much more usefull.    
 While I adore YA novels about queer kids, this one left me a little underwhelmed.  I was just never convinced that Lissa and Kate were real people --- the character development was nil.  I also didn't believe that they actually felt something for one another --- it was kind of like a romantic comedy with Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, where all of the ingredients for a romantic comedy are there, but there's just no chemistry; it's not convincing.  For a really good read, rely on the old classic Annie On My Mind --- a book which I still practically keep under my pillow, and which convinced my mom (!) that maybe, maybe this lesbian thing was OK 
 I read Cameron Crowe's book a couple years ago, and it is head-and-shoulders above this.  What Charlotte essentially does in this "personal" biography is string together a long series of celebrity interviews into one barely coherent narrative.  One gets the distinct impression it was far more important for Charlotte to "get to know" these interview subjects than it was for her to write this book.  What makes me think that?  Perhaps it's the photos of Charlotte and several of her interviewees sprinkled throughout this book.  On the whole, "personal" seems to be shorthand for "lazy. 
 This is the first book by Deaver that I have read.  Apparently there are a couple of prequels to this novel involving the same main characters -- I will never read them.  Deaver has adequate style and a talent for pacing a mystery thriller.  He also has some skill in character development; however, he only applies this skill to the secondary characters in this story.  Perhaps the main characters in this story appeared so flat to me because I have not read the other novels in this series, but judging by their inconsistent behavior, bizarre motivations, and the melodramatic dialogue in this novel I doubt the other books could be much better.  Worse than Deaver's hackneyed mystery cut-out-characters is his insistence that the reader be willing to accept the most unbelievable and unlikely situations for the sake of a dramatic situation or plot twist.  Like many other second-drawer mystery writers, Deaver portrays such notable organizations as the FBI, INS, US Coast Guard, and the NYPD as ridiculously inept and corruptible.  Nor has he made any attempt to research the actual policies and procedures that these organizations would follow in the situations presented in the story.  Deaver also has a poor grasp on the politics of international economics.  This is normally excusable in a mystery writer, but since Deaver sets Chinese/American economics as the foundation of his final plot twist the whole story comes crashing down in the final chapters of the novel.       A note to Deaver and other mystery writers:  it is not a requirement for a great detective to be a pompous jerk and an abrasive know-it-all.  It has been 115 years since Doyle introduced the world to Sherlock Holmes, and we have had 115 years of mediocre mystery writers plagiarizing Doyle's character.  Please try to be original.   And also, if the final "twist" in your story is so complicated and so unbelievable that you must expend two chapters in trying to explain it, perhaps it shouldn't be there in the first place.  I give this book a D.    
 It is strange that a book dedicated to present deconstruction and chora actually "plays" of representing it. Derrida's reading on plato's chora is indeed relevant to architecture. It is not an easy reading, which is typical of many of derrida's writings. Unfortunately, this book becomes yet more difficult to read with this "funny" perfurated edition. Different from Deconstruction, it is not an easy task to interpret the meaning of those holes. They are certainly dispensable.  
 Based on a storyline from the 1800's, this book, in this day and age, is verging on child pornography, child neglect and promiscuous language.  I can see its value for literary purposes with much expressive language, however, the heroine of this book is 13yrs old at the beginning of the book, is treated as a child throughout, the story advances by just days at a time and yet in the end she marries in the next spring at the age of 13 or 14yrs.  Some of the language used is so 1940's and has developed alternate meanings over the time frame of 60+ years.  Some very good escapist scenes, however, it will be interesting to see what they do to this novel to clean it up for the 21st century movie that is planned. When there are so many other thousands of good storylines to choose from, why did movie makers choose this one 
 I read this book when it was first published, and I believed it to be a work of genius, rescuing Marxist thought from its Soviet perversions.  But the truth is, even the mature "scientific" Marx is a total fraud, and his ideas about the progress of histrory are pure wishful thinking.  Marxists just need to give up on them: they'll never work 
 I read this memoir in one evening, not because it is gripping (it is not) but because it is short.  I found myself praying that the shallow insights, endless banal metaphors, and self-absorbed ramblings of a privileged and narcissistic woman would finally lead to some useful insights.  Perhaps, I thought, the author will be magically transformed into someone with whom I could actually enjoy spending an hour. I was disappointed.  Joan Anderson writes of her own "journey of self-discovery."  She comes off as a whiny wealthy woman who has spent her adult life gazing at her reflection in her husband, her sons, her work, and her friends.  At the age of fifty, she does not like what she sees, or perhaps she simply doesn't want to recognize herself any longer.  She escapes to her second home on Cape Cod for a year to indulge herself and make herself the center of her world - with no petty distractions such as family, friends, community, or responsibilities.  In every person, task, tide, seashell, snowfall, seal, and grain of sand Anderson comes across, she again seeks (and finds) her reflection.  She spends this year creating metaphors for herself. (I think I counted five on one page!) and smugly congratulating herself for her now open and conscious self-absorption.  By the end of the year, she likes what she sees--so much so that she now offers workshops to help other women discover themselves.  Many women have found this to be a life-changing book.  I was not one of them.  Perhaps I just could not identify with Anderson, and I guess I'm a little relieved by this.   As the Kirkus review concludes, "A less-than-enthralling journey of self-discovery marred by more than a touch of self-congratulation."    Pass on this one 
 If you've read some of Robert Bly's other books on Direct Mail --you've read this one.  As for chapters other than on Direct Mail, such as "Lead Generation on the Internet", I get the impression that this was written 10 internet years ago.  Bly has some good points but you might want to look at his other books in paperback that will be more cost effective

 To cover all the problems with continuity, logic, theology, geography and plain common sense in _Left Behind_ would take a whole book.  One hardly knows where to start.  Perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to Christian religion by this trashy novel.  As such, it isn't even a decent trashy novel; instead of steamy sex scenes, we get sanctimonious sermonizing.  Worse than that, what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the Bible into a cheap comic book, ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it's too late.  The comic book aspect can not be overemphasized.  Even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario (an idea with virtually no scriptural support), little in the characters' actions, thought processes or dialog rings true.  One gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student.  God ends up looking like the ultimate villain, demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side Or Else.  Whatever happened to the inspiring Christian writers of yesteryear?  Who is the present-day equivalent of C. S. Lewis, or Catherine Marshall, and why aren't they getting more attention?  These were writers who actually made you THINK.  LaHaye and Jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing God wants us to be doing; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought.  They show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask.  One wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all, or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter.  These days, it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of Ann Coulter or Pat Robertson, whose mission seems to be to turn Christianity into a twisted, bigoted caricature of what it once was.  Perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured.  If _Left Behind_ is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from Christian writers, then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind 
 On a scale of 1 to 10, I give On Rue Tatin a 4. I think my main objection is that I purchased it thinking it was a book about France and food as experienced by the author and her family. Unfortunately, it's much more a book about the author who just happens to be living in France.  In the end, I'm not sure if On Rue Tatin should be classified as a travel book or a memoir because it does not shine in either category. It fails as a travel book because the author is too self-absorbed to give you any feel for the region of France she called home, and it fails as a memoir because the author's life, at least as related in the book, is far from interesting. 
 This cd is maaad weak.  The beats are wack, the lyrics are wack and C.B. is just swinging on Eightball and MJG'S fame to get his cd out.  By this time this is an oldie but it is as bad today as the day it was released.  I  would sell mine if I could find anyone to take it 
 Did not help me at all. It is a sweet story of one mother's traditions; but, unless you would follow instructions on how to give a tea party that uses a pretty china plate as a symbol of purity to be guarded and kept, it's sweet and pointless 
 The basic idea of this book is that to bring prosperity we should support increased spending on research, and not worry about the federal deficit.  Mandel argues that economic growth comes from technological change, and that we should embrace that.  There are many problems here.  First, how should economic growth be defined and measured?  Mandel admits this is a problem, but he never follows up.  Mandel misses the fact that GDP (the usual measure for economic growth) is a statistic so inaccurate that concluding anything at all from its increases is nearly ridiculous.  For example, GDP doesn't correct for costs of pollution or drawdown of natural resources.  More accurate economic measures, such as the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) show that there has been almost no economic growth since the 1970s.  So much for the great boom that technology has brought in the recent past, which Mandel makes so much of.   Mandel mentions several possible technologies as candidates for the Next Big Thing.  In my opinion, Mandel wildly exaggerates the chances of success for these.  I think that if our economy has reached the point where only a huge technological leap can save us, we're in trouble.  We can't be certain that leap will come, or come when we need it.  We'd be riding a tiger that we don't dare let go of. Another problem Mandel misses is that due to widespread externalities, costs are not being transmitted correctly through the market.  When we drive a car, we are not paying for the costs of climate change, or for the cost of building roads or parking lots.  When we buy a computer, we're not paying for the hazardous waste its manufacture creates.  Instead, those costs are being shoved off onto someone else.  Externalities mean that the wrong technologies are being developed. If the externality problem isn't solved, new technologies are likely only to take the economy deeper into a hole.   What evidence is there that "economic growth" as Mandel describes it makes people happy or excited?  Is the economic growth we're trying so hard to get really improving standards of living or making people better off?  Most people I know are working a lot harder than their parents did, with less to show for it.  Health care is stuck in a downward spiral of diminishing returns: vastly more money, health only slightly improved.  The same could be said for many other parts of the economy.   As far as the deficit, I am just not convinced that it is unimportant.  There are plenty of countries out there where fiscal irresponsibility has led to governmental collapse or civil war.  Look at Argentina, for instance.  I don't want that to happen here.        Mandel points out that economic growth would make it easier to do everything, from fighting poverty to saving Social Security.  This is true, but it's like saying that a perpetual motion machine would solve our energy problems.  It would, of course, except that it's impossible.   Mandel does have some good points.  I agree that more support of research may be a good idea. However, we can't rely on it to save our civilization.    Mandel criticizes people like me as technophobic environmentalists.  I'm not afraid of technology; but I see a lot of past technologies that haven't lived up to their billing.  As far as I'm concerned, the technology that we really need to develop now is a more realistic economic science.  America could be in the forefront of this.    
 I bought this book because of Jack Canfield's endorsement.  I was more disappointeted that he endorsed this book that I was the lack of substance in the book. There was nothing new in this book.  Sorry... 
 I was a philosophy major in college and I hated this book.  But then again, the whole NAMBLA fic genre really doesn't do it for me.  I'm sure some literary aesthetes are going to pick this review apart, good for them.  I'm incredibly well-read and thought this one was just a tepid bore.  Save your time, read some Dostoevsky, some Dickens, some Milton, (...) 
 Dean Koontz delivers a rocky build-up to the closing scenes in Sole Survivor, but it ultimately stumbles badly on the hocus-pocus of evil government with good science & stock chase scenes pulled from only the worst of B-movies.  The main character, Joe Carpenter, is lost in a world without his wife and daughters, who were killed in a mysterious plane crash. But a chance meeting with a woman photographing the gravesite, who briefly tells Carpenter about the crash, leads to a shoot-em-up with the woman nearly being killed by her pursuers.  The reader then enters a realm of mediocre sci-fi as Carpenter, a former crime reporter for a major daily newspaper, begins to piece together snippets of clues to find out for himself what happened during the crash and if any of his family actually survived.  Family members with loved ones killed in the crash are visited by the mystery woman. Many of the people then become victims, killing themselves in violent ways, but are seemingly at peace while acting on the whim. As Carpenter closes in on revealing the secret, the good versus evil falls into the lap of big government, a big corporation and the mystery woman who knows everything.  If Koontz wanted the book to read like a draft for a possible X-Files episode, then he was successful. But even the producers of that once highly successful program would have needed several pens to edit a story that had so much potential, only to fail due to Koontz ultimately plummeting into the world of cliches.   
 About as comprehensible as one expects a David Lynch movie to be, but not completely unwatchable (I finsihed it!).  Robert Blake appears to have been made up to look like Lugosi doing Dracula (sans cape). This is perhaps intended to be a clue to something or other.   The best thing about this movie is its soundtrack. In turn, the best part of the soundtrack is This Mortal Coil (with Elizabeth Fraser's chastely sensuous voice) performing a haunting cover of Tim Buckley's "Song to the Siren." Predictably, it's missing from the soundtrack album

 The book I am going to talk about is the book Arms and the Man By Bernard Shaw. I really did not like this book because it was hard for me to understand.  The reason I didn't like it was because it was challenging for me. The English was hard to understand. I liked how the writer wrote the book and I would probably look for another one of his books. This book was more like an opera with out music. If I could have and known to I probably would not have this enthusiastic about the book. One reason I picked the book was because it was dealing with war and I thought it would have been cool to read about war, but when I got more in to the book it was really not about war it was more about a love at war. If you're an older audience it would be a good book, or if you're looking for a good love-war story. 
 I just got the mat and went to unroll it but it is stuck together, expecially where the paisley patterns are so that when I unrolled it chinks of the mat came off. Very poor quality and I'm unsaitsfied. I would not recommend getting this mat. 
 Please note -- this movie receives one star ONLY because Amazon does not offer a zero star (or, more appropriately for this film, negative) rating.    Recently, Entertainment Weekly compiled a list of the "25 Worst Movie Sequels" ever.  How "An American Werewolf in Paris" avoided its rightful place on this list is now one of the great mysteries of my life.   Like everyone else drawn to this unfortunate attempt at a film, I watched because I am a fan of John Landis' original "American Werewolf."  Watched, that is, 15 minutes...which was more than enough time to establish that this 'sequel' should have been stillborn during pre-production.  I was almost tempted to follow this 'film' to its conclusion, to see exactly how bad it could get, but I simply could not subject myself to such torture.  The only thing that could make this a worse movie?  Viewing the original "Werewolf" first, which will emphasize even more the tragedy that was "American Werewolf in Paris."  So, why was this such a terrible movie?  I should have taken the DVD case description as a sign -- it explained that I would be watching a (I'm paraphrasing...but pretty close) 'rockin' horror film with a 'hip, up and coming group of young actors,' and, even better, I would be treated to 'a soundtrack complete with the hottest of today's music.'   Umm...no.  I challenge you to find more blatant lies than the ones offered by the movie's promoters.    To wit, a sample of several idiotic scenes and plot devices: (1) Tom Everett Scott wants to prove his courage by bungy jumping off the Eiffel Tower...which would be fine, except, given the shape of that particular structure (going out from top to bottom), our young hero would be jumping into the tower itself.  That might be a problem, but one he never seems to consider.  Can we really like a protagonist this stupid?   (2) Just before he is ready to leap, a young woman throws herself off the ledge.  T.E. Scott jumps to save her (despite the fact that his rope is not yet harnassed), and gracefully nabs her just before she becomes another splatter on the sidewalk.  She runs off, he (hey, I was right!) bangs his head on a beam and is put in hospital.  After waking, his concern for her is understandable...but why, in any rational universe, would he suddenly be infatuated with a clearly suicidal woman?  He says something to the effect that she is 'different' or 'sophisticated' or some other garbage...despite the fact that their relationship at that point comprises all of eight (wordless) seconds.  (Here, I'm also a bit nitpicky...because I can't for the life of me fathom why he would Julie Delpy even remotely attractive; mental instability is bad enough, but her looks hardly negate those problems).  Anyway, for absolutely no lucid reason, he suddenly decides that this is the girl of his dreams...the entire movie is based on his inexplicable admiration, a flaw symptomatic of the entire plot structure.   (3) The classic scene: the young lovers' first date...in which he 'accidentally' pulls out a handful of condoms, and to subdue her anxiety about his intentions, he is forced to pretend they are actually pieces of gum.  Yes, this is the level of sophistication clearly rampant throughout the movie.    Those are the high points of the first ten minutes, and I'm fairly certain the rest of narrative is downhill from that atrocious beginning.  
 This was my first Balzac, and I was very disappointed. The story line was both thin and unconvincing, and I felt Balzac struggled in vain to make it interesting. Much of the novel was a brave attempt by the author to pad out the story to make up for the inadequacies of the plot. The introduction stated that Balzac was influenced by Sir Walter Scott - this explains a lot, as this novel belongs to the same sorry collection as Scott's worst 
 I purchased this movie for my 7 year old twin boys birthday thinking that because it said the rating was PG that it would be fine.  Also, the market for Transformers is huge with boys their age and the toys being sold everywhere.  Wow, were we hugely surprised to hear curse words on this cartoon movie.  These were not just words like shoot or dang, but the real deal.  I remember Transformers when I was growing up and I certainly do not remember their being foul language in the cartoons.  I am going to take this matter up with higher management and at least get my money back and try find out what they were thinking.  Who knows what the rating will end up being for the upcoming movie at the box office.   Concerned in Alabam 
 I have been reading Jodi Picoult's books since I first came across The Pact at the library.  And from there I glommed most of her books reading back to her previous titles such as Songs of the Humpback Whale and then her books, Keeping Faith, Salem Falls, Perfect Match and Plain Truth.  Unfortunately in recent years I haven't been able to get into some of her titles, specifically Vanishing Acts and My Sister's Keeper.  The latter title was just too sad for me to finish.  It was therefore with some trepidation that I picked up the CD of The Tenth Circle while at the library. Because I was told that there was a parallel story told in comice book form, I was concerned that I might be missing something although other readers said I wouldn't be missing much.  But at this point I must add that while the reader did a fine job and I was initially intrigued with the plot and characters, this book dissolved into a listening experience of a book which went off into too many directions to be a good reading experience for me.  I won't review the details of the plot or characters since so many others have done a fine job of this, rather offer, instead my  views just as I finished this title.  I just finished listening to The Tenth Circle and found it was such a grim book.  Not that Jodi Picoult's other books were rollicking fun but this one reminded me of a line from one of her books that said, "There ought to be a moratorium on grief."  Unbelievable the imagination some writers have.  Maybe that's why they're writers and I'm not.  But there were some unanswered questions, coincidence, sheer improbability and then she wrapped up the ending a bit too quickly.  And I might add a bit too happily or hopefully from all that happened for me to consider this a book I enjoyed.  But I do have to add that there was some wonderful writing about what it means to be a parent but I just found it overall very disappointing. I do hope I'm not spoiling this for anybody with such a negative review but I used to love this author's books and wonder if I'll continue to read her which makes me sad. 
 I bought this book as I have been asked to start using PERL at work.  All I can say is what a waste of money. It has a tiny index (9 pages).  In a programming book, the index is the most important part of the book.  I get programming books and look-up things when I need help.  If I can even find anything in the book, it points me to the PERL documentation.  I offered it to a fellow co-worker who has been using PERL for a while now and he says it doesn't have anything that a beginner can't pick up using a free online tutorial.  So, don't bother with this book 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 I was quite disappointed in this book.  Cahill has written outstanding material but this collection seems to be a gathering of miscellaneous leftovers.  I was led to this book after reading A Walk in the Woods by Bryson - and it was a false lead. The quality is not there 
 If you study Pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions. One of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still.  As a lover of Pilates and how much it has done for me, I urge you to buy something else 
 I just have to note that I think this is Shakespeare's worst play.  It has an aweful ending , and I don't think this should even be performed.  Yet it somehow manages to make it on stage all the time and audiences still seem to want to see a girl forgive her lover after WATCHING him rape someone else on stage!  Still, if that's the kind of thing you look for in a comedy...  My opinion: if you want a play with some nice healthy cross-dressing, go buy As You Like It.  Thank y 
 NOTE: MY TOPIC IS ABOUT THE WIND DONE GONE AND NOT SLAVERY(which I hate)!  Not liking the negro portrayal in GONE WITH THE WIND,Alice Randall therefore created her own version, a parody of the acclaimed southern classic.Therein lies the problem.  The trouble with parodies,it so intertwind with the original that it can be used as a sequel,a retelling or a new story with characters copied from the original but this time superior while degrading the original.So much so,readers begin to accept these false truth as the true truth.Not openly but in disguise, words like "what if" & "perhaps".Why?Because people always like scandals to famous chracters fiction or not.When that happen, a novel,even w/ the purest intent and purpose,gets butchered.  Here are some cases to prove my point & where the book failed:  1.THE PARODY/CONCEPT ITSELF-The whole purpose of this book is to show negroes aren't dumb and capable.If you read GWTW,as others call it"White-washed"&"Romantized",is in fact a love story.Plus Mitchell was trying to show how a civilization changes after a war,what better way to illustrate it than the old south?  But why portray negroes like that? Obviously these fools didn't see Aunt Pitty,Hugh Elsing or Ashley.Aren't they white,helpless,pathetic and idiots?  If you read GWTW, What about the courageousness&modesty of Pork,The industriousness &loyalty of Dilcey?What about Uncle Peter who single handly raised Charles&Melanie,who looked after and Protected Aunt Pitty?What about Rhett and Scarlett declaring Mammy as a smart old soul?Aren't these persons Negro and admirable traits?  2.MAMMY KILLING THE 3 SONS-In p.663 GWTW, a yankee tells Scarlett "do you think i can trust my babies to a negro?" She thought otherwise,and now Mammy kills Gerald's sons.Its thesame as saying negroes can't be trusted and they kill white babies and Randall was trying to show Negroes in a different light.This damages her&the book's credibility.Noble as her intent,but no good can come out of evil means.Its better to kill 10 people than 1 baby,as the saying goes.  3.GERALD/MAMMY-Check the background story of Ellen/Gerald.There can be no doubt of his fidelity.It takes a great deal of emotion for a person to get unhinged after a loved one's death.  4.CYNARA-She is an exact copy of Scarlett even their ages are thesame but this time she smart,beautiful,brown,a good mother compared to Scarlett.She even has Scarlett's strength & Rhett even prefers her.Ridiculous!if Rhett likers her than Scarlett he would've married her instead,or divorce scarlett after he have is way with her,Rhett boast of being ill-bred so his rep. wont matter.Why this nonesense of mistress and after death marriage?  The book,despite being well-written,feels like a parasite after reading created by a first-time author who wants instant fame,fortune making others accept and embrace that her work is better while destroying others hard work. If you want a book about the attrocities of slavery then buy UNCLE TOM's CABIN which is BETTER than this one.  NOTE: MY TOPIC IS ABOUT THE WIND DONE GONE AND NOT SLAVERY(which I hate)! 
 If there were a dictionary of queer literature Radclyffe Hall would certainly have a place, somewhere between "Hall, Maurice" and "Hallward, Basil". She deserves this for having written a taboo-breaking novel. She does not deserve this for writing a particularly good one.  When I started reading this book I thought I was going to like it a lot more than I did in the end; I thought Stephen as a child was an adorable little gentleman and I liked the relationship between her parents and how it influenced her life. When I reached her first girlfriend, however, a married woman named Angela Crossby, I was at the edge of the abyss without knowing it.  I realize this book is a product of its time, but never in my life have I heard so many cliches and stereotypes about lesbians - sorry, inverts - from a woman who was a lesbian herself. Inverts have terrible nerves. Inverts wrongly cling to religion. A "real" female invert is masculine and a "real" male invert is feminine, whereas their "normal" lovers are truly heterosexual.  More drama and angst are crammed into the last few chapters of the book than I would have thought possible, and the ending - which I will not reveal - comes out of nowhere and contradicts the personalities of Stephen and her lover Mary as they have been previously established. Anyone with an interest in queer literature should read this to satisfy their curiousity, and to deepen their appreciation for better-written and more realistic fiction. Someone who wants a good novel with an intense romance should not 
 Can't believe the author of the excellent Dr. Rhea novels wrote this! Unlikely premise (paranormal abilities), not particularly likeable or believable charcters, too much gratuitous violence....very disappointed.   
 I think Denise Austin does a decent job in some of her other videos, but this isn't one of them.  She lacks any type of warm up in this one and often looks like she's just trying to make up steps in order to fill the time slot.  The moves are not well choreographed and very awkward.  Some may find encouragement in the times Denise gives the camera a bug eyed stare and says "We're burning butter.... yeah" but I found it annoying.  I think there are much better workouts for the money out there 
 I did a search for Cesar Milan (known on TV as the Dog Whisperer) and a number of items came up including this one. For author it just says "by Dog Whisperer". Well this isn't by Cesar at all. It's a complete piece of junk. Don't buy this 
 I think they once called this approach  "Variations on a Theme"? At the time of this writing there are 47 (other) reviews here of this CD. (Who needs another!!!) Most everyone claims to likes it. Numerous reviewers make references to other groups - Mogwai and G.Y.B.E -  who mine this same post-rock soft/loud groove. I purchased this CD based on those comparisons. However - 'Explosions in the Sky' seem to have only one idea, and on this CD, at least, they simply provide us with several variations of that one idea. Not that this is a bad thing. This technique has been used (and is still used) in 'respectable' music for centuries. Classical, folk and jazz all employ this method of fleshing out a skeletal musical idea with different embellishments and various voices. Personally, I tired of Explosions after just a few listenings. I think a mathmatician (of logician) could write this music as a simple formula. "Employing fifths, section A must always lead to B; section B must always refer back to A; this should be repeated thrice, sotto voce; followed by a sudden, bursting crescendo of equivalent duration; reprise section one; Fade to end. Instructions for next track: see previous - play in alternate key."  This is not necessarily a bad thing... Perhaps this is a sort of post rock 'Ambient music' to be listened to from another room or used as background texture while other activities take place. However, there is no adventure in this music. These musicians take no risks and they do not challenge us. They simply stake out a small piece of musical turf and then they strike poses on it and pace back and forth, caged by a formula too simple, but not knowing how to move beyond it. This CD is amusing the first few times it spins, but there is not enough here to merit more than one star. Sorry.. 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 Yes, fast food is everywhere.  No, Americans don't eat enough "real" food (that is, food which was prepared from fresh, natural ingredients).  Yes, if we ate more real food and less fast food, we'd be healthier.    But here's where Dr. Brownell goes wrong.  He pushes the popular myth (already rejected by cooler heads within the medical profession) that if we were healthier, we'd automatically be *slimmer.*  As others have mentioned, he doesn't take individual choice into account.  Nor does he so much as mention the ill effects of dieting; from a researcher of eating disorders, such an oversight seems huge.  It has also already been said that Dr. Brownell--also the author of several weight-loss books--is himself a fat man.  Does this mean that he *himself* follows an unhealthy lifestyle rather than heeding his own advice to others...and is therefore no better off than anyone *else* his size?  Or does it mean that weight loss is *not,* in fact, always a health solution or even a likelihood--and that he is therefore a living flaw in his own argument?  Let the reader be the judge 
 Television news reporter (now there's a credential) Shenkman attempts to debunk some widely-held but erroneous beliefs about American history from Columbus to the present day, covering topics such as sex, family, the so-called good old days, arts and quotations. It's a fine and admirable idea for a book.  Unfortunately, this book does not deliver the idea's promise.  Shenkman uses nearly no primary sources, relying on modern historians' research.  This gives the result that in many instances, his "proof" of the falsity of one claim is simply another author's claim.  Shenkman also has an odd idea of what constitutes American history, often resorting to 17th-century history to refute claims of what "American" life really is.  He also quotes extensively but cites sources sproadically, often lumping a few paragraph's worth of sources together in one footnote.  There are one or two nuggets of good stuff in here, like the origin of Paul Bunyan, or some of Harvard's history, but the lack of primary sources and generally non-scholarly approach make this book somewhat interesting at best.  
 I cant find any place in the book where the author teaches you how to think. If the book were about, say...sex...Maxwell never gets around to teaching any practical techniques for better sex. The book is all about attitude and setting....which might make sex or thinking or whatever more enjoyable, but still fails to deliver the goods about how to do "it." The book is an infomercial about thinking. Like the one's that promise to teach you how to make a fortune playing the stock market but never quite get to the part where you learn how to do "it." The infomercial is all anecdotes and quotes, like this book. And that's okay because Maxwell uses good material.   Much of what Maxwell asserts I agree with. Amen! Candy and dinner and flowers and liquor are terrific for the right mood. Plus proximity...you need to be there! But no where does Maxwell instruct you how to score. How to get from the right friends and the right place and the right time etc, etc., etc. to "Eureka!"  But in fairness to Maxwell, I dont believe you can teach anyone to think any more than you can command a feeling or mood or orgasm to materialize. I dont believe thinking and emotions etc. are THAT auto-manipulative. I mean, some very creative people swear by drugs and booze 
 What a vapid collection of women.  With the exception of Susan, none of the women are sympathetic.  If there is one thing to take away from the novel it is this: don't go out with ANY man who claims his marriage is far from over.  Wait until it actually is over.  If a man can be "stolen" or if he wants to be "stolen" then he isn't worth your time and the legacy of frustration that will follow you for the rest of your life.  And the women just sit back and talk about how the first wives need to get on with their life - as if having one's life thrown upside down is something that is as easily recovered from as having a cold.  One of the characters spent two years stalking her then-married boss and is surprised when the first wife doesn't just rollover and be satisfied with the new changes to her life.  What do you expect?  And for the record, I am not a first or second wife, but I hated this book nonetheless.  If I want to read about selfish, vapid people attempting to control the world around them and then being unable to cope when the world bites back, I'll pick up a newspaper 
 Someone's trying to kill Soap star Mary Lisa Beverly, and how I wish they'd succeeded. This book doesn't do either the mystery or romanance genres justice, and thread throughout is a lame shooting report from the set of the soap whose title forms the title of the book. Does anybody care that Mary Lisa's character in the soap meets her long-believed dead father? What does this have to do with the death plot? And what's a small town cop from Oregon doing stepping into an investigation in California? The book explains Mary Lisa's father and a rejected lover both asked him to, but Jack Wolf's got his own murder to sleuth, so what's he doing in Oregon, other than making eyes at our heroine. Much of the book centers on flirting between the Oregon sheriff and Mary Lisa, stuff that has little to do with the plot and indeed detracts from it, and the book is in serious need of an editor. At one place, Mary Lisa refers to the "Sheik of Aran." Argh!  This is one to skip. Generally a good writer, Catherine Coulter must have pulled this one out of the rejected pile. It should be thrown back 
 This book is terrible and most of my classmates concur. For example chapter 5 alludes to certain statistical methods and in essence completely butchers them.  As a student I had to use several other resources to pass my classes as this text is useless. If you are an instructor select something else 
 The low-point in the great man's career, the book shows little feel for rock and roll and its hippy messiah of a protagonist is almost as embarrassing as Jim Morrison himself was. The lyrics are especially awful and the whole thing seems dated - like most genuine late 60s / early 70s  rock. De Lillo went on to much, much greater things, which is what you  should read instead 
 SURE you can have a wedding under $5000...if you want less than 10 people and have a friend whos a photographer or a caterer...according to this book.  But let's get real for a second....not everyone has a friend of a friend in the photography business.  I'm pretty sure you couldn't even get ONE pictures for $50...let alone a whole album!  I should have saved the $10 I spent on this book for more wedding favors!  Now I've wasted even MORE money 
 I was majorly disappointed in this mega award winning film. I give it a generous 2 stars because the actors were good and portrayed their characters very well. Photography was also good as was sound quality. None of this means a thing to me as the whole movie was stupid. This COULD HAVE BEEN a great film but the story was majorly lacking. The love story was good but you see very little of it in the whole film. Most of it revolves AROUND the story at what took place when the two were broken up. "The Trip" sequence was the best part of the whole thing, but very short and by this time, the two characters were doomed to never be together except for only a couple days when all was lost. If you're looking for something with a happy ending, this is not even close! In fact if you're looking for something with a happy middle, you will be disappointed with this one. The only real accomplishment to this film is the fact that a plant survived all the way through the 11 years spanned by this meaningless, very poorly written tale. (most likely to die in the deserts of Mexico). It is a chaotic, weird tale of the 70's radical gay demonstration era which praises drug addiction, hippies, yuppies and irresponsible sexual endulgence. It is a flaming queen kind of production and if you are anywhere near mainstream, I suspect you will, as I did, find it repulsive and just way too far out there! It is such portrayals of the gay lifestyle as this, which makes society in general hate all gays. I think there are a WHOLE LOT BETTER avenues for gay film making than this film could ever dream of. Perhaps if you have a widescreen television you will be able to see the whole picture or even read half the credits which are cut off on both sides of the screen for some unexplained reason. Very poor film making. I couldn't have been more disappointed. My recommendation is to pass on this one. There are plenty of good films out there to spend your money on. This isn't it. I had high hopes all thoughout "THE TRIP", that things would finally warm up and start going somewhere. It didn't. If you watch this one, I hope you get more out of it than I did. 
 A good dozen years before his spectacular films of the late 70's and mid 80's Allen got his name on the directorial map w/ this piece of fluff.  You gotta start somewhere.  Tiger Lily is more of a dry run for his later, real comedies than an original film in its own right.  Allen's early work does tend to be stand up material thinly disguised as film.  Many of the jokes are funny but the one note premise wears thin quick.  A must for Allen enthusiasts and people who like quirky cultish so-bad-they're-fun movies 
 I got this video thinking it would be like the baby faith videos with fun and creative elements for learing development.  My baby watched about two mintues and was gone.  I think this is pitched as a baby video but it's really more geared toward older children.  None of the elements have anything to do with the music, making is virtually useless as a learning development product.  I give it a big "thumbs down".  Try any one of the baby faith products like God Made Me, God Made Music and God Made Animals.  They're awesome!  
 I bought this product as a way to keep a large amount of backup data saved, however I have fought with the drivers for days now. Whenever the drive is working the usb on my computer does not work, if I try to use multiple computers on the same drives it crashes (even with the newest updates) I will be returning this product ASAP. I'm very disappointed and will not be buy netgear again!   I only wish there was a 0 star revie 
 I was greatly disappointed by this book. It supposedly informs readers "why we are who we are," but, in fact, it does nothing of the kind. A more appropriate title for it would be, Our Inner Bonobo, because those animals, as opposed to humans, are its focus. Unquestionably, De Waal knows of what he speaks when he addresses our close cousins, the pigmy chimps (also known as Bonobos) and he definitely has much to share on the topic. However, those views were expressed earlier, and pretending that this work focuses on humanity is rather dishonest. The primatologist's knowledge about our cousins is only slightly overshadowed by how little he seems to know about his own species. The Bonobo is an animal that, due to its ubiquitous sexuality, has become very popular in the general culture and with the media, but reflecting on their habits tells us practically nothing about our own. One cannot simply state what Bonobos do and then expect those observations to be transferable to humans. In fact, due to their aggression towards strangers, the larger chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) seems to have more behaviorally in common with us than the Bonobos do--particularly when we consider that Bonobo relationships do not feature permanent pair bonding between mates. Overall, while some great information is shared here about Bonobos, I thought the book itself was  a waste of time, unless you're interested in Bonobos, and, if you are, you'd do better to purchase an earlier work 
 I was very surprised that a lot of peole thought that this book was bad.I thought that the book was gripping but I guess that is just my oppinion. Even though the book had absolutley nothing to do with basketball I still thought it was a pretty good book. But not as good as 5 star 
 first complaint- the arbitrary exclusion af artists they may not personally like- George Harrison, Emerson Lake and Palmer, etc. Second complaint- inconsistent reviews. Third complaint- the R rated languagein mnay reviews/ The guide dismisses anything remotely to do with progressive rock as garbage, they laud unpopular rubbish and overall a big disappointment. For the money, they could have done a lot better. The All Music Guides do a lot better 
 One would think that with Zalman King directing, BARELY BROOK would be a raunchy romp.  This is is a very tame and boring video this side of King's RED SHOE DIARIES and the title is very misleading.  It's just Brooke on a couple of swimwear photo shoots visiting some exotic locations.  It is merely a rehash of of the E!Channel's WILD ON series which Brooke hosted for couple of years. Also, included are a couple of VERY, VERY, TAME fantasy sequences along with a music video by Enriqo Iglesias with Brooke in the foreground. However disappointing it may be, Brooke Burke, no matter how beautiful and sexy she is, still retains a wholesome, good girl image. That is not all that disappointing when one thinks about it.  There are thousands of soft and hard core material out there. To add Brooke Burke to that list would be more of a let-down than a revelation. Does the DVD misrepresent itself?  Perhaps, but sometimes the fantasy is better than the reality and it's hard to knock Brooke Burke 
 This book is in the "never wear white after Labor Day" school of design: it lists tired old rules that *never* should be broken. For example: always paint the ceiling white, use only one pattern in a room, only use white floors and white tiles in the bathroom (and no colorful shower curtain, either). I could give more examples, but the pattern is clear. In addition, her advice for families with children is absurd.  As the mother of two toddlers, I did know whether to laugh or cry at her assertion that it isn't necessary to box up breakables when you have small children. What to do?  Just put breakables up high, on a piano or a tall bookshelf. I have yet to see the toddler who couldn't scale either one in under a minute. I gave it two stars because it would be useful for people who want an attractive home and have no clue how to do it on their own. I suspect they would end up with something that had as much personality as a hotel room, but if you don't enjoy decorating, that might be considered a Good Thing.  One final thought: look at the picture on the cover. She violates her own advice several times. Why 
 Crime mob? Give me a break. What kind of crime are you committing in your stilletos? This is ridiculous, IQ lowering, inbred, country, porch monkey, southern crunk krap! Why would you listen to something that you know is going to make you dumber and in the same breath set black people back 100 years. It is insulting for people of the world to see your videos and think all black people are like you. The beats on this album are corny, the lyrics sound like my seven year old wrote them, and the hooks give me the craps. Please stop rapping and pursue a promising career at target 
 The author of the book seems more interested in politics than in education of children. I don't think this is a proper book to be listed under children's education category. It may better suit for international  politics category. I would like give a rate of 1 star 
 i don't know why but it is an ugly dress. it doesn't look like the pic. maybe it's my shape (i have wide angular, shoulders) but it is very high on the chest which made me look a little granny-like 
 Ugh. I've read virtually all of Simmons books. But... Whatever happened to a good editor. Maybe Simmons has reached a level of success similar to when King began suffering from Worditis. There's probably a good story in here somewhere. But it's drowned in repetition and boredom. I made it half way through this book then skimmed the rest. Just because Simmons read dozens of books about this expedition didn't mean he had to use _all_ of that information. Bleah. Excruciating detail about people, non-events, and daily life that mean little and illuminate less. Scene after agonizing scene telling us -- again and again and again -- that, yup, sure is cold in the Arctic! Whoohoo! Cold. Boring ship life. A "mysterious" supernatural monster, unkillable and invulnerable to human action! (Meaningless: a critter so powerful as to be beyond harm. Simmons should have left the Thing alone. [See his dedication.]) Stupid people out of a bad horror movie who don't bother to tell anyone about the uncanny things they see. The monster mysteriously arises from the ether. Kills again. Disappears. Oh, no. We're all starving. We're cold. Brr. The monster inexplicably appears and vanishes as it kills again. A mystical Eskimo woman, luring men with her sexual allure. More cold. More boring ship routine. More hunger. More inane decisions by people who should know better. Pretensions at literary significance.   God. Put me on an ice flow now and spare me any more 
 Any Western boasting the likes of Randolph Scott, Ernest Borgnine, and Lee Marvin should be an all-time great, but Stranger Wore A Gun proves that his films with Budd Boetticher were far superior to most of his films, and makes you wonder what Scott's Boetticher films would have been like if he'd had such great co-stars as he did in this film.  Scott plays a former Confederate spy who joins with an old war colleague to stage a gold robbery in Arizona. Scott changes his mind, and tries to stop the robbery. George Macready, playing the bad guy, is his usual despicable self, and Marvin and Borgnine are solid as usual as two of Macready's gang.  One of the problems with this film is that it was filmed for 3D, which is obnoxious and distracting, as objects and people point toward the screen for an effect which is no longer viable. The dialogue is also not as cleverly pointed as it was in Scott's better films.  Stranger Wore A Gun is not a bad film, but not in Scott's top five best Westerns, and possibly not even his top ten 
 The wit and originality that can be found in some of Ms. Viorst's work won't be found here.  Very few original observations and a lack of cleverness lead me to suggest that you save your money on this one 
 I just finished listening to as much of the book on CD as I could stomach.  The minutia and lack of knowledge of police terminology and tactics was nauseating.  The words forhead, perp, peruse, crim, and finger were repeated over and over and over.  What might have been a good story in half the words was ruined by descriptions of everyone's clothing, spouses, children, and thinking 
 For $99 this should be a much better remote.  If you watch movies in the dark, you have to use the glow button, guess what, you will have to replace the batteries once a month at least.  Also, Logitech has over simplifed the remote.  You can't program individual buttons you have to use their program that only allows you to program devices and not the remote directly.  If you have to go into the device menu  a lot you will not be able to control the volume unless you switch to the device that controls volume.  Why not have an option to program each button period...  But the remote is useless now because of the low battery life.  Do not buy this unless you want to buy batteries every month.  Ridiculous.  Only remote I have ever had like this 
 I gave this to my kid for christmas, and he never opened it until today. But the bad news it doesn't work on any of the players we have at home. It clearly says on the cover SACD surround sound "Plays only on". wow. I never heard of that. Any suggestions? It doesn't say that it requires a special player on the ad. Very disappointed 
 ...because I have! In his book on ACC basketball. In some cases, he  didn't change a word....just repeated the same anecdotes. I am really glad that I didn't pay for this book because I would have been really angry about re-reading old material.  If you like reading about ACC basketball, and you haven't read Feinstein's verrrry similar book, you will probably like it.  If you like reading about Big East basketball when you're not reading about ACC basketball...you might like it.  If you think that the basketball universe is bigger than the ACC, the Big East, and Feinstein's apparent obsession with Bob Knight, save your money for another book.  It's too bad, really. Feinstein is a good writer. I guess the big buckets of cash he gets from each book he writes has finally caused him to lower his standards 
 I sat through this entire film even after my wife begged me to turn it off and then stormed out of the room to watch TV in the living room.  She was bored to tears and felt that the premise was unbelievably stupid.  Little did she know, I completely agreed I just have this thing about only seeing part of a movie.  I had to finish it, even if I knew I was gonna hate it.  To me the idea that Anthony Hopkins could be a black man is so unbelievable that I couldn't even begin to concentrate on the meat of the film.  I understand that the novel is acclaimed and everything, and everyone, even critics feel that this film is loyal to that novel, but if that's the case then the novel can't be that great.  If they had chosen another actor I could have believed it maybe, I mean, I have light skinned black friends and I know they could pass for white, but when they tell you their black you can see the features...Anthony Hopkins is whiter than I am...and there's no way I could pass for black so Hopkins is out.  Really if it weren't for the excellent acting on the parts of Hopkins, Kidman and Harris this movie would have no redeeming qualities.  So here you have it, young black man looks white, realizes it's easier to just play white then be who you are, he disowns his family to live his life easy, he becomes a teacher and now in his 70's he's accused of being racist by the people who think he's white so he starts an affair with a much younger woman whos drunk husband wants to kill them both, and he does, and then his secret is exposed to this guy who wants to write a book about him.  I just had such a hard time getting over the idea that some idiot thought Anthony Hopkins could be black that I can't even see this movie for the good that it is.  I'm sorry; this review is probably so tainted it's not even funny.  For all I know this is a great movie, I mean even the premise is something I would normally really enjoy it's just so hard to get over...I'm rambling...never mind.  Like I said, I really tried 
 Gore Vidal is pretty unlikeable and it's hard to finish a book about someone so unlikeable.  He's a very cold fish.  The first 2/3s of the book are depressing to read, the last 1/3 with some info on the Kennedys is more interesting but not worth the journey.  
 First of all the subtitle has been wrongly interpreted.  Some creationists have decided to use this title to expose Darwin as a racists.  He may be, I have not read "The Descent of Man" yet.  The origin of species talks very little of man.  It is a book of observations and study.  It concentrates on how plant life, has by selection, brought forth all the species we see today.  The survival of the fittest through millions of years by gradual change.  Darwin covers his beloved pigeons in depth.  I agree with him that all the different types of pigeons we see today probably came from one ancestor of the pigeon.  This is called variation of kind.  We see this in just about every living creature and flora.  The problem arises when the next step is taken, the rise of one species turning into another (reptile to bird).  Throughout the book Darwin does admit to this fact, but he still maintains that it must be, with much difficulty.   There is no doubt there is a tremendous amount of work that went into his book.  It is a difficult read.  I would rather have read the dictionary.  One does need to know his enemy.  Darwin is not the originator of "evolution."  There are many who came before him, since the dawn of time.  He was influenced by numerous men of his time, some being more radical.  Darwin was nothing new, he just maid it "hip."  What he started has turned into the secular humanism the world had adopted.  I don't think he meant for this disease to spread like it has.  From his writings I understand him as an agnostic, but doubtful.  I believed he struggled with the possibly of a deist.  It is safe to say it was his only ambition till his dying day to prove "evolution" as proof of our existence.  What of the missing fossil record?, he new they would be found.  He was a confusing man.   150 years later and there still has been no intermediate fossils found to prove the case.  In fact we are discovering more that validates creation. 
 Everything is very fragile,esp the black vinyl part.   I broke 9 out of 10 when I tried to open the case for back inserts.  Don't expect it is of the same quality as the one you purchased with music cd. It is of much inferior quality 
      I find it hard to believe that there are people in this world as spineless as Bob. The book holds enough attention to finish it just to see if Bob ever "spines up". His lack of common sense and stupidity make him an unbeleaveable character. I rather doubt if I would read other writings by Matheson. Very repetitive. Could have shortened the book by about 100 pages. This was far fetched and not worth much more than the $1 I paid for it at a dollar general 
 Well I think that this book was not the book I was looking for, it starts out well and very descriptive, but as you go on into the book it gets worse and worse, chapter by chapter. I personaly will probably never read another Jack London book because this one was so borring 
 As someone who was on bed rest for the last trimester of my pregnancy I can relate to the character in that respect.  However, the story is so-so.  There are much better reads out there 
 I was very disappointed with this book, especially since one of my friends saw it on the Oprah show and I like many of her recommendations.    I feel like the book and the questions lack depth. The questions are very shallow and not the sort of questions I would ask and want to be asked from the person with whom I want to create a closer, more intimate connection.    If you really want to take a look at it, check it out from the library or spend a few minutes browsing it at the bookstore.   
 The story starts out very good, but the farther one reads the slower and more boring it becomes, I was only able to scan thru the second half, as other reviewers remarked the sex scene is really really laughable, avocados indeed. I felt as if I were wasting my time reading this when I could have been reading something good 
 If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "... forgive God" and that we must love God "... even if He isnt perfect". Kusher even has the will to say that "...God would not be God..." without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution.    Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that "... God so loved the world" and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place. " for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question "WHY" 
 I am a huge fan of BBC period drama and have nearly exhausted my library's supply of miniseries based on the works of Austen, Gaskell, Dickens, and Eliot. But I would have to say that the BBC struck out this time. The direction was bad, the acting was mediocre at best, the music was obtrustive, and the screenplay was just plain awful. After the first half-hour my sisters and I survived the rest by poking fun at one cliche after another. I have not read the book so I don't know how much of it is from the source material. Makes me curious to read it, though. The costumes and some of the scenery were good; I'll give it that 
 The gist of this book is that if your child is defiant, it must be because you, the parent, is too controlling.  Give the child what he wants and quit bugging him.    Um, no.  Has this author ever spent any time with a defiant preschooler?  If I didn't try to control him somewhat, he'd spend most of his life naked in front of the tv eating cookies.  This book was no help at all. 
 I bought this TV to pick up Armed Forces Network signals at my base in Iraq (transmitted from ON the base, BTW), and all I get is a very poor picture and sound I can barely hear.  The reception is worthless in my opinion, so I packaged it up and sent it to my son back home...thanks Axion, I had to go out and buy a regular TV for $99, which works perfectly with the enclosed rabbit ears 
 i have to say i was sorely disappointed in this book... the subject sounds extremely interesting but after trying painfully to work my way through the first chapter about the discovery of fire i realized very quickly mr. crump has a very confusing, unorganized style of writing...   the first chapter talked about fire, its discovery and applications about 10% of the time... the rest of the chapter was filled with completely unrelated and confusing tangents into linguistics, the developement of mathematics, religion, astronomy and everything but fire which was supposed to be the main theme of the first chapter...   mr. crump also has a very annoying tendency to write run on sentences lumping several discrete ideas together so that by the time you get to the end of the sentence you don't remember what it was supposed to be about... also, when he does manage to stick to a single theme in the sentence he becomes verbose and again throws you off...  i can't believe someone so educated and privileged to have met so many important people in his life, to have seen so many incredible things would be so inept at communicating this to the reader... i'm a physician and read profusely... and unfortunately this has been one of the poorest pieces of scientific writing i've ever read... i'm glad that i only spent about seven dollars on it...  try again mr. crum 
 Okay, you may think that I do not appreciate the so-called classics, but I have to be honest--I simply cannot stand this book. The language is so bad, and even the ending is horrible. The only good thing I can say about the whole thing is that it's very short. It's only a few chapters long, and that's it.   I read this book with my English class in high school, and reading it once was more than enough for me. Not to diss John Steinbeck or anything like that, but this book is one of the worst books in all of literature. I don't even understand why they call this lame piece of work a "classic". 
 Most of the proofs that the Morrises give are well thought-out with good  evidence.  However, when they start talking about creation, they base their  proofs on traditions instead of scripture and natural revelation. No matter  how hard the Morrises try, their personal creation theology has never stood  up.  This section stands out like a sore thumb out of what could have been  a great book 
 I'll keep this simple and short. If you enjoy mysteries that have no mystery, suspense, character development, creative storyline, etcetera - this book is for you. I'm serious. It reeks of an endeavor the author was goaded into by some teaching colleague that thought she had some talent. The author tries to be witty and is overly wordy in the process.     I bought this book thinking the description, title, and cover looked interesting, particularly for this time of year. Don't make the same mistake 
 Maybe my toenails are just too thick, but this cutter just is not heavy duty enough to cut them... I threw them away upon first use.  My old toenail cutters were the same design but I don't know who made them...they worked fine... heavier duty metal and much sharper.  These are junk IMHO 
 The Communist era is best known for grandiose pompous art, that can be enjoyed for some of its dramatic flair, aggression or harping over class inequities. Unfortunately this book showcases none of that genre. It is a selective presentation of unimaginative talentless minimalist junk, mostly printed in black and white. The Soviets did have some original strains of modern art in their propaganda machinery, but little of it is reproduced here. This is just a sad cocktail of unoriginal ideas - borrowed from the West and executed poorly (an artistic equivalent of industrial rip-offs of Western consumer goods from the same era). If you want to see some original and funky modern Communist posters, see "Revolucion: Cuban Poster Art" by Lincoln Cushing 
 I have read many books on MPD/DID, and this one is the least interesting and helpful thus far.  I do not wish to take any personal jabs at the author, however, MPD/DID is obviously not her only disorder.  By the time you get to the end of the book and read about more post-healing "tragedies" and abuse, one gets the feeling that the author thrives on such drama.  When people write autobigraphies, they take the reader into their world. I do not wish to be dragged into this author's world.  It's not about happy endings, but it is about wanting to read truly good books written by truly healthy people who have truly overcome 
 I liked a couple of tracks off ja fools first album, but only a little bit, i never felt him or rated him to be that good really. And when I heard this one my view of him could see what he is completely. This is pop, not rap and definately not hip hop. It's like he's trying to do RnB in a wannabe 2pac way. This is only for little girls and middle and upper class fa@@ots that don't know anything except for whats on radio or t.v and class it as 'rap' or 'hip hop'. This is an insult to both categories and to anyone who actually bought it. I'm lucky I didn't pay s#it for it and heard it from someone else who was trying to convince themselves that they liked it because of these marketing traps that fool blind people and my friend fell into too, thats why he didn't even listen to it for long either. I feel sorry for my friend, he could have bought something to smoke instead lol. Ja fool has beef with 50 cent too, another wack a$$ lame I don't care for at all. Its like they have all this planned to get them sales in the first place cos they know they ain't got skills. But theres always the people who fall for it, and if you feel me, you know who them people are without me mentioning. The truth is, rap has been sold out since 98/99, but hip hop is still there. And the people who like hip hop know that, while the others buy this s#it and pay weak fa@@ots. If you really like supporting clowns, go to the circus. This doesn't get any stars at all, just the anagram, 1 RATS(don't think it makes any sense lol, but sounds more appropriate). Get off the di@ks of these chumps and get into REAL music, theres REAL RnB, REAL Hip hop, REAL rap, REAL music outhere, you will never regret it after and listen to an album more than one month. Peace 
 Jet Li as a contrac killer? Come on! The reason why this movie isn't that famous is because it pretty much sucks. It's just a shootem up bang bang type of movie. No realy kung fu here 
 Initially, the 340 was way too sensitive to be even remotely accurate. It did, however, give my wife a good laugh; she was sure that at least 5000 of my 10000 'steps' were registered while sitting perfectly still and clicking the TV remote. But after one week of use, the darn thing became so *in*sensitive that it would only register when I jumped up and down like a pogo stick. Pass on this one 
 What the heck happened on this cd?  All mixed up is the very appropriate title in this case!  Why take something that was perfect the way it was, and make it less than that?  Almost every song sounds out of place with the background music.  You can tell the vocals were lifted and other music was added to achieve this disaster.  So many other bands have also tried this and failed as well.  Listen to the clips before you buy, thank goodness I did!  They are a FABULOUS group regardless and the way to go would be to do an acoustic album next time 
 Personally I found this book to be little more than a GRE verbal refresher course.  Sure, it is objective and balanced but so impassionate that such a contentious issue seems like nothing.  I think you can strip away emotion from a social problem so much that it creates the question of, well, then, does this really matter?  In my opinion I feel this is what the author has done.  I was really disappointed in this book 
 I read this book many years ago, and thought it was terrible.  Looking through the reviews just now, I couldn't believe how overwhelmingly positive they were, and just had to put in a word for those of us (and I assume/hope there are others) who didn't like the book.  The book is ludicrously long, and meanders through way too many red herrings, dead ends, and nonsequitirs.  There are any number of sub-plots that appear out of nowhwere, go nowhere, never pay off, and leave you wondering why you had to take the time to read through them at all.  The sub-plots, though, are nothing like as much of a problem as the main plot itself.  It's a very uninspiring story about a business deal.  Will person A get the contract, or will person B?  A business deal?  Who cares?  SPOILER ALERT:  And then, after sitting through thousands of pages boringly building up to the big deal, at the end one of the characters randomly dies, and the whole thing just peters out.  No climax, no drama, nothing.  I also respectfully disagree with the reviewers who praised the characters.  I found that Clavell has a bad habit of making his characters too perfect, carried out too far in this book.  All of the major characters are the greatest golfer and an olympic diver and the greatest gourmet and a brilliant business person and so on and so on.  These are not real people, they're supermen who I couldn't relate to at all.  It's boring, it's long, it's badly written.  I was particularly disappointed because I loved Shogun and liked Tai-pan and King Rat.  But after this one, I've never read another Clavell book, and I don't think I will 
 We have this stroller and aren't really thrilled with it.  In fact, we're going to buy a different double stroller to replace it.  Our children are aged 2 years and 4 months.  While the 3 month old was still in his car seat/carrier, this stroller worked well for him.  He's now out grown the carrier, and we've put him in the seat of the stroller.  The shoulder straps are too tight for him and don't adjust well.  The seat isn't padded well and there is no head support.  Our 2 year old does not like the back of the stroller.  With the infant in the front, we have to keep it reclined, so my daughter has to lean forward if she's sitting in the back.  She hates standing on it because she is very short and she can't see anything.  She would much prefer to sit in the front.  We find that the basket in the bottom is practically useless. We can't reach it so we never use it.  There is no cup holder or tray for the parents.  It is also a bit bulky when folded and heavy.  So, I think that we will put this stroller in storage until the kids are older and get a double stroller with 2 seats for now 
 I didn't like the book because it has no action.Paul Fliechman, the only action you had was when sae young got beat up and thats what I thought about SEED FOLKS.        
 Joseph Campbell wrote "The Hero With 1000 Faces," arguably one of the most influential books of the 20th century.   Christopher Vogler wrote "The Writer's Journey," which might have been renamed "The Hero With 1000 Faces For Dummies."   Now James Frey has written "The Key," which might be renamed "The Writer's Journey For Dummies."  The only thing you will find in this book that is not in the previous books is countless directions to read Frey's "How To Write A Damn Good Novel," and other "Damn Good" books.  Do yourself a favour and read Campbell and Vogler instead 
 Why am I supposed to be gripped by the drama of this personal tale?  I cannot get past the first pages, so full of history that I am completely bogged down in it. Is all this necessary to my understanding of the situation in that part of the world -- one which I watched unfold during the years it happened as I watched and listened to the media reports? Please, please, I want to like this book, but it just puts me to sleep.  Maybe I should skip the first part that lays the groundwork and get to the personal experience part.  Can I do that??? 
 I was surprised how much this book was lacking.  It didn't even contain names that I considered to relatively common. Also, it only lists a name under its most popular spelling (under that lising it will give alternative spellings but still...)  I ended up buying a different baby name book.  This one just didn't cut it 
 The premise, the title, and even the cover art are all misleading - this book does not really explore the world of Internet dating beyond 3 or 4 `dates.' The main character, Jess, is 34, single, and envious of her sister Olivia, and Olivia's perfect marriage and children. As a birthday gift, Jess receives a subscription to an online dating site and manages to go on about 4 dates during the course of a year. Not stunning odds, and not very interesting reading either. Maybe it's just me, but I really thought this book was going to focus more on the dates and less on Jess and her sister. In the midst of the book, the story takes a drastic turn and becomes very `deep' in terms of the storyline; the storyline, which involves Olivia, just didn't gel with the rest of the book and its upbeat attitude. It was as if a large cloud came over the book midway through and it was hard to get the spirit of the book back. Jess does change throughout the course of the year, but with only 4 dates as a frame of reference, her changes are not that believable and neither is her eventual romance. I just thought this book was poorly written (which, aside from its poor storyline, is illustrated by all the swearing). Waste of your time 
 They should stop milking it with crappy film franchises like the texas chainsaw massacre. This series should have been killed off by now. The first was not even worth watching! Stay away from this whole movie series 
 It is not so much that I did not think the plot plausable, but the characterizations are untrue to the original book.  I feel not enough time and care was taken to move the plot within the parameters of the characters as set by JA.  Miss Darcy, although entertaining, becomes a pale shade of Elizabeth Bennett.  Lady Catherine becomes flaccidly comic (has she become a vicar or even transposed with Mr Collins?)  It pains me also to see the most interesting and engaging characters of Elizabeth and Darcy pushed so far into the background.  I also take issue with the use of Lizzy and Fitzwilliam as the familiar names the couple uses when refering to each other.  I am almost certain that Elizabeth would always be Elizabeth in Darcy's eyes and that none of the characters in P&P would have used anything but Darcy's surname.  All of this censure aside, it was a good attempt.  I thought the phrasing and meter of the work to pay homage to Austen.  I also admire the care taken in research of the subject matter and time period.  I would recommend this book as what it is aptly titled ":An Entertainment" 
 These reviews are probably more interesting than the book. What's so interesting about them is that the reviewers don't seem to get that more than two-thirds of the country are now fully aware of Bush's utter incompetence as a leader. The "vast left-wing conspiracy" now consists of a 2/3 majority of the country. Apparently, 1 1/2 years wasn't enough time for a clear majority of voters to figure it all out. But nearly 3 1/2 years later, we all see. This book is a couple of years too late. Today it's utterly ridiculous to denounce a "conspiracy" to reveal the TRUTH 
 This book will be a relatively satisfactory read for people who have already bought the angel story hook, line, and sinker.  If you're looking to be convinced, however, look elsewhere.  All this book does is present a bunch of anecdotal stories (most easily resolved through rational investigation, misleading, distorted, or purposefully vague) and claim to have produced irrefutable evidence for the existence of angels.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought the whole point of religion was to accept things on faith, without having to prove them empirically.  If I were religious, I would find this book somewhat insulting, since it devalues the message of faith and attempts to replace it with shoddy, anecdotal evidence.  I did find one disturbing quote on page 7, however: "more than sixty percent of Americans believe wholeheartedly in angels," clearly advancing the idea that something must be true simply because a majority believes it is.  This textbook example of a bandwagon fallacy underscores the shoddy reasoning present througout the entire book.  If you're looking for something rational, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a good piece of historical fiction, I recommend Orson Scott Card's "Alvin Maker" series 
 I'm pretty sure that this book is going to wind up as the clear choice for the annual award, "A Liberal's Favorite Book Written by a Conservative Author." To be honest, the premise is why I chose to read the book, but by the end, I was feeling a bit disturbed because the author's conclusion seems to be that Bush's real crime is that he is NOT CONSERVATIVE ENOUGH! That is truly amazing, and a bit scary as well.   As other reviewers have made clear, Bartlett's conservative credentials are impeccable. This is hardly a case of an opportunistic hack or a member of the rank and file wanting to be a contrarian. I give Bartlett credit for sticking by his Reagan-era conservative ideals (as misguided and utopian I feel they are), and he is quite right for his lambasting of Bush on pretty much every topic, from the Medicare fiasco, his reckless spending, and most importantly, his anti-intellectualism, as evidenced by the fact that he finds policy research and rigorous analysis basically boring, as Bartlett says. I agree with most everything the book says regarding Bush's failures, but what is unsettling to me about this tome is what it says about the author and his worldviews. It looks like the reviewer Robert Moore beat me to the punch on some of this, but here's my spin on Bartlett.  Although as a liberal I expected to like this book, I came away from it feeling like I had heard it all before, and I had. These are the same things that I, along with probably countless others, had seen in Bush's policies from the start. Obviously, it carries more cache with the conservative crowd that one of their own would step up and state the unfortunate truth, rather than a liberal, but I find a his method of thinking just a tad insidious and desperate. Bartlett, and other members of the conservative intelligentsia who are now finding it almost fashionable to bash Bush and distance themselves from him now that his approval ratings are plummeting and his policies are not working, strike me as being very weak. The argument that those like Bartlett were taking a cautious, wait-and-see approach before evaluating Bush, just to see if there was actually classical conservative-like style light at the end of his huge-spending, huge government tunnel is laughable. Let's be clear folks, BUSH HAS NOT SUDDENLY CHANGED IN HIS SECOND TERM! He is the same guy, his policies are structured the same way, and he is arguing for the same indefensible courses of action that he always has.   My question is this: Where were these Bush-bashers on the right say, three years ago? It seems to me that they have been flacking for an administration that has betrayed their core principals simply for political points and keeping Republicans in power, no matter how much they sell out the "small government" ideology. Bartlett essentially admits this when he says that even when all is said and done, he would still vote for Bush. Why? Well, uh, umm... because he's better than having a Democrat in office. How can one write an entire book and then after all the thorough dissecting, say they would still vote for him. This leaves us with two conclusions, neither appealing for Bartlett. This is either a complete abandonment of principle or it is simply adding to the problem of our nation's leaders being so sickeningly partisan that they would support someone that betrays the beliefs near and dear to them because his graphic on the television says R- and not D-.   What is even more disturbing is that Bartlett appears to think that Bush is too liberal economically, and does not follow the small government approach. On that point, he is correct, at least in traditional conservative theory, but everywhere in this book his brand of small-government ideology is continually shown to be almost comically extreme, rigid, and indefensible in the face of reality and ethical responsibility. For example, he says that it is "tragic" that the same Bush who ignored the Kyoto accords on global warming regulation is now expanding the government to further regulate the health standards of beef products and to clamp down on corruption in the business world. Yep, Bartlett is criticizing Bush for wanting to do more to protect Americans against corporate crime and Mad Cow Disease.   Of course, the small government ideology that Bartlett still clings to has never worked and not even his hero, Ronald Reagan, was able to put this theory into practice. For all the talk about government being the problem, did Reagan shrink the size of government? Nope. For all the talk about how Reagan-era conservatives want less government intervention, did they complain about a conservative government taking an aggressive, actively interventionist stance in "regulating" and destroying unions and labor while also giving way more money to the top 1% of America (while about 80% of Americans were negatively affected) with one signature? Or their attempts to legislate issues that are a matter of private morality like consensual sex with birth control, with no quantifiable public consequences (as opposed to a publicly immoral incident like Enron)? As a matter of fact, conservatives LOVED this kind of government involvement.   Therein lies the dirty little secret of modern conservatism that Bartlett falls prey to in this book: No one really opposes government intervention if that intervention is in their interest. I'll start buying the small-government lip service if conservatives are offered a huge government package or initiative that clearly benefits their base, like say, federal funding of certain religious groups and faith-based initiatives, only to see an overwhelmingly negative response on the principle of small government. Any takers on a bet for that one? I understand that there is more than one type of conservative and their values don't always match, but one cannot just decry "Big Government" when they want to if it is really a deeply felt principle. Be consistent, please.  Once those like Bartlett wake up to the fact that their small-government, hands-off ideology is nothing more than a utopian pipedream of an extreme paleo-conservative, the much better off their books will be. This book may appeal to liberals on the surface, as it did to me, but once one digs deeper into the means and implications behind Bartlett's line of reasoning, the more dangerously out of touch he seems. Liberals, caveat emptor.    
 Reading the first chapter was the only time I actually enjoyed this book. Everything went downhill afterwards, when I realized this was just a retelling of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. Wuthering Heights is a well-told classic, timeless, raw, and beautiful. Here On Earth, however, is just a poor rendition, very contrived, no spontaneity whatsoever.  The almost-complete cast of characters in Wuthering Heights is present in Here On Earth. I don't remember the names of the characters in Here On Earth but I remember their counterparts pretty well. There's your modern-day version of Catherine Earnshaw, there's the modern-day counterpart of her brother Hindley. Then there's the counterpart of Heathcliff! Surprise! Surprise! A foundling with a dark and ominous character! And then there are the neighbors: the counterpart of Edgar Linton (whom Catherine's counterpart marries), and the counterpart of Isabella Linton (whom the counterpart of Heathcliff marries). And then there's the counterpart of Catherine Jr (Catherine-counterpart and Edgar-counterpart's daughter), who falls in love with cousin counterpart of Hareton (son of Hindley's counterpart). There's also Nelly Dean's counterpart, and Linton Linton's counterpart, but that's all I'm going to say. Those of you who've read and loved Wuthering Heights, you know the rest.  It's a sad thing that this is the first Alice Hoffman novel I've read. I'm now inclined to ignore the rest of her novels. Maybe. Or I might be open to her other novels if I've finished reading all the other books I really wanted to read first 
 I was disapointed, it was not what I thought it would be.  It's rap and I expected it to be like what was featured in Kill Bill  
 I am reading & reading to get over what seemed to be endless story telling without excitement.  King should rewrite the part what Straub had written and relaunch a revision.  Even die-hard fans of King will loose patience 
 After hearing so much about the book, I must admit to a disappointment in its contents.  As a Belgian that has immigrated to the USA, I am well familiar with the many contrasts between Europe and the US and found Mr. Reid's observations to be lacking both in perspective and completeness.  For example, Mr Reid appears enamored with the European welfare state, vaunts its many virtues and describes it as a central pillar of the new "European identity" that is superior to the barbarous American model, but admits in small print in its Appendix that the European welfare state faces a crisis that far surpasses the US social security system in magnitude and will not survive in its present form.  I felt that a fair discussion on the topic should have included a discussion on the countless challenges to the welfare state.  I thought that many of his other observations lacked the same kind of roundness.  I felt that the book lack depths and was primarily suitable to a reader in search of a caricature on the relationship between Europe and America. 
 I am not indicting his theories, but his writing. My God. Buy "Fabric of the Cosmos" by Brian Greene. It covers the same thing (and much more) in a more eloquent and comprehensive manner. Do not buy 
 Of the 7 or so Grisham novels Ive read this one is my least favorite.  It's not a bad story at all but it's just way too long, about 150 pages longer than it needed to be.   It also just lacked credibility in many spots. Grisham is normally quite good at presenting characters and situations that are at least plausible, if not really interesting. Most of his books give the layman some insight into the workings of the law that Ive always thought were fascinating. This book, however, plods along and doesnt bring anything new to his body of work.  The other thing that really got me was the dialogue he wrote for Mark Sway, the 11year old protagonist. He sounds more like a street-wise 30year old, using words like "wonderful" and phrases that have been out of use since the 70's. I think Grisham forgot he was writing the words for a young boy and not one of his more typically older characters.  This isnt a bad book if you just want to escape for a few hours a day but most of his other ones are far more enjoyable 
 I don't think so.  Contrived movie with a little cycling thrown in to make up for a poor script.  Think about it: take a dump on a stock and get wiped out; now you are a messenger?  I do not think so.  I know of a few New York Stock Exchange brokers who blew themselves up on trades, but this is crazy.  Thank goodness they kept the New York scenes to a minimum.  Yes, he was suppose to be at the NYSE and not the Pacific Stock Exchange as a previous reviewer wrote 
 I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the "female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part..." Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick. 
                   At a time when many historions and authors are bringing out important re-evaluations of the causes of World War I, there are still large numbers of the same that continue to bolster the accepted,"Official Versions of Who Caused the Great War".                   Aside from some of the defects mentioned by other reviewers this author presents the German military as operating in a vacuum. That, in fact, the military alliance between England and France, with France also having a military alliance with Russia, all of which was aimed at Germany specifically, had no consequences or dangers to either Germany or Austro-Hungary. That the then massive bank loans of France to Russia had no military application when, according to French documentation, the loans were tendered with the understanding that they would be used to insure the ability of Russias military  to mobilize rapidly against Germany.              Furthermore, the political and cultural attitudes in all of the European countries had no bearing on the military thinking of all of the militaries involved.                There are many other better histories available.                 
 This book was more encyclopedic than inspiring.  This would be great for a student of design.  It was not helpful for me.  I wanted to find decor and furnishing ideas for my unostentatious 1930's home.  This book did not offer help to the interior design novice 
 In this book, Robert Kaplan makes a case for a revival of Fascism. As in the 1930s, the world is to turn its back on normal morality in favor of the ends justify any means and to adopt National Darwinism. The book idolizes the strongman leader and the arbitrary use of military force unconstrained by a civil society.  He laughs at Jewish and Christian concepts of morality. They are for fools and children. The ethos he reaches for calling it "Pagan" is in truth not that at all. Rather than presenting anything about leadership, he presents domination. Morality is for idiots and all true leaders are supposed to recognize that life (and government) is nothing more than a struggle between men for greatness and survival. To be moral is to be a fool that will be crushed by the real leaders of the world.  Kaplan would have been right at home in Imperial Japan, Fascist Italy or up on the platform with Franco. The book isn't worth reading and I would not recommend it to anyone 
 I agree with the reviews on this book...this book is really a bad choice for an ADT class ....there are no complete code examples, everything is in parts, and the author does not explain how to fit these different code pieces together...apart from that if being a novice I could detect programmatic errors within the first 4 chapters, that shows how poorly written this text is...someone recommended "Data-Abstraction and Problem Solving in C++" by Carrano, and boy, it was a life saver....the carrano text is probably the best written ADT book available.... 
 It only became clear to me how MS undermines Mac by using its software as weapon when I began using MS office for Mac. I have used Window's based Excel everyday at work for the last 20 years and I cannot figure out how to use the Mac version efficiently. It seems like an ersatz version from 15 years ago. If you want to work on PowerPoint docs at home created on your PC at work you will find the effort not worth it...the docs will never transfer formatting properly. I bought this program and almost never use it because it is just so clumsy compared to the PC version. Having said that, there is no alternative to MS office; this is the outcome of MS having monopoly power...no support and an inferior product for Mac user 
 I bought this CD because I like Carly's voice but was dissapointed with the song selection, it seemed like I was listenning to a CD of nursery rhymmes. However the music arrangements were good. Very dissapointed and threw the CD in the bin 
 I went through 2 of these in as many months - the sound quality was very spotty and the mic would intermittently quit working. People regularly had a hard time understanding me when the mic was working and the voice recognition on my cell phone couldn't even distinguish between 'yes' and 'no.' 
 Animals should NEVER receive negative punishment (physical or mental). Why should you, when the positive reinforcemt methods have poved to work so well and makes your animal obey you out of respect and not out of fear as the negative reinforcement does? The use of negative reinforcemt stems from a lack of true understanding of canine psychology (as it is utterly unnecessary) and a need to be sadistic. As a veterinarian and animal lover, I strongly advise against this book 
 This movie made no sense to me whatsoever. it wasn't really funny and it wasn't scary. the only thing that i got was that he killed Zombies or "Returners" as he called theme. and was upssed with one. i have to admit the female lead in the film was hot. but that was the only good thing in the film. it was also boring. but if you are into forgin fright films this is the movie for you 
 Phoebe Hoban's BASQUIAT: A Quick Killing in Art is one of the few biographies of the painter whose brief career (1980-1988) coincided with the disgusting obsession with profit of the Eighties' art world. There is little here about his work itself, and in order to understand why Basquiat is so important you'll need a collection of his pictures.  The two big themes of the book are drugs and lots of sex with myriad women and men. I had the impression (like many, I assume) that Basquiat's sinking into drug addiction happened only after his corrupting fame, but Hoban reveals that he had been seriously abusing drugs since the age of fifteen. Basquiat's making an income by selling his body is also exhaustively treated, as are his relationships with Klaus Nomi, Rene Richards, Suzzane Mallouk, and others. The reader notices that a lot of things are being left out. It is obvious, and Hoban herself makes an allusion at one point, that Basquiat was somewhat well-read, but Hoban never talks about his intellectual activities or, with the exception of Cy Twombly, his discovery of his artistic predecessors.  After recounting Basquiat's death, there are two final chapters. The first describes the fights over his estate over the following decade. Hoban has Vrej Baghoomian coming out looking like quite the scumbag, and she describes the case of the several Basquiat forgeries. The chapter ends with a chilling visit to Basquiat's mother, now left extremely poor and mentally fragile even though she was entitled to fifty percent of all proceeds. The final chapter finally focuses on Basquiat's art itself, its themes and the painter's techniques. However, it isn't as substantial as other presentations of Basquiat's work.  If you love Basquiat's painting and really could care less who the man was, Hoban's biography has little appeal and that is why I have rated it rather low. I think that the book would be most attractive to those seeking to understand Basquiat in a historical context along with the 1980s art scene as a whole. That the work is very well-sourced makes it a useful guide to further research 
 This movie is demented. It's only a tiny bit above something sold in an adult video store, as it is basically just one sex scene after another. If you hate other people, and want to have an excuse to distrust everyone you meet, watch this diseased film 
 Boaz Yakin's movie is the story of a woman caught in an unhappy marriage. This is an extremely wrong and depressing portrayal of orthodox Judiasm. I can point out so many instances. It starts right from the marriage, the orthodox Jewish weddings are wonderful occasions, this looks like a funeral. There are so many wrong interpretations of the bible that anyone would be offended. The worst is the Rabbi who disregards his wife, though he is such a great scholar. Some call him "Moshe Rabbenu". I will not go into details but no sincere Jew is allowed to disregard his wife, there is a mitzwah against it. The part where he dies and his wife comes and and thanks Renee is the silliest of all. The way the entire community is portrayed makes me think that I am looking at some other community, though I partly belong to it. Every community has its positives and negatives, but showing the negatives alone is wrong. This is a unique community that has great positives, attachment to family, scholarly spirit, artistic tendencies and so on that have been shown over generations. Some of the great american writers such as Saul Bellow came from such families. While the characters are acted well, it is totally silly and fictional. Do not waste time on this garbage. 
 It is just a collection of definitions, may of which are inaccurate. It uses non-stanard terms like PDL instead of pseudocode to give it the air of authority. Instead of hard facts, you get a bunch of quotes from people who likewise working solely on gut instinct.  Take a look at books like Code Complete if you want something with real academic rigor. 
 I couldn't get into the stories or the characters....  I like short stories and novellas, and was hoping for something in the vein of Ray Bradbury or Stephen King...or Robert Heinlein...  ...I found none of that in Gibson's "Burning Chrome".. 
 This is the cheesiest music ever. Phil Collins, Glenn Frey, Chaka Khan? Are you kidding me? These were the worst artists of the 80's. Where's U2, REM, the Pixies, X, the Pretenders, Tom Petty, Prince, Springsteen, the Replacements, Husker Du? Does anyone like Rock and Roll? Phil Collins writes songs for Disney and Pixar now! What did Glenn Frey know about 'Smugglers Blues'? Do you think he was writing from the experience or from the heart? These are the worst artists, songwriters and performers of the 80's.  Enjoy the nostalgia, but the art which is song is seriously missing on this CD.  
 Complete waste of time!  I am done reading Robin Cook books for now..The story line for this book is so stupid I am amazed Mr. Cooks editors even allowed it to be printed..I'm not sure about the hospitals where Robin lives or works at, but in the area where I live, if just one patient died there would be an immediate investigation, but here we have several patients die from unknown causes and the characters just move along like it's no big deal..The Wilsons even allow their daughter to be admitted!!!  Give me a break!!  Like I said..don't waste your time on this one!!  
 Rarely do I give book rating of one star. Mainly because I don't know what that kind of rating exactly means. Does it mean that I didn't like the book? If so, what is the difference between one star and two stars. I guess it is hard to give argumentative explanation of ones own rating. So I won't. :)  What do I have in front of me?  This is something that advertises itself as a modern time macchiavelism. But, to say that this book has any kind of resemblance to "Il principe" is highly overstated. We are all aware (and if we are not, we should be) of methods described in this book. Methods that concern being promoted in any kind of job that you do. Method here being ruthlessnes, and most of all efficiency, wihtout feel for compassion and human realtions in any other kind than exploitment. It may sound as something that Macchiavlei said, it may even resemble Nietzschean philospohy, but precisely in that lies the point.   I fail to picture the reader of this book. I fail to see big corporate director who alreday doesen't know all that is written here and more, and quite frankly, I fail to see him reading at all, but that is another story. To average joe out there, who thinks that there are marvellous wonders and secrets written here this book will seem quite drab. After all, rutlessnes is not employment strategy, it is just a state of character. One who is not able to do such a thing won't be any different upon reading this book.  If you are looking for philosophy of modern times, there are tons of authors out there, of ages past that are presenting better work of modern times than any of the contemporary autors. Machiavelli being one of the better known.  Maybe I just don't want to accept the existance of the universe (which paradoxically I can tell for sure that is real) presented in this book, and maybe therein lies my angst, but that is for you to judge if you, by some twist of chance happen to stumble upon this book.   
 The clear plastic windows of the sleeves emit a strong chemical smell.  I bought two boxes; both boxes stank.  Maybe if you pay a little more you get the non-stinky kind.  You get red, orange, yellow, green and blue sleeves, 10 of each 
 This movie is not so much a sequel to the original, but simply a film that borrows that film's premise and tries to rejuvenate it with different touches.  Ultimately, it doesn't work because the script and pacing are weak, and although Eric Lively and Erica Durance are charming in their roles, their thespian skills don't really convince us they're sincere in their performances.  There is also no real explanation for Lively's abilities and when he makes his final "return", why doesn't he just not go to work and then maybe...well, don't want to spoil it.  It's not a rotten movie, but it's merely another direct to video release that won't stay with you too long 
 Don't EVEN bother buying this book.  If you can avoid the snores with all the medical mumbo-jumbo, maybe this book is for you.  Bottom line is: don't fret about aging because it's going to happen to you and eat right, exercise and take your vitamins.  So what else is new?  P.S.  Dr. Weil writes that there are no anti-aging remedies yet he advertises Origins mushroom face creams--hmmm.... 
 This game is a joke!  It is immpossible for a child to get past level 3.  It took my husband about 20 tries to get past it, and he is a pro at video games.  (he beat mech 2 for x-box and halo2 the third time he played them.)  Don't buy this game for your kids until you rent it and let them try it out.  It is was a waste of money my kids won't even play it.  It should be rated N for Nobody 
 I think this book is very repetitive and is a very poor attempt at showing why losing all of these languages is important.  They are comparing losing these languages to animals and plants going extinct.  They try and draw all of these worthless comparissions that do not make any sense.  This book is not even worth being picked up 
 Most of the other reviews have said it well, this book is a total waste of time and I wouldn't have told my wife to get this for me for x-mas had I seen who the "authors" were (I was basing my want for the book based on the title which sounded like it could have been very cool) Most of the "myths" aren't, has some very bad, inacurate and distorted facts, poor writing,  I could go on and on---I think the only reason I even finished it (mostly when taking a crap) is for the laughs I got on how stupid and ludicrous it was---If I could give this a negative star I would, in fact it pisses me off that I have to give this 1 star ---don't buy any Beatle book by these "authors"  they all stink 
 I'm a senior at Oglethorpe University, minoring in English, and I have to say I was disappointed in having this text as my last assignment in our class "The Child in Literature" and as my last English assignment ever.  I found the characters flat and the symbolism overt and unengaging.  At first I thought that the children acted the way I expected them to because they are children.  Children are easily manipulated by their environment.  But as the book progressed, the reader could see each character take the expected turns, and land in the expected outcomes.  Cody needed a father, throughout the entire novel, so obviously he will emulate his father in his adult life.  Jenny is a brilliant girl searching for real companionship, so her end is just as predictable.  And Ezra.  From the monopoly scene in the beginning to defeat in his love life, I never once thought he would veer from that path, and end up any differently than he did.  A book that does not challenge it's readers, and does not invoke any hope in a different outcome, is a very flat and disappointing book.  Even the food symbols, or the name associations, or the exact mirrored images of some of the characters (Luke and his game, or Luke and his recorder, anyone?) are blatently handed out and explained.  I like what Tyler was trying to do, and I can take the characters for what they are, and maybe enjoy them, but as someone who loves to remove the author's intention and just delve into a text, this book upsets me.  Tyler leaves literally no room for interpretation at all.  That might make her a "good" writer, but it certainly doesn't make it a good book.  A book you can't discuss or argue over the meaning of seems pointless.  I can see myself in every one of those characters, but I didn't learn anything from it.  This, to me, seems like light beach reading.  Though the subject is so dark, I don't think I could even recommend it for that. 
 After feverishly finishing Shadowmancer, I instantly went out and bought this novel. Boy, what a disappointment! This book is so lame. Lamer than Attack of the Clones and ewoks combined- and, from me, that is a HUGE insult. It was so bad I hardly forced myself to finish it. I loved Shadowmancer because it so vibarantly expressed Biblical truth in a way that unbelieving readers- Harry Potter exuberants, especially- might not exactly realize what they were reading, but would still get some basic and beautiful truths about Christ into their heads. That was all erased from this novel. NOTHING! Nothing whatsoever. I could almost say that the Buddhist and New Age-swamped Star Wars saga is more spiritually inline than this novel. What happened to good theology? What happened to the grace of Christ? What happened to His love? His protection? How He crushes evil under His heel? What happened to Deutoronomy's harsh veiw on magic that causes me to avoid Harry Potter?   And besides that, it was just not well written at all. Just as bad as Eragon, and GP Taylor is HOW much older than Christopher Paolini?! Tolkien probably wrote this bad when he was FIVE!   Terrible book. Stay away.  But does anybody want my copy? 
 "Wool and Nylon Blend?"  It is impossible to be a responsible consumer if you do not know what you are buying.  My poor review is based on this.  In my opinion technology has yet to replace the abilities of natural materials like wool and silk.  Of course, this is only my opinion and preference.  However, when manufactures refuse to inform and the buyer with more than "Wool and Nylon Blend?" there is no mechanism to a consumer to make an informed choice or even purchase what they are looking for.  Stretch nylon is certainly nice for form fit and ease when it comes to slipping your foot onto your sock and into your boot.  BUT - if too much nylon is present it will show its downside should the hiker or hunter find themselves in a wet situation and hiking for long periods.  It would seem that the age of the 100% wool sock is almost gone and I accept my fate, but I urge people to NOT buy a sock, which does not disclose the details of its manufacture.  The review reflects on "full disclosure in advertising" and not the product itself.  Should Amazon find it inappropriate then a deletion is understandable. 
 The book starts out confusing, uninteresting, and poorly written and remains that way throughout. Charachters are completely undeveloped and poorly executed. I would not reccommend this book to anyone 
 People buy this book thinking that they will get great advice about how to become a bookie.  What kind of advice you get? None, unless you consider advice not to take the phone calls at your home, or how to fill a piece of paper with the information. It seems that this guy have not heard of spredsheets.   Anyway, the worst of all, is that he tells you basically that you should not worry because people only take favorites and you will make tons of money because underdogs are not taken into account by the bettor.  I agree that in certain sports  like football there is a bias towards favorites, but if you take the data the underdog cover about 52% (or the favorite 48% ATS). This guy talks like 90% of the people bets on the favorite. But even if that it is the case, if the remaining 10% are wiseguys with a huge bankroll your days as a bookie will be counted.  By the way, unless you lived outside the US, his advice not only could make lose money but you could end up in jail!  Do not waste your money on this 
 In 12e, they updated much of the information, tables, case studies, and data (although according to Cateora, the EU still has only 15 members...). I would recommend only for an MBA level class. There are easier textbooks for undergrad level. But I decided to keep Cateora for my class because of the update.   Version 11  I used this book for an MBA course in international marketing. I agree that some of the instructor materials are good. The video series has some good content. Some of the test questions are good, many are irrelevant (testing memorizing numbers vs. understanding concepts), others are ambiguous.  But the book is very hard to read, repetitive, and not well structured. Updates (e.g. Internet) seem to be added somewhat randomly. Economic fundamentals (currencies, international trade) are not well explained. Some of the data tables are very outdated. I spent over 300 hours preparing for a 3-hour credit course, to update the materials. I would recommend looking at alternatives. 
 I know he's a famous "name-it-and-claim-it" preacher, so I wanted to see his thoughts exactly, rather than sit through some rambling sermons of his and get pieces here and there.  That's the great thing about books- preachers have to be concise and to the point.    I discovered he is teaching something I never heard before.  First, let me say that he acknowledges some truthful teachings.  He acknowledges that we are not to be greedy.  He acknowledges that Jesus said to store our treasure in heaven, not earth.  He acknowledges that there is nothing evil about money, but the "love of money" is what is evil (although, I think prosperity teachers like himself are deceived; they are in love with money, which is evident by seeing their lifestyles).  And, by the way, there is much in his book that is very good.  I only want to point out some of the dangerous errors.  And here it is:    He says that we are not to store treasure on earth, but in heaven.  That is true.  The Scripture says it.  But look at what he says that means.  He says that the storehouse for our treasure is in heaven, not the earth (not in banks).  When you need money, you can get it when you want, from God, from our heavenly storehouse.  There's no need to store it here (on earth), where robbers and thieves can get to it.      According to Copeland, how do you make deposits and withdrawals from this treasure bank in heaven?     From pages 63-75, he says how to make deposits.  These include (his words for the subheadings in this section):  -- Tithing (I this this is, by far, the most important) -- Giving to the Poor -- Investing in the Gospel -- Giving as a Praise to God    From pages 75-86 he explains how to make a withdrawal.  In the summary for making a withdrawal, he lists 6 points, culminating in a prayer that summarizes these points.  Here's his prayer from page 85-86:  "Father, in the Name of Jesus, we ask you for $____.  We have this money in our heavenly account and we are withdrawing this amount now.  We believe we receive $____.  As in Mark 11:23-24, we believe it in our hearts and confess now that it is ours in the Name of Jesus.  We agree that we have $____ according to Matthew 18:19.  From this day forward, we roll the care of this over on You and thank You for it.  Satan, in the name of Jesus, we take authority over you; we bind your operation now and render you helpless.  Ministering spirits, we charge you to go forth and cause this amount to come to us according to Hebrews 1;14.  Father, we praise Your Name for meeting our needs according to Your riches in glory by Christ Jesus and for multiplying our seed for sowing in the Name of Jesus."     I have just two questions for Pastor Kenneth Copeland:  1. Do you really live by these principles? Do you have a significant savings account and/or retirement bank account? According to your book, you shouldn't, if you really believed what you wrote.  2. Why didn't the first disciples and Apostles living in Jerusalem know this "secret" about heavenly "deposits" and "withdrawals?"  They were so poor and in hardship that the Apostle Paul went around making a special collection for them from the other Roman churches, as mentioned in 2 Cor. 8 and other passages.  In fact, why didn't any other theologians ever teach this heavenly deposit and withdrawal system?  Shouldn't that be a hint to you that you are going off into the deep end???!!!   
 Hey, how about we just find a song that someone wrote that is just obscure enough so most people wont know that its someone elses song. THEN, heres the big idea, Ill put a bass drum to it! OHH!!! What more can i do to be geniously inventive? I know! Ill make a truely meaningful music video where women dance around. Ill make millions off of it 
 Tony Buzan is not an expert in brain science, nor is he an originator.  This is evident in the "facts" he gives to explain how the brain/mind works.  The info given is old pseudoscience about the mind, adapted from the extreme views of Sperry, amongst other speculative writers of the 1970s.  But I know why Tony Buzan hasn't updated the information to include all the studies that show; mind mapping does not work to any significant level, it is not adopted to any significant level by students, it does not balance the brain any more than other types of note making, and it certainly does not make you smarter.    The reason for this persistent adherence to old and debunked pseudoscience, is that it sells books.  Some common mind myths include; You use less than 1% of your brain, the brain is seperated into specific left/right skills, creativity can be increased easily using simple techniques, and just imagining something will bring it to pass in reality.  These have all been debunked in the latter part of the 1970s.    The techniques given in the book are extremely limited in comparison with the strategies given in other less glitzy study method/ learning books.  That is good enough reason not to buy the book.  But the principles given that dictate the use of techniques are so nonsensical compared to more recent science, that they can only be thought of as sales pitch, or an effort to sell other books by the same author.  Mind mapping is a very feable technique compared to other graphic organizers (eg the concept map).  Speed reading is so misleading that it tends to result in very successful deception litigation.  They have both been debunked on several occasions.  Find a study method book that doesn't just stroke the ego.  Probably any book on study techniques will give better methods without setting you up for anticlimax.  G.Gladstone 
 There is much to say about this book, and none of it is good.  I am not well-versed in Aboriginal culture.  However, I can tell when someone is fabricating information.  Marlo Morgan has a fine time making up all kinds of rediculous details about Aboriginal life and culture.  She even seems to frequently confuse Aboriginal culture with North American Native American practices.  In addition, her writing style is clunky and laughably bad in places.  She didn't even take the time to ensure that the "important message" that she was making up was cohesive or followed any internal logic.  She just rambles on about various New Age concepts, presneting a hackneyed and confusing message about the evils of Western Civilization.  The really funny part is that Morgan doesn't seem to be able to shake her ingrained ethnocentrism, as she makes rediculous claims about Aboriginee feet being "hoof like," and claims with a straight face that up until the 1990's, Australians didn't have window screens.  It's just bad all around. 
 I know a lot of people liked this book, but it didn't work for me. The main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off, acting as if they have committed a huge crime. The problem is, they didn't. There is no crime. I talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot, and it makes no sense. It would make sense if someone comes after the McGuffin, early on, but no one does, not until very late in the book. So most of the story has no foundation. 
 Regardless of what Ryan claims the book only scratches the surface of both fans and Buffett. Ryan has a tendency to make snap judgements about Buffett fans, band members, and Buffett himself. It quickly becomes obvious that he  is an outsider looking in as opposed to a true "insider" as the  title suggests. His admission to not being a real parrothead suggest that  perhaps the book  was written more with a profit margin in mind rather than  any real attempt to explain the parrothead mentality. What is more, it does  little to shed light on anything new about Jimmy. It just gives us one more  opinion about Jimmy and Parrotheads. And we all know what opinions are  like 
 First, this looks to be an excellent book -- if -- you eat eggs and dairy.  If you follow a plant based diet, this is not the book for you.  There are handful - count maybe 5 - recipes that don't have eggs and dairy.  It is possible to substitute Earth Balance for butter and tinker with egg replacers for the eggs, if you want to bother.  For some reason I thought that because it has Buddhist roots it would lean more heavily on plant-based baking.  
 Can you spell : Fell off the wagon ? That's what really applies here. Not even a flood of (fake) 5 star-reviews from (fake) first-time reviewers in a span of 48 hours can polish this turd. Get over it, this CD is a waste of plastic  
 This book has a touchy-feely self-absorbed New Age feel to it. I see that most reviews for this book are positive but this one is not. If you lean even a little toward the evangelical and/or fundamental, please consider the following:  Walsch claims God could be a woman (or without gender). He refers to God as "She" and "Her" in spots.   There are too many references to all of us being One. We are not "one"; we are individuals, created by God to be individuals with different gifts to use in His service. It is He who equips us, not we who fit God into a "friendship" relationship -- this is simply not scriptural. In John 15:14, Jesus says, "You are My friends if you do whatever I command you." This denotes a higher-to-lower hierarchy, one which is repeated throughout the Bible. Jesus (God) clearly states He is in charge and in a superior position. But Walsch's writing does not convey this. It conveys an equality, implicitly, that he and God are on equal footing. This is offensive.   In his hubris, Walsch writes, "It has been two thousand years since the birth of Christ, twenty-five hundred since the time of the Buddha, and more since we first heard the words of Confucius, or the widsom of the Tao, and we still haven't gotten the Main Questions figured out." [We haven't?] "Will there ever be a way to turn the answers we have already received into something workable, something that can function in our day-today lives?" [Many of us have done so by following the Bible.] "I think there is. And I feel pretty certain about it, because I've discussed it a lot in my conversations with God."  [I see.]  Walsch calls himself a Christian but places other religious figures on equal footing with Christ. Jesus never left open the option of truth claims to ANY but His own. Christ never offered a one-from-column-A, one-from-column-B faith. In the guise of thinking outside the box, Walsh reveals his own religious pluralism.   In Scripture, God tells us to fear Him (not a craven fear, a Godly fear). God tells us to worship Him, obey Him and come before Him in humility and in supplication. I see none of this reflected in the pages of Walsch's book. God is my Creator, my Saviour, the Love of my life Who loves me. But He is not my friend; He is God, far above friendship. On this earth a father can be a friend. In God's realm, God is God and not on equal footing with anyone. From Walsch's writing, I got a creepy feeling he was lecturing and explaining to God things God may not have known.   The last straw was the following paragraph where Walsch is justifying the large profits he makes on his books (not that profit is a bad thing): "Is Ted Turner less valuable than Mother Teresa? Is George Soros less of a good person than Che Rivera? Are the politics of Jesse Jackson, who appears to have plenty of the good things in life, less worthy than the politics of Vaclav Havel, who may have less? Should the Pope, whose very garments cost more than it would take to feed a poor child for a year, have his words called blasphemy because he lives like a king as the head of a church which owns billions? Ted Turner and George Soros have given away millions of dollars. They've empowered the dreams of humanity with the rewards of their own dreams, lived."  Turner, Soros and Jesse Jackson are not role models for most people I know. Walsch seems to set them up as such.  Walsch writes the following self-absorbed, misguided statement: "It's as if we somehow know that if we can learn more about one another, we can learn more about ourselves. And the yearning to know more about ourselves -- about Who We Really Are  -- is the depest yearning of all." No, Mr. Walsch; the deepest yearning of all is not to know more about ourselves: It should be to know more about GOD. It is He Who will teach us what we need to know about ourselves, if anything. Americans are already too self-absorbed. We don't need more of it.  Perhaps it is just me but I found this New Age claptrap just a bit over the top, not biblical and certainly not the kind of Christianity I'd like to see spread around. 
 This has been my most successful review so I have revised it one year later. Bought this with a lot of expectations. As you are all aware there is very little in the way of books on this subject. The definitive work is Ray Zee's Advanced Omaha Hilo which is several years old. Why so few books, the reason I would guess is that although the starting hands are straight forward (A2 anything basically) how to adjust your play to the board is key to the game and this variable is hard to cover in a commercially readible/viable book. (I.e. what to do v the 1000s of hand permutations).  Alas that's the problem here there is nothing new that I have read that is not already covered in Zee's work. In fact Zee's book contains more advanced plays and a much more comprehensive hand selection, and has a superb Q&A format at the end of each chapter. You also get the balance of the book on Stud Hilo for "free". There are some sparse chapters on the internet and psychological aspects in this new publication which are more adequately covered in basic Holdem texts, thats the only "new" info I am seeing compared to the older O8 books. Overall its a very good basic book for your 1st O8 book but you still need to buy the book by Zee. If you can afford both and have the time to read this book then also buy this one as it will become the standard entry level book, if you can only afford one then you have to buy the Zee book or miss out key concepts. Overall I see very little new material, the book is very nicley put together and very readable however it still does not cover as much material as the older Zee work. Since writing this review Super system II is out with a chapter by Bobby Baldwin, I now believe that to be the best 1st introduction to O8 for beginning players and it's only 60 pages long so easy and quick to read. The Zee book is essential reading and that relegates this book even further. However for experienced O8 players the short 2 pages in this book on short handed play (6 players or less) is essential reading and is probably the best available material on the subject. 
 I think biggie was one of the best in the hip hop world which is why i cant stomach this.The production is amateur throughout,the guest rappers and singers bring nothing to the table and the subject matter is non evident from track 1 to 24.To top it off they have lifted biggies lyrics from his old tracks and then stuck them on this,and then they have the nerve to print a sticker on the front of the cd claiming it has all new tracks.I have never felt so ripped off buying a cd in my life,this is a disgusting insult to a hip hop legend 
 I guess I'm one of the minority who don't care for this series and set of characters. This was my first 'In Death' book and will be my last. Although nearly all of the characters were unengaging and not likeable, the heroine, Eve Dallas, was right at the top of the list: harsh, nasty, vulgar and very off-putting. And what, oh WHAT is the deal with that amazingly stupid character name Nixie Swisher??! Please 
 This is just a warning that the book is written in the present tense. Personally I couldn't read it, I just wanted to correct everything I read.   It's a shame, I guess Stephenson was trying to be creative but that's not the way to do it 
 This book encourages graduate students to explore options beyond academia and appears to be overly biased in the direction of industry. This book strongly cautions against the assistant professor position. The arguement is that the fight for tenure can be circumvented by gaining experience in industry and then coming over as an associate professor. It makes one feel incredibly naive for pursuing a direct route to academy.  I don't believe the decision is as clear-cut as it is made out in this book. I have worked in industry and academia and many of the concerns outlined in the book occur in both places. Office politics, fighting your way up the totum pole, and the scramble for funding are facets of both types of jobs. I would take Fiebelman's advice with a grain of salt 
 Hi, I bought this DVD, hoping that there would be some practical explanation of buddhist principles given by the Dalai Lama. However, it is a documentary (and it is a good documentary) about buddhism in general. The point that annoys me about this product is that "Dalai Lama" is written all over it, yet he only makes a short appearance in the 300 minutes of film 
 This book is tripe.  I was forced to read it for a college class, and am disappointed by the lack of substance in the book.  While it  claims to be about tributes to fallen soldiers in Vietnam, it spends a substantial portion of the time discussing battle monuments of the Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, along with an extended discussion of the dedication of the Gettysburg battlegrounds.  It looks too far into many of the objects left, such as the bike tube and nursing pads.  Frankly, I'm ashamed to be associated with the same instution as this woman.  Don't read it if you don't have to 
 The plot of this book was interesting, and it could have been a good book. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The main problem for me was that the hero is dispicable, and the heroine has absolutely no self esteem! Even many of the the secondary characters are weak, miserable people!  The story starts when the hero finds himself drawn to the heroine even though he considers her a "dirty little nobody". Once she gets a makeover and is actually beautiful, he begins pressuring her to become his mistress even though she is an innocent marriageable female by regency standards. Because she is the daughter of a "cit", he can't imagine why she has any reservations about the deal. He says charming things to her like "how much do you think your virginity is worth anyway". Now that's romance!   Meanwhile, even though she is unbelievably insulted by the hero many times, she finds herself drawn to him too. For me their relationship was sort of like an abuser and his victim. She never stood up for herself, and you felt sorry for her.  Of course the plot twist involves a mystery about her parentage... only its not really a mystery because almost everyone knows the hero is a Dukes granddaughter, including her. In fact just about the only one who doesn't know is the hero, which provides the dilemma. He would of course be willing to marry her if only he knew she really wasn't a nobody!  Will anyone tell him? Will he wise up and offer to marry her even though she isn't good enough for him? Will she give in to her desires and become his mistress since he doesn't think she is good enough for him to marry? Of course it all works out, and he actually proposes to before he finds out she actually is good enough for him. Ugh!!!  This could have been a good book if the "mystery" had been handled better, and the characters were written differently. As is, it is a sad regency tale 
 It should be noted by any who would be willing to buy a DVD like this that George Alexander has no affiliation with Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu (the the fighting style of Miyamoto Musashi). I honestly cannot challenge the effectiveness of anything Alexander attempts to teach the viewer of this DVD, but I can challenge it's authenticity in regards to being the fighting style of Miyamoto Musashi 
 Leafing through every page of this famous book, I found it utterly useless for anyone who's vegetarian. Four of the meatless recipes were useful, though not particularly appealing in terms of taste. 
 This book had all the hallmarks of a diet memoir: it was self-indulgent, solipsistic, whiny and asinine. After reading it I ate a pint of Haagen Dazs Vanilla and decided that I blame nobody but myself. It was liberating. I am so sick of people who sit around name-dropping and blame everybody--their mother, their sister, their friends--for their fat butts. The worst part of this book was that it wasn't even well-written! Courtney should quit her day job. 
 "...Allosaurus liked to hunt,and when it caught its quarry,it tore it open,back and front,and never said," I'm sorry!" Allosaurus liked to eat,and using teeth and talons,it stuffed itself with tons of meat,and  guzzled blood by gallons." If you think your child does not see enough  violence on TV then you should buy this book 
 Everything is this movie seems out of place. The old cliche "good cop-bad cop", lived by Sutherland and his pal doesn't work at all!  Dridget is in an awkward performance, totally unconvincing, unreal, flat.  ANyway, it serves to study how a movie with so good cast can be a  tremendous waste of time. 
 Another disappointing Stephen King miniseries.  For some reason, lately I've been rewatching some of the older Stephen King miniseries that I hadn't seen since they originally aired.  Maybe I thought they'd be better without all the commercials to drag them on and on.  The cream of the crop is THE STAND.  The dregs is THE LANGOLIERS, with the worst special effects ever...Ed Wood would have been proud.  TOMMYKNOCKERS falls somewhere between.  Basically it tells the story of how one lady (Marg Helgenberger) stumbles across a mysterious little object in the woods, and is compelled to unearth it.  Turns out its some sort of alien craft with the power to exert its "will" on the people of the little Maine town nearby.  These people undergo gradual (or not so gradual) personality changes which allows them to "suddenly" invent impossible machines, read each others minds, and also to gleefully kill anyone who seeks to thwart them.  That's all well and good.  Sounds like it could be good, clean, gory fun.  Certainly, the book it's based on was.  I know that King himself is not terribly fond of the book, mostly because he wrote it during the height of his drug and alcohol additions...but it contained some of his most disturbing scenes too, and a believable, ultimately heartbreaking romance between the two leads.  I have always liked it myself.  (To me, King's nadir was THE DARK HALF.)  Back to the "movie."  Jimmy Smits plays Helgenberger's boyfriend, a formerly successful poet now awash in alcoholism...but trying to climb out of his hole.  He's immune to the power of The Tommyknockers because of a steel plate in his head, but goes along for the ride for much of the story because of the guilt he feels over his own behavior.  Eventually, things get bad enough that he finally musters up the courage to take matters into his own hands...with rather serious consequences for himself.    But the story is told in a plodding manner.  For every compelling scene (for example, early on Smits is at a reception where he's been drinking too much, and has a gloriously over-the-top embarrassing moment) there's two clunkers (Cliff De Young and Traci Lords as two postal employees undergoing some serious hanky-panky in the sorting room!!)  Helgenberger and Smits are fine, as are Joanna Cassidy as the local sheriff and E.G. Marshall as a kindly curmudgeon.    But the lengthy novel has been condensed so awkwardly, and the subplot with DeYoung and Lords given FAR, FAR too much time on screen (De Young is one of the worst actors EVER to get more than one role) to keep make even the gamest performances worthwhile.  I guess the producers were so tickled to have former porn star Lords on their set, they just couldn't help coming up with more ridiculous things for her to do.  Also, we are forced to see how far Robert Carradine (so good as the "head nerd" in REVENGE OF THE NERDS all those years ago) has fallen...he turns in a perfectly dreadful performance.  The special effects and makeup are quite cheesy.  But many things could have been forgiven had a decent adaptation been managed.  But THE TOMMYKNOCKERS was doomed from the start with a pitiful script, not helped by uninspired direction.  If you're a big fan of Smits, Cassidy or Helgenberger, I guess you might want to take a gander.  If you're a fan of Stephen King or horror/sci-fi...stay away! 
 I heard "You're the One" one morning on my local radio station and just HAD to find out who the artist was.  Their online "last song played" service was down, so I came to Amazon.com to see if I could track it down, and low and behold I found Across the Winterline.  I immediately clicked on One Click Ordering and awaited it's arrival.  What a TOTAL disappointment.  "You're the One" is a wonderful piece of music.  There is no doubt that Jack Williams is a remarkably talented guitarist and vocalist.  I love his melodies, especially when he sticks close to his talent for no holds barred blues.  He has a great voice, gravelly, resonant and warm.  BUT . . .  With the exception of "Your the One" and maybe one or two other songs that escape me at the moment, his lyrics are just terrible.  Not just terrible, irritating, anoying doggerel.  They are full of some of the worst forced rhymes, trite cliches and cheap sentimental bromides I've ever heard.  Some of these lyrics are so bad they are painful to listen to.  If you can afford it, buy this CD and add "Your the One" to the blues list on your IPod, RealPlayer folder, or include it in a compilation CD you burn, and then throw this one away.  That's what I did.  Otherwise, just pass 
 This movie is basically about 12 yr. old boys crying with each other.  When does that ever happen?  The dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids.  What 12 yr. old worries about "..never getting out of this small town."?   I guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends, then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense.  I have a feeling Oprah would like this movie.  
 The remote worked only for 2 days. My daughter loves the look of it so I am not able to dispose it off. Its a total waste of money. I wish I had read the reviews before buying it since lot of people seem to have the same problem with the remote. 
 Author is extremely creative photographer, and book is well written.  Great for the amateur photographer who wants more from their photos 
 Once again a new knitting book comes out and once again the publisher doesn't let us see what's inside.  Who buys knitting books without at least flipping through the pages to see what the projects look like?  I buy about 10 knitting books per year, many of them on Amazon.  Alot of things inform me about which books to buy -- past books of the designer or editor that I liked, projects, etc.  But the single most important thing that drives my spending is being able to see a sample of pictures of the projects contained in the book.  Why are so few knitting book publishers willing to show us what is inside their books on Amazon?    "One Skein Wonders" is another book that does NOT offer the potential buyer a view of what is inside?  I don't expect to see the patterns, but I do expect to see pictures of (at least some of) the projects.     Anne Lindenfel 
 Must say, the cd dubbed 'Paris' would have fitted a title 'Calcutta' As for the 'New York' cd, well, that's more like a disco run. Seems as if BUDDHA BAR series has lost it's sophistication. What ever happened to the different cultural feels world wide? Non-the-less, I can't say I dislike the two cds, it's just not BUDDHA BAR anymore. GEORGE V RECORDS GET BACK ON TRACK! 
 This book is simply horrible. Repetitive dialogue and situations. Characters that just make you groan and roll your eyes.   I've read two by this author and she's just awful. Both books used the same lines over and over again. The stories chased their tails in circles half the time. Dull, repetitive and annoying.  
 For those of you who want to buy this book and you think by intimacy, the title is alluding to sex, you're wrong it's not. Very few things, like 2 or 3 can be found in this book about the church's view on marital sex. Those 2 or 3 things couldn't be farther apart from each other or more vague. If you really want to know what the church thinks and you can't wait until right before you get married, ask a couple who was married in the temple or some one who has received instruction about such matters from a bishop or someone like that 
 The ideas are trite, the prose is pre-sophomoric, and the little introductions by the author that precede each story are nauseatingly self-centered. One of them (preceding "Shadow of the Mothaship") says: "The way I write stories is really stupid [...]". Hear, hear! I can't imagine why Bruce Sterling endorsed this puerile effluvium 
 I should have listen to the reviewer who said it smelled like "Lemon Pledge"...it really has a chemical smell and not pleasant at all.  I'm going to use it at the office to spray down the supply room 
 This book was, in a word, awful.  For starters, it is very poorly written.  There is no discernable organization, and typos and poor grammar can be found throughout the piece.  Perhaps I could forgive these problems if the book offered some substance, but here too it disappoints.  The analysis in the book (if you can call it that) is superficial at best.  The lack of research is palpable.  After reading it, one gets the feeling that the author through this book together overnight.  It's a mess 
 Being good in office politics, I often read new books on this subject. I've learnt that the best way to get people on one's side is to be honest, sincere an open to others. This woman teaches about being manipulative, playing status games, being rude and calls it "good political skills". It's hardly believable 
 Please see my review of the Martex Egyptian Washcloths, Burgundy 
 This book was easy enough to read, it just wasn't what I expected from Quindlen.  I usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating, in this book I really did not find either of those traits to stand out.  The back-and-forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing, and sometimes I was in the middle of a paragraph before I realized this paragraph was a jump to the past, whereas the previous paragraph was present time.  Although I got used to that writing style, I always found it annoying.  The storyline itself never sold me either: a typical, young "sew-your-wild-oats" boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the "perfect" father. I just did not find such an occurrence likely.  And, as a mother myself, all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm. Anyway the whole story seemed far-fetched and disjointed to me, and a disappointment especially since I have been a Quindlen fan for many, many years 
 This book is now five years old. It has no information on any Palm device likely to still be out there. A waste of money. 
 I had to read this book for a class in Legal Ethics given by Professor Dershowitz (Dersh) at Harvard Law School. I threw it in the trash when I was done, and for good reason. The topic is interesting, but tired. How do you defend a guilty man? You don't. Unfortunately, Dersh (and, to be fair, many others also) does. The focus of the book is on the ostensibly proper division of a defense attorney between two personas: that of a person and that of an attorney. Dersh feels that a defense attorney leaves behind his personal ethical standards and morals when he takes a case and goes to the edge of the envelope in legal ethics to successfully defend his client. I don't think such a person has a personal morality. If it can be subjected to a second persona, it isn't morality. The worst part of the book is its writing. It is poorly written, poorly developed, and has a completely unbelievable "happy" ending. Dersh had to cater to his feminist viewpoints in the ending and that's unfortunate because it denies his central character (himself) the pain of truly feeling the results of his own amorality 
 I've seen a number of books that make all sorts of preposterous claims in order to promote some arbitrary agenda. However, this silly and absurd book doesn't even do that.  It has nothing to offer anyone.  I didn't have any preconceived demands on this book.  I didn't need it to say something like:  ... We Women hold up our half of the sky.  And more.  But in monotheistic society, we've been doing two thirds of the work.  And having only one third of the fun.  Moreover, this unnatural, patriarchal monotheism has made tyrannical religious demands upon us.  That's not how we lived in the past.  We can and should return to Paganism and a more natural and cooperative society which cherishes and values everyone. ...  Of course, had it said that and defended it with a modicum of clarity, I'd have applauded it and given it five stars.  But suppose it had merely looked at the overall problem of the role of Women in human society.  Something like:  ... There are differences between the roles of Women and Men.  The Women bear the children.  The Women nurse the children.  While both Women and Men have a big role in raising children, these roles are not exactly the same.  In addition, the Men are generally stronger than the Women.  One major societal problem is that Women tend to work harder to help their own children than they do to help the children of others.  And Men tend to work harder to help their children than they do to help the children of others.  But Women generally know which children are theirs while Men aren't always so sure.  Here's how some societies have dealt with these issues, and how a few societies, including our own, have gone astray.  And here is how we can make things better.  ...  Well, that would have been okay too.  And it would have been heading for five stars as well.  But this book didn't do anything of the sort.  Instead, it simply wandered all over the map.  There were plenty of factually dubious statements and poor logic that obliterated any possible flow of argument.  And there never seemed to be a point to it: almost nothing in the book seemed relevant to any possible thesis.  It was frustrating.  I doubt that I have ever read a less coherent book.  If you must read "The Chalice and the Blade," try the one by Glenna McReynolds 
 I have been very disappointed in this 5th Cape Light Novel. It is slow and boring. I am usually a VERY fast reader but it has taken me 4 weeks and I am still not finished with this one! I loved the first 4 books in this series but I think it is time  to finish the series and be done with it. James is not a very interesting character and NOT hero material. While I have been wondering at Leigh's past, there hasn't been enough mystery to capture my attention for very long. Emily and Dan's marriage plans are boring also. About the only interesting thing that has happened yet is Jessica and Sam's child issues. I have found myself skipping parts and that says a lot for this book. Overall, the first 4 books in this series deserve 5 stars and this one....well...you should quit while you're ahead. 
 While I liked parts of this book very much, it needed editing.  The sequence near the end in Venice was pure agony and I came ever so close to giving up.  However, having read so many pages it seemed a shame not to finish the book.  While the last few chapters helped to redeem the book, all in all the book disappointed, including the apparent tee off for a second volume.  Assuming there is a sequel, I'm not likely to purchase it 
 The main character in this tedious book was the Thames. The people were flat, the plot tedious, the characterization meaningless, and the theme basically a repudiation of anti-semitism. Even the Chief Inspector, a character in other books whom I had come to care about, was almost non-existant. The book was apparently written to display the author's writing ability, not to tell a tale. Descriptions of rooms and dresses and weather and looks became tedious to the Nth degree. The book is more of a poorly written travel manual than a realistic mystery. Having read at least 70% of Ms. James' books, I found this one the final nail on the coffin for me. No more. Yes, I have been to London on extended holiday more than once and love the magnificence of the Old City, the New London, and the Thames. But this is not a book I can recommend. Don't waste your money. If you must read this one, borrow it from someone else or the public library. I am through with P. D. James. The writing  here reached a peak in this book of being overinflated and full of herself 
 First off, i have to say, that I don't think this is a horrible cd and I don't think that this is a horrible band. There's no denying that Doyle and Jerry Only were key components of the Danzig-era Misfits; yet, for this band to call themselves the Misfits, and even worse, have fans applaud them and their releases, is insane. once again, i don't think this band sucks, far from it, but without Danzig it's not the Misfits but rather a second, no, third rate version of the Misfits trudging along and trying to recap what the band once was. Without the Key ingredient, the primary creative force of the orignial band, this is nothing more than a disgrace to the Misfits name. Face it folks, it's like trying to bake a cake without flour... 
 It's tempting to spoil the end of this novel in order to describe how BAD it truly is, but Ms. Grafton has somehow earned a following, and as I've said before, there is something for everyone out there. After all, some people (not a majority) actually voted for George W. Bush, on purpose! I think this level of mystery fluff is for them.  Rather than spoil the nutty climax (I have worked in hospitals for years, so I ain't buying it) I will mention that the second paragraph of this schlock novel closes with the words: "...life is one big, savage joke; not funny ha-ha, but cruel like those gags sixth graders have been telling since the world began."  I became so distracted thinking about people who were already in sixth grade when the world began (where did they go to kindergarten?) that I almost missed the rest of the chapter 
 I'd been hearing about the wonderful writing of John Le Carre for quite some time, so I picked up The Constant Gardener for a fun read . . . and it was anything but.  And while I don't know if this is typical of the LeCarre spy novels, I certainly hope not.  The plot is basically a single man versus international conspiracy.  It's a plot that would normally catch my attention early and have my sympathy from the start. Further, it's a commentary on the abuses of power wrought by corporations (in this case, Pharmaceutical) that are more powerful than governments.  Again, a device that immediately evokes common interests with me, an unabashed liberal.  Unfortunately that's where the book and I part ways.  Justin, the minor diplomat in Nairobi is thrown into an unfortunate series of discoveries when questioning the circumstances of his wife's rape and murder.  Tessa differed from Justin in that she was engaged in pursuing change in the world as a human rights activist, while he was content to follow orders, but say and believe the right things sans effort.  This, I believe is the theme of the work, that culpability lies mostly with inaction and that movements can overcome abuses of power.  Good theme, but . . .  The execution was poor.  Pages and pages devoted to characterization fell short when actions didn't meet the set-up.  As well, Justin's investigation took him around the world to look at a paper trail, not the most interesting tools of the thriller game.  But we, as well as the character, examined the words and trail meticulously to the point where it became a joke how quickly the volume would put me to sleep.  Justin is such a luddite that we, as the reader, are forced to learn about computers, emails, and the myriad electronic communication pathways along with the protagonist . . . LeCarre would have been well-suited to find a heartless editor, because the plot that does exist is not much more substantial than what a novella would handle nicely.  Bureaucracy can be handled in a paragraph where the author wants the reader as frustrated as his bureaucrat protagonist, an interesting irony done uninterestingly.  This isn't to say that LeCarre is a poor writer - his sentence construction is strong and his mastery of the craft evident.  I'm going to try another of his novels just because I believe this was an aberration caused by an author with an axe to grind and no right way to do it.  Another problem was that he telegraphed the plot.  The only one stupid enough not to see who was behind the murder and conspiracy was Justin himself.  While this can work, showing the reader what the protagonist can't see (see Fight Club), in this case it's just painful to have to slough through the machinations of bumbling intrigue with a dull and plodding man.   In summary, I didn't care about characters and I lost interest in the plot and the theme seemed contrived.  I can't recommend it.  - CV Ric 
 Even though it was fun to read, I give it one star lest the brainwashed academics out their suffer further undue influence.  This book has been highly misrepresented by evolutionists for decades.  One reviewer made this point but failed to back it up with any facts.  That reviewer failed to point out that it was in the "Descent of Man," not "Origin of the Species" where Darwin first presents man as having descended from apes.  Evolutionists apply natural selection to explain all biological development.  It's the worse case of reductionism in history.  James D. Watson and Edward Wilson were on the Charlie Rose show talking about this book.  They described natural selection as the single great development in science since Newton.  They claimed to describe this book as great English literature yet they badly misrepresented it as teaching that natural selection applies to everything biological.  How could these allegedly great scientists be so unscientific?  Scientists aren't supposed to be cavalier in their judgment.  Scientists are supposed to be conservative in their judgment.   First of all, let's quote Darwin himself from this book, page 75:  "To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree."  There you have it, from Darwin himself, from his famous book.  Yet, today, textbooks that claim a lineage to Darwin, depict evolutionary trees of everything biological sprouting from natural selection.  Evolutionists like Robert H Hurlbutt, oppose William Paley's design argument because it makes God, not natural selection, the origin of design in the human eye.  See Hurlbutt's book, page 173, "Hume, Newton and the Design Argument."  Watson and Wilson also attacked the human eye argument in an ad hominem way without producing any argument.  But, while Hurlbutt is a typical product of academic brainwashing, which passes for education these days, how could two Nobel Prize winners of science, Watson and Wilson, make such a foolish mistake?  First of all, Watson and Wilson are crooks.  Their Nobel Prize fame for unlocking the secrets of the structure of DNA was illfounded.  Rosalind Franklin of King's college is well known to have discovered the structure of DNA and her supervisor Wilson passed it on to Watson and Crick, who, along with Wilson, took credit for it.  A little research by the Nobel Prize committee would have discovered this.  I guess the Nobel Prize really isn't worth anything when you consider how sloppy they are in giving their awards.  Einstein was given a Nobel Prize even though his papers on Brownian movement are a plagarization of Josiah Willard Gibb's book "Statistical Mechanics."  Concluding unscientific postscript: Could Darwin's "Descent of Man" have psychological origin in the fact that Darwin himself looked like a monkey 
 Just a reminder that this guy cheated on his wife around the same time Clinton was being pounded for his indiscretions.   Sean Hannity, early in his book "Let Freedom Ring" reminded us of how Bill Clinton tainted the office of the presidency and then not two paragraphs later noted how Morris was a good friend of his (Hannity's) and then led into negative opinions on Morris of Clinton.  Didn't bother to mention anything about Morris doing the exact same thing- and this little worm woulda lied with his palm on the Ark of the Covenant so don't give me (...) about the lame@ss lying under oath Republican punk.  (...) hyprocrite!   
 Some journalists write excellent history.  Others produce mediocre but acceptable historical books.  But some are simply awful, like Thomas Laird, who tried hard to write something profound but failed.  Having seen the substantive criticism from experts, one could hardly believe the bad reviews were true, but they didn't reveal just how badly this is done.  Besides the multitude of factual errors, it's stylistically annoying--as if Laird were trying to write a screenplay for Oliver Stone, another propagandist with an agenda who cares little for facts if they get in the way of the story he wants to tell.  
 I enjoyed the tour through literature and philosophy and felt the author did a good job of outlining the nature of the problem.  Like other reviewers I was disappointed with the emphasis on Christianity in the end- with graphics of the tortures of hell and commentary about death being the greater leveler.  Until I got to that section I sustained the belief that Alain de Botton was writing with some neutrality.  His emphasis on Christianity, while ignoring other world faiths and spiritual beliefs have to offer, admits bias and disappoints greatly as the book comes to a close.  Certainly Buddhism, for example, would have much to say about status anxiety as well?  The first part of the book is much more rewarding to read.  By the end of the book when the author starts biasing his comments within an unexpected Christian framework, shattering my belief I was reading a neutral book with intellectual integrity, I was truly sorry I had recommended it to a friend 
 The bad news about these 300 thread count sheets is that the threads must be so thin as to qualify for supermodel status.  This causes the fabric to be so thin, you can just about see your hand through it.  Also, out of the dryer they are quite wrinkled.  The good news is that the red border color that I chose did not bleed in the washer.  Further, they did not shrink at all.  I don't know how they feel to sleep on, as they are for a guest bed, for occasional use only.  Just by the way they look, if I were to use them daily I would have returned them 
 Aerosmith were one of the worst most annoying bands of all time. They only made 3 decent songs in Same old song and Dance, Seasons of wither, and Janies got a gun. Rest of the songs just stink explosively. Avoid most albums from this hugely overrated band, steven tyler screams, he can't sing at all??? this is music for drug addicts 
 Bigoted and racist title for a book about talented blacks, their deserving of a more honorable title since they were called these racist nicknames all their lives and had to be these stereotypes to show their talent, but he can get away with naming a book as he has this one because he's Black, I'm sure if a white did the same, the NAACP will jump on him. Bogle suppose to lift Blacks up not put them down.  Here's a long but informative review! Naturally since Bogle is the only one writing about early Black film stars people believe everything he says. He plays it safe by always talking about the same ole' stars that he talked about in his last books. Never does he introduce the public to unsung talents we never heard of. He spends most of the time talking about how mulatto, how light or how dark such and such is and how such and such couldn't do this or that because of this or that. When whites write on their stars they don't write about how blonde, how brunette or how red head someone was and how Irish or Italian one looked. Which proves how stuck on skin color Blacks really are! Why do Blacks feel they always have to spend time talking about race instead of giving these stars their recognition and due, forgetting how they look and telling of their life and versatile careers, who they really were, where they come from, making one reading feel like they knew the person all their lives, make one feel the happiness and sadness. Bogle spends more time on what they didn't do then what they did do. Which is sad, the public is missing out on a lot. So again, do for yourself the research and don't' depend on others all the time.  Bogle loves talking about how white Fredi Washington looked instead of writing about her extensive, incredible career, she done more in her life then most of us could dream about it, she didn't let others prejudices hold her back. She was no tragic mulatto, another stupid name, minus well call Stepin Fetchit a tragic ni**er which he wasn't, he was the first black millionaire and no more of a stereotype then Black pimps, gangsters of today who are getting rich off of it like Step got rich off of his stereotype. Fredi will be the first to say she had a great life and career. She wasn't sad or confused but a strong black woman. Bogle is no better than a white writer who puts down a black but thinks its okay to coin a book Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies and Bucks because he's black, I'm sure if a white titled a book that we be yelling racism, don't Black talents deserve a better title?   Bogle also plays it safe by always talking about Lena Horne and Dorothy Dandridge, never telling the stories and never giving recognition to other black actresses like Nina Mae McKinney, Mildred Washington, Theresa Harris, Fredi Washington, Edna Mae Harris, Florence O'Brien, Louise Franklin, Daisy Bufford, Jeni LeGon Evelyn Preer, Suzette Harbin, Hilda Simms, Francine Everett, Shirley Haven and countless of others who had a chance to display their talents on the screen in Hollywood and helped fight discrimination and  help in the enhancement and betterment of blacks on screen but he gives all the credit to Horne and Dandridge, who didn't do as much as others if you want to get down to the truth, but I'm glad he don't talk about them in a way because he'll butcher up their life stories, I'll give them their due though. Many aren't remembered because maybe they didn't do as much, who cares about who has done more, were suppose to be remembering them for accomplishments and talents, right? White film historians sure remember all their stars, little or big. Someone like Louise Brooks, considered a early Hollywood icon is highly regarded as a great actress despite she only had a few good films and wasnt a big movie star. The woman is more remembered for one good film and a bobbed hairstyle but white historians will make sure you know her, her achievements and what she DID DO for the film industry.  Why can't Bogle be like that instead of criticizing everyone and judging them by white people's standards of what success and beauty is? I guess it's true that you gotta work twice as hard as whites to be someone in this world, whites can be remembered for little things, few successes, Blacks gotta have many successes to get rememberance and recognition even for other Blacks to remember them. Bogle is one of the few black film historians, you would think he would write more positively of blacks in Hollywood but he treats many worse then whites treated them when they were alive. Bogle never mentions Willie Covan and Marie Bryant (and appeared in movies also and was a good friend of Lena Horne's too) who choreograhed many white stars, they were behind the scenes but contributed to Hollywood. He suppose to be giving credit not taking away. Either Bogle is too lazy or likes to show favoritism because he sure won't tell other unsung talents stories. If he does he clutter it up with talking about their looks especially if he doesn't know how to write about them. Bogle knows nothing about the great career of Nina Mae McKinney, the first movie star of Hollywood and Europe, who done more films then any other black actress of her time, the first to appear on many magazines, she had so many achievements, yet he gives her one little page, if you don't know about a person, I rather you not write about them at all then to write lies. He never talks about the Black Cinema independent movie stars or the industry who was apart of American cinema, I guess their too hard for him to research, so he takes the easy path in writing about stars he already wrote about a million times. He never writes about Ethel Moses, Francine Everett, Dorothy Van Engle, Edna Mae Harris, Margaret Whitten, Tomiwitta Moore, Bee Freeman, Lorenzo Tucker, Monte Hawley, Ralph Cooper (created the first black studio in Hollywood), Oscar Micheaux, Spencer Williams and countless other black movie stars who appeared in films for blacks made by blacks in the 30's and 40's, I guess that's too mediocre for him but they done more for the enhancement of Blacks in movies by creating their own images, own roles, own portrayals, playing people from all walks of life unlike ones in Hollywood who were stuck playing the same types of roles and being the same images he always complaining about well I feel give due to ones who at least tried to do for themselves and become what they wanted but see they weren't cross-overs so their looked at as non-important by some which kind of dictated by whites who we should remembered and who's important. It's hard researching Black Cinema stars but boy it's worth it plus studying them, watching them perform gives you a good idea of who they were even if you can't find info on them. I still find the time to give them due and I'm no professional or anything but Bogle is a high class guy who only likes to write about Hollywood and his favorite gals Horne and Dandridge.   Ive done more research on unsung, forgotten stars then he has and it has been pleasurable teaching others on the net about blacks who contributed to stage and screen, stars who were just as important as Dandridge and Horne. I'm glad there are other people who are taking it upon themselves to tell the true stories of many unsung black legends and don't write in the same fashion as Bogle. Anyone who is hung up on skin color and don't want to think outside the box and like to hear the same stories then Bogle is for you but someone like me who researched many early black stars of stage and screen on my own and found out the real deal, found how they really were, found how they were really looked at, and found the true stories wouldn't appreciate Bogle's work much. I've talked with some legendary Blacks of the early years, some of their relatives also and they gave a completely different view then how Bogle describes them which shows he just goes by hearsay and documents and don't do accurate interviewing and researching.  I would think Bogle would spend more time on talking about the beauty of  black women from dark to light and  their wonderful achievements to the world.  Black women are quite unique but instead Bogle tells the  story of black women from white people's perspective it seems, he tells how black women were looked at from whites perspective not from a true black person's perspective that has pride for his race, maybe Bogle has a white person's way of thinking who is partial. Because I would commend these women, embrace and make the world embrace their beauty, courage, and talents; their many gifts to the world isn't as nearly written about as their skin tones are. He loves spending time writing about how light, dark or mulatto someone looks. Again, he makes it seem like such and such suffered because she was mulatto, light or dark, come on man, if she had a tragic life it was her own fault if she suffered. He makes it seem like color and race was the problem for everything which is false, actually many of these women profited from the race sometimes and plus women in general face discrimination, no matter what race or color. Don't you think these women went through enough being judged by skin tone or looks, they wished in their life for being to judge their talent, at least give them that now, Bogle doesn't. Who isn't discriminated against in this world? Bogle makes it look like Black is a curse when these female performers change the world and introduce the world to their greatness and the greatness of the race. He loves talking about whether someone should of passed for white or not like when he's talking about the great Fredi Washington. He misses out on showcasing  other great talents like Valaida Snow, Blanche Calloway, Una Mae Carlisle, Eunice Wilson, Adelaide  Hall and  others but that's okay because they have  been written  beautifully about by other writers. Well, many are dead so they cant stick up for themselves and Bogle takes advantage of that, he hasn't even interviewed or actually talked to ones who he writes about, he just goes by hearsay. Have your favorites but when you write a book, you can't show favoritism which he does all through which hurts others who has a story to tell but he only give honor to his faves. It seems no black can make him happy, he always has something to criticize. In his words every Black woman is a tragic, confused mulatto and every black man is a coon, or some other stereotype, he wouldn't say that to the young black guys or gals in entertainment today though, he takes advantage of the dead who can't stick  up for themselves.  There is a website on unsung black talents of stage and screen, you all will enjoy. http://www.angelfire.com/jazz/ninamaemckinney/ 
 The author never does address what skill level is necessary to fully appreciate this book. From my reading it should be clarified at the beginning that this book is not for beginners. Being new to ASP I found this book very frustrating to follow. It wasn't until page 51 did the author decide to inform the reader exactly how to 'run' scripts in Windows. From cover to cover I felt the book was organized poorly. However, if I was a more experienced programmer I think that I would better understand the book's layout and be able to 'fish' through this convoluted book 
 I was one of the Ambivalents when it came to Auster and his NYC-branded mysteriso until I picked up this insipid and downright egotistical meta-blah novel. Maybe I was supposed to despise the writer-slash-narrator lost in the rabbit hole of who's-the-real-puppet-anyway as Leviathan unfolds? Obnoxious as it may seem (and is); Leviathan is about a writer writing Leviathan about a writer who already wrote Leviathan. And just to make things interesting the "writer" smells faintly of (who else) Paul Auster who is (of course) writing the novel. Yippie.  Being a fan of Lydia Davis, I didn't exactly appreciate the treatment of her "character" nor did I like the sparkly little sex-studded attempts Auster makes at describing (oh, come on... I'll just say INVENTING) his own psychological and personal growth. Oh, but if ONLY Auster DID grow as a writer. THEN, I'd be interested.  But in reality, Paul Auster can do little more than write (more poorly) the same novel he began writing all those years ago. The same writer-ordained set of chance occurrences spun into a meta-noir plot make Leviathan a tired, if not utterly despicable novel. Why do I say despicable? Because I'm sure Auster can do better. I feel his intelligence throbbing underneath the muscular ego-laden re-hash of fantasies he should have let go when he was 16 years old.   Leviathan reveals what I don't want to know about yee urban readers: a book on the subway is worth twice its weight in cocktail party conversation. Come on everybody! Let's all go theorize about the "real" Paul Auster! Have a gin tonic and watch yourself on the fire escape.  
 this is an amazing book. buy it right now. however, i would not recommend the paperback edition. it is binded with very inferior glue; two days after i recieved it, the cover had fallen off, and as i read it (quite quickly i might add, as i could not put it down) the pages were literally falling out one by one. i'm not sure if anyone else has had this problem with the paperback, but i can assure you that you're going to want to have this book for a while, so just buy the hardcover 
 An important test of any theory is how much evidence exists for its case.  In this book, Doherty proposes that Christianity began with a celestial Christ who was thought to be crucified in a celestial realm above the earth, and that Paul's letters as they currently stand speak only of a non-terrestrial Christ.  In fact, Doherty makes this claim for all the New Testament epistles, which are thus presented as direct evidence -- people describing their own belief and thus directly attesting to the existence of the belief.  One trouble facing Doherty's thesis is that Paul's letters and the other early Christian documents speak of Christ's flesh and blood, and his birth and death; they also provide other indications of a terrestrial savior.  So a large part of Doherty's book consists of arguments to the effect that all these earthly-sounding words really referred to a "spiritual" death in the heavens.  A great deal of work has already been advanced against these arguments, and it does not need to be repeated here, except to say that no single piece of evidence for Doherty's thesis exists which is not ambiguous.  Doherty hardly denies this ambiguity, since it is his own contention that even the most terrestrial-sounding passages in the New Testament can be dismissed as metaphor rather than plain evidence for a historical Christ.  Thus, the main argument of this book is about a lack of evidence, that is to say, an argument from silence.  Doherty claims that the first ancient Christians are silent about an earthly Christ.  Again, much prior work has been done to show that this is far from true.  What I find interesting is that an argument from silence, though difficult to make and not generally favored by historians, can be legitimate, especially if combined with positive evidence.  In this case, if we could not combine it with such evidence we would face new arguments from silence that contradicted Doherty's thesis: Why are the proposed believers in the celestial Christ silent about so many details of their heavenly savior? And why do we not find ancient Christians, Jews, and pagans reporting or reacting to doctrines about a celestial Christ?  In this book, Doherty deals only with the second of these two questions.  He looks for ancient authors who tell us that others either believed in a celestial Christ or doubted the terrestrial Christ.  Since no ancient author tells us clearly about people who doubted that Christ appeared to be a flesh-and-blood man on the earth, Doherty proposes that we can find hints of such a thing.  In Appendix 3 of this book, he quotes a letter by Ignatius of Antioch to the Magnesians, written at the start of the second century, wherein Ignatius hopes that his readers will attain "full assurance in regard to the birth, and passion, and resurrection which took place in the time of the government of Pontius Pilate" (Magnesians 11:3).  This seems to Doherty like a polemic against a celestial Christ.  The principle he is using is a valid one, akin to when mainstream scholars use Paul's assurances about the Resurrection in 1 Corinthians 15 as evidence that doubts about the Resurrection existed.  But in that case, Paul tells us clearly what the doubts were.  Ignatius does not, and it will be worth a little effort here to go into the details.  Ignatius says earlier in his letter that some deny the death of Christ.  Today we call this the Docetic doctrine, which held that Christ merely appeared to be a human being but was actually only a spirit who appeared to die on the cross.  This doctrine is well-attested because so much ancient Christian literature seeks to refute it; and Doherty rightfully regards these refutations as different from the refutation that he is looking for, the proposed polemic against a Christ who did not even appear to walk on the earth.  Yet Ignatius mentions nothing like that.  He alludes to Docetism and to unspecified doctrines denying that Christ was the same as the one true God.  And he refers very specifically to Judaism, just before making his assurance about the birth, death, and resurrection in the time of Pilate's governorship of Judea.  He is telling his readers, in short, to have full assurance about things that both Docetism and Judaism are known to have challenged: the nature of this or any proposed savior's birth; his Passion under the Roman leadership in a Jewish province; and his Resurrection.  Doherty thinks that Ignatius is asking his readers to be "fully persuaded" of the bare facts of these things - the bare fact that they took place - but it hardly seems probable that Ignatius would be content to ask for that.  He is asking his readers to attain "full assurance" about all of the Church's interpretations and teachings concerning these things - to keep from straying into any kind of doctrinal dispute.  So he writes throughout his letter.  The ambiguity of Doherty's evidence prompts him to argue that there is so little clear evidence because orthodox Christianity changed, destroyed or neglected the evidence that was once there.  He uses this argument openly in a chapter claiming that at least some second-century Christians worshipped only God and rejected all savior figures.  Doherty presents the writings of Minucius Felix as a "smoking gun" to that effect, but he allows that the evidence is not as clear as we might want.  He tells us that it is the best evidence that can be expected, because clearer statements would never have "reached us through 2000 years of Christian censorship" (see p. 292).  That is the conspiracy theory.  Considering that Christianity has not wiped away all evidence of doctrines that it regarded as heresies, but instead has offered refutations of every heresy and preserved these refutations as a guide to the true faith, Doherty's claim is hard to believe.  A conspiracy to hide the truth can take place, Christians not excepted; the record of the past can be doctored, and has been.  But Doherty's specific claim is that Christianity's very first doctrines contained a purely celestial Christ, and that these doctrines have not been preserved even as heresy (with Ignatius serving as a brief and ambiguous exception).  Christianity's true origin was wiped away, not with refutation and doctoring, but with silence.  It is hard to believe that Christian institutions and individual writers were silent about what would have been the most radical and provocative of all the heresies -- silent about an idea that, per Doherty's central thesis about how religions work, would have threatened the Church's power to a greater degree than any of the other heresies, some of which were already regarded by Church Fathers as mortally dangerous to the Church.    So Doherty proposes one additional reason to explain the silence: he suggests that the Roman war against Palestine in the year 70 C.E. uprooted or destroyed so many lives that later writers could claim that Christ had lived there in recent decades, without challenges from locals who remembered either the true situation or the beliefs of the sect that worshipped a non-terrestrial Christ (see pages 168 and 179).  Doherty's picture is of a dying sect.  But a fundamental claim of Doherty's idea is the pervasiveness in the entire ancient world of the belief in saviors who descended to celestial regions above the earth and experienced pain or death there.  Had this sort of belief really been ubiquitous throughout the Empire, and applied to Christ as far as the church in Rome (to whom Paul addresses his longest letter), one war in Judea could not have extinguished the belief; and even in Judea it would be likely to reappear. Ignatius himself, per Doherty, is proof that the belief survived the war.  But if Doherty is right, we would expect such a popular doctrine to have flourished after the war.  We'd expect the orthodox sects of the Church proclaiming an earthly savior to produce some refutations.  The Fathers established in Rome, the center of all ideas, would surely have encountered or heard of the celestial Christ, for Doherty does not address how the celestial Christ of Paul's Letter to the Romans was just forgotten -- except by returning to the idea of censorship.  I invite any reader attracted by this book to work out Doherty's scenario and to test it repeatedly against the available information about the time period.  That's an external test.  Then test it against its own premises, repeatedly, for an internal test.  It is a worthy and rewarding challenge 
 I like Metallica first of all. But this was their worst release along with Kill Em All. All the songs on this album are really horrendous. Metallica only made about a few good albums, want to get one???? Get Master of Puppets, Black, and Ride The Lightning. They all have about 3-7 good songs. This album is a waste!!!! Get those albums insted 
 She starts out slowly to explain the transformation from an individual based responsibility society to one that resolve individual responsibility and blames all woes on the vary society that creates the problem.  A hand full of perverts and commies have taken control of our institutions and perverted the institution's purpose. Sounding like she stumbled upon some great secret and is giving the alarm, this book then quickly turns in to some bitch session that moves from one institution to another. It become very repetitive and offers no solution. She should have stopped when she was ahead.  I haven't heard terms like the deserving and undeserving poor since the re-runs of "My Fair Lady" when Alfred P. Doolittle said "I intend to go on being undeserving".   Maybe it is just that a lot of her descriptions of society are of some place far off or unique and have never made it here. However her descriptions of schools do not match the ones I went to or the local ones that kids are going to today. She must have gone to a different Smithsonian than I did and none of the examples of daily life matches any reality that I have come across.  If the book had a solution section it would be "The Capitalist Manifesto" (a revolutionary plan for a Capitalistic distribution of wealth to preserve our free society) by Louis O. Kelso and Mortimer J. Adler.  This book is the "Turner Diaries" without the story line. I rate it up there with the best of conspiracy theories. If you make it through this book with out wondering what her problem is then be sure to read "None Dare call it Conspiracy" at least there is an attempt to put some meat behind it.  However the book does describe a good nightmare if you can find it. 
 I was disappointed by this book.  It held very little new information that I haven't already read in other books.  I ordered it, looked through it reading a few pages in each chapter and then decided to return it.  It's possible that there are redeeming factors but if so, I didn't happen to read those parts 
 How can he be such an enormous talent when all he does is copy off of other people? sorry i just cant see it. I dont think he does justice to Nolan Porter's "If I could only be sure" on the first track at all: If you want to hear some great music listen to the original!!! 
 I don't know what Kluver and Powers were thinking, but it was obvious that they have never even VISITED china, or spent any time around real Chinese people.  If they have been to China, it only shows that they are totally ignorant of the topic at hand.  This book is another in a long line by small minded, western biased, anglo-loving nerds.  In addition to that, there were numerous typos and errors in the book.  Too many to begin to list here, but page 116 contained one of the BIGGEST blunders I have ever seen.  Unless a professor forces you to buy this book, stay far, far away from it, because you can learn more about this topic on MTV than in this book 
 This book hosts an interesting debate on the major issues in public education.  It brings out some very good points, but also uses poor logic and one sided arguments.        For example, the author proposes to debunk the myth that teachers need to be paid more by stating that they only work 7 hours a day, 9 months of the year.  He claims that teachers make an average of   $40,000+ a year and are thus making over $30 an hour.  He claims that accountants and other professionals don't make nearly that, thus implying that teacher should be happy they are getting paid as much as they are for the little they are doing.      The truth is that some teachers who have 15 years seniority and a masters degree can make $40,000, but starting teachers make closer to $28,000.  I also don't know a single teacher who works only seven hours a day five days a week.  If they did it would mean they came to school right when the students did, and left when they did, and did nothing outside of school.  Most teachers arrive well in advance and go home long after the students, often supervising multiple activities, sports, clubs, and other programs for which they may get a couple hundred dollars a year.  So, what is the real hourly wage?  For a teacher who really works from 7:30 to 5:30, plus an hour of prep at home to grade papers, write lessons plans, and prep for the next day, plus time on the weekends to grade more papers a real teacher works closer to 57 hours a week instead of the authors suggested 35.  Also, school is in secession nine months out of the year, but that doesn't mean teachers only work for nine months.  Over the summers they are attending workshops, taking additional college classes to try and jump to the next pay scale so they can take care of their families.  They also come back to school and start working as much as a month before students arrive to set up the next year and revise curriculum.  Many do work part time jobs during the summer, but their hours and pay are limited by the time commitment of the classes they are taking, and by the problems associated with jobs that will let you work for three months (did somebody say McDonalds?)   With these new factors taken in, what is the wage of a college graduate teacher? The hourly wage for a teacher in their first several years is closer to $12 an hour, a far cry from the authors distorted number of $30 which can only be achieved in reality by someone with 30 years experience and a Ph.D.  Unfortunately this lapse in logic is typical of most arguments in the book.      With all the distortions the author does make good points concerning what to do about those teachers who are only putting seven hours in and are getting paid the same.  The book is an interesting read, but check the facts on both sides before you believe all the propaganda from either side of this debate.

 This book has some serious weeknesses: 1. The author seems to be confused about the nature of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, and thus she keeps on mislabeling the energies of these planets. She keeps on pointing out how misunderstood these planets are, and I think that notion applies to her first and foremost. 2. The book attempts to assimilate the occult perspective on outer planets, as it has been done by Alice Bailey, and the author seems to have bought wholesale into the Bailey's theories instead of developing her own understanding based on her own experience. Granted, that is hard to do with Saturn because of lengthy time-span involved into such a study, but the book would be a lot better had she done so. Unfortunately now it has  a ton of hints and poetic allusions to the occult nature of Saturn and its myth, but severely lacks solid psychological perspective. A good book on Saturn, considering the natural Saturn-Moon opposition, would be an in-depth study of emotion and it's affect on how we function and build our lives. The author touches on it, but superficially. She talks about the pain of Saturn, but never explains why it is painful. She also talks about the rewards of Saturn, but doesn't give clues on how to turn Saturn into being rewarding. Where does it stop being painful and becomes rewarding? As a result, you  find a lot of correlations to your life in this book, but absolutely no info on how to transform it. Thus Saturn will remain for you after reading this book what he has always been --"The Devil" and "The Great Malefic", something that will come and hit you on the head during the transit. 3. The writing style is nausating with "pie in the sky" metaphore. Saturn would appreciate a little more matter-of-factness and insight 
 Professor Peters is/was a Harvard professor of business who concentrated on researching and teaching competitiveness. I liked his serious books and text books. He's a really high energy speaker and has a quite lucrative business in coaching. Therefore, I should not be surprised that this little book is full of gimicky fonts, colors, buzz words... and is closely associated to the sales-oriented web site of the same name. Maybe there's good content there, but the presentation screams: motivational, not content-rich. And that's what I think the book is good for 
 I could not put this one down- I finished it in one evening, I just couldn't wait to find out what happened next, with the family and the court case. However, I was deeply disappointed by the ending. It was lame, it was soap opera-esque, it was so unworthy of this great story. Tacked-on and totally unneeded- it should have ended ten pages sooner, that would have be a fine conclusion 
 I have to admit, with great shame, that I didn't realize how bad this was until the sex passages started. There, the book totally reveals itself as another of those Danielle Steele like  easy-reading "romantic" books for housewives. The book is made of extremely intense micro-chapters, all of them contain an essential part of the story, necessary to the book: the skeleton of the history is the boom itself. It is extremely predictable and the characters act childishly like in some kind of bad soap opera. The main issues of this book are supposed to come from long ago but all of them resolve in 5 minutes scenes in extremely stupid conversations 
 I am a big Leslie Nielsen fan. I first saw him in the Naked Gun series, which I thought was awesome, then I saw him again in Wrongfully Accused. I was so enthralled that I acquired Airplane, which seems to be a highly praised movie with him in it.  I had thought he could do no wrong, but he really disappointed me here. What is wrong with this movie? EVERYTHING you will see in here are things you have already seen in other Leslie Nielsen comedy movies. There are times that what will happen becomes so obvious that it's painful rather than funny. For example, the x-ray glasses. My God, when that was mentioned, I just felt nauseous.  The problem with this movie is that it continues the Naked Gun-variety humor, but it does it rather badly. Most of the humor in this movie is sexual-based and that will eventually get boring. Aside from that, this movie lacks a proper plot. All throughout the movie, it doesn't seem like Dick Steele (Nielsen) did anything, but move from one area to another in preparation for a gag. Nielsen's other movies had bad plots too, but at least they were coherent.  I am sorry (mostly to myself for seeing this), but this was just a bad movie. Perhaps the director should go watch the entire Naked Gun series to see how it is done 
    More than a year has passed since I bought and read this book, and while I truly dislike spreading negativity, I feel compelled to warn others tempted to spend their time and money on this depressing memoir. The book is mistitled; the author and her feather of friends are neither 'weird' or 'bohemian'. Re-titling this book 'Ennui: My Self-Absorbed America' would properly describe the story told within.     Honestly - from a woman who cherishes my thousands of books...I could not allow this blot on my shelves, or in good conscience donate it...I threw it away.  
 I also, have had to find my spiritual path. At some point, many women "wake up" and take ownership of their own selves. I did this at age 35.  I chose to become a member of the Baptist (Southern) church because their doctrine was sound. If you read what their beliefs are...it's all found in the Bible. I know women dislike being linked to "EVE" but you either believe the Bible as truth or you don't. There is no middle ground. If any part of the Bible isn't "inspired", then it's all bunk.  So, I say...you're either a Christian (belief in Jesus as the only way to heaven) or you aren't....period. That was easy, huh? Why do we need a book

 Do not buy this cd, the first two reviews said this is a good cd. NOPE. I'll tell ya the real about this cd. I believe this was 305's first cd, and I don't see how this cd was ever in mass production. While It does have a few decent cuts most of this cd belongs to a different artist. 305 got much of the material for this cd on Techmaster P.E.B's masterpiece Bass Computer. Any one who has both cd's can tell. If your looking for bass, you'll find it here. But you can find knock with any bass artist. I give this cd one star for biting Techmaster 
 I have been a huge fan of Dean Koontz for years, ever since my mom got me to read Watchers.  But this story is just way too slow.  Just when I thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride....it would slow way down again.  I almost put it down halfway through the book, but I kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner.  About 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining....but I just felt like something was missing most of the time I was reading.  I just couldn't get into the characters.  I wouldn't recommend this book to any first time Dean Koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off....don't judge his work by this novel.  
 I'm sorry but despite some brilliant acting performances from Hopkins and Thompson this has got to be one of the most BORING movies I've ever tried to sit through. Don't be fooled by artsy film snobs, this one is a snoozer. And oh by the way, the tenacious "loyalty, devotion and integrity" of Hopkins character that so many critics think is the cornerstone of the film, is in my opinion, distracting and ridiculous 
 Regurgitated Luddite foolishness from an economic ignoramus.  This is the worst kind of populism, based not in love but in fear: "He is really big, but if you and I get together we can bop him." Mix that with the leitmotif of intellectuals ("How unfair that people like Jack Welch have influence: what were his grades in high school?" and "What a better place the world would be if we were in charge!") and you get the picture. It is amazing to me that this stuff still has an audience 
 I got two of these shower heads and they were both defective.  I returned the first one, got another, and it was defective too.  I would not recommend this product at all 
 This album lacks a lot of the controversy (not all of it) of the original,  uncensored "Cop Killer" (new censored version now titled Body  Count). Go to eBay and find someone auctioning off the real version of the  92 album. You will like it a hell of a lot better 
 I was quite surprised to learn that the filter is not designed to be water sealed. While the installation direction clearedly says that it is required to apply Teflon tape, it still feels like a 19th centry technolodgy. On the bright side, a small scroll of the said tape is included in the package.  The installation is easy and simple. Unfortunately, when we attached our shower head back and tested it for the first time, the filter could not sustain the water pressure and broke into two pieces. Luckily the only casualty was our light bulb.  Item returned without much of discussion. I hope this company's got a good return policy 
 I loved the theatrical/cable release; but the editted/cut "commercial" cable version destroyed the emotional impact of the theatrical release of the movie.  We bought the "directors cut" hoping to recapture the movie.  What a major disappointment.  Don't waste your money.  They dropped the whole "I got hammered" sequence and replaced Kris (and his son Johnny) with vocals by hot lips Sally Kellerman.  Way not cool 
 I was at the airport, getting ready to fly out to Cali and I found this book in the airport gift shop- I thought what a stroke of luck I had getting a Stephen King title at such a juncture... I'm a huge  fan. Despite the fact that I started and finished the book exactly as the plane took off and landed, I was sorely disappointed.  Much ado about nothing would be an overstatement 
 This is basically a book of few words, many uninspiring photographs, and a some weak hints here and there that reveal to you the astonishing secret of clutter-free living: just buy a bunch of cute and clever containers to store all your junk!  There is virtually nothing meaty in this thing about how to get organized and STAY clutter-free.   
 I was quite surprised and disappointed with this book.  It is not at all a horror story, not at all mysterious, really it was very boring.   Normally I enjoy Koontz books.   
 This is one of the best books on Reiki I have read 
 Are we living in the end times is just what I expected.  Typical apologetic Christian scare tactics based on irrational fantasies. What should scare you is the nastiness of the previous "Christian" reviewers attitudes toward each other.  A person whom may be interested in the Christian worldview likely would be even more confused and probably put off by these people.  Why should they bother to read Mr. LaHaye's opinions or for that matter the Bible itself, since all these people have read these same books and come to such different interpretations  and conclusions.  If they're looking for love and comfort, why should they want to join a group of people that not only look forward to the world being destroyed and 80 percent of the nice people inhabiting it to be murdered and tortured forever, but also seem to hate people of their own faith?      Christians have such diverse opinions because the fact is that the Bible is hopelessly contradictory, no matter how hard apologists like LaHaye try to twist and destort its words to make it form to their own biases.  By all means, READ the New Testament.  Take your time, don't use study guides that try to tell you what they think it means, keep an open mind and THINK FOR YOURSELF. You will find that there is no question that the people writting the New Testament thought that the "end of the world" was going to happen in thier lifetimes.  Pay attention to Matt. 24 when Jesus says he will be back during that generation, or Matt. 16 where people standing there will not have drawn thier last breath before the second coming occurs.  You don't use terms like "the time is nigh", "the end of all things is at hand" or the first words of Revelations itself " the things which MUST SHORTLY come to pass" if you think it might take a couple of thousand years.  When the Bible says the world is flat, the sky is a solid dome supported by pillars with windows in it for the rain, space is full of water, and that giant human/angels used to inhabit the earth, it is wrong.  When it says that invisible people who live in the sky are going to come and destroy the earth and just about everybody in it, that again is wrong. More importantly, it is not moral or anything close to love, which the religious are always claiming they have so much of.       Don't wait for someone to come do some magic and make all your problems go away. Get off your knees and do it yourself. 
 Some will mistake me for a Evidence hater, but I'm really not.  I just want the man to put some effort into what he does.  I'm tired of taking just any ol' thing artists throw at us nowadays because the "fans" don't expect very much -- or simply don't know what good is anymore.  Sure, you can relate to what Evidence is saying, but you can put on a dope instrumental CD, sit with a friend or knowledgable hip hop head, have a discussion about any topic, and the resulting feeling will be something like the feeling you get from this album.  I quickly get tired of the "slow flow" -- see: talking -- and I feel like anyone can do it.  I don't shell out money for things I can do myself.  Really, the only difference between him and 50 cent is content.  When I hear someone say "slow flow" my mind translates that into "reduction of standards to make it easier for cats to get on" because this album would have been thrown out the window before the jiggy invasion came.  And lot of these beats, though very dope, are as slow as his flow is.  Couple that with the fact that there are a lot of wack guest appearance from cats like Joe Scudda (I'm sorry, I tried to like him, but dude is simply terrible), Big Pooh (same goes for him), and Madchild and you have an album that can have a drowsying effect on the listener.  The only dope guest shots come from Phonte, Planet Asia, and Slug.  Yeah, I know the fans and jock riders will hate and call names, but I'm going to keep it honest -- fu** real.  When Ev actually puts his back into it, he creates some dope material.  "Down With New York City" is nice piece of work that has Ev gettin' busy over an air tight Jake One track.  "Chase The Clouds Away" is another track where Ev does his thing over a pounding ALC production.  The standout to me had to be "Line of Scrimmage" which features Ev and Atmosphere frontman, Slug, getting nice over another dope ALC creation.  With the likes of Alchemist, Sid Roams, Jake One, DJ Khalil, Babu, and Evidence himself providing dope beats, I'd have to say that the production is definitely the strong point of the LP.  Simply put, I don't recommend playing this CD while operating heavy machinery.  I respect Ev and his whole crew (hell, I love Rakaa), but this album will make you nod off instead of nod to the beat.  I can only call it the way I see it regardless of whether or not the artist is a favorite of mine or not.  Bring on the unhelpful votes if you want, but I can only recommend this to the die hard fans -- who should eat this one up.  Everyone else should download this and test it out first.  Standout Tracks: Letyourselfgo feat. Alchemist & Phonte, A Moment In Time feat. Planet Asia, Line Of Scrimmage feat. Slug (My Favorite), and Down In New York Cit 
  Ugggh! On top of being dated and boring, this movie is so RACIST! Intolerance wasn't so fun either, but I liked it's theme better. D.W. Griffith films are not my favorites anyway, but I watched this out of curiosity and all I could say when it ended was UGGGH! "Birth" was stupid, and some of the ideas in it were outlandish. If you want to see a good Griffith film watch Intolerance. D.W. Griffith created the birth of a nightmare. 
 As the sole dissenting view so far, I'll say that perhaps one has to have read Byatt's critically acclaimed "Possession" in order to appreciate what she's done here but I must admit I was unable to do so.  I found it sorely misleading to lable these stories as horror stories since absolutely nothing about them was scary or even remotely horrific in any way. I wasn't expecting to find a Stephen King story here but neither was I expecting to find "Body Art" - a story about a doctor who gets a young woman pregnant and forces her to have the baby. An interesting character study perhaps but nothing at all supernatural or like anything that's advertised on the back of the cover.  Something may be said for the author's poetic writing style and she does effectively pull off the modern fairy tale for grown-ups tone but frankly it was a tone that lulled me to boredom and eventually to sleep.  I found most of the characters dull and many of them unlikable.  I thought that these stories would be an interesting and short introduction to an author I keep hearing so much about. Sadly, as I was barely able to finish this little black book I doubt I'll be picking up any of her longer works. If you're looking for poetic character studies with dark tones, I recommend this one. If you're looking for something scary that won't bore you to death with page long descriptions of nature at every turn look somewhere else because you won't find it here.         
 By this book, 1940 marked the time that photography died and was replaced by vast amounts of performance art.  Can you seriously present a "survey" of contemporary art without even acknowledging photography in any form?  
   Look, "Sweet Jesus, I Hate Bill O'Reilly" is a funny title.  Seriously.  It reminds me of Al Franken's "Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot."  Good for one quick forced chuckle, but nothing more.  Just the work of another hapless liberal zombie (What is the author's name again? Hm? Hm?) spouting juvenile hate and wondering why Dems can't get elected President.  If this is your thing then please, go right ahead...   Me? I'm going to pick up Bill's latest #1 New York Times hardcover bestseller, "Culture Warrior," even if the title isn't funny...    
 This book should have been titled "The Unofficial Guide to Personal Finance". Only Part IV, chapters 10 through 13, about 160 pages are devoted to online investing, and it's at a very elementary level. The rest of the book deals with bank accounts, credit cards, debt reduction, insurance, taxes, and other personal finance issues. If you want to learn about Online Investing, leave this book on the shelf and look for another book which has doesn't have all this non-Online Investing stuff. Leave this POS on the shelf 
 Somebody put something in my drink, or was it this snooze-fest of a film. This guy directs like a dead-beat trying to avoid creditors. What a disgrace to Ram Dass's legacy. Please avoid this film like the plague 
 Having read Frank's "What's the matter with Kansas?"---which I quite liked---I started this book.  I looked forward to reading a critique of the "Emperor's New Economic Paradigm": that the almighty *Free Market* is the answer to all of America's problems.   However, after struggling to stay awake through the first 50 pages, I cried "uncle".  Frank is not content to make a point but must go on to remake it again and again ad nauseum.  And to add injury to insult, the book's tiny, thin-line font is rather hard on the eyes even with my normal reading glasses 
 Purchased this item for traveling. Our son doesn't travel well. So we purchased this item for him and it doesn't strap on to the car seat like the picture shows. The straps are material and velcro on the ends. How do you attach these straps? So, now we just let him play with it being free. It doesn't attach 
 Just like the old Chariots of Gods, his books are very interesting and and entertaining.  But please dont think that you are reading a scientific work.  Real historical works are not as sexy and entertaining as these books just as real archeologists are not Indiana Joneses.  
 I hoped I could leave the theatre, but I was hoping it would get better. Here let me put it this way: 3-D sucked Plot sucked Actors sucked Movie sucked PLEASE DON'T MAKE A SEQUEL!!! 
 I received this book and started reading it, only to find after 96 pages into it, that it was incomplete and missing 17 pages right at the important parts. I had to return it. What a hassle. You would think that the publisher would at least make sure all the pages are in the book... Fool 
 I read _The Seer and the Sword_ largely because I was attracted to Trina Schart Hyman's lovely cover art, and found the book mediocre.  I liked it enough, however, that I ventured to try the sequel, in the hope that it might improve over the first book.  _Seer_, although the plot became bogged down in the middle of the book, had some genuinely interesting characters and events; it had believable moral dilemmas and suspense.  The characters in _The Healer's Keep_, on the other hand, were flatter than paper, indistinguishable from one another.  The author seemed to think that announcing an associated trait for each character was enough to give them individuality, without actually doing the work of constructing separate personalities.  The plot, meanwhile, is rote, predictable, and uninteresting; the world feels like a collage of fantasy tropes.  Worst of all, however, is the tortured, stilted prose.  This book reads as though it was written by an 11-year-old for a school assignment.  With the current boom in appreciation for children's and YA fantasy, there are many more interesting, original, and well-written books in the genre available, both newly written and reprinted.  I'm glad that the latest edition of _The Healer's Keep_ sports a bland computer-graphic cover rather than the enticing art of the original jacket--it's much more true to the reality of the book 
 I purchased this book while I was engaged to my British husband, in an effort to adjust to the cultural aspects of living in another country after our wedding. This book was *not* very helpful. It didn't help at all in the *adjustment* process. Also, if you live (or plan to live) outside of London don't waste your money. Sure, it talked about some of the things that people coming to the UK might need to know, like differences in language, but if you're American, this book can be a bit confusing because the author is a speaker of Asian English (I think Hong Kong), which is much closer to British English than to American English 
 I bought this book on the recommendation of several people that I know pretty well, unfortunately, this book is filled with errors upon errors and is filled with a typical neo-confederate bias by the author.  In fact, the book should be called "How confederates saved America" as he gives the credit for the peaceful return of the confederate armies to confederate generals such as Lee, Johnson and Forrest, rather than on Lincoln's instructions to Grant and Sherman and generous terms known as the River Queen Doctrine, "I want no one punished; treat them liberally  all around.  We want those people to return to their allegieance to the United States and submit to the laws".  His errors are numerous.  He talks of the possibility of the confederates disbanding their armies and moving into the hills and waging a guerilla warfare against the US troops and sights examples of how successful this tactic has been throughout time and he includes in these examples the American Revolution.  He states that Francis Marion, Thomas Sumter and Andrew Pickens(who all could be called partisans or guerilla fighters), but then he goes on to state that Nathaniel Greene was a guerilla fighter as well.  Now only someone completely ignorant of US Army history could ever make such a statement.  Nathaniel Greene served in the Continental Army and was the Quartermaster General, he was in no way a guerilla, nor did he use guerilla tactics.  He continues on that Greene used guerilla tactics in battle at Kings Mountain and Cowpens and Guilford Courthouse.  Besides the basic fact that Greene wasn't even at the battles of Kings Mountain and Cowpens, neither one could be said to be guerilla attacks.  At Kings Mountain, the American militia found Patrick Ferguson and his men well entrenched in defenses at the crest of the mountain and formed up and attacked the positions, hardly a guerilla tactic. Cowpens was fought by Daniel Morgan and was a set piece battle where he destroyed Tarleton's legion.  Greene attacked Cornwallis at Guilford Courthouse in another set piece battle and was winning until Cornwallis took the extreme measure of firing canister directly into the center of the two massed armies, killing and wounding as many of his own men as he did Americans.  None of these battles were guerilla fighting and Greene in no way can be called a guerilla.  The author shows his neo-confederate bias most clearly by restating the apocryphal stories of rape, theft and outright murder by Sherman's troops during the Savannah and Carolina Campaigns as matter of historical facts.  He continually paints the Federals in the worst of lights, while reserving his highest praise and most eloquent prose for the confederates.  He incorrectly quotes Sherman when he claims Sherman said "Sherman himself explained that in his march, he inflicted an astonishing $100 million worth of damage, of which only $20 million was necessary, the rest being "simply waste and destruction"".  He clearly is slanting his own words to convince people that Sherman was in fact "the devil" as the neo-cons believe he is.  Unfortunately, what he CLAIMS Sherman said has no relation to what he actually said.  From the Official Records, Vol 44, page 13; in Sherman's report on his campaign to the War Dept, he states "I estimate the damage done to the State of Georgia and its military resources at $100,000,000; at least, $20,000,000 of which has inured to our advantage, and the remainder is simple waste and destruction."  Sherman does not, as Mr. Winik claims state that only $20 million was necessary, what Sherman said was that his army confiscated and USED(inured means to use) $20 million worth of the property and destroyed the remaining $80 million of confederate civilian and private property that was going to be used against the armed forces of the United States.  If you are a confederate "lost causer" then you will enjoy this novel, however, if you are looking for historical truth, then you should read a different book.  William Hal

 Robin Briggs promises an intriguing concept-- social history of witches-- but fails to really deliver.  This book is overly anecdotal, rambling, and too long.  Occasionally, Briggs starts to sketch a reasonable and viable  hypothesis about the topic at hand, but then inevitably veers off into a  loosely-related anecdote or another topic altogether.  If you have no  background in European history and know nothing about the witchcraft trials  outside America, this book would be acceptable.  However, if you would like  to learn more, this is NOT the place to start 
 This book does not stray an inch from the usual 'Raising Daughters: For Dumb***es' formula, which consists of the following:  1) Pop-science involving the brain and hormones is used to 'confirm' the most banal stereotypes about females.  If you've heard the ones about how they are supposedly all more 'empathetic' and 'relational' than males, you have heard the basic premise of this book.  The author even mentions something about how she believes that stereotypes 'usually hold truth'.*  2) The sort of trite parenting advice that was once called 'common sense' but is now called 'marketable'.  Plenty of tiresome and unenlightening 'real-world examples' are used as padding to make up for the book's lack of anything that can be called substance.  * Indeed -- but only if one doesn't bother to look any further.  In short: don't be a sucker.  Hopefully this review will be of help 
 Cleopatra Records produces a wide variety of compilations. Some quite good (tribute to pink floyd and gong's YOU remixed) and others awful. This package falls into the awful category. A nicely done package with little inside. Over 50 bands contribute to this. Biggest names are Bauhaus (In the Flat Field), Leg. Pink Dots, Delerium, Fields of Nephilim, Boyd Rice, etc. If you are a true collector of these folks and expect to get something new or really rare, forget it. Most of it is available. The rest of the multitude of bands sound like 80 throwbacks. Nothing really innovative or original. Problem with gothic has always been it's pretentiousness. Cleopatra has already released a variety of dull gothic compilations, why do this again? I am sure there is something in here for everyone, but not everyone will love all of this material. Borrow it from a friend, not worth the price in my opinion.   
 I have a problem with Bakke's idea of "fun."  Fun, by his definition is a free-for-all.  For example, he feels that an organization's "amount of fun" is determined by "the number of individuals allowed to make decisions" (99).  I agree that sharing information "reinforces the feeling of community" (98), but I don't agree with his suggestion that leaders should "ask for as much advice as possible before making a decision" (88).  "Sharing information" and "seeking advice" are two different things.    Bakke misuses the analogy of a child jumping into the arms of a parent by stating that the same is required of leaders to jump into the arms of the subordinate (103).  It is the subordinate who should trust the leader.  In one section of the book, he stresses the importance of "asking for as much advice as possible before making a decision."  But in another section he shares the story of his administrative assistant who "routinely checks with the office accountant to see how her decisions would affect the budget, but no higher approval is necessary" (apparently no other advice is needed as well) (79).  His idea of leadership lacks strength by decentralizing decision-making to others.   In his postscript, Bakke discusses Biblical leadership.  At first glance, what he writes sounds Biblical-"serve the people they lead," and "allow followers to use their talents effectively" (261), but his overall idea of leadership is not Biblical.  For instance, he says, "The Creation story does not assign people, even leaders, the responsibility of `managing' other people" (261)- I wonder what he thought God meant in Genesis 3:16 when He told Eve, "he will be your master."  The Bible doesn't use the word, "manage," but God entrusted leaders to people throughout the Bible-that's why there were judges in the OT.  I don't think the Israelites would've left the wilderness if Moses asked "as many as possible" before making a decision 
 I have been a fan of Dean Koontz for many years, but I stopped reading his new novels about 6 years ago, because after awhile, it seemed as if all of his characters were the same. I recently read the back cover of this book, and it sounded so interesting, so I gave it a chance. Boy, was I sorry. It is as if Dean Koontz regressed to a first year creative writing student! His sentences are awkward, mostly out of an insane desire to use as many adjectives and adverbs as he can - it is as if he wrote the book with a thesaurus by his side. This was way too distracting, and it really diminished what otherwise could have been an entertaining tale.  Please Dean, take an opportunity to read some 'how-to' books on writing 
 This book does cover alot of information not needed for CLEP, but it does give you a great guideline on who and what to study for clep and good examples on what questions will look like for the actual clep.   I wanted to ensure I was prepared for the clep, so I purchased this book and disregarded the other 2 comments.  Although, they were right about the obscurity, this book still taught me alot.   You don't necessarily need it, but if you want to be prepared, this book will not hurt your bank account that much. I also recommend The Complete Itiots Guide to American Literature (5 stars, check out the reviews), and the Internet.  That is all you need 
 DO Not buy this product...it is not for multifunctional printers.  Linksys just launched the WPSM54G at the Las Vegas Electronic Show 2007.  Go to Linksys for details....and Google the produc 
 They say there's a sucker born every minute and I guess I just joined that club. The Last Rakosh is a complete waste of money no matter how much you pay for it. Expecting a new and exciting Repairman Jack tale, what I got was a retelling, almost an exact excerpt from a previous RJ novel! Nothing new, nothing exciting, just a waste of money. Spare yourself the dissappointment and read the original novel that this is culled from. Even the cover art sucks, the rakosh not looking nearly as deadly or ferocious as I imagined, more like a koala bear with teeth.  
 Wallis Budges' Book, "The Gods of The Egyptians" was Interesting at BEST and full of insulting and incorrect terminology and opinions about the Ancient Egyptians at WORST!!  The book delved into the belief structure of the religion of the Egyptians but he referred to the Egyptians as "savages" many times then made statements that "...their ideas about the world beyond the grave and God and gods were of a savage, childish and inconsistent character". He also made the statement that "..it is difficult to see how  the eminent Egyptologist could attempt to compare the conceptions of God formed by a half-civilized African people with those of such cultured nations as the Greeks and Romans".  ANY educated man that has studied Egypt knows that the Egyptians TAUGHT the Greeks everything they THOUGHT they knew who came into Egypt ignorant and obsessed with homosexuality I.E.- Socrates, Pythagora credited w/(Pythagorems Theorom) which he learned in Egypt and the Romans were the same way. The Romans INVADED Egypt.. raping the country of her knowledge and culture.. which is how the Romans got THEIR knowledge I.E.- The Library of Alexandria. It is well known that Egypt was considered the "Learning Center Of The World" and had even developed the FIRST writing systems and were mathematical, medicinal and philosophical  geniuses.   YET... Wallis Budge would have his readers believe that they were SAVAGES and their religion wasn't really even worth bothering with..  yet he neglects to mention that it is the SAME religion upon which Christianity was based. So I would say to read Mr. Budges books (but especially this one), with a reserved and cautious mind. I have quite a few of his books, and they all maintain that same opinionated and incorrect view of the Egyptians and their culture. Therefore if you take his writings literally and as pure fact..  you might miss the GREATNESS that existed in an ancient people and their culture 
 Just one of the many lies i n this book overlooked (????) by Douglas Brinkley was Kerry supposedly in Cambodia in 1968 and  havinga telephone conversation with Pres. Nixon. HINT: Johnson was the president in 1968, not Nixon.  To read this book 'TOUR OF DUTY', you'd swaer that Kerry was a real life Rambo when in fact, Kerry was more concerned with carrying around 8mm cameras and old fashioned and heavy Smith-Corona typewritters layingt he foundation for his future presidential campaign.  In another regard, what happened to that BIG DRAFT KERRY said was goingt o happen in January 2005? And the reduced social security benefits? And the Herbert Hoover economy? These were just some of the lies that Kerry repeated over and over and over during his failed presidential campaign in 2004.   But what really happened? There was no draft and 2005 is nearly over. Our seniors got a raise, not a cut in social security benefits and all economic factors show that the economy is doing just great thank you.  Are you all glad that Kerry got whipped last year? Say yes.  [... 
 William O'Neil is perhaps the one individual responsible for my development as a trader and investor.  I consider How to Make Money in Stocks to be one of the most valuable books on stock trading.  I cannot say the same for this one.  In fact, I found it to be a complete waste of both my time and money.  There was not a single new or insightful bit of information in the text.  If I could give it 0 stars I would 
 Like any other text. To pricy if you ask me 
 I never wanted to write one of these, but I feel I have to. I bought these boots, they were great, but one size too big. So I tried to exchange them. Amazon doesn't do exchanges.....apparently too difficult. On top of this, the price doubled after I bought them, so now if I want the boots, Amazon will not honor the previous price. This is something that any dime store would do, but apparently one of the world's largest online retailers couldn't. This is very disappointing, and I would never recomend this company to anyone....ever....quite the opposite 
 The fast delivery and reasonable price for these shoes almost make me ignore the not so perfect pair of shoes I received. They look like some floor model and somewhat tried on with part of the heels on both shoes cut off resembling rejects. I am sure I will not show them off much when I wear them 
 I will admit, I stopped after reading the first 50 pages.  It's very repetitive.  After a 15 page prologue, the author offers a 25 page introduction.  Maybe both should have been skipped.  The main idea: up until the 1990s radical Muslims focused on fighting their own governments (the near enemy) and in the mid 1990s a small fraction of them decided to fight the U.S. and Western countries (the far enemy).  Interesting, but in the first 40 pages, the author made this point at least ten times.  Not only ideas and arguments, even whole sentences are repeated from one page to the other.  For readers interested in this topic, I recommend 'The Next Attack' which I'll give at least four stars 
 Lists, quotes and corporate anecdotes pretty much sum up this book.  It's light reading and quirky, but I didn't walk away with a single idea to take to my team at work 
 This is the first novel I have read by this author and after reading it, I am not likely to read any thing else by her.  I managed to finish the novel but it was more of a chore than a pleasure.  It wasn't bad enough not to finish but I am sure am glad that I didn't purchase it.  I would have wasted my money.  I have a friend who likes to read as I do and we share/pass books to each other...this one, I don't think I will share 
 This book is extremely challenging to get through and understand.  I was lost a great deal of the time and did not learn what I had hoped.  I appreciate the inclusion of the spiritual aspects of theories in the book, but the authors seemed to forget about teaching in an understandable manner 
 I didn't think I'd miss the Christopher Reeve superman movies (one and two at least) and I really miss George Reeves now!!!!  Those black and white Superman shows were the best!  what's her name was a HORRIBLE Lois Lane!!!!  The whole thing sucked - that was the second of two bad movies in a row!  I don't even care about the deleted scenes!  I want to sell it to someone else or at the very least - I'm going to give this one away!  Brandon is cute enough but that uniform was soooooo dull!!   I remember now that my brother told me I could wait for cable.  I got greedy - someone bought him a DVD that was coded for another country (there was russian writing on it) and it wouldn't work in my DVD player so I got Amazon happy and ordered it from a vendor in Brooklyn.  I SHOULDA WAITED FOR CABLE 
 Believe it or not, I actually wanted to watch this movie.  I've seen almost everything else Adrian Lyne has done and respect his shallow talent enough to be interested in his early efforts.  (I watched _Jacob's Ladder_ because I remembered an intriguing preview on a VHS cassette I watched as a kid and learning that it was a significant influence on _Silent Hill_ sealed the deal; My girlfriend owns a copy of Lyne's version of _Lolita_; _Fatal Attraction_ was a girlfriend induced rental; I watched the TV version of _Indecent Proposal_; I haven't seen _9 1/2 Weeks_ but I read the book.)   Flashdance is also one of those pieces of pop culture that are so influential that you recognize references even if you've never seen it.  And I always wanted to hear the song "Maniac" in its original context, so when I found it on an acquaintances shelf I popped it in.  So, how was it?  Not too bad.  Not great by any means, or even really that good (_Lolita_ and _Jacob's Ladder_ are both quite good) but interesting enough to keep me awake after a long day of work.  The plot is a by-the-book "believe in your dreams" story with really lame dialog, but its development is intercut with extended dancing sequences that are so long and frequent that at times it felt like I was watching an abstract silent film.  I don't know squat about dancing, but the choreography seemed innovative, at least for its time.  I can't even remember the names of the characters, but all in all, I have to admit that it was kind of neat.  Also, if you watch it with the subsequent 20+ years of movies in mind, _Flashdance_ can be seen as sort of an omen of all bad things to come from Hollywood:  It's a movie by a director whose only previous experience was in music videos and commercials, one whose screenplay was an early effort by hack Joe Esterhasz and was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer!  Taken collectively these elements are probably responsible for about 60% of all crap movies made since 
 Most of the stories are forgettable within an hour of reading them, but I did enjoy "Demolition" about Chuck's visit to a combine demolition derby.  Other than that it was one snoozer after another with the bottom of the barrel being an interview with Juliette Lewis (gag!).  Another time stopper was a 31-page story about people who've build their own castles, literally.    Read (if you must) only after you've finished all of his fiction 
 Aphoristic, not grounded in any theory, and unhelpful for my purposes. I was looking for something more than a statement or two about a topic per page. Written to showcase the illustrations, not the content. 
 I just wrote a great review for this album, but my computer decided to quit unexpectedly so I'll make this short. Find a way (legally ;) to only acquire these tracks- 2, 8, 9, 12-15. They're great and reminiscent of his deep moods and tastes for the ethereal. However, if you're unfortunate enought to hear any of the others, you'll want to have your brain whiped clean of any memory of it.   Basically DJ Shadow, who I used to never be able to shut up about, now has a bunch of parasites (sadly, even one is named "Droop-E," weak) clinging to him and begging him for exposure. Somehow legend Q-Tip wanted to involve himself, which I'll never understand. So anyway, since DJ Shadow is a nice guy, he took 15 minutes to make tracks for them to rap over. This explains the rest of the album. So you have my advice, and I hope your curiousity or disbelief will not lead you to explore beyond the tracks I've listed, as you may fall off a cliff and into the dark endless chasm of wasted talent (although you can say hello to dj shadow, I hear he's down there somewhere trying to climb back out) 
 When I got this book and paged through it, I was delighted with the baby blankets and I've decided to knit several of them. I was also excited because I love the "Yarn Shop" series.  Debbie Macomber captures the spirit of a Local Yarn Shop beautifully.   So was I bitterly disappointed when I looked up the recommended yarns for the project.  These are yarns that are available in large chain stores, not in local yarn shops. I can appreciate that people  are interested in knitting affordably, but there could at least be a mix of yarns.  Much of what I loved about the original books is the knitting community that takes place in a local yarn shop.  Having ALL of the recommended yarns in the pattern books come from chain stores betrays the premise of the stories.  The stories could not have taken place anywhere else, yet the companion books send you to buy yarn from the very stores that are driving small shops out of business 
 I'll preface this by saying I'm a cryer.  I cry at movie previews when they simply look entertaining.  I cried all the way through Superman Returns.  I did not, however, shed one tear during Message in a Bottle.  In English class, I always learned to "show, not tell" when writing.  When that is your rule of thumb, you'll write a moving piece of literature, even if you're not completely skillful.  Sparks is the master of telling without showing.  I'm honestly baffled by all the good reviews it gets.  The story is somewhat engaging, but with no payoff.  But the work is filled with passages like (and these are from memory; if I picked up the book to look for verbatim examples I'd have to type the entire thing), "He went to the refrigerator, opened the door, and took a beer.  After opening it, he sat down on the back deck."  Or, "Though she was overweight, she moved quickly around the table."  "She got out of the shower, dried off, and put on khaki shorts and a white cotton shirt."  Have you read enough yet?  I'm new to the romance genre.  My mother-in-law recommended Sparks because -- I think she was trying to imply -- his sex scenes aren't too graphic.  They were to me, but then, I'm new to romance, and spoiled by the masterful, unequaled storytelling skill of Stephen King.  Please hold your New York Times bestsellers to a higher standard.  Let's hold on to whatever quality control we can in music, movies, and literature 
 More tripe about how one "man" discovered other humans.  The "objective" view of this man as a hero is still present, helping to perpetuate the myth that Natives were not as valuable as the oppressors who came to colonize them.  I am not the type to say burn books, but this would make great kindling for the fires of truth.  You might be able to use it in a discussion of racism and the epestimologies that help create and foster it.  There are plenty of Italian people who were heroes, this person is just not one of them.  
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 It's hard to tell just what the point if any this movie was trying to make. There are scenes which contain cheap disjointed porn and then moral comments  This "film" really was a waste of money and at best should be rented and not bough 
 The Great Smoky Mountain National Park is an area of rare natural splendor.  It is surrounded by the Great Smoky Mountain region which is a ... tourist trap.  I bought this book hoping to find 100 secrets of the Park: the best sunrise view, the best hike for small kids, the best fishing stream, etc.  The book does have a few secrets of the Park, but mostly it's about the tourist traps: the Exotic Petting Zoo, the best steakhouse, the backdoor entrance to Dollywood.  If these are the things that interest you, you will like this book.  However, if these are the things that interest you, then you should seriously consider vacationing in Orlando instead of in the Smoky Mountain region. 
 Now where's the old John Stossel who stood up for consumers against sleazy scams perpatrated by corrupt businesses? Guess he thought it's better to steal all the taxpayer money than to fight for taxpayer justice. For all his ramblings in this book, he might as well blabber on the Emmy Awards and get lost ! Let's see how this clown fares when the public lion wakes up and tears his ligaments to shreds  
 As a Landscape Architect I found the book helpful and very simple to use and browse through.  It is a good resource.  It would be helpful to have some construction sections or details illustrating construction techniques.  Also having a resource guide in the back for manufacturers and supplies would be useful 
 this has got to be the WORST film I've ever seen. its not sad. Its not funny, jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage. I don't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie, because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him. the actor is the worst of all. i cant tell if he's sad in some seens, or angry or jest retarded. I've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks, I guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present. it probably worked better back in 96'. but this movie is SO SO SO BAD. its embarrassing. do not rent it or buy it or view it on television. NOTE'S: THIS FILM HAD  SOME GREAT TALENT A song from Olivia Newton Jon, and (one of my most personal favorites) Mila AND my favorite comedians Margaret Cho. She's to good but...why this film, she (and Mila ) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this.      
 If you ever wonder why energy workers are stereotyped as newagey, flaky, and also inprecise in how they define energy, i.e. they say energy is in everything, you won't wonder after you read this book. I picked this up on a whim, curious to see if it really offered a break through in energy healing.  There is nothing innovative about this book. You can find the concepts the author discusses in books on taoism and tantra that are better written and have a better explanation.  I tried his exercises out and found them to be not nearly as effective as he promised. If anything it seemed this was more like a diet lite soda than anything that promised a break through. I wouldn't really recommend this book 
 Over the top ...   Kurzweil's enthusiasm of writing style exceeds the logical supposition. Take what we know, divide it by the sqrt of 2, multiply by pi, raise to the power of n ... there you have it. You gotta have Kurzweil's imagination to extrapolate, then accept the premise that computational evolution can, and will, transcend biology.  I agree with another reviewer that Kurzweil will spawn a next generation in ScFi 
 This is one of the worst cds I have ever bought.  I picked this cd up just to see what it is all about.  There are no good songs.  I wish I could give this cd no stars.  And why do they have all those silent tracks  .I mean theres like 70 silent tracks and there are no songs except on the last one what the point of that?  This is the worst cd ever.  
 The special effects are very poor. The mixing of horror with humor and a teenage type script just doesn't do it for me. Not recommended 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 This is one of the worst films ever made! And I mean it!! One of the worst scripts I have ever come across. The acting is hammy and the direction is very weak! There was no reason for this movie to exist! "Turbulence" was a good movie and they should of stopped at that but two sequels! No way! If you like the 1st mabye try "Turbulence 2: Fear of Flying" but stay away of the 3rd. This is one terrible movie! Believe ME! 
 I couldn't get past the very stylized dialogue which seemed to coming from the same source although different actors were speaking.  The characters are cliches through and through and does anyone really speak the way the people do? Mamet appears to have never left Manhattan and has no clue to writing non urban roles or a script with enough nuance to delineate his characters perspective.  To be honest I didn't finish the entire film, but instead checked the TV Guide for reruns of Northern Exposure for the real thing 
 I bought this book looking for some helpful advice for when our first son arrived.  I did not find it with this book.  This book is just a couple's stories about life with their first.  Somewhat interesting but not at all what I was looking for 
 ed harris was perfectly cast as artist jackson pollock. sadly, he was also the producer, and hired a horrible director. a director named ed harris. i have never before seen a movie where you could sense every damn scene being held a beat too long. over and over and over, harris keeps the camera running too long. it is as if he was so in love with his pet project (he worked on the movie for many years) that he could not bear to not put forth every single one of his notions. sad, because it couldve been a good movie 
 I am not happy with this item.  I managed to get the first shade to stick on one of my car windows with some difficulty but by the next morning it had fallen off and I could not get it to restick on the window.  I had even less luck with the other shade.  No matter what I did it would not stick to the window.  It was a total waste of money and I would recommend everyone buy something else or not bother.  I think I would have had better luck with plastic wrap on my window 
 ***Spoilers Ahead***  Towards the end of the book I was absolutly positive there HAD to be another installment in the series because it kept going with no resolution in sight.   Unfortunatly, I was wrong.  In a typically Mercedes Lackey move the book goes on and on and on, following the characters practically day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute and then ends abruptly.   I honestly felt there was no point to most of what I read. It seemed that half of the book was spent following Kellen as he travelled from place to place and back again while he whined over how ruthless he was becoming. Then we spent another good portion of the book reading about Savilla torturing various creatures and walking around naked. And finally, Jermayan, who also seemed to spend half his time just travelling back and forth between cities and camps and so forth. Oh, and let's not foget Cilarnen, who spend most of the book holed up in one place of another while he fiddles around with all his new books and equipment.  Then we get to the end, the final battle, the culmination of all our effort in reading through hundreds of pages of character and plot development....and they wrap it up in MAYBE 30 pages.   There was absolutly no resolution in my mind. It was like the ending was simply an after though: "Oh, yeah, and the good guys win. The end."   The demons are supposed to be a mighty and powerful race but they go down seemingly without a fight. To be honest, I was more intrugued by Kellen and Shalkan fighting the stone mastiffs than I was about the final battle. It was just way to easy, convenient, and stereotypical to be enjoyable.  To end the story, of course, there had to be the relationship resolution. I wasn't bying these flimsy relastionships from the beginning, it was just very fast, very forced and very out of place. So Jermayan gets Idalia....sort of but it was the relationship between Kellen and Vestakia that really got me. They spent most of the trilogy avoiding each other yet somehow manage to fall in love and then at the very end: "Oh, by the way, we can have sex now. I love you."   In all, it was disappointing. Many questions weren't answered and they left a lot of loose threads hanging in their hurry to wrap it all up. If they hadn't spent almost the entire book focusing on the pointless they could have made so much more of it 
 ed harris was perfectly cast as artist jackson pollock. sadly, he was also the producer, and hired a horrible director. a director named ed harris. i have never before seen a movie where you could sense every damn scene being held a beat too long. over and over and over, harris keeps the camera running too long. it is as if he was so in love with his pet project (he worked on the movie for many years) that he could not bear to not put forth every single one of his notions. sad, because it couldve been a good movie 
 I still am in favor of keeping the capital punishment system in our country after reading this book.  Some people preach "Compassion", "Love", and "Mercy", but what about Justice? Do we care more about the murderer than the victims?  ...how many people have been accidentally executed and proven innocent?  My studies show 2.  How many innocent victims have died to murderers on parol, countless 
 I think that people who buy this book should know that many of the recipes require the use of a cake mix.  It may be that when I actually make the cakes, I will regret what I write now, but until then I am feeling a little short changed.  Surely Mrs. Pregnall does not use commercial cake mix in her own shop 
 this is a sad attempt for the Liars at taking their sound in a new direction. It comes off as a hearted rip off of "Animal Collective's" "Feels" album, which was amazing. This disc doesn't live up to the hype surrounding it, and conventional wisdom is starting to tell me that Pitchfork has gotten too big for there britches 
 Dont buy this book, it's only dedicated to sell more O.S. System from MS ! The content is inappropiate  
 A Thousand Days could hardly be classified as history and basically is an emotionally charged admiration of the 35th President. However, it is one of the classics that helped proliferate the Camelot myth that, unfortunately, continues to persist to this day 
 A rather spirited debate among reviewers for a book that is rather boring. What did we learn from The Juice? 1. Steroids are bad. This is a revelation? 2. Players such as Giambi and Bonds used steroids. In case you are the one person who has not seen the 176 specials about steroids on ESPN, this could help.   Other than this, the book really revealed nothing new. And the big story is from a source that is anonymous? What are we talking about, baseball's version of deep throat? You have to do better than this.   It was long, drawn and no real "meat" to it. More hype than anything. And I got sucked in with the advertising. Canseco's book was interesting. Great stories and easy to read. At least he gave me something.   I have to agree with some of the critics. Mr. Carroll did a  disservice to his readers by including the nutritional stuff with steroids. Most people I know use a lot of this and it is fine.  It would be like the president says all drugs are bad - cocaine, heroin and cough medicine. Silly example because we all know that cough medicine is not harmful assuming someone does nothing stupid like drink the whole bottle but it does illustrate the point. He was wrong and should have done his homework or avoided the subject altogether since he seems to known pretty much nothing about it.  Anyway, I like Mr. Carroll but this is subpar. Guess that's why it's not selling really well 
 I had the exact same experience as one of the reviewers below.  Hooked up several different video sources and ran and HDMI cable to my Pioneer plasma television.  The first problem I had was an annoying hum from all speakers.  After trying many debug options I finally debugged it to the HDMI connection.  With HDMI connected (several different cables) the hum was there, without it no hum.  In addition I had the same video problem listed before as well.  There was a scrolling line that went slowly up the screen with all video sources.  So I tried to set everything up removing the HDMI cable and just running component video to the plasma.  While the sound was now very good it still had that annoying scroll line on all video sources.  Given that I had to return it.  I just got a Yamaha 661 and am happy with it so far but I had to give up the dream of one HDMI cable to the plasma, too bad 
 This book had potential, but the terrible character developement and choppy flow of the book blew it.  The end leaves you with more questions than the LEFT BEHIND SERIES books do!! 
 Unfortunately, I didn't see the other feedback on this item. I concur with the other buyer. The item you receive is NOT the item pictured. I did find the dimensions in the description, but this is a HUGE platter, like for a whole ham or turkey, not for a typical main dish presentation. Hope they change the image 
 I have found this book difficult to read because of its lack of examples and theorems.Many famous examples and theorems are left as exercises.Many of them are too difficult for a beginner.The book just state some basic defintion and theorem without examples, and even some proofs of the theorems are not complete.Many algorithms are skipped or illustrated badly.I can give no reason for the beginner to buy this book. I would suggest the reader to see "A first Look At Graph Theory" by John O. Clar 
 I found this book to repetitive.  It just keeps going on and on, on how bad Web feels about the death of his 7 team mates.  Also, it has harsh racist descriptions on some characters that don't really add to the story at all.  It just adds to the stereotype of how life is in Annacostia, Washington DC.  One such description is that of the black grandmother of the missing kid.  She is described as a big black woman about the sides of a small car with big breast and lives in a house full of rat excrements. I don't recommend this book at all, but if you are a narrow minded white male, who thinks that he is at the top of the hill looking down on the rest, this book is for you 
 Manfred B. Steger fails at providing an introduction to the topic known as globalization. This book starts out looking like a basic explanation of what globlization is and why it is happening. However it quickly turns into a tirade about how "bad" globalization is and how it is a U.S. plot of some sort. I am disapointed with this book becuase I was looking for easy to read basic pro vs con explanation. Steger also discusses some advanced topics which he may not explain correctly or completely. All of his arguments or either anti-globlization or extreme anti-globlization. Steger goes as far to say what Bin Laden does is good becuase is slows the globilization process 
 This will probably be an unpopular review.  First, there can be no doubt that the men of the platoon of the story did their duty with bravery and competence.  Second, the book is reasonably written and appears to be well researched and thorough.  Having said that, this book seems to try too hard to exaggerate the importance and distinction of the short-term actions of a single platoon.  What is so unusual is that the book itself provides the evidence to counter this repetitive implication.  The actions of the men of this platoon were no more heroic than 90% or more of the line soldiers caught up by the battle of the bulge or any other major action of wars.  The critique that follows is not intended to lessen their sacrifice and bravery, but to try to put it in some perspective.  I include some details of the book.  Do not read on if you want to read this book.  First, the "epic" combat action of the platoon lasted less than a day (about 10-12 hours).  The fighting was intense but no more so (probably less so) than many many other units in the european theater.  As to the claim that their actions were pivotal to the American success in (eventually) repulsing the attack, just look at the recollection of the platoon's own members who state that it was only the unbelievable incompetence of the attacking German forces that delayed their eventual capture.  The platoon commander recalls even early in the battle that the superior force (primarily infantry, enemy tanks only show up later after their capture) could have easily flanked them and overwhelmed them at any time, and simply didn't.  The german tank commander interviewed after the war states that it was traffic jams that delayed his column, not the actions of a small platoon.  The book devotes one chapter to the "epic" (brief) battle.  The rest of the book bounces from the platoon members suffering as POWs, and a superficial account of the surviving 99th division combat actions.  Finally, the medals of distinction.  Only one of the medals (for the platoon leutenant) was recommended by the division's chain of command after the war.  All the rest were requested beginning in 1966 in response to that silver star medal.  The commanding leutenant takes on the crusade to have the rest of his soldiers recognized 20+ years after the fact.  Americans are grateful to all those who fought bravely in wwII (indeed all wars), and we can certainly understand the emotional attachment between the platoon commander and his men....but 4 DSCs, 5 silver stars, and 9 bronze stars?  Why not just hand out 18 medals of honor?  When compared to the continued combat bravery of other people/units in wwII, Korea, and Vietnam, this just pales terribly in comparison.  Even members of the platoon thought the medals were questionable:  "Don't call (me) a hero.  Please don't use that word.  Too many other people did a lot more than I did who were never recognized."   I agree.  When we confuse bravery and competence with true individual heroism sufficient to justify our nation's higher honors, we dilute the significance of those who truly performed amazing feats of distinction.  This may sound like more of a critique of the events than the book.  The link is that the book is much less than advertised (in my opinion).  The book is a decent historical account of what happened in this small component of the war.  For that it is a fair read.  If you expect it to impress you with true heroism and incredible combat action, you'd probably be better to look elsewhere.  It was a waste of time for me 
 This book, like several others in this genre, provides the reader with different nuances on how to brief cases, take lecture notes, study for exams and other components that every other book in this field suggests.  This book is a rather long and difficult read.  It contains a few decent suggestions on study aids, but one can receive this information from practically any other pre-law book or website.  My suggestion is to stick to other pre-law books and not waste your money on this one.  Upcoming 2L 
 I know this is supposed to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, but. to put it simply,I found it to be unreadable although I tried several times 
 I STILL have not received this DVD.  It was ordered on 12/8/06 and was supposed to ship on 12/12/06.  I am very upset that it did not arrive as it was a Christmas gift.  I cannot rate the product as I don't have it.  I sent an e-mail through Amazon to jrmovies several days ago and have not heard from them.  I would appreciate a response or a refund 
 Fragmentation is necessary because of the time it takes to output bits in  large frames on slow serial links. This time is called serialization delay  and it is relevant for low-speed interfaces where delay-sensitive voice  packets might need to wait a long time while a long frame is pushed out the  interface, at say, 64 Kbps. Propagation delay is not the issue. This seems  like a very basic telecommunications 101 issue that the authors should not  have gotten wrong 
 This movie was so stupid, everyone listens to Nina when she is clearly messing with their lives. They are stupid enough to believe her, and well I don't even know what else happens cause I saved myself and changed the channel 
 I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this book, was yet another dread.  The instructions were, at times unclear, and my result was not up to par.  Though the pictures are astounding, especially the cover picture, don't let your eyes, or your tastebuds longing for the food, decieve you 
 When I bought this book, I didn't realize it was mostly just a consolidated writing of Friedman's collumns in the Times.  I think Friedman is a great author with lots of great insights, but he isn't able to go into his ideas in depth as much as I would have liked in a bunch of detached 750-1000 word segments.  Since the sections are arranged chronologically, there also isn't the opportunity to tie the themes together.    If you really like Friedman, then it's worth a read, but if you are in it for just one, I'd read The Lexus and the Olive Tree first.  It is by far his best 
 I have never been one to go with reviews so I ignored the ones that I had read about the bike tipping over and bought it anyway for my 2 year old's birthday. What a mistake! Within 5 seconds of getting on the bike, it tipped over and did so every 2-3 minutes thereafter. Definitely not a safe bike. It may be cute and smaller than some of the others out there, but you'd be better off buying a kettler. Frome now on I'm going to pay more attention to the reviews. What a disappointment 
 The stories in this book leave the reader with no doubt that they are reading Hemingway, but the collection is rather unremarkable.  Typical Hemingway strengths, including strong and descriptive writing of places and  things, are present.  But I found the stories themselves to be weak 
 i had never known that there was a movie made about the life story of one of my very favourite singers patsy cline.well they needn't have bothered as it was a very much by the numbers story something definetely not above anything that you would see as a midday movie on any weekday.i liked both of the main actors,jessica lange and ed harris.the problem for me was that there was no attempt at conveying any real depth to the characters.whilst i appreciate that there has to be some element of fiction in most bio-pics anyone watchimg the movie and not having heard of patsy cline would be none the wiser for her motivations and driving forces.the only saving grace for me was that patsys singing was used in the movie to at least try to convey the quality that others saw in her singing 
 articles weren't anything new. mostly fluff and cosmetic/clothes ads. better info and exercises in Oxygen and Women's M&F. 
 I'm really disappointed in this book.  The overall premise was a solid one, that if you can buy (say) a DVD for $12, watch it, then resell it on eBay for $5, it really only costy ou $7.  The author goes into some of the history and theory of secondary markets, why they work, and why they are important.    Unfortunately, I just gave you the whole book.  He repeats the above 3-5 times a chapter for 10 chapters, and weaves in commercials for his own, drop-shipping company, claiming that only fools or hobbyists would consider selling things on eBay themselves.    I wish this book had been worth the time or money it took to read it, as the topic is a fascinating one, but instead I feel like I was duped into reading a barely disguised brochure for the author's company.  I cannot recommend anything about this book 
 Not sure what happened, but I received my daughter's gift in the mail today. There were no penguins in the box, and but the packaging looked original with no tampering. Beware, if you're ordering from Imaginarium! What a disappointment this was for us 
 "Theory in Landscape Architecture" is a compilation of essays, articles, and book excerpts from numerous authors spanning a period of more than fifty years. It seems as if Swaffield went out of his way to include only the driest, most boring, esoteric, and inane essays to include in this book. Nearly all of them are incredibly difficult to read. Many of them are so abstract that it is nearly impossible to discern what the author is trying to say.   Writing is a form of communication, and if your readers can't even figure out what you're saying, you are not communicating well. In that sense, this book is an excellent example of what happens when a bunch of very intelligent, talented people with dismal communication skills sit down in front of a typewriter or computer and try to explain what's on their minds. In short, this book is an ordeal to read 
 This book has inspired me. I figure that if it can become ubiquitous in airports and make the author some money, why can't I write something similar and soak some up? It is probably the worst written book I have ever read. I bought it in an airport, trusting it would be the typical counter-terrorism/spy junk novel that, though pretty banal, would be nonetheless enjoyable.   Although I have managed to suffer through most of its pages (this morning, about 85-90% the way through I through it in the recycling bin, I just cannot take anymore of it), the storyline is not just unbelievable, but simply silly. The dialogue between characters is unreal--surely most of them need to be medicated or at least slapped back into their senses. One moment somebody will be courteous and another they will snap at little, if any provocation. I don't want to spoil it, but something the president asks to pass with congress was comical and I nearly put the book down as soon as I read it.   I think that Brown's writing is about the quality of a well educated and precocious 14 year old, but certainly not a weathered writer. This was the first Dale Brown book I ever wrote and it goes without saying it will be the last. It's a travesty that I had to pay for this tripe.  Let me put it in perspective: I read Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, a book that was ported in theme into a video game on the XBox and it was a far better book 
 The material is first-rate but his writing style is horrid. His five-part typology of memory doesn't make sense since he is basically repeating the same theme for each type of memory in each chapter. The underlying theme is about the destruction and shattering of the self. Very poorly written and bad organizatino of his material. There are much better and clearer books on the Holocaust! Don't bother with this one 
 I think there is probably a chance that this is the most poorly written textbook I've ever encountered.  I was going to hold off giving it a bad review until I got through the class, but at this rate I'm not even totally sure I will. I've just re-read the difference between nominal and effective interest for (no hyperbole) the 10th time, and I'm no closer to understanding it. Bad examples, useless derivations, poor explaining. I only wish I could give it a zero 
 There is no other explanation. The following quote is all you really need to know to prove that Andrea is unstable and most likely hates who she is. "I want to see a man beaten to a bloody pulp with a high-heel shoved in his mouth, like an apple in the mouth of a pig." - Andrea Dworkin. If a man were to say something like this, I'm sure she'd call for his arrest. 
 this was a not a good book they was alot of stupid things in this book they were trying to tell about plants to eat and not to eat and they had very poor black and white pictures of the plants most of the book is made up of unwanted infromatio 
 I went into this a pretty big Golden Smog fan eager for a new effort from the guys.  With Tweedy's songwriting having taken a great upward swing in recent years and with Louris' departure from the Jayhawks, I was hoping we'd see a few more Tweedy gems and some great tunes from the past few years since Louris' "Rainy Day Music" was released.  Now, while there are some really good songs here, nothing really comes close to the "Red-Headed Stepchilds," "Radio Kings," or "Jennifer Save Mes."  The album lacks something but I can't put my finger on it.  It almost sounds like a band that has too MUCH focus.  Considering Golden Smog started as a buncha musician friends sitting around, drinking beer, and goofing off, this album feels wrong.  It doesn't have that sing-along feel (with the exception of possibly one or two songs) that the first couple albums (and even EP) had.  Just a little lackluster and, considering the amount of Louris has his hand in on this one, almost comes off as an album of Jayhawks throw-aways 
 The problem I was looking for wasn't answered in the book or on the Apple or Microsoft web sites. It isn't a direct instructional book. I had to fumble my way through it and trail and error was the only way I got the answers 
 This won't be received well.  I know that.  But, there's little point in my writing this if I'm not going to be truthful. I've read this book and the book upon which this is written, and this is what I've found:  Joseph Campbell's Skeleton Key purports to explain the incomprehensible "masterwork" Finnegans Wake. It does offer up an explanation of sorts but this explanation, itself, makes little sense. Further, apart from a small "demonstration passage" early in the work, Campbell offers next-to-no evidence that what he divines is in the Wake itself.  Campbell believes that Finnegans Wake is the story of the cyclical nature of man as expressed in the writings of some obscure philosopher named Vico who, for all I can tell, found his greatest glory in the critical commentary on Finnegans Wake. That's well and good, but the Wake is a mass of 600+ pages of senseless rambling. Why does it take Joyce 600+ pages to communicate a story that Campbell can neatly summarize in the first fifteen pages of his work? Because, according to Campbell, Joyce tells this story over and over again in a "dream language."  According to Campbell, the Wake is one tiny story repeated a thousand times, enshrouded in a rebus-like pseudo-language of puns and portmanteaus. The only thing worse than the suspicion that Campbell is just as fradulent as Joyce is the suspicion that, maybe, he's right. If Campbell is right, then the Wake is transformed from a fairly decent practical joke played on the academic community into a nightmare of pointless, wasted effort. His, Joyce's, yours, and mine.  I cannot bring myself to conclude that Campbell was fraudelent; he seems sincere. So, I simply hold out the hope that he was honestly mistaken in his assessment of the work. Of course, it would be impossible to say whether he was right or wrong--the Wake, like the inkblot in a Rorshach test, will accomodate the human need for pattern recognition by supplying almost any concievable image. There's no way to "prove" any interpretation of the Wake right, or any other interpretation wrong. I could just as easily say that it's a tale about the colonization of Mars. I bet you I could find good textual evidence for it, and then defy you to prove it wasn't so.  Campbell, bound and determined to come up with a coherent tale that fits Joyce's almost-words, indeed produces *something*, though it, itself, is only on the borderlands of the rational. But is that something what Joyce had in mind when he sat down? How would we ever know? Those who need to believe that "Joyce was a genius" because that's how they'll build up their own cultural cachet, will continue to believe it no matter what I say. But those who approach the Wake, or this purported exegisis of it, with an open mind will realize that, for thousands of years men claimed to find meaning in tea-leaves and sheep's entrails, and pictures in the stars, but those images and tales lie more in our own minds than in the entities themselves 
 I was incredibly disappointed in this cookbook.  A large number of the recipes seem to be more about proving the varity of foods you CAN cook in the slow cooker, rather than foods it is USEFUL to cook in the slow cooker. Keep in mind that unless you're looking to soften tough meat, you can make almost any slow cooker recipe on the stove if you have an hour or two to babysit it.  Slow cooker recipes that require a lot of babysitting (adding ingredients, stirring, or doing something else in the middle of the cook time) run four to six hours and require you to hang around the house all that time.  I'm a working foodie who uses the slow cooker to make fun, interesting meals that I can leave to cook during the work day.  Between the babysitting required and the less-than-8-hour cook times, I was very disappointed in the number of recipes from this book I could use at all.  I highly recommend Judith Finlayson's books for a better alternative 
 This book tries to link together everything in Stephen King's books.  Sometimes it tries too hard.  Like finding a character name from one book simply mentioned in another.  Not too mind-blowing.  Some of the interconnections were intersting, but overall nothing to write home (or a book) about 
 I mean, nothing made sense in this movie and it literally made my head spin. Nothing but fast cars, severly underweight h00chies, and plenty of rock/hip&hop music. It was like watching an extremely long music video. Sean is supposed to be in high school, but as old as he looked I guess he was on the 10 year plan. On top of that, he talked like Forrest Gump. In order not to go to jail, Sean moves to Japan to live with his dad. Sean was able to find himself a crew real quick. And if he and his friends were suppposedly in high school, how come they had so much time to race, fix cars, and go to parties? Shouldn't they have been studying for entrance crams? If it wasn't for Bow Wow and Vin Diesel (small part at the end), I never would've watched this waste of a film 
 The author missed the point of a quiet life which is that you just do it and enjoy it --- you don't call your friends to do it with you and stop when they cancel.  Another reviewer of Bender's work said that she in "in her head too much" and I completely agree. Stop thinking SO much - just enjoy life - your family. Stop making lists. Stop degrading yourself for the simple process of taking care of yourself, your family and your house. 
 My son ONLY asked for this for Christmas, so I had to get it.  It doesn't do much -- he was bored with it within a few days.  It shoots the harmless "bullets" pretty far, but not easily aimed.  The pincher on our first one didn't work so we had to send it back for a replacement.  Pincher STILL isn't very strong & basically just pushes things around rather than carry them -- it doesn't "lift" objects, just grabs them & drags them around--and you have to hold a button continuously to hold the object.    And LOUD -- VERY LOUD -- the legs hit the floor VERY hard (though I haven't noticed any scratches on the floor).  We have a small house & you can hear the bug from one end to the other.  I would NOT buy this again. There are MUCH more interactive RC toys out there 
 I've been robbed.  I just spent $25 for this hard cover book, and now that I finished it - I feel like burning it! I feel like the authors have jerked me around, led me along so I spent my hard earned money on their three goldarned books - and for what?  Let me explain. When you start an alternative history book on any  era, you begin with a question.  "What would have happened if something had gone differently"  . Here the authors are free to pick from the hundreds of critical events and make a point of departure.  The authors choose a very interesting one. What if Lee have listened to Longstreets advice and made a massive flanking movement to the South at Gettysburg.  The first book of this trilogy covered these fictional events with not only a truely outstanding depth of knowlege of the era, but a breathtaking mastery of suspence and pacing. This was an adventure novel of the first water. A real page-turner with such detail that you felt you were present at actual events depicted in the book. Staying well within the bounds of the possible, it was utterly convincing - even to the knowledgeable reader.  The second novel was not quite as good as the first but it still had fire and held our interest well.  The end of the second novel left the Confederacy in possession of Baltimore - America's third largest city - with a large population (which about half were sympathitic to the Southern cause)and loaded with heavy industry and the technical craftsmen that the South so desperately needed. There was a major diplomatic initutive that won the French over to extending recognition to the Confederacy - there is even some exposition on the French Emperor deciding to dispatch not only troops but state-of-the-art sea going iron clad warships from the French Navy to aid the Confederates (and secure a firmer foot hold in Mexico, naturalmont).  There was an extensive dialogue with a leading Jewish intelectual in Baltimore where some broad hints were dropped about possible last ditch efforts to arm some of the Souths blacks to refil the depleated Confederate ranks.  The second novel ends August 22, 1963. We are left with all these interesting possibilities. All these interesting avenues for the alternate history author to explore.  I bought the third novel and rushed home to read it. As I turned the pages a growing sense of dread filled me - the authors were rushing things, closing off Confederate hopes with such obvious heavy handed partiallity.   You always see this near the end of a cheap potboiler - the bad guys, who have previously been masterful and clever, quite suddenly become increadibly stupid and make mistake after mistake, while the good guys, who have struggled all the way through the book to put two and two together, are suddenly geniuses and have ever possible break falls their way.  So it was with this book. You have a stupid and drunken Southerner assigned to oversee the vitally stategic B&O railroad main yard. The crafty (and openly partison to the North) yard superintendant not only delays critical Southen supplies and troop movements, he orchestrates a major campaign of sabotage and even sends one of his men to inform the Union forces of these  critical Confederate plans - all without getting caught or even suspected by those dim wit southerners.  You could tell it was all a set up from there, the sense of credibility is gone. Everything and I mean everything goes wrong for those darn rebels. Once the authors partisonship is out in the open, it is clear that history will be repeating itself here.  The third book ends with the South's ignoble defeat- now note this carefully - Lee surrenders on August 30, 1863.   THIS IS ONLY EIGHT DAYS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND NOVEL ! You get what I mean by the authors rushing things. And that, friends, is not only straining credibility, it throws it to the winds.   To use one typical example - the Noble Army of the Potomic which after its smashing defeat at Gettysburg took a full month to recover, somehow after an even more devistating defeat is able to rest, reorganize, resupply and move into position to attack Baltimore with 15,000 troops - after just 9 days - yea, right.   The pathetic Confederates, somehow have not managed to make any improvements to Baltimore's existing fortificatins, can not seem to even delay a daylight amphibious landing, nor do they fight house to house nor deploy mobile artillery to delay the advance. On the other hand, the dashing Union calvalry, storms into Frederick, and in 3 hours whips up a bomb train to take out a stone bridge, while the stupid Confederates, who have been in full possession of Baltamore for a month, can not round up enough gunpowder to blow up a similar bridge. Thus Baltimore not only falls with hardly a shot, the entire infrastructure is intact!!??!!. Wow, what a break for the good guys ;-)   This third book is a not just a total disapointment - it is a rip-off. Having raised all these interesting ideas and giving the South two absolutely smashing (if hard faught) victories - the authors whip out the climax - the totally collapse of the Southern armies like a cheap tent in just one week.  In case anyone has forgotten, even without those smashing victories and the possession of the critical city of Baltimore, the South managed to fight on - dispite General Grants best efforts until 1865 !  This book was a cruel disappointment. There was no follow up of all the interesting ideas raised in the second book. It seems like the authors lost interest and just slapped together a jury rigged ending to please the house.  Yep - the good guys won, (yawn).  One had hoped for more courage and intelectual honesty from the authors 
 I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the  "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me 
  This author has surly become disallusioned with his religion and is trying to bend it to his liking 
 When they originally aired this Sullivan Christmas Special on network television a few years ago, it was packed with oldie rock 'n roll clips as well as old Sullivan holiday clips. On the TV special were classic performances by Neil Diamond, the Animals, Petula Clark, Sam & Dave, etc etc. For some reason they wiped all of those great clips and left only the Christmas-oriented performances on the DVD release. On other Sullivan DVD releases, they released pretty much the same content as the TV specials. I cry FOUL on this one! 
 There are review questions which do not match the text in the chapters.  I do not know whether to trust the content 
 I'm sorry but I must agree with others here that this was a very slow, confusing BORING book! I've heard about Linda Barnes and was told she's a good writer - not in this book! I think maybe it could have possibly been better by cutting at least 100 pages! (Yes, I put all those extra words in on purpose!) I really do NOT have to know every stupid detail about how she gets from point A to point B! Really! I haven't read (nor will I ever read) any of her previous books so the whole thread with her Little Sister was confusing and ... no necessary. I only gave the book two stars for a great premise. Too bad it was wasted 
 Not the type of music I had envisioned...much slower than I was hoping for. 
 I thought it was pretty bad. Hostel was better than this crap. I mean it was ok in some parts but I didn't expect much. It's not even scary. I can't wait to watch Hostel 2 when it comes out 
 I am appalled at the greed that Disney must have to milk out a classic like "The Absent Minded Professer". I found this to be one of the worst if not the worst remake of any movie. I found the plot to be too embelished as it made for the relationship between the characters played by Robin Williams and Marsha Gay-Hayden to be one of where it either tried to remake the safe and easy happy ending that's throughout all Disney movies, or it showed to be one where the parties had to wear their hearts out on their sleeves. I also feel that with the Character of "Flubber" it was a waste of time considering I don't remember any merchandising from the character. They should've stayed with the bouncing rubber balls from the original. I also feel that with the promotion of the Flubber substance that it was all shallow, and commericial as where in the original it was going to be put to good use in the military, and here it was to make a buck. I feel that there are some movies that are best to just be left in original state, and not be remade, and this is one of them. 
 I bought this by mistake-thought I was buying book of same title by Lolly Winston...what a disappointment. These 20-something novels are something else...boo hoo hoo...life isn't perfect, but wait-then suddenly it is! Give me a break...I know it is fiction but don't readers want some real life in their books anymore?? Maybe not...that might require thinking.. 
 I'm appalled at this marketing.  I've read every book Mr. Woods has written and have enjoyed them all.  This type of marketing should not be allowed. It would have been simple to make the Cover obvious as to contents.  For those who have not read the novels it's a good deal, otherwise very disappointing advertising 
 The play itself was good, but the quality of video and sound was very bad all through the DVD. The sound quality near the end of play was too bad with irregular flattering in sound and video or intermittend drop out of sound. 
 RELIC was great. This is a mess in which the characters make zero sense and the action is almost preordained.  The biggest fault lies not with the plot or the action but with characterization. There is no main character, just several with  varying degrees of visibility.  The story was never personal since it came from so many different directions.  A filthy rich man has 3 sons sired by 3 wives.  He raises them as many parents do - pushing, pushing, pushing around the clock. One lives beyond his means, another goes hippy with fake gurus while the third is steered away from his first love (dinosaurs) into the world of vetinary medicine. All men receive a summons to his house for an important announcement.  The house is empty save for a video - he has gone to die (cancer) and is buried "somewhere" in the world. Their mission - find his tomb and collect the treasure buried with him including an ancient Codex in Mayan containting cures from native plants.   So, using the oldest plot device in history, the chase, we plunge ahead.  The vet meets up with a feminist right out of the 70s, prickly, asserting the rights of womanhood every chance she gets. She's the type that screams sexual harassment over a swimsuit calendar. The sons split and search on their own but of course are reunited in (of all places) Honduras.  Along the way they are shot, attacked by Indians, soldiers, animals, insects, face starvation and non-stop rain.  It is never explaind how a single old man (with cancer yet) manages to transport a huge treasure all by himself but let's not get technical.    Needless to say a bad guy appears, a former partner who is an almost likeable sociopath. You can write the rest of the tale - they find the tomb, dad is still alive (don't ask), bad man shows up, gets killed and the kids divide the treasure and reconcile with repentant dad before he conveniently dies. Somewhere along the way, tough gal blurts out she is in love with the vet so they hook up and start translating the Codex for "humanity". Despite  this treasure trove of ancient wisdom, the average Mayan lifespan was less than 30 years - LOL 
 SAVE YOUR SELF DOSH AND THE PAIN OF READING THESE BOOKS THAT ARE FROM THE ERA OF LEAVE IT TO BEAVER AND BRADY BUNCH! SWEET BUT VERY UNREAL FOR TODAYS WORLD. S.WHITIN 
 This canister will crack and stop sealing with in weeks of purchase.   I tried to get the mfg. to honor their warranty.   I am speach impaired and have to use digital methods to communicate.  They would only talk about it over the phone.   They refused to use other methods.  I will never buy another one of their products.   You shouldn't either 
 I just purchased this book, and I was really excited when I received it.  However, after 5 attempts of trying to install the CD-ROM, I gave up, and... the worest thing is, I tried to visit the website the book provided, in order to get to contact with them & ask for help... I was not allowed to view the page... cuz they blocked a lot of IP address, and the cable company that I have is on their list.........   If you want to get a USEFUL CD-ROM for drug reference, don't get this book... it will cause you a lot of headache & troubles.  Get Nursing200X drug handbook published by Springhouse.  The software is good, and I never had any problem with it 
 I love the History Channel, have infinite respect for the AVG, love John Wayne films, and lived two years in the part of China where Flying Tigers is set.  So, you'd think I might adore this film?  I had hoped so, but unfortunately Republic pictures made this opus on the cheap.  John Wayne plays a fictional commander of the American Volunteer Group, somewhere between Claire Chennault and Pappy Boygnton.  He does his best to carry the film, and does OK, but he can't carry it alone.  Bad effects, cheap stock footage, flimsy sets, and bad script all plague TIGERS.  Republic made little effort to hide the California filming location and even used the WRONG PLANES!  There is little mention of the OSS-AVG connection, and the film was made too early on to be a good history of the AVG, even if it were accurate.  The heroes of the AVG deserve better than TIGERS; this film isn't a tribute to them, it's a sloppy, propaganda film that does them little service 
 There's nothing in this book that could not be learned during one hour net-surfing the more mundane, hum-drum satsang sites on offer.  Nick "Arjuna" Ardagh is first and foremost a new-age entrepreneur not a true spiritual writer.  His latest book reads like piece of vanity marketing for those quoted. However, it fails to go anywhere but to the superficial which is exactly what we don't need.  Arjuna is reasonable at spotting conceptual trends but is not sio able to follow them to their conclusion i.e real freedom. Just see any of his video presentations over the past few years. This book is any no-brainer with little practical value.  I'd recommend any books by Lee Lozowick, Adi Da, Dave Oshana or Lobsang Rampa over Nick's latest offering 
 All that I have to say that this book left out A LOT of stuff. Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE fan of Star Wars, but everyone who reads this book deserves to know more than what this book tells them 
 DON'T GET THIS BOOK!  All it has are other people's essays and some questions.  Although the answers to the questions are available, as well as the explanation, it does not help!  There is NO information about US History.  It was a big disappointment. [.... 
 This man is another example of our over-affluent society's attempt to distract itself from existential angst via the myth that we should all be happy and feel good. Deepak Chopra has grown very rich catering to the alienation of misguided Marin County yuppies. Sleep is important, as is taking care of our bodies and minds, but do we need a smarmy swami to tell us this? Basic common sense (drink a lot of water...) is sugar-coated in pseudo-spiritual jargon, insulting the intelligence of anyone other than self-help-junkies and cult-bait. Can't sleep? Use the 17 bucks to buy a real book, and read it in bed. Or buy a vibrator 
 Everyone loves Rose, the first narrator of this story and the central character in the book.  Her mother loves her, her first husband, Sister Evangeline, her best friend, her second husband, and her daughter.  The only people with any real reason to love this woman are her mother and daughter, both of whome she abandons completely to work as a cook in an unwed mother's home for almost no pay for 15 years without a vacation or ever having dinner at home alone with her family.  She is completely unlovable in that the only feeling she ever expresses is toward her mother.  She says she misses her everyday.  So why does she never go back to see her before she dies?  Why does she never share with her the granddaughter that she took away from her?  Rose's idea of fun is to drive aimlessly, rent a hotel room on the coast, sit on the bed for five minutes, and drive all night to be home to the husband she doesn't love by morning.  It's idiotic.  Apparently this episode was so much fun to Rose that 15 years after it happened she relates it to her daughter as oh yes, it was so much fun.  Sounds like a blast.  She can't even carry on a conversation, much less show any tenderness or affection.  It makes the people around her who love her so much seem ridiculous.  Son can barely stand to go into the kitchen at St. Elizabeth's after she leaves because he misses her so much, even though she never considered his feelings at all when she named her child Cecelia against his wishes because it held such a painful memory for him, and when she left him to go live by herself in the small cottage.  Also Sister Evangeline confides in Cecelia that she misses Rose so much she can hardly bear it.  Why?  She was a humorless, inconsiderate (to put it mildly), cold-hearted bore.  Cecelia is the only one totally frustrated by her mother, as she should be, but even she accepts her behavior in the end.  It was a well written book that you thought might lead somewhere but went absolutely nowhere, like Rose.  When she leaves you wonder what new relationships is she striking up that she could not care less about now?  I won't read Bel Canto or the Magician's Assistant.  This book was foolish in the extreme and completely pointless 
 I own several great digital cameras. It seems like I get one for each use - one with good zoom, another camera for its good flash use in lowlight and others. This one I wanted for the high MP in a small compact size that I can put into my pocket. The first few photos were great, taken outdoors in my sunny patio. Then every picture I took after that (same settings - fine, HQ, poster 10m etc... and vertical lines started showing on the LCD screen and the pictures were all washed out. When I download them on the computer, they look exactly that way too - with the lines and almost all white. I've played around with the settings (and I do know how to work them) but still it does the same. So time to return to find a better one. That's too bad since I read some good reviews and wanted to have it 
 I'm sorry, but I did not like this book.  Her first, Black Rubber Dress, I couldn't put down. I really enjoyed it.  This one to me was boring and seemed to drag on and on.  It was almost to the last chapters before it started heating up and became interesting.  This is one I would not recommend or keep 
 I disagree with all others who reviewed this album. This album is somewhat decent for its time ('94) but overall, the beats are garbage. I think Eiht really stepped up his game when he came out with Death Threatz. The beats on that album are great and I give that album 5 stars 
 Jean Rabe is perhaps best known in the Dragonlance fan-community for her `Dragons of a New Age' trilogy. The Dawning of a New Age, The Day of the Tempest, and The Eve of the Maelstrom were the first Dragonlance books to come out after Weis and Hickman's Dragons of Summer Flame. Rabe's trilogy ushered the world of Krynn into its new age; the Fifth Age, known as the Age of Mortals. Opinions on these books vary, though none can deny that the changes made to the world were drastic and irreversible. I, personally, was disgusted with what was done to the world I'd been escaping to since I was nine years old. I was horrified by the destruction of Kendermore, and the `Dragon Purge' really irritated me. The writing, however, was quite good. I found myself enjoying Rabe's characters, despite being nauseated by the story. Because of her fantastic cast, I was able to read through all there books without any trouble. However, I could never say that I `enjoyed' them, because... Well, let's face it. Krynn was raped and abused and can never, ever be the same again. Change is good, but the author had trouble with the `global scale' of things. I was very displeased, overall, with these books.  Years later, a new trilogy came out. `The Dhamon Saga', which focused on arguably the main character from Rabe's first trilogy. I picked these books up as they came out with a great deal of hesitation, expecting the chances that I would hate them to be very high. However, I was mistaken. These books, while not the absolute best that I've read, were quite good. Her characters, once again, intrigued me. Her story was original, and -small scale-. No more of those world-changing events she had so much trouble with in the first round... This was a trilogy about a man, not about a world or a grand quest. It was about individual character interactions, progressions, and relationships. It was fantastic, believable, and definitely helped redeem the author's standing in my eyes.  So, when `Lake of Death' came out, I was thrilled. "Yes!" I thought, "Another great Dhamon book!" Wrong. I can't even finish this. It was, quite simply, not worth the money I spent on it. Sure, the story telling is fine. The characters are the same ones I loved before. But the horrible, -horrible- inconsistencies make me want to puke different colors all over the pages. At least then it would be something worth looking at. Despite having written in the Dragonlance world for YEARS, Rabe seems to have forgotten basic Krynn chronology. Sorry, Jean, draconians are NOT `centuries old'. They were created for the War of the Lance, in the year 342 AC. (That's about 85 years before the War of Souls.) Some things just don't even make any sense at all, and left me wondering what the heck Rabe was thinking when she wrote that. Or, what the heck her editor's were thinking. (Compare the description of a certain body of water found in this book to the description of the same lake found in Douglas Nile's new book, `Wizard's Conclave', which hit shelves in June, for an example of this.)  All in all: Jean, I love your characters. I really do. You're a gifted writer, with a lot of talent. (You made me cry over a kobold's death, for god's sake. That character was truly beautiful.) But this book will go unfinished, at least for the time being. I just can't get through it. I've tried. One thing after another make it impossible for me to see it through to its completion. I haven't lost complete faith, but this was a major disappointment. 
 I recently purchased this software and had to uninstall it.  In my case, I was unable to get into my Quicken account, which is password protected.  One of the features of Confidential is an "Information Vault" which stores all passwords.  I was prompted to enter the Quicken one as well, but chose not to as I felt this would defeat the purpose of having a password set up in the first place.  After that, when I would enter the Quicken password, my machine would just hang up.  The only way I could get in was by opening it in safe mode.    I believe that this product sounds appealing on the surface, but when you get down to it, it promises more than it can deliver.  I also think that when it comes to internet security, the best solution is to take reasonable precaution.  If you respond to an e-mail requesting your account numbers and passwords, a software package is not going to save you.  I purchased this product based on my previous experience with Norton products and have been quite satisfied with their performance.  Thus, I was extremely disappointed with this product 
 i have not recieved this book.  i have had surgery and forgot about it.  can you please chec 
 The authors seemed to spend more time asking you if you really, really, really want to get a poodle, considering all the work and money they take, than on giving valuable information.  Not very helpful to those of us who already have a poodle and want to learn more about our dog/puppy, and caring for them.  It does have chapters on care and grooming, etc, but for the first several chapters it seemed to be cautioning people away from getting a poodle, at least that was the impression I had 
 Ok, so the song playing when Brian goes and we see mia for the first time is a song called "Deep Enough (Urban remix)" by Live.  I have the other songs written down, including the one played between the two buildings, so I will find them and tell you.  If you all want only the songs that were actually in the movie, rent the dvd, and take about ten minutes to watch the credits and write down the song names and artists.  That's how I have only the songs that are in the movie 
 On the positive side, this book contains an enormous quantity of well-documented detail and scholarship.  On the negative side, the writing is colorless and, to my eye, devoid of any unifying theme.  Even someone seriously interested in the history of the period will find it soporific.  Having struggled to the end, I still cannot decide if the juice was worth the squeeze 
 This is much better than what used to be written on Hinduism in the West.  But Flood still has to travel some more distance. This book still speaks of  the Aryan invasions although archaeologists have abandoned that racist  theory 
 I was interested in reading the book becasue I recently returned to playing the piano after 30 years and I thought it would be fun to read someone else's experience on the trials and tribulations learning or relearning the music and buying a piano.  Unfortunately, Mr. Adam's short reminisecne was short on information about actual playing and such and more about his very busy life with NPR.  His book also suffers from "name dropitis" and a sometimes an elitist tone.  Passages about "overfed" mall shoppers in "stonewashed" jeans -- followed by the author's refuge to an organic juice bar was plebian writing.  I was most appalled by the fact that Mr. Adams purchases an incredibly expensive piano before even being able to read music!  I found his struggle and his inability to "get going" and play very inaccessible to me as reader 
 Evidently, this book does not target people starting out in Public Relations. I am a VP of Marketing in a start-up company looking to get some feel for the value of PR. I found this book utterly unintelligible. I was also irritated by the constant reference to `clarity of communication' - advice that the author clearly ignores. Why is `plain English' considered to be such a crime? After reading this on a 3 hour flight from Denver to New York, I was none the wiser about PR and given the significant weight of the book, decided to leave it on the plane. This is a text for PR academics 
 If your christian dont buy this,It has nothing to do with the 5 books of Moses,also no true idea on religion 
 It's hard not to like Doreen Virtue and all she talks about. She talks of many uplifting things. But then she downplays the role of Christ in the world. He is put at the status level of Ghandi and Buddha! Christians understand that this is a great falsehood.   So even though some good comes of following Doreen, her Source is not Christian angels and Christ. If you keep reading her stuff you'll be getting help from fairies, unicorns and angels instead of God himself. You decide if that's who you want to set your faith in.  As I said I like the woman and enjoyed her books I read, but after much soul searching I realized I was subtlely being brainwashed into putting my faith in the wrong things. So I must give the book one star because it's the only option available 
 As a stand-alone reference this book offers very little to anyone looking to implement a six sigma program in healthcare. The book fails to address the organizational and strategic issues related to implementing a comprehensive process improvement strategy in any type of organization, let alone a healthcare organization. The book would have us believe that six sigma is the application of statistical problem solving techniques to traditional quality improvement programs. If it were that simple, many healthcare organizations have been practicing six sigma for over 15 years. Someone in healthcare looking to find out what six sigma is all about would likely be left with the impression that six sigma is just the latest buzzword.  On the other hand, the book does provide some nice case studies that may be useful for a non-statistician looking to strengthen their process improvement tool belt. Either the authors don't really understand what six sigma is all about or they are just attempting to exploit the market by combining the words six sigma and healthcare in the title.  Most healthcare professional would do better to look at the GE related references on the subject 
 In his frequent jousts with critics and reviewers, MacDonald always takes the stance that his books do not justify anti-semitism; they merely describe it as a scientifically understandable, indeed predictable, response to certain supposed Jewish traits that he has identified as elements of a long-term Jewish evolutionary strategy.  (Many of these criticisms and rejoinders can be found on his own website.)  In other words, he is claiming the neutrality of an investigating scientist, and always acts offended when people accuse him of racism or anti-semitism.  If that's the case, why is he a frequent contributor to The Occidental Quarterly?  That journal's own statement of principles says, first, that "the West is a cultural compound of our Classical, Christian, and Germanic past," and, second, that "race informs culture."  (You'll also find, under principle 4, the lovely statement that "the European identity of the United States and its people should be maintained.")  Case closed.  This is an educated racist who is dressing up his bigotry in pseudo-academic language; all he means to say is that Jews have brought on their own persecution.  And I'm shocked that he has taken in so many readers.  Shame on Praeger for publishing these books 
 Jing Wong truly sinks to a new low with this movie.  Jet has one oustanding action sequence but other than that, he just isn't used.    Jacky Cheung is the star of this movie and plays an actor who absolutely never uses stunt doubles.  It became apparent within 5 minutes that this movie was made to make fun of Jackie Chan.  Of course it didn't have to be so obvious but Jing Wong just keeps driving it into your head that he does his own stunts.  So if you are familiar with Jing then you know this isn't going to be a tribute to Jackie.  Oh no, it is a punch to the throat through the movie screen.  Jet Li plays Cheung's bodyguard and ends up doing the a stunt for him.  After setting up his stupid Jackie Chan character, Jing tries to do a remake of Die Hard.  Remember how you never knew what Bruce Willis was going to do and it was always surprising?  Well Jing makes about the worst movie possible from here on.  Instead of being clever, he makes Jet just keep storming in on the hostages and then flee.  At one point he takes a helicopter up and starts shooting right into the buiding at the main bad guy with all of the hostages standing around.  After the helicopter crashes into the side of the building it doesn't blow up, it just destroys everything on that floor.  So other than one outstanding action sequence between Jet Li and Ben Lam(guy with sunglasses), this movie is a complete waste of time.  Even Billy Chow couldn't save this one.  Of course it would help if Wong Jing was smart enough to capitalize on the success of Billy Chow and Jet Li in 'Fist of Legend', but instead we don't get to see them fight and get to look at Billy Chow in a thong.  Yeah, that it just what I am looking for.    The Universal Laser and Video company version is OK but the imbedded subtitles are sometimes hard to read.  There is a version of this released by Dimension Video(grrrr)that has been retitled Meltdown and has been shortened by 10 minutes and also has gotten a horrible new soundtrack including English dubbing and rap music replacing what was in the original.  Doesn't matter which one you get because the Chinese version isn't really any better since it is not a good movie to begin with.   
 "When will it end?? NEVER! MUWHAHAHAHAHA!"  REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*****  First off, up until this point, I found the series moderately entertaining (especially the 2nd book). Granted, in every book, there are certain aspects of Jordan's redundant writing that are very annoying. For instance, the childish, and extremely immature thoughts and actions of the female characters. Realistically, in a time period like that, if a woman acted as arrogant and sexist as they do in this book series, they would get a good "thumping" and be forced to learn from their mistakes (As would anyone really). Instead, the men grovel like slaves around the women. It's very annoying and infinitely un-realistic. Even in fantasy, there are certain rules one must follow pertaining to the characteristics of the human race. Hardly anyone in this series of books makes a rational, practical decision. There is hardly any Logic here, and when someone who is supposedly "Wise" speaks up, its merely common sense that hopefully everyone in real life should, and probably does know. Most of the so-called "intellectual" sayings in this book bassically translate to somthing a 10 year-old kid would know.  Human characteristics aside, Jordan has a great attention to detail when it comes to scenery (Clothing, geography, battle fields etc...) Hardly anything is left out. I suppose this is good, if one really wants to leave the real world and become part of the reality that Jordan has created.   But here we are...at the 5th book. I hate to say it, but not enough happened in the time-line to justify 5 long books. Sometimes, it is hard to tell just how much time has passed from one point to another. Jordan has virtually no sense of time at all in these books. This can either be as an excuse for such a long series, or its just basically poor writing. I'm a little undecided on that.   This book is full of the usual aspects that the previous 4 had:  1. Most of the men can't think for themselves (However there are a number of Characters that I do like allot. Uno, Julian, Matt, Asmodean, Lan, Thom, Loial (Who isn't even in this one..go figure) What happened to Elays?? Uhg..  2. The female characters whine and complain like my 2 year old daughter  3. Rand's increase in the One Power, is directly proportional to how much of a complete idiot he is turning into. It all started when he absolutely refused to believe he was the Dragon Reborn (End of Book 1 I believe). It takes him a number of books to finally stop being so damn immature and finally step up, and take action. This is the ultimate annoying aspect in this series. Rand attains the 'Sword that cannot be touched'. A weapon that can level cities...What does he do? Shoves it into the floor at the Stone Of Tear, and scampers off into the woods for another adventure. Wow..smart huh?   4. The Forsaken are scheming as usual. It's a mystery to me that they were picked by the Dark One. Powerful as they may be, they're mostly stupid, too paranoid, and un-trustworthy of one another. It would make more sense to create a truce and simply eliminate Rand. They could. Everyone knows they could. But they don't...Frustration level ever increasing...  This series seems to remind me of a poorly written play with too many characters to have on stage at any given time. Jordan seems to shove various ones on for certain amounts of time, then shove them off, with hardly a word of goodbye.   Something that I must point out is the way Jordan decides to kill off, or deal with the "Evil" characters. This whole re-incarnation nonsense is spoiling the importance, and fear of death. I believe it is wrong to kill off so many "Evil" characters at one time. Characters that have potential are eliminated.  And yes...Asmodean. Here comes my biggest gripe of all.. I rather liked Asmodean, his character was interesting, and it was rather refreshing to have someone cross over from the "Evil" side, to "Good" side (Even if it was un-willingly). He does provide a lot of insight for Rand. If I was a Forsaken, I would defiantly cross over to Rand's side, it only makes sense. BUT...Instead of keeping Asmodean alive and allowing him to help Rand with his great struggle...He's killed off at the end of the book.   Right there, Jordan drops a huge amount of story potential, and trades it for the same, un-inventive, one-sided drivel that the rest of this book contains. Then Rand goes on to Kill Rhavin. Another interesting Character wasted. Lanfear has also been killed (as far as we know). Again, another interesting character wasted. I could care less about Moraine. After the first book, her character is basically rendered useless, and is completely unneeded.   All in all, Jordan has a tendency to do away with the interesting characters (Hurin, Ingtar, Elays etc..) And keep the boring, immature ones. (Nynaeve, Egwene, Elayne, Aviendha etc...)   The series is simply too long, and I'm positive it has over 1000 pages of material that needs to be discarded. If Lord of Chaos is as bad as this one, I'm burning my collection and sending the remains to Jordan's house.   So, to those who are in the midst of this series like I am, I say to you; 'Welcome back my friends, to the show that never ends'.  
 Poorly written, poorly researched -- it's as if the writer had tried put together a great work of art from torn bits of cocktail napkins... and had a hard time filling in the gaping spaces between 
 This book was not as compelling as I had hoped.   As an Antipodeam, I thought that Conway was unfair to Australia with her portrayal of its society.   Her ideas about Australia seem to have been clouded by her  unpleasant family life.   I am also opposed to her portrayal of the United  States in the 1960s as the land of true intellectual freedom and  dedication.   This ignores important and equally valuable contemporary  Australian scholarship 
 Clancy has gotten the best-selling writer thing down to a formula: a taut, suspenseful plot populated by militaristic all-American heroes and the evil-doers de jour. His merit lies in coming up with gripping, if improbable, settings for his stock characters. On the other hand, his actual writing is mediocre, unimaginative, and devoid of art.  Rainbow Six is the conservative Clancy's broadside against the environmental movement. The book's basic (and typically unbelievable) premise is that, in order to save the planet, fanatical environmentalists in charge of a major corporation devise a plot to kill off nearly all of mankind, while the brave men of the elite multinational force to which the title refers strive to thwart them. The unbelievable part: environmentalists in charge of a major corporation! Everybody knows that all the big corporations are in the capable hands of patriotic, polluting, profiteering Republicans 
 Received the DXG-506V yesterday and was surprised to find out that it had no tripod mount. Many sites showed a light and tripod as optional accessories for this unit but there is no way to mount these accessories to the cam. This is kind of like false advertising. This is a no deal for me because the cam is so dark in normal indoor lighting situations as compared to other cams at similar prices (like the optimus that radio shack sells) and there is also no image stabilization. Geez, how hard would it have been to put a simple ¼ inch plastic mount on the bottom. As for sound, the built in microphone produces too much hiss and is located in a place that does not allow it to pick up the voices and sounds of what you are shooting. You can hear yourself talking great but not the person you are shooting. That is pretty bad. The resulting audio with the hiss sounds like a cheap 1970's cassette tape recorder.  The best thing this cam has going for it is that it can save movies in AVI, MOV or ASX format at different resolutions which is why I got it in the first place. It is also pretty easy to learn and its buttons and functions seem fairly logical. It also has a lens cap.   My advice to DXG is this.  1.	Add a tripod mount. 2.	Move the microphone forward and do something about that hiss and tinny sound or perhaps add a mic jack so that I can use an external microphone. That would be sweet. 3.	Improve the cam so that it will do a better job in normal indoor lighting situations. The optional settings do nothing to improve this. I tried them all.  Bottom line is that I would have kept this cam if it had a tripod mount. There are just too many situations that this comes in handy and it would have allowed me to add a light to the cam for indoor use. 
 Sorry, but this is both an unimportant work, and pornographic (when every chapter revolves around one sex scene, I think it is safe to accuse a book of being pornographic).  Understandably, it has been written that this book was intended to be exploitative, and di Prima wrote it because she needed money.  Great.  I hold nothing against writers doing what they need to do to make a living.  If I recall correctly, Stephen King got his start writing articles for Playboy.  With all that said, however, I think it is also important not to hold a book to unrealistic expectations, simply because of the author.  Porn, porn, porn.  Let's see: chapter 1, sex with Ivan.  Chapter 2, recollection of the first time she had sex with Ivan.  Chapter 3, sex with Robin (a man in love with Ivan).  Chapter 4, Sex with Tomi (a female friend).  Chapter 5, Tomi has sex with Tomi's brother.  Chapter 6, Sex with 4 other women.  Chapter 7, sex with Tomi's father Serge.  Chapter 8, sex with young Jack and some guy with big ears while runaway girl watches.  And so it goes, through all the chapters.  So, if you're looking for a "spank" book, then check it out.  If you're looking for a book about the beats from a woman's perspective (as it is boldly proclaimed on the front cover), look somewhere else. 
 I'm giving it two stars, though it may deserve one more, to balance out the rave reviews by others.  Take warning, this book is not what it appears to be.  The cover looks appealing, the subtitle is misleading.  There are better books to help you "discover greater creativity and artistic confidence."  (One is Paint Happy by Cristina Acosta.)  This book is mostly about keeping artistic track of your travels throughout the world in the form of a creative journal.  It does also include ideas for making business meetings more entertaining--i.e., by drawing your colleagues--but many of those ideas may not appeal to  stay-at-home or housewife types of people (which I am).  About half of the activities are less exotic, but there were too many exotic or really boring ones for my taste.  The book is not set up very well.  The chapter titles are clear enough, but the pages are sort of mushy looking.  It is not easy to tell at a glance if the page is a project page or a sample of other peoples' art page; it doesn't seem to have many projects.  The main media used in the book were drawing and watercolor.  The collage section was kind of nice.  Most of the projects are for pages in your creative journal, not for paintings you might want to hang up somewhere, but she does show you how to develop some the ideas into paintings, which is nice.  All in all though, this book just didn't appeal to me.  It should have been crammed full of fun ideas and it wasn't.  My advice is to look through the book completely before you buy it because it is an expense and it takes up space 
 I wanted to like this book, but I had to give up in the end. If the overall vignette concept is attractive enough, the execution of detail isn't -- Kosinski can't write. He tries and eventually fails to convey what he deems important, whereas the reader is always expected to discover "depth" in simplicity. Nothing to be recommended for 
 I bought this and Brown's Intro to NT.  The Brown book, at 1/3 the price is superior in the quality of the book itself, and in my opinion, in the writing as well. That said, Kee's book is a good intro to the NT - just fantastically overpriced for what you get. 
 I agree, where is the DVD? $200 for a soon to be obsolete format?? Get real!!!! This is an excellent mini-series on the worse medium 
 I agree with the reviewer who called it a "bogus treatise." I read this book after personally witnessing a remote viewing experiment (documented on my website). I did not read the whole book, only chapters 1-7 and 16 (I wasn't interested in debunking Uri Geller). Chapter 3 begins with a Robert Browning quote "...you'll find what you desire", I assume targeted at "believers" in the paranormal. But it equally applies to the authors. In their "replication" of Targ's remote viewing experiments the authors selected as the viewers a few students and a housewife who "believed themselves to be psychic to some degree." Of course, they did not believe in the existence of the phenomena they were testing -- otherwise they might have allowed themselves to make the assumption that it might require someone who practices. If you were testing "exceptional athletic abilities" would you select a subject who played softball once a year and "believed he was athletic to some degree" or would you select a professional athlete?  For remote viewing, you could select members of the Hawaii Remote Viewers' Guild, for example.  Their intent was not to study the phenomena using an open-minded scientific approach, but to "debunk" it - in the typical sarcastic style 
 At the risk of sounding egotistical, I consider myself a fairly intelligent person, which is why I am loathe to admit that I didn't understand the ending!!! Who was this person in Cuba? It didn't sound like it was Craig Bowman using a dead person's name, because of some physical characteristics that couldn't be faked. If anybody has an idea what the ending meant.   But let's forget the incomprehensible ending for a moment. This book has more potholes than the Sea of Holes in Yellow Submarine. Among them:   What was the killer's motive? Who sent the thugs to scare the girls? NONE of this is ever explained!!!  I have always been an avid reader of Robin Cook's books, but this one is a huge disappointment. Maybe this was accidentally sent to the publisher before it was finished!

 Your rebate submission has been received. Unfortunately your rebate is denied for the following reasons: REQUEST POSTMARKED AFTER CLOSE OF PROGRAM DEADLINE REQUIRED POSTMARK BEFORE 09/10/04; ACTUAL POSTMARK 09/13/04 ***********************************************  There was absolutely no cut-off submission deadline given, except the purchase by date and submit within a certain time after receiving purchase. All were followed to the "T".  I submitted the rebate immediately after I received the merchandise from Amazon.  Give me a break, I'll never touch another thing from viking except with a 10' pole.  If it was not so piddling an amount, this would be worth reporting to FCC, but the state of customer protection in this country make you jump through even more hoops, probably for nothing, more heartache. Just forego rebates, send Viking back to the boat and purchase another brand 
 so bad that i will just say this,read the book night shift and find out what this movie should of and could of been!!! skip this mess! 
 I LOVED the first movie...and I'm sad I can't say the same here.  As Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald put it: The worst kind of sequel - the kind that exists only to give you more, more, MORE of what you particularly liked about the first film, without ever justifying its own existence. Indeed, in my view, Dead Man's Chest was just that, and it didn't please me nearly as much as the first.  What the filmmakers did was listen closely to what audiences said about Curse of the Black Pearl. The audience liked the swashbuckling action, the audience like the humor, and of course, the audience L-O-V-E-D Capt. Jack Sparrow. The filmmakers took this feedback and tried to incorporate these things into Dead Man's Chest. Oh boy did they try - way too hard. It shows.  Swashbuckling action? Let's give them a three-way sword fight between the three main characters that lasts twice as long as it should. Swashbuckling action: check.  Humor? Let's bring back Pintel and Regetti, the comic relief of the first movie, and make them a bigger part. We don't have to explain how they got out of jail and why others of Barbossa's crew didn't. We don't have to explain why they both vow to help bring Jack Sparrow back when, in the first movie, they helped maroon him and almost shot him. They're funny, that's what the audience wants. And hey, lets have most of the cast on an island inhabited by cannibals. We can have Jack roasting on a spit, then have it become a shishkabob later. We can have the crew in hanging cages, swinging back and forth and rolling downhill in them. This whole scene of the movie will be utterly pointless, but it give them the laughs they want. Humor: check.  Jack Sparrow? We'll have plenty of him, but just doing these silly loony toon-like stunts. Not putting him in different critical situations that display his cunning and convincing negotiation skills and his quick-thinking. And what of the central threatening situation? Whether it was escaping from a sinking dory or fighting a ferocious battle with his former first mate or facing death by hanging, Jack was always calm, cool, and collected. Not this time. So what if it goes against him (as one filmmaker said himself) always believing that if he can just hang on long enough, that everything will eventually turn in his favor. Make him visibly afraid. Make him panic at the sight of a black spot on his hand. Make him cringe at the first sight of Davy Jones. Yes, Jack Sparrow's mannerism will be a bit different this time, but its Johnny Depp in the same pirate costume - it should satisfy the audience. Jack Sparrow: check.  But what of the other things that make a film good? Things like, say, a story? Aware that the film did need a tale to tell, the filmmakers decided the "plot" of Dead Man's Chest would be four individual dilemmas thrown clumsily together: Cutler Beckett wants Jack Sparrow's compass (why? we'll have to wait for the 3rd movie to find out), Norrington seeks to restore his now-shattered career to it's previous glory, Will and Elizabeth must get Beckett what he wants in order to escape the hangman's noose, and Jack Sparrow attempts to weasel out of a 13-year-old bargain made with Davy Jones. What does this all come down to? Only one character accomplishes what he/she set out to do in the whole 2.5 hours. Norrington brought Davy Jones' heart to Beckett - but Will had to steal the key from Jones first. That's the only thing that actually gets DONE in the movie. How could that have taken 2.5 hours to do? It didn't. Then what filled up the extra time? The pointless stuff I mentioned above. As Ty Burr of the Boston Globe put it: It goes absolutely nowhere and takes 2.5 hours to get there.  I'm not someone whom filmmakers can show three men sword-fighting and a group of savage cannibals chasing someone down a beach and expect me to be impressed. There needs to be a point, something to it all. As Dana Steven of Slate put it: Without a beating heart at its center, this chest feels empty indeed. One star for effort...and for Davy Jones' creative design (tentacles for a beard, nice) 
 This is by far the worst action/adventure book I have ever read.  I'm surprised that aliens didn't show up at the end to fight against everybody else...  How this book ever got a top review is beyond me.  Please do not waist your tim 
 I eagerly awaited the arrival of this cd wanting to hear some new rockabilly bands I was not familiar with, but I was severly dissapointed. The quality of the tracks on this cd are mediocre at best and some are just downright bad, the two standout tracks are red hot and real gone by the spinouts(great tune, good hook, excellent slap bass, guitar interplay)The other standout is girl of my dreams,by peter and the wolves very Elvis, Maries the Name era early sixties sounding. The majority of the other tunes are just dowright pitiful.If you are new to the rockabilly scene, a few helpful suggestions, The Stray Cats, The Blasters, Robert Gordon, The Planet Rockers, Sun era and 56-59 Elvis, Carl Perkins, Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, the list goes on and on of better spent dollars on QUALITY rockabilly music, apologies to these artists, but if this is the current state of rockabilly, please somebody help us!!!!! 
 I've never had such-a-slap in the face biased book presented to me for college curriculum. Very dissapointing 
 The plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many.  Why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach case, when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is? We know where the precious document is : another useless quest. People are murdered by the half dozen, the characters are outrageous, most of the time improbable, and I felt the semi-erotic swimming episode totally stupid, not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it. I have read much better books than that. Sorry.. 
 This overwrought tripe is the cinematic equivalent to a dead fish.  It doesn't work as good trash or as high camp.  Edward Dmytryk directs Harold Robbins' source material with a lead foot.  George Peppard made a larger artistic contribution when he was on "The A-Team".  Alan Ladd, who had the misfortune to have this as his last film credit, essentially sleepwalks through this picture.  It's equally unfortunate that talented actors like Carroll Baker, Elizabeth Ashley, and Martin Balsam are associated with this swill.  Heck, I even feel bad for former boxing champ Archie Moore in his having to play the thankless role of houseboy.  The film's lone redeeming quality are the costume designs by Edith Head(the women's lingeree in particular).  If you must waste 150 minutes of your time it's better spent watching paint dry or grass grow 
 While an interesting beginning for a novice collector the author spans too great a time period to adequately cover any series of Winchester firearms.  Winchester collectors are quite attracted to styles or types of firearms.   This book barely answers even the most rudimentary of questions and as such  is an overall disappointment.  Secondly, the book would be greatly enhanced  by more detailed and clear photography.  This would assist the new  collector in appreciating the marvel of these firearms - while providing a  much better overview for future study 
 The concept of this book is a good one: a large color picture accompanied by half a page of text. Unfortunately this was not well executed. Leaving aside the text and ignoring the callous mistreatment of scientific names a minimum requirement for a book of this kind is to have proper color pictures. Three steps are involved: 1) the correct wood; 2) exposing a characteristic face of the wood; and 3) proper surfacing. Although there are a number of quite good pictures in this book, it is an easy matter to find major transgressions against each of these three steps. For example the picture given for pink ivory could be replaced by a bit of copper plating for a gain in accuracy. It is impossible to tell if there is a single correct picture for a mahogany (in the wider sense) since no diagnostic faces are shown (however, at least one of these is definitely wrong). For a capital offense against proper surfacing see balsa. All in all something like 40% of the pictures must be replaced for this book to work. This book has the potential to be a handy reference, but a lot of overdue homework must be done first 
 What seems too good to be true usually is; the complete output of Charlie Patton -- dozens of $1,000+ original records all compiled here for under $30?  Only one word comes to mind:  piracy.  These are some of the most important recordings ever made, and I certainly have no beef with that. But the buyer should know that most or all of these tracks are lifted from other reissues, in the typical JSP tradition! It's a little like buying stolen merchandise.   If you can get around that, the set is a bargain.  
 Tolle has managed to pull together the thoughts of the writers of present living and non duality and made the subject into his own. A good book for the beginner in this field. Anyone who has read widely will see it as just another self help book of which there are millions on the market. How do i know this book is useless. It made no difference to me. I have read this stuff years ago in a beginners guide to relaxation. As I say however it is a good start for beginners 
 Not that I don't like Shakespeare's works, but his tragedies are terrible, especially this one. I can't understand the language real well, so I have to grab one with the contemporary language so that it'll be easier to understand. I just can't understand this love tragedy at all! Here are some things that confuse me:  *How did this feud really begin? *Why can't this story end in happily ever after? *Why does Lady Capulet have to be so stuck up on everybody? *Why couldn't Shakespeare have written in a language we could all understand? *Why does everybody have to jump to conclusions?  I simply can't understand why people love this play so much. It's ridiculous! If you want a true love story, try reading "A Midsummer Night's Dream". This one absolutely SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I was forced to read this in 10th grade but could hardly bear reading it.  Initially, I'd had high hopes for it, because we'd read such intelligent, intriguing novels earlier in the year, including "Lord of the Flies" and "Catcher in the Rye."  But what a bore it was! Old Santiago goes out to fish, hoping to catch the "big one" (drawing on the innate male desire to always catch the best, biggest thing.."that must mean I'm macho, a real man!"), blah blah blah, can't catch anything, blah blah blah, and when he finally catches the big one, it is eaten by sharks. The stupidest book ever. I've never been a Hemingway fan, and this book steered me further away from his work.  A pathetic book by a pathetic man

 This book is a joke.  For a beginner looking for a comprehensive guide for investing, don't buy this book, unless you want a lesson in being ripped off.  This book is the size of a coaster, the kind you find next to the checkout at the pharmacy about how to get various stains out of your argyle socks.  It's made up to look cute; a two inch hardcover tomb, complete with dustjacket.  Misspellings and grammatical errors abound in this nugget.  Aspects of investing are listed, but not explained to any extent that might help someone actually pick stocks.  "A Fool And His Money Are Soon Parted," by Peter Lynch.  Buy another one of his books (a "big kid" book), but not this one 
 This mouse is designed horribly bad !! It opens fine when it is new, but as soon as you put in the batteries, it refuses to open. I suspect that the designers of this mouse did not think about trying to open it when the batteries are in .. I would not recommend it to anyone, unless you want a use and throw mouse. I thought Kensington was a good company. Did not expect this from them. I will stay away from their products henceforth 
 I saw Barrage last night.  They're not great dancers, and they're not great musicians.  The music is just loud, new age, junk, similar to what I imagine Yanni or John Tesh probably plays 
 The acting was terrible, there was basically no plot. If this movie represents a woman's view of the Conan movie genre, then that's just very sad. Red Sonya was better 
 I purchased these thinking that I was buying the AA Big Book; there are distinct similarities upon initial (online) inspection. However, this isn't the entire Big Book; certain passages that I've found to be most relevant are absent. What good is this, then? Most dismaying is that their purchase price is the same as the standard AA Big Book. I've returned this purchase; it's far more practical for me to return them  than it is to try to fit these 'round pegs' in the square holes that are best filled with a bona fide AA Big Book.  Better luck next time. : 
 Coghead (Brooklyn, NY): I understand how you feel, but we must understand that every artist must one: create his/her own style and two: they have to keep up with what is in style. Reggaeton is a new genre and in order to be competitive and have longivity in this business you can still stick to your style but you have to keep pace with what's in. I love La India and yes the cd could be better but her cd is up to date with what is being listened to. Maybe for her next album, Pure Salsa will be back in style. La India will always be the next female Celia 
 Unfortunately, the stool arrived in its box without the seat. As we needed one quickly, we purchased a similar stool locally. We returned the stool and Amazon was quick to give us a refund. The manufacturer who sent these out evidently needs some quality control 
 I am a big fan of Eric Jerome Dickey's novels. I have purchased all of them  However, this one didn't thrill me. It wasn't a bad book, it was just a little boring.  
 This book is perhaps the most disgusting display of blatant prejudice I have ever witnessed in a work of fiction. I don't believe Mr. Caldwell could possibly have interacted on any personal level with any of the people whom he so cruelly and stereotypically portrays. As a resident of the South, I have had literally thousands of narratives of the Great Depression passed down to me through family and friends. None ever reflected anything in the realm of this book. "Tobacco Road" reflects a view that poverty equals inhumanity, and this could not be farther from the truth. As social parody this book is almost entertaining--but taken as seriously as the tone of the writing encourages, it is ludicrous.  
 My brother hated this book and I don't think it is very good either. Kids should learn from their parents about the body and not from a book. I recommend this book to very very very little kids 
 This book should get 0 stars; speaking as an artist myself, the theories laid out in this book are ridiculous. The basic gist of the argument seems to be that the work completed by the old masters was just too difficult to have been done without the use of optics, etc. To me it sounds like the desperate argument of a man who did not have either the talent or the determination to attain the skill of a great master, and therefore spent years constructing an elaborate excuse.  Admittedly, I could not even finish this book; after reading for the nth time a line of shaky, circumstantial evidence like "all artists know that the ellipse of that collar is very difficult to draw, but there are no correction marks, therefore optics must have been used," I could not even stand to keep reading! On the contrary, all artists who have spent time and dilligent effort in becoming technically skilled know that although that ellipse may be difficult, after a few years of daily drawing and painting it becomes second nature, and could very well be drawn naturally with minimal correction.  That is just one example... the book is filled with flaky examples such as those - Hockney claiming "this is too good to have been done without optics" or "this was too difficult to have been done without optics" - and I found myself thinking over and over that the man simply must not have been disciplined enough in his own art, if that is indeed what he thinks. And, modern artists must remember this: nowadays, the work of the old masters seems very difficult because in modern times artists get nothing like the education or practice time had by the old artists, for many reasons. Superior art education is very hard to find, and there are many distractions in the modern world (TV, computers, having to hold a 'day job', lack of patrons, etc.) and therefore modern artists usually lack discipline and do not live and breath art in quite the same way that the old masters did. Therefore, most will never attain the skill of the old masters. But that is certainly no reason to assume that the old masters could not have done what they did without the help of technology!  Some of the other examples used as 'evidence' refer to 'odd' proportion, perspective, etc. in otherwise masterful work. I am surprised that this author (and those readers who are artists) apparently does not realize that throughout history, great artists did NOT necessarily strive for EXACT realism - even nowadays, photorealism is not necessarily considered great art by many artists, because after all we are ARTISTS not cameras! The point of realist art is to ACCENTUATE the reality, not to copy it! Therefore, many inconsistencies in proportion, perspective, etc. evident in old masters' work are not 'oddities' or 'mistakes', but purposeful exaggerations or adjustments to benefit the composition.   All that being said, I think this book may even be harmful to the budding artist, since it may cast doubt in the mind of the art student that he or she can build the skill necessary to paint in a masterful way without the help of 'trickery' or technology of some sort. Instead, an art student should be encouraged to build skill, discipline, and self-reliance - because THAT is the true secret of the great masters 
 I have tried to order twice from this company.  The first time I waited over eight months and cancelled the order.  I accidently ordered from them a second time, but when they mentioned a delay, I looked them up.  Do not order from them 
 You get your money's worth here--there are a ton of CDs in this audio book. Unfortunately, I found Bryson's prose (which I enjoyed a lot when reading silently, as I have done with his other books) to be greatly irritating when spoken aloud. To me, he sounds kind of 'affected' in parts, and sometimes there is a sort of "moist" sound when he pronounces words. Hard to describe until you hear the CD, but trust me on this one. I think a lot of the positive reviews on here are for the book, and not the CD. I would stick with the written word on this one.  
 I got this for Christmas and finished it late last night.   As the tale begins, the author initiates two primary storylines, The first is set in WWII spanning both the European and Pacific theatres. The second is modern day and is centered on a California start-up (with requisite ambitious young guys) with primary business interests in the far east. One knows the stories are connected because of similar last names in both. The other connection is encryption - how crytography was central to the war and how it is central to current day business and, in the author's view, central to the future of civilization.  One of the great pluses of the book is how the author made use of these commonalities between WW2 and modern-day to create interest and anticipation. The middle of the book actually made use of these quite well and I was eager to keep reading. There is some terrific writing in middle sections and descriptions of people and places both in Europe and the Far East are very vivid.  The author does write with terrific humour at times and I was reminded in several places about a series of books written about WWI called "The Bandy Papers - the Journals of Bartholomew Bandy" by Donald Jack. Very similar in style as the author captures the points of view - dry wit - of Grandpa (WW2) and grandson (techno geek) Waterhouse.  The presentation of Gen. Douglas McArthur was (from my Canadian perpective) endearingly flag-waving-pipe-chomping-bullet- shedding-American-Super-hero and, of course, totally unbelievable.  Then I hit the final pages where I had hoped to receive a big-payoff to the build-up over the previous thousand pages. Alas, it was not to be and all the tedious verbiage that scarred the entire book turned out to be a sad bell-weather.  One of the "1 star" reviews amongst these reviews suggested that Tolkien was nothing compared to Neal Stephenson as far as filling up pages with words. There are numerous examples of page after page of "who cares" blathering which may tell us that some of the characters are in fact terribly boring individuals but do not deepen the characterizations. One of the good points is that when you hit such a section - and the reader will recognize them - you can simply skip about 5 pages or more and pick up the story without missing anything. The book could have been shortened by about 400 pages, maybe more. I'm guessing there is an encrypted message in the pages somewhere but I couldn't care less.  Some story lines, characters and inferences are left totally unresolved in the end (e.g. what happened to the dentist?). A case of author boredom and a loss of interest as the ending approached? And why the heck did Andrew Loeb make a final appearance! Talk about out-of-place and just bizarre.  I dunno what the author is thinking sometimes but several times he comes across as just a tad too clever. At least 3 times during the book (inluding the opening pages) I didn't have a clue what he was talking about. For example, one such bit of cleverness is his incorporation of the Hindenberg disaster in New Jersey - the narrative is written at that point from the perspective of a main character who stumbles literally out of the woods after seeing a brightness in the sky. It is not central or even obliquely of interest to the story line. The author never mentions Hindenberg by name and it is left to the reader (if you can pass the author's ever-so-clever test of cleverness) to figure it out. It seemed somewhat a condescending (to the reader) writing style.  There is the usual technology-dropping (like dropping names but gadgets instead of people) to presumably up the coolness factor and from my knowledge it is mostly, but not always, believable.  Ultimately, why there is some terrific writing, the overall result is a draft that needs 1 or 2 more rewrites and a worthy ending to really tell a terrific story.   Summary - go directly to Tom Clancy's books which are executed much better and have endings that offer a consistent pay-off (but with less humour). Clancy can also go on and on... but not like this guy!  The paperback story is 1130 pages of small type that is hard to read 
 I was really disappointed especially because I had read so many positive reviews of the book. It very boring and the only exercises there actually were was one little chapter. The book was more of an autobigraphy of the author as well as about the history of the acceptance of women's masturbation which I could have read online if i wanted to. I wouldn't consider this a self-help book at all.  
 While this book had some good ideas, I thought his advise to men to sleep around after a break up was very irresponsible. He admits that many men will be prone to use sex at this time in an addictive way, to numb their feelings, so why encourage them to do so? Even worse, what about the feelings of the women that these men will be USING for their "healing" sex?? nobody deserves to be used that way 
 "The Accidental" by first-time Scottish novelist Ali Smith has to be one of the most irritating books I've read in a very long time.  It's so modern, it's really hard to tell what happened or why you should care about it.  This book won the Whitbread Novel Award.  According to another website, the Whitbread Award lost its sponsor and ceased to exist the same year.  Would it be fair to label this book as the one that killed the Whitbread Award?   The jacket also labels this book as a finalist for the Man Booker Prize whose website says that they award "the very best in contemporary fiction."  For me a requirement of the very best fiction is to be able to affect the reader in a positive way.  My only positive is that I finally got to the end of a dreadful book; & no, it did not get better.  Eve Smart is a novelist.  I usually try to avoid books where writers write about writers.  It's like a movie about movie stars or a song about songwriting -- it seems quintessentially self-indulgent.  Who knows what happens to Eve at the end of the book?  Why is she in some lady's house near the Grand Canyon?  Is it just to present another character as irritatingly self-absorbed as the main character?  Why is Eve unconcerned about her children?  Why does she see her dead mother floating above the Grand Canyon when this wasn't a book about her parents?  Wouldn't it have been more interesting to have her be eaten by a mountain lion?   Michael is Eve's husband.  He's a university professor that sleeps with his students.  His wife Eve knows and doesn't care.  Are they progressive people because they sleep around?  Is this supposed to make us care about them?  What is the effect of their loose behavior on their two children?  Do we care or applaud when Michael gets fired?    Astrid is the youngest child.  She is going through typical adolescent behaviors.  Yes, she is one of the most real of the characters, but she doesn't change throughout the book.  She gets mad at her mother for not being home and refuses to speak to Eve when she calls on the phone.  Astrid was right to be mad at Eve, but so what?  Magnus, the son, was the most interesting character to me simply because he loses his virginity in a church.  It's a bit of a mixed message from author Ali Smith.  What does it say about the church?  Is the message that "The Accidental" is man because there is no God proved because the church is empty?  Who knows?  Amber shows up as the family summers in Suffolk or Norfolk as Eve tries to write.  She buddies up with Astrid smashing her expensive camera.  She has sex with Magnus.  She insults Eve and gives her a knee massage.  She kisses Eve on the lips, right before Eve leaves for the Grand Canyon.  She ignores Michael.  Who is Amber?  Why is she in the book?  Magnus tells Astrid he knows who Amber is after she's disappeared, but Smith fails to let the readers know.  Is this a puzzle?  An illusion?  A nightmare?  Then when the family returns home, their house has been completely stripped.  Who did that?  What's the point?    I did not care for Smith's repetitious use of pages of short sentences.  It doesn't further the story.  It basically just says, "Look at me.  I can write in short sentences."  However, it was enough to have her awarded the Whitbread Novel Award.  I didn't mind the poetry.  I liked it because I could get through the book faster.  To what point it was there, I cannot say.  Perhaps you will be more modern than I and not particularly care if a story makes sense or whether there is anybody about which to care.  For me, this is an award-winning dud.  Taxi!                
 I had to read this book as a freshman in college in 1985 (it's since been updated). The professor offered an A to anyone who read it five times--so I did! As a result, I was stunted intellectually for several years, before I finally learned about some basic economic fallacies.   Parenti's book, which is little more than propaganda, is one long string of economic fallacies. For example, one of his favorite arguments is that just a few people, corporations, etc, in the US own most of the assets and property. He never stops to ask the question: So what? What follows? This is only self-evident proof of injustice if economic exchange is a zero-sum game, so that if one person gains five dollars, then someone, somewhere, lost five dollars.   But everything we know about economics refutes the assumption. Wealth is created. The fact that the outcomes of wealth are unevenly distributed proves nothing, especially since many of the individuals and companies with the most wealth are the very same individuals and companies that create the most wealth.  By missing such simple distinctions, this book should only be persuasive to colleged freshmen who are blissfully ignorant of economic fallacies. And someone of those freshmen will do what I did: they will keep reading, and figure out how out of touch Parenti is. I doubt Parenti imagined his agitprop would backfire, and produce conservatives who don't like to be propagandized 
 I'm an (unemployed) agronomist and I live in Brazil.About this book, I must tell you that I readn't it.In fact, a friend of me, send parts of this bad book to me, by e-mail, from America. She was scare, about the doomed prophecies of this book. There's so many frauds writen in this book, that I can't count the majority of then. 1)This book claims that end of nitrogen from natural gas, will doom modern agriculture and spread famine.In fact, fertilizers with nitrogen can (and are) be produced with hydrogen from eletrolysis of water, using wind, hydro or nuclear energy.At the same time, using genetical engeneering, vegetables such as corn or wheat will produce his own nitrogen.We must see that soybean don't use nitrogen's fertilizers, because bacterias inside his roots made his nitrogen's fertilizers, without artificial fertilizers.This second alternative will produce cheap harvests, without fertlizers with nitrogen. 2)This book claims that climbing oil prices will doom the world.In fact, whith more oil's price, the alternatives of oil will became better than ever.Ethanol in Brazil costs less then US$50,00 each brent.The Athabasca's oil sands are bigger than all Iraq's oil reserves.The shale oil has trillions of brents in the world.If you ad hydrogen to corn plant, you will produce oil.In other words:there's many future alternatives to the oil.  The real big menace, to the world, is the same:religion. Nuclear bombs from Pakisthan, Iran or any other source are real menaces.Mad strong men from North Korea or China are also possible menaces in the future.  
 Talk about a waste of time!  I was wondering if it was just me so I asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it.  It is boring, tells you instead of shows you, hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all.  I also found the protrayal of the grandmother's flirtation with Islam to be shallow, un-informed, unbelievable and ultimately dismissive. Don't waste your time on this or your money. Luckily I had picked it up at a book sale for $0.25, about what it was worth 
 This book reduces Nietzsche to rhetorical devices and tropes.  Many out of control discussions are on hand, eventuating in nothing worth remembering.  The idea of this book seems to be to reinforce the idea that morality is boring, that no one should find thinking about morality interesting, and that if you just call boring prose dangerous, then it is.  The argument in this book goes all the way back to Paul Valery, Derrida's inspiration, who misunderstood Saussure.  Valery argues that philosophy has all the marks of literature, and so is indistinguishable from it, and so just is more literature -- no different from comic books, grafitti and wedding vows.  But Quine found no marks of science that were not to be found in philosophy, yet philosophy does not reduce to science.  The argument is no better from the side of art.  Philosophy does not reduce to art.  Valery was wrong, and so is the Magnus group 
 I bought this book based on backcover info. What a disappointment. It's not just that it is poorly written and unimaginative. Unless you are into sleazily written sex and gore, you won't find much to hold your interest. There is nothing new here. Just tired, sorry, second rate prose, thinly drawn characters in a porno-lite storyline. Save your money 
 I have never been a fan of Danielle Steel's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime, and those many years ago.  I'm not sure what motivated me to pick up Toxic Bachelors -- extreme boredom? insanity? -- but I slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer's work.  Actually, I think I was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was.  The writing was completely repetitive and superficial, and I rather felt that I was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself.  It read like a poor book report:  "...and then he did this, and then he did this, and after that he did this, and then he laughed."  We are TOLD that the bachelors -- who struck me as commitment-phobic, a little neurotic, and fairly immature despite their (middle) age, but not necessarily toxic -- are decent, likable guys, but we never really see too much proof of that.  When the "proof" does come, it's so ham-handed as to be laughable:  Charlie's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother, and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character.  Yeahsurerightwhatever.  Most of the story is told through narration, with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue.  The author adopted a third-person point of view, but there's certainly nothing omniscient about it, and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters.  Throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls, and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable.  THIS is how men behave and relate to one another?  I find that hard to believe, considering that none of the men I know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other.    I liked the female characters of the book initially.  They all seemed to be strong, capable, independent and emotionally healthy women.  But my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book, as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man.  And the conflicts Steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous:  mountains out of molehills.  For instance, Gray, the 50-year-old artist who has always been phobic about family, refuses to meet the ADULT children of the woman he's been with for several months and whom he claims to love.  Nevermind the fact that he's known about the ADULT children since the very beginning.  Nevermind the fact that the ADULT children live in England and Italy, while Gray and Sylvia are New Yorkers.  Nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent, self-sufficient ADULTS who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face-to-face visits.  Evidently Gray can't see beyond the fact that they are "kids" and therefore "family" and therefore not to be tolerated.  Sorry, but whatever sympathy I'd developed for Gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity.  Dump the weenie, Sylvia.  You can do better.  The other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness, and of course everything was wrapped up magically, with sudden capitulation, as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses.    Considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters, their conflicts and resolution, I have to wonder why Steel even bothered writing this book.  And why I bothered reading i 
 I have loved many of Jodi Picoult's other books, but this one seemed too far-fetched. I did not feel the evil depicted in the comic book drawings was necesary to the storyline and in-fact detracted from it.  Many of my friends who are Jodi fans were also disappointed in this newest release 
 This movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made.  I use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies.  They are either worse than this one (rare) or better than this one. As an example: Buffalo '66 is worse.  If you watch both in the same day, you will surely die 
 This book reads just like an infomercial sounds. Some of the information sounds credible and I have encountered it elsewhere, but some does not and NONE of it is substantiated in any way. By this I mean, he does not offer collateral resources for one to verify the data he put forth. Also some of his ideas & recommendations seems a little over the top to me. The book is VERY long but the essence of the contents could have been written in 100 to 125 pages. I was disappointed overall 
 Sheri is great on the radio show she co-hosts however her humor did not work so well in this book of random thoughts and statements.  The idea for the book, transforming and organizing her family, is good but I found the book to be way too scattered to be considered a good read 
 Like other reviewers listed here, I thought this book would focus on the trials and tribulations of cooking recipes that are half-a-century old (if not older)using pithy, witty humor and comparisons of the writer's life and Child's life.  To be fair, there is some of this sprinkled throughout the book, but as an avid cook and Child fan I wish there had been more.  I think there is a market today for food writing; good food writing, like MFK Fisher and Elizabeth David, but I don't think Julie Powell even comes close.  The Julie/Julia Project is a front for this young novelist who see-saws between charming and extremely annoying in her attempts to describe how her life evolves over a one-year period in which she participated (to whatever extent) in some very profound experiences, like working for the government agency dealing with the World Trade Center memorials, a household move in NYC, dealing with a less than stellar marraige, and coping with very needy friends and family.  Julie, get a get a grip on your neurosis and narcissism and just write!  Forget the food, it's just not you.  Stick to your hoo-hum job, your even more narcissistic friends, and your boring marraige and you could be the next Nora Ephron, or at the very least, Erma Bombeck. 
 THIS IS THE STORY OF THE 2004 AMERICAN LEAGUE PENNANT RACE. IT GOES THROUGH THE GREAT RIVALRY BETWEEN THE YANKEES AND REDSOX FROM THE BABE RUTH TRADE TO THE STARTLING AND UNBELIEVABLE COME BACK BY THE REDSOX TO THEIR FIRST WORLD SERIES VICTORY SINCE 1918. THE BOOK COVERS IN GREAT DETAIL HOW BOTH TEAMS FAIRED THROUGH OUT THE SEASON AND ALSO TOUCHES ON SOME OF THE GREAT PENNANT RACES THE RIVALS HAVE ENDURED. I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS FOR ALL BASEBALL FANS BUT ESPECIALLY FOR REDSOX FANS. A GREAT READ. 
 If Bell left out any cliches I would be surprised. From terrible dialog, laughable stereotyping of characters, ridiculous plot with an unlikely (to say the least) coincidence, to one of the most (unintentionally) comic finales this book has it all.    
 No "Radio Song", "Turn You Inside Out", "Crush with Eyeliner", or, most shockingly, "Shiny Happy People"? Guess I'll wait a few more years for Warners to put out a better best of, like IRS just did of REM's early years 
 INTERMISSION was filmed in Ireland and you have these Irish actors with their heavily-accented English, which is wonderful but hard to understand at times. This film has been described as a black comedy. Black, yes, but I don't recall laughing at this essentially violent film. If we don't have blokes hitting lasses in the face with their fists, we have cops beating up suspects, kids flinging stones at buses and cars causing wrecks, robberies and kidnappings. And then there is the emotional violence: a bullying supervisor, a deserting husband, people made fun of for the way they look. So this is Ireland? Or a slice of life in Ireland? Well, I hope not. Almost all the characters in this movie seem angry or drifting. That some of them calm down and find a better direction in the end is redemptive for INTERMISSION but the viewer is still left with a bad taste in his mouth. After watching so many of these art house flicks, one wonders if the time would be better spent at the Gaugain exhibit at the museum or on a Louis Auchincloss novel. Something, anything, with a little class and some uplifting spirit. 
 Yes there are some laughs.. but the majority are only silly slapstick type jokes that we have come to expect already.. It does not have enough intelligence for sustained laughter but it is too entertaining not to watch.. What makes the movie particularly annoying, however, is the acting..and the lack of clever dialogue.. I guess you should expect that from the trailers and title - god why did i watch this 
 Boy, yet another collection of incoherent musings by Feynman.  Instead of being impressed, I am quite disgusted at this bundle of babble being sold as some profound truths uttered by a deep thinker.   If there is one thing that's been elucidated by Feynman's nontechnical writings, it is the fact that outside of physics Feynman was a totally pedestrian individual.  His thoughts on social and religious issues are no deeper than those of an average college kid. Yet with his "genius" label successfully marketed, in no small part by himself, he could ramble aimlessly about anything and the Feynman groupies would take it as gospel.  Even on some technical issues, such as quantum computing and nano technology, his thoughts were really quite superficial, or sketchy, at best.  Nonetheless, they have been billed as ideas of a "visionary."  For those of you who aren't paying attention to the cult behavior among physicists, a side-benefit of being a visionary is that you don't actually have to think hard about the question of feasibility -- it's mundane task for the lesser men.  All in all, another ripoff from the Feynman cult industry 
 I thought I was getting a terrific deal on 6 ink tanks, they look exactly the same as those that came with the printer and those that are packaged individually.  But when I later bought a one-off replacement -- not "custom" -- tank I noticed the ink level bar on the printer LCD was not only full but also longer than the other bars!  If the "custom" tanks hold only about half the ink, this isn't the bargin it appears 
 I must confess to owning two copies of Wallis Budge's translation, and therefore my review may be colored or spoiled by previous contact. It must be noted that Dr Brooks used a Spanish translation from the Ethiopian Ge'ez as his starting point, and there are several lacunae and editorial lapses in this edition. It was also noticeable that Dr Brooks apparently believes the claims in the original and advances scarcely-disguised notions of Africanist superiority, which would be rightly termed racialism as it had been with Budge's British Imperial conceits. The assertions in the editorial review above are noticeably absolute and categorical, despite the legend which it relates, and which may be found in differing versions within Ethiopia itself 
 I bought this  book hoping that it would investigate today's financially status oriented world. In this task the book starts off quite well reviewing Nixon's visit to Russia.  The biggest problem I have with this book is that it drifts off the subject to look at how status has  been covered by other authors and artists.  To me, the book, particularly with its enumerated layout, reads more like someone who's written a ph.D thesis and desperately wants to cover those things that  someone reviewing it would be impressed to see, throwing in a few graphs for good measure. Unfortunately to the layperson it is very hard to get through. For example at the end of the section on philosophy it reads "To heed the misanthropic philosophical council we must surrender our puerile obsession with policing our own status..." Yeah, right!  De Botton doesn't really seem to be writing for the reader, more for himself, and a very intellectual audience, who probably will nod and agree with everything he says, because they too are impressed they know so much too.  It's a shame that the book has turned out how it has as I think the subject would have made an entertaining read if written in a different style.  I was going to give it one star, but De Botton has clearly researched his subject well whic earns it an extra star, but don't expect to learn anything you don't know already 
 I bought two Clarisonic brushes - one as a gift and one for myself.  Although the product works well, unfortunately, both brushes were defective.  The trouble started occurring about two months after using.  One brush started out with two speed settings, but eventually only functioned at the low setting.  The other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged!  My experience with the customer service has been terrible.  They would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty.  Be careful if you are going to travel abroad.  The warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v!   
 I was extremely frustrated using this book on my recent trip to Antarctica and South Georgia.  Some of the plates do not do an accurate job of depicting the birds and the distribution maps are also not entirely accurate.  The professional ornithologist on my trip  agreed with my observations and recommended that I purchase another book: "Birds of Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego, and the Antarctic Peninsula" by E. Couve and C. Vidal.  
 Very confusing book, and shy on details. Also contains to much personal interjection (opinions). A better book I would recommend is 'A Buddhism Primer - And Introduction to Buddhism' 
 2 stars 	After reading Barras' explanation and description and interpretation of what life has been like for her concerning the concept, structure and realization of a father figure in her life and in the life of her daughter I conclude that 1/3 of the book is reporting on painful emotional feelings and psychological confusion; 1/3 reporting on research that is usual and available and interpreted in a prevailing view that homes without "fathers" produce dysfunctional children and adults, although, more than half the homes in America do not have a resident-male performing the role of father and 1/3 of the book is pure puff, pure market exploitation.  Yet, I also concluded that I will buy the book for my daughters but I will glue my review and interpretation of the book, in detail, to the inside cover. 	I will use this book and "Becoming Dad" by Leonard Pitts, Jr. as text for classes in cultural anthropology because these discussions of "fatherlessness" are so culturally based.  But even more, they indicate clearly the cultural differences between what a "father" was suppose to be in the 40s and 50s in comparison to what a father is suppose to be today. 	What is a father?  That depends.  That depends upon the region of the world, the environment and the era.  That clearly makes it a psychological cultural-construct. 	The data on "Daddy" in the home (i.e. an active role) is clear that it depends on the cultural and economic development of the males in a population. 	So the socio-economic factors point to political punts and blocks.  In other words, the American government has supported the development of white manhood, and the subsequent development of white fatherhood and with the employment of women even that effort is slipping. 	This book and others like it can be a lethal weapon, a hurtful instrument, for women who are vulnerably disconnected in a dreamy, fanciful reality. 	All 35-year olds who read the book should read the very last line of the book, first, realize Barras is now 50, then read the book with that in mind.  That is, realize that this psychological-cultural painful phenomenon is called, "growing up." . . . . I HAVE A BONE TO PICK WITH BARRAS: 	"The only thing I can hear clearly is the fatherless song.  I sing it sorrowfully, achingly, the way Billie Holiday sang `Strange Fruit.'" (pg. 34) 	Thousands of black people (& about 200 white sympathizers) were tortured, beaten, mutilated and burned, then hung from trees all over the South because (some) white people hated and was allowed to hate and Barras compares that with her childhood fantasy of a father and her mother's abrupt lack of sensitivity, which we all will grow out of eventually because we will realize the fancifulness of it all but torture and murder and rape are real.  Somehow, I don't think these are the same thing or even similar in the essence of living human, do you 
 It is frighting that any one would find anything real about the family in this book. Rosie the witch, Chuckie the night of the living dead. I found the whole thing so boring. Just because it took place in the 50's does it have read like a book from the 50's. This is 2001. Who talks that way? Pease, more life like chacters. Could have been great....I come from a Irish, Catholic family with many of the problems faced in this book. But, I just thought the book was insulting 
 I didn't like how the author has chosen to label the character's anxiety as his "autism".  This book conveys the message that his autism is the label of his bad feelings or his feelings that are out of control.  I wish the author had chosen a different word to describe the character's feelings, such as anger, impatience, or anxiety.  Instead, they are labeled as his "autism".  It's an uphill battle to fight against the negative impressions of autism.  My message to my kids is that their autism is part of what makes them interesting (and it's true).  
 I am by no means an economist, and much less an expert on finance, but this book strikes me as a thinly veiled, unsubtle hatchet job on the efficient markets hypothesis.  I've seen much subtler discussions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis written for general audiences, enough of them so I can recognize that Lowenstein doesn't get it; he equates efficient markets with "the price that the market offers is always the intrinsic value," and not with "you can't reliably predict intrinsic value any better than market prices themselves do."  This is a crucial difference, because it is only by assuming that market efficiency is the first that his attack holds water.  The other thing that makes me very suspicious about this book is the way Lowenstein presents the character of the various people involved in the story, given what his sources are.  Reading between the lines, I just have to wonder if his description of the personality and character of the people he describes as the core folks at LTCM is much too informed by interviews with people who've had a falling out with them 
 Loser by Jerry Spinelli could have been an interesting and overall good book but, in my opinion it was not because it was rushed and undeveloped.  The book chronicles the life of Donald Zinkoff from his first day of kindergarten to his last day of eighth grade in a mere two hundred pages.  Thus no grade is well developed and neither is any character but the loveable loser and main character Donald Zinkoff.  This book was attempting to give a good message about the life through school of a loser.  Because it is hard to go through your time in school with out true friends or any real interests to speak of let alone to be unatheletic on top of it.  But although the message was no doubt an outstanding one, it left much to be desired as a whole 
 If you are a teacher, student or a writer seeking guidance, this is not the book which I would suggest, as it's really not prescriptive at all. It's chock full of frequency data wrt various grammatical constructs. It's like reading the census data, if you know what I mean. You'll be left out in netherspace, to basically extract the rules by yourself. Would much rather suggest using your hard earned dollar to buy the "Comprehensive Grammar ..." by Quirk to get some real guidelines.  However, if you like statistics, buy this book, you'll love it .. 
 I don't know about anyone else, but this book, with it's constant reviewing of past events just made me more sad than inspired to create art.   I am a painter, not a writer...so forcing myself to write all of the time just wasted valuable practice time. ( I also work full time and have a busy spouse that I like to spend time with) so every precious second that i can spend on my art I grab up.   I guess, for pepole who are in emotional distress, this book can teach you how to use art as a thereputic tool for recovery and self esteem. That is fine. For busy, self motivated artists who already enjoy making art...this book isn't going to deliver those fun moments of "get-up-off-your-behind" inspiration. For an energetic, get moving to make art book, read Danny Gregory's "the creative licence" instead.   In conclusion, this book has a lot to offer pepole who have had a troubled past and are working through a lot of anger and sadness, but that wasn't me. I just wanted to make art 
 This book is a total waste of time and effort!!!!   It is poorly written and very vague.  Also, its information is too old!! 
 Please note, this is and has always been, one of my favorite stories.  I am not reviewing the story Little Men, but the way it was published by IndiePublish.  I would give the story 5 stars, but this presentation only two.   On the bright side, the cloth binding appears very well done and should last quite a while.  Unfortunately, the publisher chose to reformat all the paragraphs in the text so that like this review all margins are left justified and a blank line separates the paragraphs.  If it were done well, it might have worked ok, but it was done very clumsily with the completion of a sentence often being separated from the rest of the paragraph.  (I have a suspicion that the reformatting of an original text was done by using a Find-Replace function of a word processor and not checked by an editor.)  This makes for some awkward readings, and probably not something I would want to put into the hands of a child.  Also the text was not proofed for typos or other simple errors in punctuation, and there are some places where I could not tell what the original sentence was intended to say.  Again, I expect that the only proofing done on this version was by a spellchecker and a lot of simple mistakes entered into the publication.  I wish to repeat, that I love this story and have since I was a boy, and would recommend the story to any child, but would not recomment this particular volume 
 You gotta love a political pundit like Joe Klein.  He didn't even have the decency to attach his name to his book.  Wow, that's courage.  That's a backbone.   Let's see, Klein goes around slamming the Clinton presidency, anonymously.  Thanks, Joe.  America needs more brave souls like you.  Go back to writing your drivel in Time Magazine.  Frankly I am surprised you have the courage to attach your name to your columns. 
 I didn't like this book.  Truth be told, I still haven't finished it, and I bought it over six months ago.  The characters are boring; the situation (while ripe with potential) drags; and the recipes don't even sound good.  I am supremely disappointed, as I usually love what Nora Ephron does.  Bummer 
 I ordered this Mei Ah edition and regretted it after the first five minutes of watching. The visual quality is average, but, as Anaguma reports below, the English subtitles are execrable, which is a grating distraction. The good news is that Criterion will be issuing a new edition in January 2006; if past performance is any indication, it should be excellent 
 The author spoke only from her point of view, which was Midwestern and Christian.  She devoted a huge section to church weddings, and a tiny section for any other kind, which did not help me at all.  Also, she kept talking about NOT having a wedding outdoors, which doesn't make any nature-loving bride happy, nor does it give a California bride tips on planning her outdoor wedding.  Thirdly, this book doesn't include many ethnic or cultural tips and traditions (except for the tiny part on the Jewish wedding).  Try the Unoffical Guide to planning your Wedding or the Dummies book instead 
 I bought this epilator about 3 months ago and here are my thoughts on it. Pros - saves money on razors - good on large areas - entertaining if you're bored Cons - no matter how many times you use it, the pain does not go away (you have to be drunk to use it on your bilini and use tranquilizers to use on your armpits) - ingrown hair can be a problem (especially in the bikini area) - hair doesn't grow back that much slower than shaving (after two day you have to shave anyway to be smooth) - the epilator doesn't pick up fine hair - if it does, it just rips it. 
 When I read all three Books from cover to cover. At First I was expecting a lot from Jim's work. But Alas- the least I expected. Well Anyway, As Garfield would say " Life's Like a Lasagna "-- Happy Reading  Folks 
 I've seen a great deal of these films and consider myself a buff. This selection is very weak! Most of the films are of the film strip variety, where there's music and there are still images that change, rather than the piece being a movie. Some of the films are unpardonably boring! There's so much great stuff out there, but not on this DVD. If you must see it, rent it 
 I enjoy watching teen movies because I'm ever so curious about how the director sees this particular age group and the misconceptions present in his view as much as in the teens' view of things.   This movie is unlike most teen "romantic comedies" I've seen, and not necessarily in a good way. First of all, the main characters are unlikeable and don't represent actual categories of people in real life:   We have the good looking rebel who's actually not so rebellious after all but then gets back to his old ways (stupid twist if you ask me), the nerd who can't get any (they picked the worst possible guy to play the nerd; he's actually pretty good looking and a funny guy...), the nerdy girl who hasn't grown up yet (ends up hooking up with the rebel but they break up), the gay guy (I have no idea what his role in this movie was), the aggressive victim of child abuse (...), the freaky nympho with a tint of lesbian (what the hell were you thinking Daniel Waters?) and finally the rebel's childhood best friend who falls in love with him and is rejected (the film focuses about 5 minutes of its total 88 on this character... I don't know why she's even here, she has no obvious role and her situation doesn't reflect at all in the real world).   Next up, I think the director is sexually obsessed or something. Ok, I know sex is an important part of a teenager's life but this movie is about lame 13 year old girls aching for sex and even lamer 19 year olds who have nothing else better to do. If I wanted to see hormonal imbalance, I would go watch Discovery Channel. There are more important things in life than sex, and this "masterpiece" definitely doesn't illustrate them. The characters' thoughts and actions are limited to the camp itself and the director focuses too much on useless stuff and tries to create stereotypes, but fails miserably. Most teen movies have a moral side to them, they teach the audience certain values, unlike "Happy Campers". This movie only taught me that it's so cool to be obsessed about sex, it's cool for 12 year old girls to think they're oh-so-hot women, that only the absolute best looking guys hook up (not true in the real world) and more [...]. Also the director makes completely ridiculous situations seem normal, such as the camp leader getting hit by lightning and then acting completely weird, the counsellors buying 47203 boxes of condoms (there's only so much sex you can have in 40 days...), the whole "Don't-touch-me Todd" thing, and so on and so forth.  This movie isn't worth the $2 I paid to rent it. Those who think this is better than the American Pie series should go out more. American Pie was a work of art, this is a piece of [...] 
 This is the shortest book I failed to finish. I'm sorry, but for a short novel, it was just got too wordy and touchy-feely for me. I loved Emperor of the Air, a collection of short stories in which feelings and places were described succintly. And the events happened at a quicker pace. But in Blue River, Canin stretches out all his descriptions of places, of main character's resentments, disappointments, fears, and memories. It really feels tedious to read and halfway through it, I just had to give up 
 I loved this player until the day I really, really needed to use it for recording, when I discovered that the MODE button no longer worked. This is the button you need to use to switch from mp3 player mode to voice record, line-in record, or FM radio.   The device is now permanently stuck on mp3 player mode with no ability to shuffle or repeat, which is not the worst thing in the world, except that I specifically bought it for its recording capabilities which are now, for all intents and purposes, non-existent. And 14 months after I bought it, too; conveniently post-warranty.  The screws holding the case together are impossible to remove, so there's no way to attempt a DIY solution to this maddeningly simple but nonetheless irreperable device-crippling problem. This thing is of no use to me now; a $200 paperweight. I'm never buying another iRiver product again 
 Well, first off, I'm not sure if it's the card, or the N1 router itself, but ever since I installed the new N1 serious wireless in my home, I have had nothing but problems and poor connectivity. They clam that the N1 has extended range, I went back to my Pre N wireless and got twice the range and way better reliebility then with the N1. The concept seems good and the descriptions are great, but i can't say I feel the product is what they say it is 
 I'm looking at reviews and people are saying, "The movie is awful! Read the book."  It's true that the movie is one of the worse films you will ever see, butI advise you NOT to read the book. It's too difficult to read and it leaves you with a headache. If you're in school and you're required to read this book, I suggest you just watch the movie (get the 2 hours and 52 minutes out the way) and  get Cliff Notes. For real, don't watch the movie or read the book unless you have no choice 
 This book is written from the viewpoint of a flaming socialist with the attitude that anything white or European or is overly valued in American history textbooks.  Loewen does have many valid points about what history textbooks omit, but the degree to which he is clearly slanted to the left is ludicrous.  "Lies My Teacher Told Me" could have been an amazing book, but all it did was aggrivate me and motivate me to write a 23 page paper debunking half of what the author wrote, much to the dismay of my idiotic Sociology professor.  The only reason I didn't give the book 1 star is because the overall intent and effort put forth were good, but the book as a whole is just far too biased 
 I bought this book with the camera hoping to learn something that I would not be able to figure out effortlessly on my own using manual or pressing buttons. I wish I saved the money. Book has basic instructions from long-time user. No specific insights of the professional. Photos that are illustrating the book are plain and boring. No huge mistakes in light or composition, just ordinary objects in uninspired setting.  This is my first SLR, I was using digital for 3 years before. Rebel XT is such an easy camera to use, you do not need this book to take pictures that you will love 
 ok first of all let me say that yes this mic has a nice look and feel to it..also being wireless it adds to its attractivness but over all this mic after a long time of wearing it can really hurt your ear....it becomes very uncomfortable to wear and has even given me headaches, being as how me and a friend needed a headset we both bought one...i no longer use this headset while my freind has no choice till he gets his 360 also, and to this day he constantly has to say "hold up im switching my mic to my other ear cause this ear is starting to hurt" with the 360 controller and headset being wireless and it becoming more availible just wait cause in the end this headset isnt worth the price and it wont be compatible for your 360 
 Released as David And Goliath, this is a very enjoyable classic Bible story. On the cover it is billed as an Orson Wells picture, however, Wells does not take the prominent focus. This movie explores the opposite side of the Philistenes gearing up for war against Israel, an aspect not usually covered in Bible stories. If you like classic film, this is definitely one that should be seen 
 Don't waste your time on this drivel.  This writer has unjustly thrived over the years consistently raking up false malicious muck on the Fabs. True Beatles scholars know Giuliano for what he is - he was despised by George Harrison and I'm sure Paul feels the same way.  
    This is another "Rip-Off" CD. 3 songs and a Video, don't make this a good purchase.    I expect a CD to have, at least, 8-10 songs on it.    
 Never having read Macomber before, I picked up Susannah with interest, hoping to discover the secret of her popularity. While the premise of this book is a promising one, it never reached it's potential. Susannah as a character is oh so nice, and for a woman in her 50's, remarkably impetuous and self-absorbed. Her husband Joe is incredibly mild mannered and forebearing, and daughter Chrissy, evidently meant to be charmingly naive and innocent, comes across as petulant and spoiled. As so often happens with writers who turn out book after book, Macomber annoyingly depends too much on favorite phrases (e.g., he "wound his arm around her waist"). Less than halfway through this story, its central "mystery" became transparently predictable, and in the final 30 pages, all the pieces fell conveniently into their happy ending places. On the positive side, Macomber did a terrific job portraying the insidiousness of Alzheimer's. Perhaps her earlier novels are more skillfully written 
 What a bad product!  They didn't last two weeks before they began to smear my windshield 
 I think the only person that should read this is a person that loves or knows a lot about sailing. Even though the decreption was good I got really comfusid in the good parts of the book. Anyone that doesnt like or has no  clue about sailing should not read this book! 
 The history of the making of the Nancy Drew books is fascinating, and I did enjoy reading that part of this book. However, the author simply could not keep her point of view (that the Nancy Drew authors and creators were modern feminists, showing the great big male world what women could do back then) when the facts simply did not support this point of view. The author even says that the writers SAY they didn't think they were being pioneering or feminists, yet, the author tells, us, even though they say there weren't, they are, and Rehak insists on it. I can't understand how an editor could have allowed so much bias to enter into this book unless the editor, too, shared this slanted point of view.  So, read this book for the history, that part is fascinating. But take all the feminism with a grain of salt. Mildred Wirt Benson is a fasincinating lady, but her intention with Nancy Drew was simply to write a great story and earn a living. She was not trying to impress any men or show the male world that women rule, as the author seems to imply 
 I have to admit, I had to give up on this book by chapter 2, there were so many misspellings and factual errors: "Floradora" girls, Evelyn "Nesbitt," "gangster" Diamond Jim Brady, "P.T. Barnum's star Anna Held."   I really blame the publisher more than the author. Does no one send these books through fact-checking or to an editor anymore, or are they just churned through Spell Check 
 Disappointing in both technical and artistic sound.  Will probably give the cd away to get it out of my collection 
 I am in a Master's program in Science and Religion. The facts are, White was the first president of Cornell University. Cornell was the first secular institution of higher learning in the US. White was resisted because of his desire to make the University purely secular; in response he wrote this polemic specifically against religion. He misrepresents history on many counts. For example, he quotes the mythical account of Columbus' alleged conversation with Ferdinand and Isabella about sailing to the New World to show the earth is round. I was taught that myth in grade school, only realizing in the last few months that this is a fable. Washington Irving is the one that made the story up about Columbus, White quoted him, and the fable has been perpetrated since. White has been used to perpetuate the myth that the Christian Church held that the earth is flat, which is again completely false. No serious historian of science today accepts the conflict thesis between science and religion, and no one in the field accepts White as anything more than historical curiosity. While the book might inflame people already predisposed to attack religion, serious investigators about the relationships between science and religion would do better to read real historians such as John Hedley Brooke, David Lindbergh and Ronald Numbers, or Dennis Danielson. The nuances in historical episodes such as the Galileo affair, who by the way was never tortured, are much more complex than the simplistic parrot talk usually perpetuated about these subjects.  
 Mr. Auster's Trilogy is strong in stylistic innovation but sadly lacking in imagination. His themes, plots and characters reveal a writer with a broad exposure to European literature, but the sum total of the work feels repetitive, impoverished and too smart for his own good. I lost patience for his empty characters devoid of specificity. At times, it seemed like endless, nonproductive navel gazing on the life of being an artist/sleuth. It reminds me of a much weak version of Martin Amis' Times Arrow, which I rather liked, for all its flaws. 
 Muybridge's "The Human Figure in Motion" is a classic.  The frame by frame photographs of figures (male, female, athletes, children) are vintage photos from the latter half of the 19th century. They document action: carrying objects, a man jumping, child crawling, etc, as well as activities common to the time that are not evident in everyday activity now, such as discus throwing, fencing, woman pouring water from a jug, etc.  These photos, although small, are still of major importance to the artist who tries to understand muscle groups for drawing the figure.  Great resource book 
 I like John Grisham, but THE KING OF TORTS was a slow-moving disappointment.  Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel, which is fine, but he ends up putting the message above the story.     Grisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs' lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits.  This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain, in agonizing detail, how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees.  Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers, and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients.     In the end, none of this adds up to an engaging storyline.  It doesn't help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall.  Since I didn't care for this character, I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely uninvolving.  This novel is also rather preachy and heavy-handed in tone.   I personally dislike class action lawsuits, but I read novels for entertainment, not to validate my own political beliefs.   Although this book was decently written, I just didn't find the story interesting enough to recommend.  For a better version of this story, I would suggest A CIVIL ACTION by Jonathan Harr. 
 During fourth of july vacation, I had a chsance to see an old college friend, who is a vice president for a large computer hard drive firm... he was showing offf his new Toyota hybrid when we began talking about the market forces, which interfered with large companies responding to the emerging needs and changes in the marketplace.  I was fascinated as he explained to me the difficulty of an older company attempting to incorporate new technologies, while maintaining a profit margin necessary to please investors.  It was during this explanation, He recommended "The Inovator's Dilemma".  All I can say is that his verbal synopsis was far m ore interesting than this dry two-hour lecture on CD. I can only surmize that there must be another book by the same name 
 I had high hopes for this movie, Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, and Edward Norton, how could I go wrong with this movie with a cast like that? Despite the cast this movie sinks under a terrible script. The film is often tedious and the characters never seemed very realistic to me. This was a poorly contrived and at times silly film. The tension never really builds even though the filmmakers try. Embarassing for all involved. I only give it two stars to be nice to the cast 
 I bought this with great anticipation.  I was quite disappointed when I got it.  Billy Idol was never one of my favorites.  I don't recommend this one.  Save your money for something else 
 Though too fluffy and light-weight, 'Chasing Papi' is not as awful as some opinions might suggest.  Produced by none other than 20th Century Fox, one of the major Hollywood studios, it has enough budget to create the colorful looks and joyful soundtracks.  Sadly, the film just doesn't know the right way to use three surprisingly refreshing Latina-American actresses, and that's the real problem.  Well, but I think the opening chapters are awfully bumpy.  Think about this.  Thomas is dating three women at the same time; a Chicago laywer wearing glasses, a street-smart Miani cocktail waitress, and a rich, sheltered, spoiled daughter in New York.  Normally, this kind of guy cheating women, well-meaning as he thinks he is, is called Romeo, and I suppose most women would despise him, but because this Romeo, or Thomas, is so irresistible, the three women  cannot stop thinking about the possibility that SHE is the only one meant for him.  I wanna ask whoever gave the green light to this project -- are you living in the 21st century?  But to be fair, that is only the introduction, and wait a while.  The real point of the film is the ad-hoc coalition to get over the embarrassing situation (like Thomas fainting and an FBI agent watching it!), which eventually develops to the friendship between them through joining in a beauty pagent or dacing on the stage.  The film uses up its tricks pretty early on, and funny moments come very sporadically.  In fact, the characters, stories, and gags are all too familiar today, and look exactly dead art, like pie-throwing.  With short running time of 80 minutes, the film still looks padded out, and I didn't talk about the 'dream' sequences (including that of a chihuahua) that have nothing to do with the story.  As I said, the three leading ladies Roselyn Sanchez, Sofia Vergara, and Jaci Velasquez do act with gusto, and they did admirable job for their characters always remain likeable.  And I like Roselyn Sanchez, who has curiously attractive charms like Sandra Bullock, and was the only good thing in terrible film 'Boat Trip.'  I just don't understand why Hollywood must keep on wasting them in this awful films again and again.  Innocuous, fluffy, but that's not the problem.  The problem is that they could think of only hackneyed ideas to fill the 80 minutes.  And they used as many as four writers.           
 I heard that Shatterpoint was the best Star wars book ever. I don't get why everyone likes it. In my opinion it's a piece of crap. No it's worse. For one thing. It's way too long and I'm betting your thinking cause I'm a kid I don't read long books?. Well guess What?. I do. Shatterpoint stinks. No plot, no good characters. Their is nothing good about Shatterpoint. I read 145 pages and I can't read the rest. It stinks and that's all you need to know. Don't waste your money on this force sensitive 
 J.R. Nelson is correct!! Half of the movie, or DVD, viewing experience is the sound!!! This DVD is in mono!!!!!!!! All the positives about this series remains - the best of all time. But, the 3 Cruise versions all have way, way, better sound, and DVD extras. I fully recommend the 5 "Alias" seasons over this package because of the far superior sound, and obvious similarities to the original Mission: Impossible tv series. 
 Let me start this off by mentioning that I like most of John Fante's writing. He gets a little too mean-spirited for me at times, but in general I find him interesting.  This novel, on the other hand, shocks me by how bad it is. It's the story of this adolescent jerk who is also totally pompous. As someone who, like many people, could easily have been described as a pompous, adolescent jerk as a teenager, I thought I'd be able to relate to or enjoy this. Boy was I wrong. The only reason I even finished this thing was because I was on an airplane and didn't have anything else to do. Now I wish I hadn't, because it has soured me a bit on Fante. Some people whose opinions I respect seem to like this book, but I have no idea how. It left me angry and depressed, like Fante was pranking me from beyond the grave, wasting my time when I could've been reading something else. And to the guy who compared this embarassment to A Confederacy of Dunces: What are you, illiterate? Toole's novel is the funniest book I've ever read by about 1000 miles. There is nothing similar about the two except they each have a protagonist who lives via a misplaced emulation of his favorite philosopher (wildly different philosophers, by the way: Boethius and Nietzsche, there is no comparison). Don't read this book, read Toole, Nietzsche, or Mencken instead, even if you've already read them. Hell, read a copy of Tiger Beat or Seventeen magazine before this crap 
 I have been reading several good guides to the Montessori method, including one volume from the library I was able to get written by Montessori herself.  I was hopeful that this book by Lillard would give good sound advice for practical current infant Montessori techniques based on a sound knowledge of Montessori.  Unfortunately this was not the case.    My biggest complaint regarding this book was the disregard shown to infant well being.  Leaving an infant alone for extended periods of time is not advisable and can be dangerous.  I had a very large objection to her advice that infants should be weaned at 9 months whether the infant seemed "ready" or not.  That certainly does not seem to be respecting an infant's innate intelligence.  Then there was the potty training at 12 months advice.  Well that may be great if your child is showing signs of readiness, it would not be advisable for the many many infants who are simply not developmentally ready at that stage.  Those ideas of the author are in direct conflict with Montessori principles of giving children materials for their developmental readiness.  Not all children will be ready then and forcing them as the author seems to suggest will not likely lead to positive results.    There are much better guides out there and this one I simply cannot recommend as it is harsh and gives an impression of Montessori principles that is not truly accurate in many instances.  
 Those who wrote positve stuff about this book, please tell me why nobody even mentioned that the authors did not give the answers to all the excises in the book? I just can not believe this, am I missing something here? Is this a math book? What am I supposed to do now with those questions 
 Wuthering Heights the novel grabs you at the first page and drags you through passion, betrayal, madness, despair, greed, hatred, and revenge. It's not necessarily a pleasant read, but always an engrossing one. Emily Bronte's characters jump off the page and will continue to haunt you long after you've finished the book.   Modern day moviemakers have had a notoriously bad time translating any of the Bronte sisters' works into film and this is no exception. The characters are representations in name only and fail to capture any of the true spirit behind this amazing book. Juliet Binoche and Ralph Fiennes are two of the best actors working in film today, but this movie is a definite low point for both.    As Heathcliff and Catherine, Fiennes and Binoche seem to have failed to grasp the depth or the passions of the characters and their performances are flat and bland. Binoche's personality is too grounded and mature for the wild and carefree Cathy so she compensates with endless giggling that got on my nerves. Fiennes comes across as greasy and sullen instead of a tormented and complex soul; he simply does not have the charisma or the depth to play such a demanding role. The other characters are likewise lacking in realism, only Janet McTeer fares well, she is fabulous as Ellen Dean.   Even if the acting were better, the story does not capture the essence of the book. Everything moves too quickly, the film jumps around frequently and large plot holes are left either unexplained or are patched quickly with a few brusque words. Sinead O'Conner's appearance as Emily Bronte to bookend the film is contrived and unnecessary.  This film was very obviously made on a budget and the sets and costumes show it. The wigs are dreadful and the costumes are for the most part, ugly and unflattering. Fiennes actually looks potbellied in some of his vests!   Maybe someday someone will make a film that does this remarkable book justice. This isn't it 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 I have worked quite a bit with Somali refugees, and have established friendships with several individuals. I picked this book up in hopes of understanding more about the background of the older individuals I encounter (same "age" as Aman). The first third of the book I really enjoyed, and I think, learned much from. From that point onward, it seems to become less and less representative of "the general" experience or "a typical" experience. Though I cruised through the first part, by midpoint my interest was dropping off quickly, and I had to convince myself to finish it. If this is one of the better books to read about Somalia or Somalis, it is only because there are so few contenders 
 Top does not heat up enough to sear what you put into the pan. Also, it's very, very hard to clean. I am really disappointed by this product 
 Because of its popularity and its subject matter, I was very excited to read Chalmers' The Conscious Mind. I was horribly disappointed.  First, Chalmers' discussion of supervenience and intension in chapter two is horribly convoluted. Of course, Chalmers asterisked some of the more technical parts of this chapter so that the lay reader could skip them, but here's the problem: if you skip these sections, you are no longer able to critique the most crucial parts of Chalmers's argument!   Second, Chalmers engages in bizarre and fallacious reasoning. One of his central arguments runs like this: It is possible to imagine a zombie---that is, a being who is molecule-by-molecule identical to me, but who lacks phenomenal conscious experiences (i.e., qualia). Since imagining this involves no obvious logical contradiction, zombies must be logically possible. Since zombies are logically possible, qualia must not supervene on physical facts--that is, qualia are not logically dependent upon the physical. Since this is true, there can be no possible reductive, materialistic explanation of consciousness.  This argument is preposterous on its face, as many reviewers have noted, and it is only the hocus-pocus about supervenience and intension in chapter two which lends it even a little credibility. For example, let's assume that reductive explanation X can fully explain consciousness in terms of brain functioning. Even if this is true, it is STILL possible for us to imagine zombies right NOW---purely because of our ignorance of X. Since the zombie argument is a central pillar of Chalmers's text, its failure is a failure of the book as a whole.  Third, Chalmers has not done his homework when it comes to the arguments of other philosophers. For example (leaving aside the technical details), I would suggest reading Quine's essay "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" in From a Logical Point of View. Then, read Chalmer's discussion of Quine's arguments in chapter two of this book. Then reread Quine's essay (it's a tough essay). Chalmers utterly fails to refute Quine's arguments, and these arguments are absolutely fatal to Chalmers's entire enterprise--especially his ridiculous zombie argument.  Finally, Chalmers does not address previous attempts to explain qualia (phenomenal conscious experiences) reductively. Daniel Dennett, for example, spends an entire chapter of Consciousness Explained trying to provide just such a reductive explanation. Since Chalmers's whole point is to argue that the existence of qualia specifically makes reductive explanations of consciousness impossible, his failure to spend even two pages on Dennett's explanation is ridiculous. (Briefly, Dennett argues that qualia just are the sum total of all a person's visceral, cognitive, emotional, etc. repsonses to a particular object of perception.)  In its foundations, its approach, and its failure to address important arguments by Quine, Dennnett, and others, this book is an abject failure. Instead, I would strongly suggest purchasing the wonderful and varied essay collection Explaining Consciousness: The Hard Problem.   
 Not as good as I had hoped.  He explains a lot of Yiddish phrases that are not commonly used.  The commonly used expressions were not defined as well as I could have defined them myself 
 I fell in the pond once, and it really wasn't very nice, and this book brought back horrible memories for me, especially with its overly descriptive passages on pondweed and quacking ducks. I was too traumatised to carry on reading. Not a book for sensitive people 
 I bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds. He hated this carrier because he couldn't turn around and see the world. I hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move. The seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly (I tried numerous positions. There isn't a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable) and also said to tighten the straps so the baby couldn't move around. I did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear. The seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. (Note: there is a $5 return charge.) 
 What is up with the guides lately?Can they NOT get a walkthrough correctly?!IF you want to get almost everything in the game this is NOT the guide for you! Many errors! It tells you to go west when you should go east in many places. Also leaves you hanging in areas where you NEED detailed help.Had to call the Nintendo help line so many times for certain areas of the walkthrough. Mind you I played the game more than 1/4th without a guide.SAVE YOUR MONEY and go print a walkthrough from gamefaqs.comI am surprised because most Brady guides are good. This one will have you walking around in circles!I am ordering the OFFICIAL NINTENDO guide and hoping it will be better for the Oracle Of Seasons part.Nowadays you take a chance ordering game guides :(  Even one guide I had ordered from Nintendo was so wrong I had to call them and give them ALL the corrections.Such sloppy work nowadays. DISGUSTING! And yet they want to make money doing these things. HA 
 Even though I am not a Sophia Loren fan, I thoroughly enjoyed her perfomance in these 3 different short stories about 3 totally different women. Anyone born before 1940 should enjoy them as well 
 This is an OK film.  It has none of the mystery, the art, the ambiguity, or the brilliance of 2001.  It's just a rather straightforward story.  It explains everything that happens in 2001, which isn't the point.  One of the reasons 2001 worked so well is there were no explanations.  It just happened, and you were supposed to let your mind and imagination interpret it.  And as some reviewers have noted, the bizarre inclusion of a Cold War, US/USSR military confrontation over Central America was short sighted, stupid, and now, terribly dated.  It wasn't in Clarke's original novel, and Hymas should have never put it in.  Of course, this was made during the 80's, where we were led to believe that the Russians are going to invade any day now (needless to say, they never did).  It is nice to see Keir Dullea and Douglas Rain reprise their roles.  The rest of the performances are good for this kind of thing.  If there was no 2001, this would be an OK film.  But it's really an unnecessary sequel.  Read the book, instead.  
 I've made over 14 of the recipes in this book and my husband and I have loved every one of them.  The recipes are simple to follow, but taste complex.  This book offers a great variety of ethnic food items in addition to your regular ol' pot roast. 
 This book is horrible - not at all funny.  Waste of money - good thing it was relatively cheap.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone 
 I was enthusiastic about this book when I first scanned it at the bookstore.  Later, after trying a few recipes and spending more time with it, I found it to be mediocre.  
 ...Or you'll never read another.  I have been plowing through all the novels and this is by far one of the worst books I've ever read in my life.  The other books in the series (with the exception of the Calrissian Trilogy) are among the best books I've ever read.  The only reason I committed to finishing this one is because I'm on a quest to read all the Star Wars novels.  This one was brutal.  Too descriptive where it didn't need to be (ie author decides to up and describe some inanimate object which doesn't even help the story line along), not descriptive enough where it needs to be (ie author must assume you know what they were thinking when they wrote the book).  If this had been the first book I read in the continuing Star Wars saga, I would never have picked up another. 
 It never ceases to amaze me how conservatives prefer a brief read to something written in depth.  Perhaps some things are much too challenging for narrow minds.  I couldn't help but read some of the reviews, and I can never understand how conservatives can say liberals always have to revert to name-calling and using the word "stupid", and yet they constantly pepper what they say with insults themselves.  Typical.  I used to respect anyone's opinion, and I still try to, but when people clearly ignore facts and cling to their biases, without considering what they can see or use common sense, I have to call a spade a spade.  This book is funny only to those who find drivel funny.  It's not even well-written.  
 The book has lots to offer if you want a quick reference as to what role vitamins and minerals play in the human body. It also discusses different herbs, flours and sweeteners.  What it is also filled with is typographical errors. Who ever heard of "canal oil" (pg. 70) or "1/3 c. raising" (pg. 90)? The abundance of typos causes one to wonder about the accuracy of other information presented.  It has recipes that call for oddities like buffalo flour, date sugar, kamut spirals, organic chili, applesauce made from Gala apples, MSG-free Spaghetti Sauce and TVP. Even if you can figure out what these are, they can be difficult to locate and expensive. No serving sizes are recommended and calorie values are not given. How is one supposed to track caloric intake?  While this book does supply you with one week's sample menu, it does not explain why the menus are arranged the way they are. For instance, why is there a bedtime snack some days, but not others? On two days the menu includes fish, but the other days have neither meat nor fish. Are five vegetarian days required or is it flexible? Clear-cut directions are not given. I found it disappointing 
 I really wanted to like this book, but could not stand the depiction of women. The wife is a real ball-buster, the lesbian character is basically insane, and the one female with a heart is constantly being mistreated by the main character -- an alcoholic with the emotional depth of a high schooler. He's a nasty bit of business, not someone I enjoyed spending time with. 
 I was disappointed with my purchase.   The first two tapes in the series were fine, but when I inserted the 3rd tape into my machine the tape started feeding out the front of the machine.  I checked the tape and the wheels or sprockets they were wound on were loose and free floating inside the plastic casing.  I, then examined the other remaining cassettes and 4 of the 8 had the same problem.  I wonder if these products were seconds or something?  I would not order from this vendor again because it could have ruined my machine and because it is a hassle to have to return merchandise in today's busy work world.  
 I don't keep up with every single Ludlum book, and when I bought this in paperback I'd just assumed it was one of his earlier ones that I'd missed--since I was aware that he'd died.  About 15 pages into it I found myself looking back at the front to make sure I had the right book--the writing style was juvenile.  It felt like a high school kid's first attempt at a spy novel.    Then I looked at the printing date and realized I'd been ripped of by the publisher!  Ludlum did not write this, and it is so painfully obvious.  I trudged through another 100 pages or so--you know--figuring that I'd invested some time in it and it might get better. It never did.    I admit to not finishing it and I know I'm not missing anything. Just to get as far as I did was a tedious chore.    Robert Ludlum would be writhing in his grave if he knew the slop that St. Martin's Paperbacks is peddling in his name 
 After listening to Lori Petty and Debra Mazer read the first six novels, Lorelei King was a distinct disappointment. Stephanie is from New Joisey, for crying out loud. Not Nebraska, or wherever the bland Ms. King is from. a major delight of listeneing to the first novels was the wonderfully expressive voices of the readers. They gave attitude to the words. The latest efforts now sound as if they are being read by the local librarian, local if you live in Kansas, that is.  From now on I'll read these delightful novels, and listen to others 
 If you aren't a hard-core fan don't buy this CD. Spend your money on their first CD or "Hearts of the Innocent". If you have those two, be content that you have their best 
 Very limited selection of music.  Not at all what I wanted or needed.  There was nothing to tell what songs were on it, so I bought it without knowing.  THAT was MY mistake 
 I have read half of Jodi Picoult's novels and this one was such a disappointment. I didn't care for any of the characters and just wanted to scream during the last 50 pages. I only finished it so I could find out what happened. After reading My Sister's Keeper, Vanishing Acts, and Picture Perfect (3 of the best novels I have ever read) this one was a huge let down. It felt very impersonal and boring 
 I wanted to convert an HP LaserJet 4 Plus to a networked printer. Even though instructions from the manual was followed, the printer did not work. The customer support is claimed to be 24/7, but no one has closed my help desk ticket yet. This product cost more than a linksys router. So customers can naturally expect better customer service and better response time 
 ... this is a poor attempt at rediscovering the truths of Christ's passion. Faulkner says very little as to what his opinion of war is, his characters instead demonstrate an ethic that is apart from war. It is instead a story that lives within a war without being a commentary on war. Unfortunately, it is incomprehensible in language and style. Once you finish, it does redeem itself somewhat, in that you see what the point was (for most of it). But it is a harsh, rocky road to the end. I had to read it for a class... i wouldn't have gotten anywhere otherwise. Highly not recommended to anyone but Faulkner fanatics 
 I am usually enthralled by Maire Brennan's vocals. This time, I just can't get through the album without losing interest. She has several interesting, very beautiful solo albums.  "Perfect time" comes to mind as an example.  Get that one instead 
 Although easy to load a smart card, this viewer was disappointing in quality.  My pictures look fine on my computer, but the pictures were dark and there was no instruction on how to change the contrast etc. (although I found that it the picture could be adjusted, it was never mentioned in the manual).  The manual is, because of the comment above, disgustingly incomplete. If not going through the bother of returning it through Amazon because I purchased it on line, I would not have kept it.  I actually bought another digital frame that was smaller and cheaper and it was worse, otherwise I would have given it only one star.  I could have purchased a unit a Circuit City or BestBuy and been better off 
 I would like to cordially invite Dr. John Gray to visit and work in the public school system, of which many campuses are run exclusively by women. These women can be very matter-of-fact, get-down-to-business and get-the-job-done.  Those gals are there to work.  Some of them try to bond emotionally and some do not.  But they get their jobs done.  They often have to do things they don't "feel" like doing, but they do it and they do it darned well.    I think the best cross-gender communication, whether at work or socially, can be as follows;  1.  Listen as well as talk. 2.  Respect the other person's views. 3.  Don't try to make a psychological statement about another person's style, whether male or female. 4.  Don't hog the limelight. 5.  Respond with empathy. 6.  Park your ego outside the door.  In other words, practice GOOD MANNERS!  It works every time 
 Didn't know Hoover was to blame for all the problems of the world...Thank God for people like President Clinton 
 I missed the book club meeting that discussed this book but thought I would read the book anyway because everyone seems so enamoured with Ms. Cleage.  I read the first 150 pages of this book and I am bored to tears.   All of the reviews call this book astonishing; did the reviewers read the 1st 150 pages--nothing, absolutely NOTHING interesting happens in these pages.  Even if the author made up for it in the last 150 pages, this book could not be an astonishing book.  I will not be reading anymore Cleage books.  I, however, will try to finish reading this one since I started it.  My hopes for some excitement in the book,however, has been shattered by the other reviewers who state that the book doesn't even have excitement at the end of the book 
 This book is lewd, blasphemous & obscene. It is wicked, indecent, unnatural, immoral, filthy, bawdy, and an offense to public morals 
 I saw this at the library and brought it home, thinking it might be interesting to watch. I very rarely watch films made after the 1950's, but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable. It ended up being only mildly enjoyable, and a bit boring. I felt that within all the time it ran, we didn't really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters; seemed to remain in shallow waters all along. The film was sort of good...pretty photography,and for the most part it seemed like the costumes, hair, way of speaking, etc. were accurate for the time period (so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when) but something just wasn't quite right, and it is hard to know exactly what it was. I was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate. I think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity. I am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed. So I would not recommend this film for families with young  children, because of the nudity. 
 I am a longtime Govi fan and have all of his CD's.  That said, I have to agree with Amazon.com's editorial review of this CD. The two traditional Govi cuts on this release are darn good, but not among his best. The rest of the songs are, to me, filler material lacking a distinctive melody that do not generate any inner feelings, good or otherwise. The recording quality of "Jewel Box" is top notch. My overall conclusion: Govi has abandoned his great trademark sound for something that doesn't quite deliver. I sure hope that this is only a one-time experiment.     George M -- Phoenix, A 
 It is obvious from the responses here that this is simply a replication of the book in audio form.  I found myself mislead on the "Part II" on the cover - buyer beware 
 This guy thinks collectors want to see his own creations of what rare prototypes are. What a complete waste of time. Collectors want to see the real thing. Most of the "rare" prototypes in this book are fakes that Santelmo forgets to tell the reader. This book would be useful if you are interested in conterfeit items 
 There are SOOOO many GREAT books about wicca out there I certainly wouldn't waste my money again on this book, and I suggest others don't either. It is a lot of pop propaganda made to make wicca and witchcraft look like something out of the movies. It is full of false information made just to look cute so it will sell, sell, sell. This book is not for anyone who is seriously interested in learning Wicca or witchcraft in general.  This supposedly "advanced" book doesnt go into details on how to make your spells better, how to connect with nature, how to beome stornger. It doesnt encourage deep thinking and lots of factual information. It DOES however make the reader feel like they can just read a spell out loud from the book and it will all work in a puff of blue smoke. This book is not about a different of opinions or different practices, it is about portraying a real, serious, religion as a fun and games, do whatever you want choice as she mixes in things in tradtional witchcraft that has been shown to have the oppsite and/or nagative effects, as well as doing spells which do not follow the Wiccan rede.  Even though I am not in a coven I understand wicca is a religious choice and like any religion there are beliefs and redes which are followed. It is not 'do whatever you want to do and call yourself wiccan'. Yes some things in religion are personal choices but the building blocks of the religion are totally lost on her. Freedom of choice in religion is wonderful and its everyones right but if your choice is to make up your own religion you should not go around saying your wiccan when you do not follow the wiccan ways, Unfortunatly that is EXACTLY what ravenwolf does. She doesn't differentiate between the Wiccan and Paganism, in fact she barely cover the topics at all giving vague rehashed information from her other books. This book seems a nice commercial, cutesy items to make everything pretty and oh so shiny. This book is teaching hype not truths.   This book is demeaning and disrespectful to anyone into witchcraft and wicca alike. There are many good books which put things in simple, pleasant terms without all the false, goofy information spread thoughout this book.  Go pick up another book on whatever your interst (wicca, witchcraft, or paganism) and you will undoubtably end up more informed, this book will just leave you feeling broke. 
 The authors have maybe a bit too much expertise and experience to effectively write for "dummies" like myself.  Somehow after reading this, I had just as many questions as before.  Part of the problem is this book is way too comprehensive, covering such topics as sail-boarding.  I would rather have had more in depth explainations of the basics and more diagrams/illustrations 
 This toaster oven's timer is faulty - we were making toast, next thing we knew there was smoke bellowing out from it and the toast itself was on fire!!!  With today's technology Oster should take more care in providing a toaster oven with an accurate timer.  This oven almost started a house fire.  I would not recommend this oven to anyone 
 This book is unorganized, out-of-date, too focused on New York City, and on every other page promotes the authors and their careers...On page 7 they are telling you how much has changed with the computer age, and the internet, and one of the authors tells you he went to grade school and they used quill pens and fountain jars...okay, I didn't need to know that.  It was so annoying that by page 14, I was going to submit to them a list of improvements, but it would have been EXTENSIVE!  From there on just gritted my teeth and got through it...Good luck!  You'll be really tired of the references to the Trade City Bombing, and NYC in general, by the end of it 
 Did not like at all.  I ordered both of these CD's based on a song that I heard that was beautiful and melodic.  It was the only song on both CD's that was that way.  The other songs were more mechanical, etc.  Wish I had never purchased either CD.  Should have just got the one song off itunes 
 When I reviewed THE STREET LAWYER recently, I mentioned that I've never put down a Grisham unfinished and that we should throw the man some props. For that book, certainly. For this one, nope. I read four chapters, 41 of its 391 pages, and gave up totally unengaged and uncaring about any of his characters or his plot. I hope he just had an off day or something, and that what he wrote later got back to what makes him so readable. 
 Originally written in 1939 (and later revised by the author), this gritty crime novel has got a lot of fine elements in a nicely plotted armed robbery turned murder turned kidnapping.  Unfortunately, for me there wasn't enough detail in the motivation of characters to make it at all believable (not that I think believability is always necessary); I'm left with the impression that characterization in this book is rendered by a paragraph which says "Criminal A behaves like this because...."   Don't get me wrong, even though I just can't help thinking that every character in this novel is utterly s-t-u-p-i-d, it reads really good and is a great time passer that may serve to inform the reader about what Europeans thought about Americans (Chase (one of his pseudonyms) was an Englishman who learned about America from books).  What's most interesting to me is how nobody seems to understand the unfortunate Miss Blandish.  No review I have ever read gets her right (certainly none of the others on this page, so don't worry 'bout them givin' nothin' away).  Is she the victim of a "fate worse than death"? -- whatever that means today -- or is she the victim of something else?  Perhaps the spareness of detail here is what makes this novel work.  George Orwell thought it was nothing short of "brilliant."  What will you think 
 This movie has been praised for it's technical depictions, and indeed the guns, uniforms and sounds of battle are quite realistic.    The problem is that everything that goes into making a movie; dialog, plotting, pace, acting, and especially directing, are all terrible.  This makes the film seem quite unrealistic, with dialog composed with authentic slang, but with the atmosphere of a profane elementary school play from 1969.    I would also note that beyond the problems created by the lack of moviemaking skill plentifully in evidence, the movie tries to draw a heroic message not just from the men, but from a war that scarcely deserves it.  
 I actually wish they had given us director commentary on this disc because I would have listened to a little of it just to see what Barry Levinson was thimking and I would cross my fingers and hope he would blame the whole thing on a really bad drug trip. Take a look at the man's filmography and tell me if you think this absolute disgrace belongs there. Worse, he wasn't alone, SOMEONE ELSE liked the idea enough to co-write it. Everyone else can blame a large paycheck, but Levinson actually came up with the idea. This is one of the most beautiful terrible films I ever seen, if they took one tenth of the imagination they put into the set and toy designs and invested it into the screenplay they might have had a movie 
 I can't believe how you nice little English people can actually edit such terrible and unbelievable books!  I hope you'll never ever get another book published 
 Many women might find that this book provides a quick and fun pick-me-up.  Personally, I am really tired of being told that a bubble bath and rhinestone tiara will make my life better 
 In this book, Gladwell reaches the astounding conclusion that EXPERTS know more than other people. That if you spend YEARS doing something, or researching it, or training, you will be able to spot more details than others. A real eye-opener. 
 I guess success turned around for Sam Raimi in 2002 & 2004 with the two Spider-Man films, but first he created this "V" like character in this garage of a movie, I liked "V for Vendetta" but not this "Darkman" if want to see a badly burned viligante in a mask see "V for Vendetta" don't see "Darkman 
 Dont pay attention to any of these 4 & 5 star reviews. This album is a complete waste of time & space in anyones music library 
 If you like this book you will probably like "Bless the Child" by Cathy Cash Spellman.  They are very similar.  This book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded, simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple premise.  What a contrived piece of garbage!  I can't describe everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time.  If it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through.  If it's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak, worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious.  If it's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea for that is irritating.  That's how bad this book is! It can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying.  This author has no style.  The book reads like an episode of inside edition.  There is no immersion into the story.  The total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them.  As a reader I felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario.  The attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable.  I've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn.  The only reason I read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me.  Do not waste your time.    I must say though that this novel was inspirational.  If this crap can make the best seller list, it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published 
 very confusing, non-focusing writing style plus author's splurge of mathematical demonstrations everywhere in the book makes this text book very hard to understand and offers no help for people to grasp the beauty of the economic theory. 
 Before I get started with my review i must say one thing. Im not just a mindless hater, trying to bash a fanatical fanbase of the legendary superman franchise. I liked the original movies, with the real superman christopher reeves and the real lex luthor gene hackman. with that being said here is why i really didn't like this movie.  i felt it was too long and drawn out. Too much time was spent on Lousi lane crying and complaining about superman not saying goodbye before he left. she whined to her reporter friend, she whined to her husband, she whined to clark kent, she whined to her boss, and finally she whined to superman in another overly long melopdramitic flying scene. essentially making this movie a quasi chick flick/comic flick. and although the soundtrack was stunning at times, too much time was past just showing different scenery and background environments while letting the music play. yes atmoshere is great in movies but enough is enough.  basically im saying this movie was 90% melodrama and atmoshperic mumbo and 10% action.   and although the action scenes where pretty cool, it is nothing we haven't seen before in a superman flick, or any other super hero flick.   acting wise, i think the guy playing superman did a pretty good job, nothing compaired to reeves, but im not going to complain about that too much, he was servicable. and noone can complain about kevin spacey, he is just awesome, although i dont think he had the charisma that hackman has as lex. did not like louis lane. too whiney.  story wise, this movie didnt really make much sense. it was way too out there. i mean yeah its a fantasy story and you have to use your imagination but i mean come on. lex luthor is going to basically destroy over half of the worlds population by creating the new continent and people are just going to go "yeah lets move there" and lex is going to make lots of money. not likely. i mean it would take years among years to make that crytallic and dark damp place to be somewhat livable. i dont think that lex would really be the type to want to put years of planning and prep to make this work. i mean most criminals want their power NOW, instant gratification. maybe im being overly harsh on a fantasy storyline, i just think they could have thought of something better, and more feasable.  this movie was alright, it would have been helped a lot if they trimed about 30 minutes of melodrama away. and no i am not saying more action and less character development in movies, cause character developement is one of the most important aspects in the success of a truly great movie. however whiny crying does not constitute as strong character development in my book 
 I was excited to start reading this book when I saw it in the bookstore; however, my excitement quickly turned to boredom as I struggled to finish this tale. One of the comments on the cover of the paperback claimed it was Amazing Race meets Raiders of the Lost Ark or something like that. It was neither. I was hoping for a fast paced, traveling adventure all over the globe, as the descriptions lead me to believe - but it wasn't. I was hoping for exciting tomb adventures with traps and puzzles and such.  Once we take away all the excitement and adventures what do we have left? "The Codex." This story is a tale of stereotypical brothers who are not even well crafted characters for their stereotyped personalities. I guess it can be hard to create original characters from completely unoriginal molds. A failed love story, unbelievable character interactions, and the longest (and most uneventful) jungle adventure ever! I cannot count how many times the characters were turning back and heading for home, or talking endlessly about a panther attack that was going to happen in a few chapters, or the relative lack of adventure throughout this harrowing land of Hondurus. Besides a couple of lame actions sequences randomly thrown in, this book had nothing on the "Raiders of the lost Ark." Didn't even come close.  With a somewhat interesting premise this book had a lot of potential. However, to me it was dissappointing in all aspects because the story was forced along at a insanely slow pace. I could see a book like this being 300 pages or 350, but 400?! I love longer books, but only if they need to be long. I can't even remember what made this book so long, it must have been the endless mumbling about the travel in the swamps and the jungle.  My advice? Skip this one 
 This comeback was a big letdown.  I was really exited for Curt's return, and was hoping for some revolutionary music from T4F...Like "the Hurting" or "Songs from the Big Chair"...but instead i was really disappointed, as this disc of songs are quality songs... but they are so much like Beatles songs that I cannot tell if it is an homage/tribute, or just lack of original ideas (or fear of them).    This is a CD that does not compare with their early discs style and originality.  "Everybody Loves a Happy Ending" is like the song "Sowing the Seeds of Love", but more extreme in it's imitation of the Beatles style/sound.    It wasn't a happy ending 
 Who would read all these reviews, and then actually buy this book? This book is an unfair attempt at pandering to the doddling whims of a major portion of our population...the suckers...of which I am obviously one, because I did read the stupid book! It took me almost a year to get through it - one half paragraph at a time before I would fall asleep each night. If it wasn't for Jordan, I'd have a hard time going to sleep at all. It doesn't even deserve 1 star 
 I got two pairs of these for my kids and they could hardly walk after wearing these.  Unless the bottom of your feet are tough I would not get these 
 Don't buy this camera!!!  Prone to "Memory Error" & E18 errors after warranty is up.  Cost min $150 plus shipping to fix.  This camera was great until 23 months went by then I started mysteriously losing pictures due to file format errors.  I switched memory cards and it happened again.  Then the "memory error" displayed after a month or so of losing pictures.  Now it doesn't work at all.  I called canon to see what type of service could be provided and if they would fix what appears to be a factory defect since so many people have reported this problem.  Minimum cost is $150 or I could upgrade to a refurb S500 for $199 w/6 month warranty.  They have to be kidding, $250 get me a new one.  For what appears to be common problem I was expecting more from canon.  Guess I won't be buying another canon.  Google this "Canon "Memory Error" E18" and see for yourself that Canon cameras have problems. 
 Please spare yourself the pointless meanderings through what should be simple statistical techniques and buy a real statistics book 
 My review is basically a review of the reviewers. In particular I am going to pick on the reviewer who wrote "A substantial and objective view of a Latin American Legend..." February 9, 2004, Matthew Dubuque. Because of that review I decided not to buy the book. (I haven't read it but based on the reviews I've changed my mind about purchasing it). Most reviews listed here whether critical of Castro or critical of his deriders, have really missed the point. It's all about ignorance.   Centralized Power What many fail to see is the problem of centralized power found exclusively in the hands of the State. How many times have we heard about how even if Hitler was bad, he had the trains running on time and brought back an economy from the ruins? God forbid something good should happen in a person's life and the government doesn't get credit for it. The friends of Liberty are few indeed. Cuba, at least in our Hemisphere is an example of centralized power destroying life and lying about its success even if it is successfully argued that the individual should take a back seat to the communal good.   Politicians If in fact a "conservative" "appointee of Margaret Thatcher" wrote this book it betrays that even the Hawks like the right in the UK and US are way off when it comes to Cuba. If it was "written by an appointee of the free-market heroine Margaret Thatcher" that gives credence to the view that there isn't much difference between political conservatives and modern political liberals: they go about arguing for different roles government should have in a person's life but they both want government in a person's life. They aren't too far from the likes of Castro.  Castro and Latin America To say Castro is deserving of praise like that given to Simon Bolivar shows how much ignorance there is of Latin America in the United States. The common view here is that all Latin Americans are either lazy, deserve their governments, come from naturally corrupt countries, and can only be saved by the strong man. It is interesting that those who hold similar views in the States don't prescribe such a government in their own hometowns- different rules for special people, I guess.  Further proof of the mass ignorance in the States about Cuba in particular is seen in the reviewer's statement: "Coming from a decisively Thatcherite background, the author's commentary is neither distorted by the hysterical whiners in Miami nor is it merely pinko propaganda." I can assure you that the Miami whiners are anything but: many have recreated their lives as Americans never to return to Cuba (without any major complaint), never involving themselves in politics or in some cases holding very liberal and pro-government views. Those who have complained and taken action (such as attempting to overthrow the Castro regime) the US has dealt with forcefully. Many of those active whiners now serve life terms in Federal prison for their actions (so much for the US's claim that it fights for the freedom of the oppressed worldwide).  The other more peaceful "whiners" in Miami have reasons to protest. Their family members have been: shot by firing squad, drowned by Cuban coast guard, attacked by US coast guard, tortured in Castro's prisons, divided by both the US and Cuban governments, and so on.  Another point of ignorance is the claim that Fidel lost many of his men by massacre during the revolution. This is not the case. The real major bloodletting took place once Castro came to power. Typical of all tyrants, he purged many of his own clan accusing them of conspiring against the revolution (challenging his power, reasoning and/or techniques). Plus, the vast majority of Cuba had no idea who Fidel Castro was. Castro merely appeared stage left, made his entrance and delivered the speeches. The "revolution" against Batista and Cuba's past was largely an action of the political class (those already in power) which of course Castro was not a part of.   Literacy  Literacy rates never are guaranteed by the government. In Cuba there is no way to cross examine the claims of government as the press does in a free society- such as questioning the claims of a government that states another country had a weapons of mass destruction. Just look at the US. Its literacy rates were highest in the world up until after the Civil War. Decade after decade its own government has kept records showing that the more government involves itself in the education of its citizens (increased spending) the greater the illiteracy (at least since the 1950s). Most students here today cannot even point out their country on a map and know very little about economics (a greater reason for their willingness to depend on government and hate the rich).   Blockade? The blockade is another point of contention. The word blockade first of all is a malapropism. There are no war ships blocking the ports of Havana. The embargo against Cuba is a joke. The first supporter of Cuba is Washington. The relationship between Havana and Washington is more that of two former lovers who criticize (directly and indirectly) one another's current lifestyles and actions- calling each other names but also ready to stop the actions of outsiders to the relationship lest it create the impression that the outsider has a stake in the former lovers' relationship- than the relationship of two archenemies. If you don't believe me, take a look at Washington's willingness for regime changes all over the world, its reluctance to take action against Cuba or allow others (the outsiders of the relationship) to take that action and its cozy relationship with Cuban military along Guantanamo base/border.  Prenatal Care, medicine, and homelessness If a mother misses a visit to her doctor in Cuba I wouldn't doubt the doctor visits the mother the next day. Undoubtedly since the State is ever present in such a system in every person's life, either the doctor or the mother have a political role in that relationship. And if either fails the State (list Castro here) the State will most assuredly fail them in respective their natural liberty (prison awaits). I doubt that mother would care about doc's visit knowing that the visiting doctor lacks supplies. (I know, its Castro's fault or the embargo's fault. Why can't it be the people's fault? When will they rebel?) This is nonetheless the case even in the US. Soon we will see our dear friend the Nanny Government knocking on the doors of all poor neighborhoods making sure that mothers get their prenatal care they deservedly need for the nurturing of future robots (I'm sorry, I meant to say patriotic citizens). Keep in mind that the medical doctor in the US is in fact an agent of the government. Try getting some medicines you need without a prescription. Said medicines are approved by the government, tested by the government and monitored by the government.   I am also certain that in Cuba there are no homeless because, well, there are no homes to be homeless from. Take a look at photos today of Havana and you'll see why some Cubans might want to be homeless than to live under the roof of a soon to be condemned structure.   After reading this book and writing all the things Dubuque wrote it is hard to believe that one can honestly state that the book is a "balanced examination...".. The reviewer also goes on to say that he goes to the island twice yearly on licensed visits. (Governments love to help one another regardless of their official declarations concerning one another.) The reviewer explicitly states how government supports his trips to Cuba which in turn create his view of Cuba. He states that his visits are "fully authorized", no doubt, with the Treasury department's rubber stamp, Havana's offering of tourist traps and his safe flight back to the US, causing his rose colored lenses to sit firmly on the bridge of his nose as he tells us what he has seen in Cuba 
 I just finished it and my first thought was "What an awful, awful book." I was really excited about reading this one too because the back jacket held such great promise. (i.e. "haunting world of avarice, skullduggery, and exceptional evil." Oh really?? I guess I missed that.) Seems more like an ordinary, even dull, murder story. The main narrator even has to mention that there is exceptional evil afoot. Should he really have to point that out?   As others have mentioned the plot is very convoluted with numerous side stories and people that after the fact seem to contribute nothing to the main story. How many times do I have to read a narrative on King Alfred? At one point yet another person wants to tell Alfred's story and the narrator says he doesn't need to hear it again. My only thought was "Oh thank god!" (I'm still not clear on what this story had to do with the mystery.)   I still don't understand how some of the characters were connected to the murder and what their motivations were. Also, the mystery was wrapped up too nicely w/the Indian boys narration at the end. He basically spelled out exactly what happened. But shouldn't that have been done throughout the book instead of dumping it at the end? (It's like the author got bored and didn't feel like writing anymore. But I don't think we can fault him for that after all the filler he wove into the story that contributed absolutely nothing to the mystery.)   I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I don't think it is particularly brilliant like all of the quotes in the book make it out to be, nor is it well written. 
 It wasn't obvious to me which battery to purchase for the Olympus Stylus 710.  This is not it.  I had to send it back and get the Li-40B 
 I'm driven to write a short negative review by the acclaim this series of books seems to generate.  I suppose I'm alone in thinking that in reading a history of philosophy you should aim for unique perspective, erudition, or outlandish insult.  I don't think this series of introductions fulfills any of these roles.  While finding a general consensus in the rating of philosophical systems is a pipedream not worth pursuing, there are so many alternative histories worth perusing, that I would advise anyone with a modicum of lively interest in the subject to avoid these books.  Even if your looking for the comic book variety of "how to" manuals, there are better to find.  I'm repulsed every time I've browsed this title in the local superchain 
 I am a man who loves his classic rock, but I don't shun modern music.  However though, I just hate bands like these who add Absolutly nothing to to the music scene other than giving people urges to gouge their ears out.  This is just terrible.  Laffy Taffy is the worst song of the year.    We need some good music to come out.  I can't say that much, other than this stuff will be on it's way.  Read the other reviews as well, they all know what they are talking about, but I am just adding the back up, for the sake of power in numbers 
 This book is most useful if one wishes to study Walter Kaufmann.  This book is a waste of time if you wish to study the writers Kaufmann presents to us.  Kaufmann warps the texts to suit his own agenda.  If you share his agenda you will likely not even notice that he has an agenda.  "If you make people think they are thinking they will love you, but if you really make them think they will kill you. " - Albert Einstein  
 How can a book about gender struggle written by two esteemed feminist intellectuals miss the boat entirely in examining such an important issue? Doctors Cole and Sheftall waste numerous pages explaining and analyzing the actions of black males within the dynamic of male/female relationships. How about analyzing the actions of women and shedding insight into their psyche? The book is written in an almost apologetic tone to explain male mis-steps. Even worse, it coddles black men, panders to them and persistently excuses their damaging behaviors by blaming their actions on the ever present perpetual myths of racist economics and the legacy of slavery. Historical quotes and antiquated interviews are plentiful especially by Black scholars Cornell West and literary master Essex Hemphill. They even give rapper turned actor Ice T a chance to explain away macho male behavior in an interesting yet un-enlightening chapter on the degradation of women in the lyrics of much HipHop music. But they fail over and over again to tap into real women and real problems that women face and the role that women's lack of self esteem and identity plays in the disintegration of relationships. Although a few notable women were quoted, specifically Audre Lorde and Essence's Susan Taylor, their contributions were not impactful because they were not given nearly as many pages. While I am glad that the sisters brought the subject to the forefront, I am dismayed that (as usual) so much time is spent on understanding why men cheat, beat and are in jail only to come up with the same lame conclusion - slavery, racism and poverty - while totally ignoring the women who "hold up half the sky". Very, very disappointing 
 I sincerely wish that amazon.com allowed 0 stars.  There were too many "eyerolling" moments in this book, not to mention that the copy editor must have been on vacation.  The plot, which involves a voluptuous woman and ex-rock-and-roll star who get married because of the terms of a will and then begin to fall in love, would have been far more believable if the author would have spent time in story development to make us care about the characters.  This does not happen.  Consequently, the characters come off as simply unbelievable and cliche-ish.  Save your money and pass on this book 
 I bought this book sight unseen based on the positive reviews and the recommendations of others.  There is nothing wrong with the book, it has a good rating, but I just didn't like it.  First, I found the author's photos very boring.  Very low contrast (could be a problem with the printer/publisher, but if so this is still not an excuse) and just plain dull.   He has a photo of something brown and asks if it's a photo of a puddle or an arial photo.  I have no idea but whatever it is, it's not interesting or pretty to look at.  Some of his triumphs come from things like jumping up and down while taking photos of trees (result is pretty bad), zooming in and out, etc.  It's like if you gave an SLR camera to a kid and let him play with it.  Yes, we should all be as naï¿½f as kids some time and think outside the box and all that, but this book just isn't going to teach you how.  One exercise he discussed was to take an egg and photograph it in different situations.  Sounds like fun, but I was expecting a lot more from the book.  A few good things, he does talk about photography and doesn't try to sell himself and his photos.  many books are more about the author than the book itself, but not this one.    I suggest any potential buyer first look through the photos.  If you like them, buy the book.  If you don't, then pick another.  This isn't a book to be bought mail order sight unseen 
 The Leak-O-Matic fully lived up to its name.  As a new parent, I don't have time to do things once, forget about doing things twice.  I need simple and reliable- the Leak-O-Matic is neither.  It worked OK for the first few times, then I partially filled the tub and put all the items nearby necessary for bathtime.  By the time I returned with baby in hand, the Leak-O-Matic had dribbled all over the laundry room counter, soaked all my other items on the counter, water ran down onto the floor, under the baseboard, and dripped from the upstairs landing onto the downstairs foyer floor.  The Leak-O-Matic is the Hindenburg of all baby bathtubs.  It is too bad that I cannot give it zero stars.   There are many people who say that you just have to assemble them correctly, but judging from the number of irate mommies here, I conclude that it is either too a complicated design or just plain crappy engineering.  Think about it- the number of people with young children who took the time to go online and tell everyone that this thing is a piece of cheese!    The cups on the feet stick to the countertop so you are unable to positon the tub once it is attached.  The fabric mesh incline allows the baby to slide down into the water, so you're always repositioning the baby.  I'm surprised that this thing didn't come with a built in toaster for 'added safety'.  I did not research every single item on the registry- I figured that if the big stores carried it then it must be at least "OK".  Back it goes.  If you buy this thing, then good luck to you, and don't burn the toast! 
 I don't have an opinion on the book itself, it's a requirement for a class. However, I thought although there were restrictions (understandable copyright issues) on printing, I could have the inexpensive ebook, and print a hardcopy to take to the class. If you have printer issues (and you will) you will be penalized for those copies, whether they are printed, readable, or not. Subsequent downloads to override posed a different kind of printer issue, as it began printing pages 'backwards'...so I'm still out my pages. I'll have to buy the hardcopy anyway 
 I ordered this DVD for my husband who is teaching a World History class at a local high school.  We love the movie itself, but the quality of the product was sub-par.  There were several times during the movie when there was an annoying scratching sound that would continue for a while.  I thought this was a new DVD and not a used one, but the annoying sound during parts of it causes me to wonder about that.  The speed with which we received the DVD was right on!  He did get it in time to use in his class.  So that's a plus.  Just wanted you to know about the quality of the video itself.  
 Chick Hicks is one of the hardest cars to find but keep trying.  My nephew wanted this car for Christmas.  My sister had everyone she knew looking for this car for 3 weeks.  We finally found it at Toy R Us for $3.49 a week after Christmas.  We had managed to find all the other cars before this one.  Don't pay this price for it.  Now that Christmas is over there will be a lot more of these around 
 This book is simply awful. I gave up after a hard slog through ninety percent of this dreck. The author simply can't write. It sounds callous, but after enduring this book I feel less sympathy towards the yound Marines fighting and dying in Iraq. No wonder they call them grunts. I made a resolution long ago to never read books by the enlisted and this book reinforced that. That Mark Bowden of Black Hawk Down fame endorsed this book is unfathomable to me. Read 'A Rumor of War' by Philip Caputo if you want a superbly-written account of war. On the other hand, if you want to waste time and money, read Jarhead 
 Harder to get into than I first thought.  The kids are anxious to get to "work" and fidget getting into this, the arms are a bit too tight.  It seems bulky as well.  Better off going old school - daddy's old shirt on backwards 
 Why not just take up belly dance?  This machine uses some of the same principals, but you'll get a safer, better total body workout belly dancing!  Check your gym for classes or buy an instructional DVD 
 I saw the author during a book signing on television.  I saw a young, intelligent, articulate lady who had some very interesting ideas about American culture.  I picked up the book to learn more about her and her ideas.  Unfortunately, though there is a lot of meat in this book, simply put, I was bored...bored...bored.  This is not a subject I take lightly and believe me, I wanted to like this book because I like the author.  I have to agree with a lot of the reviewers here.  There is a lot of data and no real point.  A lousy effort and there are few people more disappointed than me 
 There was absolutely no substance to any of the stories in this anthology. I wanted Christmas romance and instead I got bed hopping characters who you can't help but dislike. And even though the stories were extremely short, it was still sometimes hard to follow along and understand what was going on. 
 This straightener is great for thin hair... but not for thick. I myself have very thick hair and this straightener usually leaves my hair looking frizzy and very poofy. The best hair straighteners out there are about 1" thick or less and they normally have glass plates. So if you have thick hair, spend a little more money on something with a lot more quality 
 This band sucks really bad it's worst than hearing jonathan davis trying to sing with anger and issues. The lead vocalist (who i can't stand) sounds like she's nagging out loud with anger and the group plays terrible with their guitar and bass. I don't consider this metal at all it's even worse using this as a drinking coaster (which I don't need) that will increase your head ache. 0/5 stars 
 I had read a lot of Emily Dickinson's poetry and some brief article biographies of her life before reading this book. So I was looking forward to a book-length biography. I was disappointed. I feel the book could have been edited down to one third or one fourth of it's tedious length. Who really cares about a relative's business dealings? I skipped over those boring pages, trying to find facts on ED's life. I didn't find much.  I feel I can know more about Emily through simply reading her poetry, some of which I still find hard to understand. I admire her for not seeking fame or money through her gift of writing. She was a true artist with words.  Go to this site to read her poetry online: http://www.bartleby.com/113/ 
 "Moby Dick" has been hyped far beyond its worth because it was the first American novel with philosophic pretentions. You could read the first ninety pages, then skip to the last ten and miss nothing but a binful of symbols. It's gauche, jejune, primitive, a graphic novel without illustrations--one of the few American novels improved as a Classics comic book. Joseph Conrad covers the same material better, and Persig better than either of them. This is a wearying tome that no one would read if it weren't assigned reading. It will teach you . . . nothing 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 I am very interested in the Fragments affair and was eager to read this new account of it. Unfortunately I found this book disappointing. It adds little new to the other published works, notably historian Stefan Maechler's excellent account which was published in English last year. While Eskin has a good style, his narrative is jumbled, he skips around a lot and it is often hard to work out what is going on. Also Eskin virtually ruins his own book by going on endlessly about himself when it is really not relevant to Wilkomirski's story. There are too many unnecessary uses of the words I, me, and myself by Eskin to make this a focussed study of the Fragments affair 
 The editorial review goes on about how lavish a production this movie was. It  really wasn't. Simply having a few cheap props, mono coloured rooms and a cast of extras dancing about doesn't mean much. Pit and the Pendulum was the most lavish production. Pit also had superior music. Masque suffers from a bland plot. The only thing that saves the movie was Price.   It should also be noted this dvd is not a quality dvd. It may not play in all players. I think this is the last "midnight movie" double features I buy. This is my second. The other plays in my computer's dvd player, both sides. This dvd only plays one movie on my computer's dvd player. No doubt these dvds are being ran off in someone's garage. 
 This is a beautiful but creepy book: a lost sheep all alone, terrified by UFOs no less into fleeing into a strange, deserted home, is not my ideal bedtime reading for a sensitive child. The strong colors are beautiful and a nice change from baby-pastel, but they are also ominous and deterring. His utter solitude, in exploring the house (creepy corridor with blood-colored doors), eating, and finally sleeping, is horrifying to a child with imagination, whose most overriding terror is abandonment. I give it points for beauty and originality, none for sensitivity to the needs of its target audience, and cannot recommend it 
 You probably already know more about Persians than the book writer himself. Disappointing. Better to spend more and really Learn about Persian cats 
 I'm glad I checked this book out of the library instead of buying it. I remember reading The Flying White House by  J.F. Ter Horst (Ford's press secretary) and Col. Ralph Albertazzie (Nixon's pilot), and looked forward to an updated story with the 747, plus presidents Reagan, Bush 41, Clinton and Bush 43.  Unfortunately, Mr. Walsh displays a clear bias, with far more petty comments about the Democratic presidents than the Republican ones, save for Nixon. He's especially biased against LBJ and Clinton, taking every opportunity to  make a negative comment. By contrast, he plays George W. Bush far too heroically than more objective journalists have.  Although The Flying White House was written in 1979, and thus misses much recent history, it is a far more interesting book, with better and more detailed stories, particularly the pivotal role Air Force One played on November 22, 1963 (which I consider the most momentous event in the airplane's history, not September 11, 2001 as Mr. Walsh contends).  I'll admit I enjoyed Air Force One overall simply because I'm fascinated by both aviation and the presidency. But this book stacks up poorly against the earlier work by Ter Horst and Albertazzi 
 I don't know who wrote the 5 star reviews of this book, but they're like those actors in bad TV ads claiming that they lost 100 pounds in 8 weeks. Those rave reviews are hard to stomach. This is a really bad book--I agree with the person who said that they would give it zero stars if they could (half the book IS empty blank pages for your journaling). There is not much that's helpful in this book. Much better and thorough are (1)  The Thyroid Solution by Ridha Arem, (2) Living with Autoimmune Disease by Mary J. Shomon, & (3)Thyroid Power by Richard L. Shames and Marilee Halo Shames. These books are better researched and are compassionately and well-written by M.D.'s and/or persons with personal experience with thyroid problems.  Skip this book by Dirgo 
 It's just one of those things you end up watching at 3 in the morning. But skip this one. You should be sleeping. I am a die-hard Strokes fan so when New York Stories came out, I had to have it. Much to my disappointment, it turned out to contain no music by The Strokes, or interviews with any members of the band.  If you still feel like you need to see this DVD, don't pay more than $5 for it. You have been officially warned 
 I liked the shows when the 1st ran on tv; the unrated didn't quite live up to my expectations 
 I regret this purchase.  As one reviewer said, this is just a coffetable book. It doesnt introduce any new idea to an educated woman. Who cant roll a napkin and tie a ribbon on it ??? It doesnt take a professional caterer to know that !!!  Funny, but an out of print 1960's cookbook by Mary and Vincent Price ``A Treasury.....'' showed far more intricate, elegant, and exquisite napkin foldings. The utensils showed in Tabletops are not even for very dining ! Worse, an old item was made to pass off as an antique centerpiece and I am a professional antique collector. I lived in Europe and this book does not deserve space in any European home or library. What I saw here, I see frequently in crafts store windows in small towns.  DONT BUY. I got instead ``Perfect Setting'' by Peri Wolfman (?) and finally, I got something intelligent with truly new ideas to captivate an intelligent woman. At best, give this book to a grade school kid 
 This was kind of an impulse buy for me and I didn't get what I thought I would get. I thought it would be a clear and concise magazine on what is up and coming in TV and the Movies. Instead I got indepth ramblings on actors and directors. If you want to pick up a magazine and find out what is coming up without fluff and filler...this is not the mag for you. 
 I would have to agree with both the positive AND negative comments about this version of Mozart's Die Zauberflote. All the technical and production comments are accurate enough,but also,(and more importantly),1)This opera is written in German and I'm a big believer in performing great operatic works not only in their entirety,but also in their original language, 2)AND most importantly for myself,the opera is intended to be a comedy;yes,but a BLACK COMEDY! This production turns it into a FARCE,(which is why children probably love it so much).If the kiddies saw this opera as intended,(regardless of choice of language),they would probably go running and screaming to dive under their beds and shake! The evil Queen really IS EVIL! More like in Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty' than say, Jareth in 'The Labyrinth',(as a reference only). I think one is able to get a little more comfortable with Bergman's Queen than Mozart intended. 'Nough said 
 I'm sorry, I wanted to like this book. It is well written. However, it is written in what I would characterize as a pretentious style. I'm sure many may enjoy this style, but I prefer a more realistic, down to earth narrative. Tolstoy was literate but he wasn't usually pretentious.   The main woman character also bothered me; she was just not believable. Maybe there are women who kiss men within hours of meeting them, but I don't know of any. (An expansion of my circle of acquaintances might be in order.) Possibly this was written for a more romantically inclined spy novel audience. I don't know.   Rarely do I not finish a book, but this is one that I didn't. I would recommend Alan Furst over this author for a WWII spy novel 
 I tutor and this is the worst Geometry textbook I've had to use. Geometry is a new branch of mathematics to most students and can be difficult to comprehend. This book only makes it worse. The lack of examples and clear explanation is very frustrating. I empathize with any student forced to endure this text 
 Watching "Toys" was like watching "Teletubbies" dumbed down for an audience of subhumans.  Six Million Jews died in concentration camps during World War II.  It took the combined forces of the free world to stop this genocide.  Williams and the production company that made "Toys" are just closet nazis.  Inasmuch as I watched this self-righteous piece of elitist garbage, I can say without any hestiation that if you believe that whole nations would be better off in the hands of two-bit despots, then maybe you'll be stupid enough to accept the premise of this unadulterated nonsense.    Pray for peace, but never give in to evil 
 I continue to be astounded at how carelessly Amazon reviewers throw around their 5 star ratings.  This movie is overlong and not especially comedic or romantic.  The main character (or the actress who plays her anyway) is appealing, but her motivations to start a new life aren't convincing or justified.  Her "romance" with the waiter is ludicrous and the ending is contrived and predictable.  It actually took me 3 days to see the ending because I just didn't have the patience to view this from beginning to end in one sitting.  IF you are a patient, die-hard romantic with 2 hours to kill, I guess you might enjoy it.  I am not and I did not 
 i bought this thinking that this would be fun and a decent workout, i tried it a few times but just couldnt get in to it. it go's a bit fast but i know i could get used to it, but they have very big steps and they lung into it and i think it would be better if they work up to it i kept finding myself rewinding it to do the step corretly i dont realy strive for perfection i just want to do it some what right. there are better ones out there than this, but i think i am going to try it again cuz it wasnt so bad that i am going to quit it 
 This novel has some campy appeal since it introduces us to the famous Sam Spade, the morally ambiguous, hard drinking, but devastatingly attractive private eye.  The rest of the characters in this short novel don't amount to much, and as a result I didn't find the plot of much interest either.  I have to believe that this novel was voted onto the Radcliffe List at least partly on the strength of the movie that was based on it 
 Most of the reviews as far as I can tell are for the actual paper version of the book, but I just wanted to comment on the audio verson.  It's bad as you can tell from the title of my review.  The reader is slow and makes the story drag on and drag.  Despite that, I managed to get through 15 hours of agony because I spent so much buying this audio CD.  Again, the story moves very slow in the audio CD version 
 this book stinks on ice. No offense of corse. This is not one of NB's best books. I read ten pages and then i knew the ending. A boy goes on top of a volcano to find a monster. it turns out the monster is, well i won't give the ending away. Stick to your Harry Potters and Artimis Fowl. I really advise you not to by this book. Please don't. I am not sure if you will but if you do buy it, it will be in the garbage can in two days or les 
 Don't bother buying this.  It's pretty much a rehash of what's already been written by this author and others (often word for word).  Go the bookstore and skip to the section on the Lakers for anything you might have missed 
 I'll admit right out that I am only a student (college) and still (relatively) new to studying the history of the conflict, but with that said believe that this book was given the wrong title.  The title leads you to believe that maybe finally there has been an unbiased book written about the conflict that will refute both sides stories and give you some truth, but all I seem to find is information that discredits the Arab side of the story, leaving it extremely one-sided.  I believe that this book in the wrong hands has the potential to produce some violent anti-Arab behavior.  Look at the chapter devoted to Arabs threatening Jews, you could just as easily fill a chapter with Jews threatening Arabs, but what positive effect will that have?  For those of you in my position, just started out researching the topic and maybe still a bit naive, it is my recommendation to stay away from this book.  It is easy for some to fall into the trap of either anti-Semitism or anti-Arab sentiments and this book is only an invitation for the latter.  
 Unless you are a first timer to the area this book will tell you very little.  While the information regarding the area (complete with maps) can be helpful the information on new restaurants and hotels is non existant.  (I notice they didn't list many resorts including the well known Palace properties).  This can help you with local things but use some other source for where to stay/eat. I also found the web had more information then this book did.  The only difference I can see with this book was that they added "great websites".  Which really consist of about five very generalized sites.  If you want an overall view it is fine.  If you want detailed info (where to eat, where to stay) I would suggest another publication 
 I found this book completely useless except for a paperweight or doorstop!  What I did find interesting is that Vickie Adkins-Marcum seems to review all of Matthew Lesko's books.  Of course Vickie highly exalts him using such phrases as "KUDOS to Matthew Lesko! He's making this world a better place!"  For those of you who are a little slow, let me inform you that Vickie Adkins-Marcum is really Matthew Lesko, or someone Matthew gave this review to and paid Vickie to post it.  It's strange that Vickie's reviews all start out with the same first paragraph and have many of the same phrases throughout.  It is also strange that Vickie only reviews Matthew's books.  Shame on you Matthew Lesko for writing your own review 
 The Title of this CD threw me off; the description and the first review didn't help either.  The primary reason for buying this CD was the song "You Are My Sister", but this version is a duet with someone that can't sing. I can't tell which CD has a version of the song as seen on Letterman. Disappointing 
 Personally I did not like this book. It was too Christian with everything having to relate to Christianity. I did not find it funny at all. The stories are the kind of thing you get in emails. 
 I was expecting something nice looking, something that looks like 30$ or so worth. But instead we get this cheap looking cloth made crappy thing. The baby never liked it. I wouldnt pay more than $5 for this item. I think its a scam, they make people think its so good but then you get that.  Please dont buy it or you will be disappointed. Thanks  
 After her mother's mysterious death in India, Gemma Doyle is sent to a boarding school in England. Gemma is troubled by her mother's death and the strange visions that she is receiving. At Spence Academy, she feels like an outsider until her magical powers manifest themselves in the ability to travel to another realm. Things unravel as Gemma has to separate evil from good.  This book is written in as a first-person-present-tense narrative, which makes it very awkward to read. The point of a novel is to tell a story, not to think it. Besides--who thinks in coherent sentences? There are several inconsistencies in the writing tense which should have been caught by the editor.   The characters are at times inconsistent. They seem more like girls of the 21st century than the 19th. The girls can't seem to make up there minds whether to be 'blushing maidens' or not. One minute they are blushing at the mere mention of the word "chastity", and the next they are joking about sex over a bottle of whiskey. The general behavior of the characters would have been more realistic if the setting had been the 20th or 21st century rather than the late Victorian era.   A weak point with this book is the magic itself. The sources are never fully explained, and suddenly finding Gemma flying up a staircase was disorienting. The idea was good, but all explanations were vague and confusing.  The entire novel is inconsistent and sensationalized. I felt as if Ms. Bray had created this novel then thrown in some corsets and etiquette to create a sort of modern, Victorian-Gothic, melodrama. The overall effect is weak and unsatisfying.  
 DO NOT BUY THIS MAGAZINE! FOR ANY PRICE, IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE. MARIE CLAIRE HAS HARASSED ME REPEATEDLY TO PAY FOR MY SUBSCRIPTION.  IT WAS PAID FOR IN ADVANCE THRU AMAZON. I HAVE SENT THEM COPIES OF MY AMAZON RECEIPT TWICE.  THEY ARE REPORTING ME TO A CREDIT AGENCY FOR NON-PAYMENT.  AVOID THEM, AVOID THEM.  THEY ARE SCAM ARTISTS AND WILL FALSELY AND WITH MALICE DESTROY YOUR CREDIT RATING.  
 I used this book as an undergrad in a graduate course and our assignments consisted of discovering all of the errors and attempting to correct them.  It is a good reference book for name reactions, but as far as stereochemistry is concerned be VERY CAREFUL! 
  The People of Sparks by Jeanne DuPrau is a horrible book that I would not recommend to people under the age of eleven. This story takes place in the city of Sparks. Lina & Doon have just lead the people of Ember out from underground. After coming to the city the Emberites are mistreated, malnourished, and misunderstood. So Lina goes out into the Empty Lands with a roamer that is looking for treasure. The Empty Lands are full of owls, coyotes, and other odd animals. There are also destroyed homes and buildings. Following this she comes back, and there is a large fight involving everybody. After that the climax is still climbing, and the most important part is ... I can't tell you!  	The above ground city of Sparks is an incredibly small city. The population is only three hundred twenty-seven and then to make matters worse, four hundred odd some people of Ember come to live with them. With food being scarce and people on the brink of war, Lina leaves with a roamer and goes to the Ancient City. This roamer that Lina left with is very rude, odd, and is looking for buried treasure that isn't there. When the roamer leaves, Lina leaves with the roamer's partner and head back to Sparks. When the two meet a new roamer, that is going to Sparks, they travel with him. The Roamer tells Lina the clues to the treasure, and Lina tells him that it is... I can't tell you, you have to read it.  	Truly, I thought the book was horrible, and weird because I don't like Fantasies, but if you like Fantasies you should read it 
 The first novel of Laurell K. Hamilton's Merry Gentry series is not, actually, that terrible a book. It's by far the best in a not particularly great series, actually. What made it almost impossible for me to read is that the basic premise, the set-up, is one of the most grotesquely, ridiculously stupid things I've ever read.   Princess Meredith NicEssus has fled Faerie, in fear of death at the hands of her aunt, Andais, the Queen of Air and Darkness and ruler of the Unseelie Court. High profile fae in this world are major public figures, like rock stars or the royal family of England. The sudden disappearance of one of the Unseelie royals is a very big deal indeed. Every news media in the world reports the story....and it never goes away. We are told solemnly that reports of Princess Meredith being spotted are right up there with Elvis sightings. Meredith's image, the story of her mysterious disappearance, is everywhere. I mean, neolithic pygmies living in deepest Africa know who Meredith is, and what she looks like.   Meanwhile, Princess Meredith has disguised herself as a mortal private eye. Thing is, she hasn't disguised herself very much at all. Her supernaturally pale skin is now humanly pale skin. Her fae red hair is now human red hair. Her facial features remain the same. And with everyone on the planet wondering where is Princess Meredith, for years on end, no one recognizes her. Let me hasten to add, there is no magic involved in this, they honestly simply don't recognize her. And the crowning touch to this masterful disguise, the name chosen for her pseudonym to hide the fact she's actually Princess Meredith is....wait for it....Merry Gentry.   Jesus wept.   And for years, none of her co-workers, no one who knows her, says to themself, "Hey, wait a minute, that women who looks almost exactly like Princess Meredith....Merry Gentry....Princess Meredith....oh my God, Merry Gentry is Princess Meredith!" Nope, she's just incognito, baby.   At which point I almost threw down the book and said, "You have GOT to be kidding me." It's absolutely amazing to me this made it through the editing process. Do Laurell Hamilton's editors do anything other than rubber stamp her writing? Given her past six or eight novels, including this one, I'm tempted to say: no, actually 
 Save your $3.50 DVD rental fee. If you're looking for a movie that will make you feel like City of Angels made you feel, look elsewhere! Sorry, my vote is for Hollywood. The director of Wings admits that there was no script before shooting began. The extras that came with the Wings DVD, interviews and info on Berlin, were more entertaining than the movie. 
 I have not read this book & will not because of the rediculous price!!  Give me a freakn' break!!  If someone can't be creative enough to come up with some way of commiting suicide that will do the job without paying this much for this stupid book, you really do have a problem.  There is more than enough FREE info on the internet to spend this much money on this useless book!! I am NOT saying suicide is the answer to ALL people's problems, please don't get me wrong, but as a person who has dealt with bipolar disorder my entire life, I DO believe that some people ARE better off being put out of their torment.  No one knows until they have been there themselves!!!  Until you have suffered with this illness, don't judge other's, you have NO idea!!!  
 I thought it would be cute but it's just a crazy rich woman who indulges her love of animals by turning her home into a zoo. For some reason, instead of amusing me, it annoyed me. Dressing chimps as people and treating them like spoiled children. And she does the same with the gorilla, Buddy. She first saved Buddy but instead of using common sense, she decides to try to make it as human as possible. Of course, he turns on her later and she finds out that yes, gorillas are wild animals.  People who want to see animals in human terms annoy me sometimes. I remember once reading about a woman who was kicked in the face by a moose up in the mountains. Well, what did she think "Hey, it's Bullwinkle!" and try to pet it?  I think it also upset me because I was thinking she could have adopted children instead of making chimps into kids. But perhaps it was best she didn't. She would have messed them up by indulging their every whim.  BTW, this movie is based on a true story.  
 This is possbily the worst guidebook of any kind I have ever read.  Loaded with meaningless phrases such as "Nighttime activities are not to be missed," and other high-school-yearbook-type observations, it is absloute torture to ferret out any helpful information buried in the inane prose 
 M. Night Shyamalan's Lady In The Water was a bit disturbing.  As I was reading it, I tried to read it from a children's perspective.  I found that the content would have completely freaked me out as a child.  I'm certain that with the simple mind of a child, I would have focused only on those odd things living in my back yard, and not on the only small part of the book that focused on something positive.  That being, that if I become a "vessel", I will do something great in the world.  If I had children of my own, this is not a book I would choose for them to read.  I could hear it now, "Mom, do we have these scary creatures in our back yard?"  The other thing I noticed was the extreme waste of paper.  The author could have fit the entire story on one page.  Some might call it art, but thank goodness I am not an environmentalist, or I would have additional complaints added to those I have stated.  I believe a book written for children should trigger their imagination in a positive manner.  It shouldn't cause fear and anxiety of things that don't exist, giving them thoughts that, they might.  There is truly enough evil and fear in the world for kids today.  All they have to do is see the news, a newspaper or hear the adults around them talk about things going on in the world.  Unfortunately, there is also the World Wide Web that with one click of the mouse will take kids to scary places.  With the world we live in today, I feel that people who write books for children have a responsibility in looking out for them, writing something that will help them grow in a positive manner.  Not write things that will cause fear, doubt, anxiety, frustration and anger to just name a few.  The world will continue to decline in goodness as long as outside influences remain evil 
 Breath-taking! I have worked and traveled in  Russia  and the CIS over  the past ten years and I am reminded of the story of the two scientists who went to the seashore to discover what a beach was. The first scientist observed the waves and tides pounding the rocks and said, "Aha! Big rocks grind together to make smaller and smaller rocks until we get some pretty grains of sand!"   The second scientist went to the beach with a pair of tweezers and a magnifying glass, and spent all day selecting grains of sand according to his preference of shape, size, weight and color. Then he hauled his sand collection to his laboratory and began to categorize and cross-compare each grain of sand with the grains of sand from foreign country's  beaches until he felt he had enough data to write a book about how large Russian rocks preyed on small Russian rocks and how pretty pieces of Russian sand were rare; and that the pretty pieces were always buried in the mud of a Gulag and how all the rest of the sand grains had to hide the audacity to strive to be beautiful - which could somehow provoked the envy of the big rocks into oppressing the sand grains.   In the end, his book was full of clever sophistry and cynical blame for the majority of the Russian sand grains wanting to be beautiful. He concocted his own "Cosmic Law" which stated that Russian sand grains were either content to live in dreary, collective layers because they did not want to be envied by other Russian sand grains who were afraid of the bigger rocks -or that all Russian sand grains should strive to rise to the top where they could hide under new "Laws" which would protect them from learning responsibility and from thinking for themselves; thus keeping all the grains of sand under "soft" control and diverted from trying to be better sand-grain souls.  I hesitate to use a four letter word to describe the author's covertly angry, bitter and abusive criticism of the evolving and talented  Russian people who have, after several hundred years only just begun experiencing the decency of a leader from their very own country. (Even Stalin was Georgian), but so, for the opportunity for the discerning sociologist to experience and study a stunning and ingenious example of "Sophistry",  I shall give this book one star. The thundering silence of any encouraging word and the breathtaking jealousy of the re-emerging, responsible podvig of the Russian people will become self evident to students of ignorance versus spirited elan 
 Unfortunately there are not much words to loose. Poor writing together with the fact that practically all facts were lifted from Cameron's 'Conversation with Wilder' which is highly recommended btw, make this book forgettable. Why going through the whole exercise of publishing it is quite a mystery 
 Reading this book is like reading dry after action reports.  All I got out of it was how much ammo they expended on a daily basis.  The print is huge so it is good for those who are half blind.  It is only about 60 pages so I read it in about 3 hours.  It's like they took a chapter from a book like "Panzer Aces" and made another book out of it.  Don't waste your money 
 I was looking for a real thriller, and thought I would try one by David Baldacci. I had read a very favourable review a while back, and I have also seen and enjoyed the movie version of Absolute Power.  After reading reviews at Amazon, I picked Last Man Standing. However, I was really disappointed. For me it wasn't thrilling at all. Several times I had to force myself to pick it up again to continue reading. For me, a good thriller is a book you can't stop reading, even if it's getting late and you really, really should try to get some sleep instead of continue reading.  Examples of great thrillers I have read are: The Firm by John Grisham, The Day After Tomorrow by Allan Folsom (nothing to do with the weather-related movie of the same name) and Angels and Demons by Dan Brown.  But Last Man Standing was quite the opposite. Sure it had its moments where it got exciting for a while (the final shoot-out for example), but those times were quite rare.  I've been trying to figure out why I didn't like it, but I can't say I know why. I do think that a lot of what happens in the book is quite far-fetched (especially the reason the hero Web London froze during the ambush) and that the characters are pretty one-dimensional, but that's not enough of a reason. Both The Day After Tomorrow and Angels and Demons have plenty of far-fetch twists and one-dimensional characters, but they were still exciting reads. I can't come up with a definite answer as to why I didn't like Last Man Standing - I simply just didn't care for it.  Writing a negative review like this will probably earn me a few unhelpful votes, but I think it is important to also review books you didn't like. Otherwise you risk getting an unbalanced view. However, I do admit that it is much more fun to review books you really liked.  But to finish, if you are looking for a good thriller, skip this one and try one of the other three I mentioned above. 
 When you receive this set, they offer a regular box you can set on the shelf, for an additional $2.98. What arrives four weeks later is a piece of folded paper that makes a slip cover for the already very poor disc holder.   20th Century Fox Entertainment should be boycotted. They make almost three dollars on something which costs them likely 8 cents - all in addition to the original cost of the discs.  I love THE SIMPSONS, but I am returning this piece of folded paper along with an invoice for a four disc jewel case 
 So after scanning my first batch of cards (which it worked great for), the scanner simply stopped working correctly.  It couldn't be recalibrated and won't read any more cards.  I called tech support only to learn that this is a known problem, there is no fix available and that it's likely due to their outsourcing of the manufacturing of this product.  I'm returning the one I got and I'd strongly recommend against getting one until the quality issues are resolved 
 I use about a bottle every summer and don't love this product (who could!):) but it works pretty well.  I found on Amazon Solution2 and gave that product a try.  It's definitely a nicer product.  It doesn't sting nearly as much which is a big deal for me and I LOVE the roller ball application.  
 This "novel" chronicles the "adventures" of men who realize sexual ecstasy through cold-blooded murder and other crimes, who kidnap young children and repeatedly rape them on an extended retreat into the wilderness.  Perhaps that will shock, disgust and/or horrify you. It probably should. But I'm a pretty open-minded sort--it isn't the subject matter which earns this work my low rating. Instead, I rate De Sade's "masterpiece" low because it really isn't very entertaining or relevant.  Look, I've never believed that sexuality is wrong in any way, really. Of course, the scenes described in Sodom *are* wrong; forcing people, and especially children, into any such acts against their wills is heinous. But, in reading, more crucial to me is how repetitive all of the "action" becomes. Fine, the first 100 pages of non-stop "libertinage" has some amount of curiosity about it... but the fact that the book proceeds ponderously, day by day, without anything really new introducing itself is insurmountable.  I was hoping, at least, to be titillated; I don't ask a whole lot out of my pornography (and for all of its pseudo-philosophical trappings, Sodom is nothing more than that). I am certain others will find thrills in some of the scenes described, such as people achieveing "lubricity" by having their genitalia vomited upon, or sucking snot out of others' noses, or eating other's toe-cheese, but I must report that it didn't do a whole lot for me. I suppose I'm rather more "traditional" in that sense. For sexual excitement, I prefer the thought of attractive, consenting adults giving and receiving pleasure.  Yes. Yes, I understand that Sade's work is not really about sexuality and is, instead, about "power." And a fair dose of woman-hating (all of his "heroes" have a prediliction to the feminine aft rather than the fore, and boys above all; their sport consists of denigrating and humiliating their wives). I get that. But so what? These kinds of "power fantasies" aren't daring or enticing, they're insipid and juvenile. Sade's psychological abnormalities, however bizarre/extreme, don't necessarily make for entertaining or enlightening reading.  In the end, I can't really think of an excellent use for this novel. Philosophy can be found better by the tons in any local bookstore or library, in varieties fiction and non. If you want sexual freedom, specifically, check out Stranger in a Strange Land. If you want philosophical defenses of ruthless debauchism and assorted villanies, nothing bests Les Liasons Dangereuses. Better works about psychotics are available--if such fascinates, try In Cold Blood or Helter Skelter. Better pornography is (massively) available in, essentially, every medium available to man. I find the quasi-amateur efforts of Ed Powers to be rather enjoyable. Better explorations of abnormal psychology are certainly out there, for instance the classic Sybil. In every way, in everything it does or could hope to do, The 120 Days of Sodom is mediocre and dull and bettered by a hundred and twenty other works. Reading it does not make one "edgy" or "perverse" or "intellectual" or, really, anything other than bored. 
 Now, I could just be biased-I'd just finished "New Moon" by Stephenie Meyer the day before-but I honestly can't say I was very fond of this book. There wasn't really any character depth and I have serious doubts Raven (the main herione) would act the way she did half the time; it just didn't fit the persona at all. Like I said, I might just be biased, but the authoress didn't even put her own spin on the whole Vampire legend, or make the existing belief interesting. But, I will say it was an interesting enough read to finish. That much I can give it 
 I rather enjoyed Kenry's first book, Can't Buy Me Love, so I looked forward with anticipation to this one. I was sadly disappointed. The machinations of the characters are grotesque, and while the lifestyle depicted is so overdone as to be obviously fictional, I am nevertheless offended by the glorification of robbery, falsehood and self-indulgence that Max attempts to teach Dillon. I realize that this is not intended to be a serious work, nor is it intended to teach a way of life - but it is nevertheless extreme to the point of distaste. Max's attempts to manipulate everyone around him are almost nauseating, up to and including seducing his nephew. Max is self-centered to the point of blindness, and I found myself hard-pressed to maintain an interest in his schemes. Dillon fails to see anything aberrant in the behavior he is being taught. He ultimately recognizes Max's selfishness - but indulges him anyway. At the end, I found the whole mess singularly unpleasant and thoroughly unamusing 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...  But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of "The Partner" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks 
 In terms of being of value to the reader, I think the Iraq Report fails for multiple reasons.  To start with, there is the panel's decision to only look forward.  I felt the main value of the 9/11 report was the fact that it documented events leading to the attack on 9/11, and provided me with quite a bit of context which I would otherwise be unaware of.  I presume the panel's decision to not look backwards was based partly in Baker's desires to fulfill his duty to the public as well as maintain his loyalty to the Bush family.  If this is the case, I think he provided a disservice to both.  With this decision, the report focuses solving the problem going forward.  I think this renders the report irrelevant as: 1.  Few of the recommendations are being actively pursued, which makes their inclusion in the report a moot point. 2.  It may be based in my partial naivety of world politics, but it seems that many of the recommendations are not realistic.  For example, the report stresses the necessity of participation from Iran and Syria in order to secure success - yet my understanding of the situation leads me to expect that Iran has no desire to help.  In fact, the report itself expresses the fact that Iran has some interest in keeping our hands tied in Iraq.  Either way, with the exception of a brief discussion of the current state of affairs, the report does little to inform.  It does do a bit to explain how bleak the current situation is, but that is hardly a revelation.  The recommendations themselves don't appear helpful.  And as time goes on, they are quickly becoming irrelevant.  The only positive that seems to have come from this report is that it has sparked some discussion.  The report itself falls short 
 The first part of this 1997 edition covers material that is an "old hat". The rest of the topics are unnecessary, badly explained, too superficial, or unfocused. Don't waste your money, and your time 
 After being involved with Weigh Down and leading a group myself, I lost some weight, but suffered worse medical conditions from it. If your body is not used to trans fats from being on low fat diets like mine was, you may shock your system. I ended up in the hospital for five days and had my gallbladder removed. Sugar addiction is not easily overcome and if you listen to your body's cravings, it will tell you to indulge in sugar. Obviously this can lead to diabetes. Regardless of what your faith is, Gwen is giving dangerously wrong information about the body's physiology. We know too much now to ignore facts about our health and to eat like she suggests. She takes no responsibility for anyone being hurt from it either. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!! 
 Despite attempts to keep an open mind, I grew increasingly annoyed at the omissions, exaggerations and half-truths passed off as researched facts in this book. The author calls Cuba - a country under a dictator which holds  no elections - a "democracy" and extols the virtues of the  revolution without ever presenting the views and the injustices perpetrated  against those who opposed the revolution.  It is a shame that a work which  could have been an objective scholarly book instead is little better than a  propaganda pamphlet 
 What made me buy the book was the cover for the sarong. I thought WOW, I already had ideas. Then when I received the book, went through the pics, [which they give closeups on the stitches] I was thinking, [Ive been had] The poncho they have only 1 though I dont like the pattern it gave me ideas and the yarn Richesse et Soie impossible to get,which I want for the high content of cashmere, from K1C2, and the silk ribbon form Artemis, you can't even find I dont think they do any more. I was truly disapppointed and have entertained the idea of sending the book back. There is more accessories [wristband, small pouch bag, alot of edging] than there are clothing. I was hoping for sweaters, better designs on hats/scarves. Save your money! : 
 I've been selling cars online for 4 years now.  This book was very basic.  If you are new to selling cars online buy this book.  If you have done it for a while not worth the money 
 I will continue to read the series, but I must say it could have been enhanced had there been some glossary of the nautical terms used so profusely.  I would have expected nothing less mind you, but unlike having a good dictionary for other words, there were many terms to be found nowhere.  It can make for some rugged reading.     Still, the book is worth the effort.  I am just not sure the full enjoyment is available to those who are not intimately familiar with sailing and with sailing a vessel during the Napoleonic era.    And who am I to judge a book?   Because I spent money to buy it 
 I looked forward to the first episode of "Deadwood," hoping HBO would reinvent the Western they way they had reinvented the mob movies with "The Sopranos."  About ten or fifteen minutes in, I finally told myself that if one more person used a particular profanity--it starts with a C and ends with sucker--I was going to turn it off.  I didn't get that thought out before I heard it again.  So I shut it off.  I hear enough profanity in my daily life and I get plenty from movies and TV. Too much, way too much 
 This novel was quite possibly one of the worst I have ever read.  Poorly written, and grammaticly hard to swallow, Davis' arguements are hard to see through all the philosophical "crap" he presents.  Davis paints of a picture of government conspiracy, and proposes a solution of anarchy and social equality (which he then goes on to contradict, because apparently there can be no equality).  Disability is a serious issue,and should be treated as such.  Davis makes a mockery of these people and their struggle, and should be tarred and feathered.  Davis, here is my message to you: Please do not write anymore...you are not a scholar, an expert, or a professional for that matter.  Move on and stop feeding America your radical ideas 
 THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT LEAST A 2-HOUR DOUBLE DISC DVD WITH ALOT MORE INSIGHT AND DEPTH AND ALOT MORE MATCHES LIKE WHEN: LUGER BEAT HOGAN ON NITRO FOR THE TITLE IN 1997,MICK FOLEY'S TITLE WIN ALONG WITH THE CONTRAVERSIAL "POKE OF DOOM" MATCH WITH HOGAN AND NASH;BOTH I MIGHT ADD WERE AIRED ON THE SAME NIGHT.THERE IS ALOT OF STUFF AND FACTIODS MISSING ON THIS ONE FOLKS 
 I picked up this book in the hopes that I would find something original, something challenging, something other than the evangelical dribble that passes for "Christian Living" books these days.  Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed.    What I Liked: 1.	There really were some challenging ideas in this book.  So often, "biblical womanhood" is portrayed as being all about homemaking, mothering, and hospitality.  It's all about being "against feminism."  While I don't see anything wrong with a balanced view of a woman's role, I do think that it's easy to take these ideas to the extreme.  Stasi Eldredge's book definitely does not fit the mold, at least not in the circles I tend to frequent.  Mrs. Eldredge's ideas are concerned more with the heart.  To her, "godly womanhood" means getting back to our roots as women, to embrace our femininity and use it for God's glory.  Unfortunately, Mrs. Eldredge's ideas about femininity are wrought with their own problems. (See below).  Additionally, Mrs. Eldredge's idea that womanhood and femininity doesn't always look the same between women is very refreshing and something of which I need to be reminded every day.  2.	The authors are clear about the God-ordained distinction between the sexes.  In other words, men and women are not the same.  3.	The chapters, while lengthy, were quick and easy to read.  Yes, that is a plus when you're running after two children under the age of three.  4.	This book was easy to read in pieces.  What I Did NOT Like: 1.	The Eldredges have a very low view of women.  In their minds, all women are broken, messed up creatures who have spent their lives hurting and looking for someone to build them up and fill in all the holes they experienced growing up.  There is no room for strength, confidence, industry, dignity or any other "Proverbs 31" quality in their economy.  In fact, they mock and ridicule the "Proverbs 31" woman as though hers is an unattainable, impractical, useless standard to which we should strive.  For them, it all boils to whether or not a woman feels she is beautiful (and while they spend an entire chapter developing this idea, I never understood what they meant- beauty on the outside?  Inner beauty? What beauty are they talking about?  Oh, the beauty that is completely corrupted by sin, but made alive and beautiful again by the saving work of Christ?  That beauty?), and whether or not she is being properly "romanced."  In fact, I'm actually nervous about writing a bad review of this book in fear that Stasi will read it and spiral into a depression again.  What if I hit a nerve, dig a deeper wound, remind her of her difficult childhood?  Why not generalize this fear to all women because according to the authors, women are weak, wounded, and helpless.  2.	Theologically, this book is a mess.  For example: "Eve was given to the world as the incarnation of a beautiful, captivating God" (pg. 44).  Hello!  That is heresy!  Jesus Christ, ALONE, is the incarnation of God.  I think they must have no clue as to what they are actually saying in that statement.  It would be more appropriate to say that Eve was made in the image of a beautiful, captivating God.  Image and incarnation are not the same thing.  They make this error several times throughout the book.  They suggest that Eve was the "Crown of Creation."  In reality, mankind (women AND men) is the apex, the pinnacle, the crown of creation.  They often refer to Jesus as the "bridegroom" of the Christian woman and that the woman is His bride.  Actually, the Church is the Bride of Christ, and that includes men as well as women.  They refer to Jesus in these sappy, overemotional, and overtly sexual terms when they talk about Him as a "Lover."  Well, were I a man, I would either laugh at this or be very turned off.  Jesus isn't my boyfriend.  He's my God.  He's my Savior.  He's my Lord.  He is the Bridegroom of the Church Universal, but not of individuals.  I could go on, but its late and I'm tired...  3.	Frequent and blatant misuse of Scripture.  They take so much of the Bible out of context that its hard to know where to start in pointing it out.  Their use of the Song of Solomon is a frequent offense in this regard.  The book was written as a description of marital love between husband and wife, not between Christ and the Church and certainly NOT between Christ and a woman.  Hosea is another example.  This book was written as prophecy regarding the eventual return of Israel from exile, not as a description of the return of a woman to her "first love".  They often mock the correct interpretation of several passages in Scripture, tossing them aside for their own feminized, overly-sentimental view as well.  4.	They have a very low view of Christ.  Essentially, they suggest that He cannot act in our lives unless we let him, unless we "open the door of our hearts" where he stands knocking (yet ANOTHER reference they take completely out of context).  Theirs is a neutered, powerless Christ.  There is nothing said in this book about the beauty He gives us because He is IN US, living HIS LIFE through us.  The reason I need to look to Christ to find this beauty for which I am allegedly seeking affirmation is because the beauty I possess comes from Him.  5.	There is an overemphasis on the effect that Satan/demons/spirits can have on the lives of Christians.  I believe this issue stems from their use of the Neil T. Anderson's book The Bondage Breaker, a book that has been widely rebutted due to its unbiblical views of Satan and his relationship to believers.  They attribute common marital and even medical problems to meddlesome spirits when there were completely natural explanations for what they were experiencing.  I'm afraid that people will fail to get to the root of their problems and just "blame Satan" instead of really working through very complex issues (or seeing a doctor for medical issues!).  6.	Enough with the movie metaphors already!  I don't want to hear about how I'm like "Cora" in "Last of the Mohicans" or "Rose" in "Titanic."  Tell me about Rachel, Rebekah, Mary, Deborah, Ruth, Phoebe, Dorcas, Mary Magdelene, the nameless women throughout the Bible who acted in faith when God called them out of their normal lives into greatness.  Tell me about those women FIRST and leave the movie metaphors out of it!  Instead of looking to God to learn about us, they point us to our culture and ourselves in order to learn about God.  That's completely backwards!   This book is nothing more than really bad pop psychology trying to be passed off as "biblical" truth.  It is sappy, overly sentimental, erroneous, and, in most parts unbiblical.  I had a hard time following any of the points put forward by the authors.  The meat in this book would've made for an interesting article in "Christianity Today" or "Focus on the Family" magazine.  They didn't need a whole book to detail this dribble.  Please don't bother with it.  There are much better books out there about biblical womanhood than this one. 
 You don't need to trust me--you can look inside the book and get a load of the first translation of the "Frog King" which is unreadable.  Someone just took an old translation and reprinted it on poor quality paper.  This does not do justice to the tales 
 I guess some people out there actually liked this, but not here. "From Out Of Nowhere" is somewhat decent, but after that the rest of this blows dead bears. I especially hate "Epic" which if not for this the group would never had made it. I guess because of the diversity to the song that made it popular, but it made me want to gag, and then vomit as the song doesn't make sense to me for starters, and in the key of E, and just droning on and on for over 5 minutes that it's worse than the gas chamber. After that it just got worse. 17 years has come and gone, and it still stinks. 
 Oh dear. This is another book like the horrible "Who Moved My Cheese?" that attempts to manipulate grown adults by treating them like children.  Like the aforementioned "Who thinks my cheese stinks?" (or whatever it is called), I saw some people in the organisation where I work trying to sneakily weave it into the corporate culture and it lasted about five days.  It's all about making work "FUN". Yep, work can be "FUN". Tell that to the folks who work in hospital waste disposal. Or maybe those who deal with animal cruelty cases.  Of course, it's just great "FUN" to deal with children who have just had their parents killed, or folks who just lost their kids.  Because that's what work is - "FUN" - or so this book would have you believe you can convince your workers.  Of course in the examples I have listed above, it doesn't really work too well, because this is really about getting people in perceived lower-end occupations like factories or call-centres to believe their mind-numbing daily tasks can be "FUN".  Myself, I do have some "FUN" at work, but probably like many people with more than one brain cell, it is based on having a laugh with my co-workers about the sheer absurdity of where our work life often takes us.  You can call this cynicism, which is probably how it would be viewed by people who buy into this dumb "Fish"-style "WORK MUST BE FUN" philosophy. I'd call it black humour, but it keeps people sane and makes difficult work more bearable.  As to the title of my review - this method of making the workplace "FUN" in a forced way is very useful if you have employees that you wish to isolate and marginalise.  First immerse people in the cult-like atmosphere and tell them that they are now to regard work as "FUN".  Second, let them know that they now "CHOOSE" their attitude - if they are unhappy in any way (regardless of them doing their work well or not), they are "LETTING THE TEAM DOWN" and not complying with the obligation to "MAKE WORK FUN".  Third, while the majority of victims or workers, however you choose to view your prey, swallow the "WORK IS FUN" message and display the behaviour of sea lions clapping to get a mouthful of FISH, you can point to those who have shown a small streak of individual identity and are not HAVING FUN AT WORK and use the Enron-style message that they "just don't get it".  In this way, the resistant individual can be said to be "incompatible with our mission and values", "bad for morale" or just "out of step".  In this way, the "FUN-LOVING" workers, who have now taken on the costume of "FORCED FALSE FUN" can be set against them.  Of course this will compound their unhappiness and isolate them further until they are totally marginalised and can be tossed on the scrapheap or forced to resign.  This book is useful then, if you wish to convince idiots that their "WORK IS FUN".  Just don't try it on a group of people with a brain between them who might take their work seriously.  They might tell you to stick your "FISH" where the sun doesn't shine 
 Once again Catherine Coulter has written a very stupid book!  I could not believe she could actually call this a love story. If I want to read porn books, I would go to the adult shop. I hate the explicit sex scenes in her  books. I am looking for love, not lust. And then to have an uncle who would  treat a neice this way, like a sex object, come on Catherine. I hate her  books and have read quite a few, almost all hoping for a good one. Well  there have been maybe 2 out of the 100 or so she's written. Jade Star was  my favorite. She is drawn out and boring in most of her books,and she  always overuses words.Can't she come up with any new ones? Don't bother  with this one girls, yuk 
 To start with, I have seen pretty much all of the Wolf's Rain anime, (I may have missed a few episodes) and it wasen't all that great, anyway (THE ENDING, for great's sake!). The only thing outstanding in the anime was the music, logically nonexistent in the manga. Still, I bought the manga in hopes that it would differ from the anime in some respect, perhaps end better? Although the end is yet to come, I already dislike the manga mostly for the artwork, more precisely the wolves, whose legs resemble those of a girrafe's! And Kiba is supposed to be fluffy, but his fur looks much too stringy in the manga. Also, instead of selectively leaving out a few parts, they seem to have selectively chose a few parts to actually draw! It seems almost like a summary, they have so few scenes. What really ticks me is that my favorite part of the ENTIRE series, (which I didn't even like) the scene where Quent shoots UNDER Blue, smacking the crap out of Kiba, is left out. The entire charm of showing how in tune Blue and Quent are is left out. I just can't wait to see the second book, which I bet won't even show an ending. So much for this series- the only thing worth money are the two CD's.   P.S.- one last thing that just struck me as odd and out of place, the text on the front of the book, "Wolf's Rain" is.... Pink. Not just a little. Bright..... PINK. Almost ANY other color would do for this depressing anime. Oh, and another thing, something GOOD- the bonus thing at the end of the book- I liked that. Very Nice 
 Depending on how I shifted my weight--even just slightly--the scale read different amounts.   This is normal when the difference is small.  But the difference was up to 20 pounds!  There was no way to know how much I really weighed! I called Amazon right away to send it back... 
 The writing is pedestrian and the plot makes no sense.  I thought something might change, that it might become an interesting ghost story, or there might be moral issues, or maybe even a character would grow or change.  The heavy-handed ending is, perhaps, intended to demonstrate how the intense oppression and suppression of women in Amish culture forces them to violence against their loved ones...but that's a pretty heavy message for a book that seems full of meaninglessness.  Are we supposed to take everything that Ellie says about the Amish in court (peaceful, gentle, incapable of murder, loving, child-centric, willing to accept an out-of-wedlock child into the community) as lies?  The ending belongs to a much darker book.  My biggest complaint though is the bad writing and editing, I kept stumbling over inconsistencies and that always inhibits my enjoyment of a story.  
 First:  the majority of the content is not compatible with the current TIVO system, series 2 *** I got SKUNKED! Second: This book is really for someone with very strong technical skills, particularly a Unix background.  I am fairly technical with a Computer Science degree and would not attempt to do anything with this book and passed it to another fairly tech savvy friend and he gave it right back to me.  There is a page or two that has cute shortcuts for the remote but you can get that info off a TIVO user group site.  I regard this purchase as a total ripoff.  I'll be happy to send you this book to you for $5 + shipping.  email: funbeach6@yahoo.co 
 If you don't read Spanish then consider this book just a picture book. It would be nice if somewhere it had been mentioned that this book is NOT IN ENGLISH. The pictures are OK 
 I found myself after reading the book. Sincerely hoping the movie will have a different spin. This is an unsatisfying sequel to the novel Get Shorty. I love Elmore Lenord novels but this is a dud 
 I admit I am a brainwashed Bose fan and love their products.  i got a $25 gift certificate for best buy and I bought these for around $80 out of pocket.  These things suck. yes, the sound is decent, but comparable to less expensive sony earbuds that are half the price.  the cord is cheap plastic that stays in permanent shape as it came from the factory. it looks and feels sad.  the sound isolation and fitment of the silicone ear pieces stinks.  do not attempt to jog or exercise in these things.  all you'll hear is the wind rushing in and the earbuds themselves trying to extract themselves from your ear and onto the floor.  I returned these headphones in 3 days. 
 This is an extremely interesting biological and viticultural story. Unfortunately the history is poorly and haphazardly organized. Although Campbell strives to make the characters (scientists, viticulturists, and bureaucrats)three dimensional - his insistence on chronologically following the activities of multiple individuals comes at a high cost of understanding. The story would have been better told - I feel - by focusing on fewer players or including a more organized interspersion of biological context 
 The only discipline lacking in this story, is the author's 
 I bought one of these and was quite disappointed.  I have two small kids who get fingerprints on all of there DVDs.  I sprayed one, dropped it in the machine, watched it spin around and then...  When I pulled the disc out, there were still fingerprints all over it.  Using my shirt, I gently wiped on one and it came right off.  How can the cleaning pad NOT work, but my shirt work just fine?  I took it back to the store 
 i am a huge De Lint fan, but i cannot drag myself through Moonheart.  this is an early attempt by him to solidify his ideas about celtic and native american mythology and their presence in a modern setting, and for that perhaps it was groundbreaking at the time, but after his later books, this is painful to read.  the characters are largely flat, though the setting of tamson house is a good and intriguing one. the super secret paranormal branch of the canadian mounties (!) is never made believable or interesting and i kept losing track of the cops' names, which didn't matter as they kept dying anyway.  anytime he creates a character of a specific ethnicity, the cartoonish stereotyping and deeply labored ethnic dialogue are painful to behold (i.e., the "rasta" man who begins every sentence with "I and I"); the character of keiran with his constant declarations of "NOM DE TOUT!" and "LORD JUMPIN' JESUS!" is annoying beyond endurance -- and furthermore, what is he supposed to be, french canadian or southern gothic with those odd declarations?  the scenes with the native american "manitou" read like bad B westerns written by Carlos Castaneda.  do read De Lint, but don't start here.  his later books based in fictional Newford are his best, especially the books that are collected short stories -- they're wonderful.  if you want to read one of his early Ottawa-based books, read Jack of Kinrowan which combines two shorter novels into one and which is far, far better done.  i'd hate to have someone pick up Moonheart and think that's all there is to De Lint 
 I bought this item like 2 months ago, and now it's broken. I'm sooo frustrated.   I 'd not recommend buying this item 
 Three years ago this month I wrote a rather scathing review of Rhino Records' 3-disc THE ULTIMATE YES. [Note: I later bought it, but paid less than $10 for a factory-sealed copy.] But my original complaint was that the same Yes songs had been recycled ad nauseam for more than a decade. Now, to add insult to injury, Rhino drops the original bonus disc from THE ULTIMATE YES, provides a new cover and retitles it DEFINITIVE ROCK. What the $%#@? I always thought Rhino had more integrity than that. My advice? Buy 2002's 5-CD box set IN A WORD; for now that release stands as the "definitive" career retrospective 
 The idea was good but Natasha simply didn't have the talent to put it in written and understandable text. She switches all the time the "I", got me confused about who she was talking about, her or her aunt.She mixed both stories, suddenly she wants to explains her "great destiny" (narcissism) at the same time as she tells the strory about her great aunt. Those second, third, fourth, xth brother's wife, sister, uncles, all irritating narrative. I really tried to like the story, to pick and read and just gave me headaches trying to figure it out whose story she is talking. Go back to school. I don't know how the editor accepts this kind of book to be published, need a lot of editing. Maybe someone in the publishing house is her relative. 
 I agree with a previous review that you get what you pay for.  But in the future I would highly recommend paying more once instead of having to replace this food in a few months or so.  We received this as a gift and from the outside it looked like an great choice!  I was very happy.  But we have had this package of food for about one week and I am already taping boxes with packaging tape to keep them together.  Little hands can pull apart the milk, juice and snack boxes in no time.  The cans of food are so small that they topple over easily in the play kitchen.  The pies, pizza, and such food are all actually hollow underneath.  There is no base to them.  They tell you 101 pieces but in our kit it counted 8 hotdogs (without buns), 12 individual french fries and the same on potato chips.  Not necessary especially since you also get two french fry packets in a french fry container and you get a hot dog in a bun separately.  Why would my child want four jalepenos too.  So much of this food is not they type of thing a small child would be familiar with.  Anyway, in my opinion spend the money on a smaller quantity of higher quality food or go online and find the "vintage" Fisher Price or Little Tikes food.  Now those are made to last and of good size for small hands.  
 Ah, another book from good old Sylvia Browne, the woman who, a few weeks ago on a TV show in effect told a woman who described waking up unable to breathe and feeling panic and sickness, "Aw, forget it, honey, that was just you trying to astral project." Gee, Sylvia, maybe a recommendation that anyone waking up breathless and ill might want to see  a doctor? Ya think?  Anyway, just wanted to get that off my chest.  Nothing new here in this book, although she acts like it's revolutionary material. Sutphen, Fiore and others were writing about cellular memory and the supposed past life roots of present-day ills more than thirty years ago, and Ruth Montgomery was telling of it in the 1960's.   Once again, Browne left me unimpressed and whatsmore:  (Page 101) Browne describes a woman burned for witchcraft at "Salem."   Fact: NO ONE WAS BURNED FOR WITCHCRAFT AT SALEM.  (Page 96) Woman shot in "early 1500's India" when her assailant withdrew a "gun" from under her skirt, and killed her.   Fact: Although firearms were not unknown on the Indian subcontinent in the period described, they were rare in the extreme, new technology unlikely to be in the hands of any but a handful of military personnel, and were far too large to easily be concealed under a skirt. Furthermore, it's unlikely a woman, or even many men, would have been capable of firing the guns of the period, as the violent explosions and recoil were difficult to restrain and frequently presented great danger to the shooter.  (Page 113) A man describes living on a "horse ranch" in South Carolina.   Fact: A "ranch" in South Carolina? I don't think "ranch" would have been a word a real person from that time and place would have employed to describe his property.  (Page 176) In a reported past life, a patient tells of being a doctor named "Morgan" who lived in New England in 1923 who was arrested for the violent murder of his wife.  Fact: One would suspect such a sensational crime would be front page news and yet from what I have been able to tell, no such event as a physician named Morgan being accused of spousal murder is recorded as having taken place in New England during the 1920's.  And this book hit number one on the best seller lists? How long is Sylvia Browne going to be able to pull this off, folks?  In closing, let me let you in on a little secret about "psychics." They are actually worse off than you when it comes to  wondering what happens to us when we die. You and I can openly admit we don't know, but they have to pretend they have all the answers even though they don't. Their lot is to spend their lifetimes longing for the same answers as you and I: they just don't get to ask the questions 
 Basic Instinct was a pretty good movie.  Basic Instinct 2, not so good.  But Sharon Stone is still HOT!  It is worth buying the movie just to see her 
 Architects of the Culture of Death purports to unveil the intellectual heritage at the root of the "culture of death" that the authors contend underlies modern society.  This they accomplish through biographical sketches of 23 individuals whose lives spanned the last two hundred years of human history.  Although the sketches are interesting, if one likes biography, the book is deeply flawed book.  The authors presuppose that the things they attribute to the "culture of death" somehow vanished from human existence as a result of Christianity's birth only to return in the last two hundred years or so.  They refer to the Didache, a code of laws drawn up, it is believed, by the twelve Apostles, which admonished Christians from participating in such apparently common activities as abortion, adultery, infanticide, child molestation, homosexuality, fornication, stealing, and coveting.  They then contend that these practices, with the addition of incest and beastiality, have returned in what today is referred to by some as the culture of death.  This must be the case for their argument to work.  Humankind must be in a decidedly more evil state today or there would be nothing to decry.  But where is the evidence that human beings ever gave up these practices in the first place?  Of course, some did, just as some certainly never engaged in such activities.  And certainly Christians were not immune from falling prey to human error, to sinning, so even they cannot be said to have given these practices up.  Is one to believe that there were no homosexuals in, say, 5th century France?  Are we to believe that adultery did not occur in 10th century Italy?  Has not abortion been a consistent practice throughout all of human history?  Wasn't beastiality on most law books throughout the middle ages?  I dare say it is very difficult to believe people did not fornicate throughout what might be called the Christian era.  Of course, here reference is made only to the Christian world.  When one takes a broader view of human history one finds that these practices were quite acceptable to other human cultures long after the Didache was written.  So if these practices did not vanish where is the evidence that a culture of death is new to us today?  It may be that they have come more into view than ever before, that they have come out of the closet, as it were, but they are hardly new.  Perhaps it is this that disturbs those proclaimers of the culture of death so much.  Abortion was fine when it wasn't legal because then no one had to see it, performed as most abortions were in back alley, makeshift hospital rooms or through self-mutilation.  Child molestation was fine-people just didn't talk about it.  How many "Uncle Ernies" or "Cousin Kevins," not to mention "Father O'Malleys," got away with molestation in the not too distant past?  Imagine what it must have been like in the 15th century, when children were considered little more than little adults.  Adultery was fine when only men got to engage in it; once women began to express boredom with convention suddenly the society had become over sexualized.  Homosexuality was something that happened, often even among straight men, but not in the open.  The point here is that human beings have not really changed over the millennia.  If a "culture of death" exists it has always done so.    This leads to a problem, if this is so, how important really are the architects they identify in forging this so-called culture of death?  To be sure, some among those listed had some very disturbing, one might even say dangerous, ideas but can they be said to be the cause of a huge cultural shift away from virtue and toward evil?  Put another way, are they not more the reflection of their existing societies/cultures than catalyst for them?  Ideas can carry power, to be sure, but there are other forces at work.  It is a weak reed to point to certain individuals and say, "aha!, there are the culprits."  It also is a means of deflecting attention away from others who may be to blame (such as ourselves) but who the authors don't want to consider, for reasons only they know.  On this last point, it is troublesome what the authors leave out.  For instance, one searches their book in vain for any references to the death penalty or to war, practices both condemned by various popes throughout the twentieth century.  Certainly if a culture of death exists it must include the death penalty in the United States, one of only a few nations in the world that still practices the death penalty.  The glee with which most proponents of the death penalty in the U.S. cheer it on is certainly at one with a culture of death, is it not?  War has killed more people in the last 150 years than any other single human practice.  Why didn't Napoleon or Bismark or Clauswitz make the authors' list?  Several US presidents, too, could have made this list.  While the US has fought several justified wars over the last century and a half (WWI, WWII, Korea, Afghanistan), it has fought many others that were not (the Philippines, Vietnam, Nicaragua, Iraq).  These wars all resulted in the deaths of millions.  If war does not qualify as a culture of death, what does?  Conspicuously absent too are any capitalists, industrialists, or corporate heads.  In this the authors have, unwittingly or not, equated capitalism with good and socialism and communism with evil.  But that is a false premise meant to deflect attention rather than promote knowledge.  Conservatives today like to point to the millions who died under Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, and Castro (sometimes they include Lenin and Che as well) as a way of condemning communism and celebrating capitalism.  But capitalism can hardly be said to be outside of the culture of death.  Millions died in WWI.  Although there were multiple causes, it was a capitalist war.  The US conquest of the Philippines was undertaken to ensure economic access to China for American capitalism. An estimated 200,000 Filipinos died in the process.  It certainly was not socialism or communism that caused WWII, despite the word socialist in the name of the Nazi Party.  Was the I.G. Farben Company in Germany, maker of Zyclon-B, the gas used to exterminate Jews during the Holocaust, socialist, communist, or capitalist?  US, British, and French support for Right-wing dictators throughout the world largely centered on their friendliness towards capitalism and their hatred of the Left.  How many thousands, if not millions, of people died as a result of brutal, Right-wing regimes propped up by the West throughout the twentieth century?   Nicaragua, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Iran, Iraq, Cuba, Panama, Greece, Indonesia, Vietnam, South Korea, South Africa, Algiers, El Salvador, Honduras, the Philippines-all these states have played a major role in the global spread of capitalism, generally as third world suppliers of cash crops and cheap labor.  All have been subject to the rule of heavy-handed brutes who terrorized their peoples.  Certainly, capitalism too is part of the culture of death, that is, if one accepts that one exists.  This reviewer is not convinced.  Human beings are capable of both great good and great evil.  Killing has been a constant in the human experience.  We are no different today in this respect than were our ancestors.  One might even argue that we have become more humane, not less (although the twentieth century wars would appear to belie this assertion).  Certainly we at least give lipservice to the idea of "human rights" whereas such words did not exist in the vocabularly of even are close ancestors.  Although opponents of abortion will never be convinced legalized abortion is a safer way than the alternative.  While some might be uncomfortable with homosexuality, freedom and democracy has its uncomfortable side effects. And while child molestation will continue, there is far greater awareness of it today than ever before in human history and the desire to prosecute the perpetrators.  These are just some of the positive aspects of the human condition today.  Read only with caution 
 I really like the raised edges of these boards when working with wet ingredients, like cutting tomatoes. However, the thin material of the boards warps/cups, making the board rock on its center on the counter. This combined with the slippery nature of the material itself makes for a very frustrating if not dangerous situation while chopping. The only solution I have found is to put a folded damp kitchen towel under the board to stabilize it. Frankly, that's more trouble than it's worth. For now, I am just using them for holding ingredients after I have prepped them on a better cutting board 
 If this book is one of your options for a history class and you have other options, choose again please!. it is for your sake i say this. this book has the hardest thesis to pic out of any history book i have read. i find myself wondering "john lewis gaddis" how in the world did he end up involved with a history book at oxford press. he cant seem to stay on his subject of "the cold war" i give this book 2 stars because its sentance structures are not as horible as many history books. john lewis gaddis has potencial as an author as long as he stays away from history books. if you are not intending to read this book for you education, but rather for the plesure, i advise you to look some where else.. 
 Episode two of the hunt for the bumbling master spy(Peacemaker) is an improvement over the unfortunate initial episode, No Graves as Yet. There are some good scenes: the beaches at Gallipoli, the amusing downfall of Judy's competitor for the General's wheel, the encounter with the German sub, etc.  But we still have the preposterous underlying theme that George V would trade continental Europe for German help in retaking the United States for the British Empire. That task made more difficult as Miss Perry has Mexican armies pouring over the Southwestern border to conquer the U.S. Even Zimmerman didn't expect that much.  Then there is Private Corliss who dominates the opening chapters by suffering a crushed hand, a suspected Self Inflicted Wound(SIW), for which he is court martialed and sentenced to death.  In WWI, the test for an SIW was whether the injury was caused by British ammunition, not the case here. There were 3,894 recorded SIWs in the British Army during the war; the penalty was a prison sentence. No one was subject to the death penalty for an SIW. We have Chaplain Joseph who spends half the book playing police detective; a general in command of substantial forces at Ypres who spends most of his time with his attractive driver and seems to have no contact with his regimental commanders or the battles; a reporter for a small newspaper chain whose accurate depiction from Gallipoli would cause millions of Britons to abandon the war, even though the millions had already heard the truth from their sons, daughters, and husbands; etc. On the bright side, there is a new Pitt mystery, Long Spoon Lane, where Miss Perry makes us feel right at home in both the drawing rooms and the slums of Victorian London.  IMO her reach toward World War I is a war too far. 
 This game is a joke!  It is immpossible for a child to get past level 3.  It took my husband about 20 tries to get past it, and he is a pro at video games.  (he beat mech 2 for x-box and halo2 the third time he played them.)  Don't buy this game for your kids until you rent it and let them try it out.  It is was a waste of money my kids won't even play it.  It should be rated N for Nobody 
 Dull, antiseptic, lacking any interesting perspective. At best, you could say this book is like a series of colorless newspaper articles strung together, at worst, a book written by someone so far removed from his subject that he might as well of been writing about extraterrestials.   I wonder if Raab has ever actually met or talked to a mafiosi face to face. This book seems to get all its information from law enforcement souces, prosecutorial types, or other books. Nowhere is there any kind of sociological context that might raise the subject matter above the level of journalism -- and flat, lifeless journailism at that.  For someone so accomplished and genearlly recongnized as an "expert" in his field, this book is a big snooze 
 Unlike most reviewers here, I really disliked this book.  The main reason is that the entire novel is a gimmick without any real substance.  There is no reason to tell such a dull story except for the fact that there is some mysterious story-within-a-story complexity.  The characters, especially the protagonist Iris, are bores.  Iris is like a 300 page wet blanket.  Most of the other characters are 1-dimensional cut outs.  Her sister Laura is the exception, but she got on my nerves too with her one-note quirkiness.  The story-within-a-story is more a gimmick than anything else.  The science-fiction meta-story within that story I thought was the most interesting part of the book, but it goes nowhere and its purpose is even more tenuous than its parent.  Finally, this is my second Atwood book, and I really dislike her writing style.  It reads as if she is trying too hard, and even the simplest situations feel forced.  I don't understand why everyone seems to like this book, but I would just suggest not to believe all the hype. 
 This product wasn't delivered to me for at least 2 1/2 weeks. After one review, the customer service rep from Allergy Be Gone emailed me bribing me to take my review off. He mentioned that Amazon would be reviewing his company, and he didn't want Amazon to see the negative comment. He promised me free filters and offered me a $20 gift certificate if I removed the comment. His name is Jason P, and he goes by judahp for his email account. What a jerk. I will never buy from Allergy Be Gone again 
 'Gloria' is an beautiful sweeping emotional love anthem. May be in my U2 top ten, which is saying a lot.   The rest of this album holds no appeal to me at all. Where most of U2's music has a timeless quality that makes it hard to date, this is very a much an awkward early-Eighties album. 
 It worked file with Win 2k, but as soon as I switched to Windows Xp, this device was rendered utterly useless to me - it won't shut down or eject, and windows explorer won't see it.  Grrrrrrrr .....   
 Have you taken meat & eggs out of your diet? Are you still trying to limit saturated fat to less than 10% of your total calories? Are you popping statins to keep that cholesterol level below the maximum de jure? How about some pills for that hypertension? Do you need more little brown bottles sitting on the bathroom vanity? Don't be fooled by the title of this book. Scott Deron takes the politically correct route through the "cholesterol & saturated fat" minefield, choosing dogma over science at every turn. Where's the new information about CRP in this book? Eighty percent of this book is a rehash of the same bromides we've been swallowing for 30 years. Cardiovascular disease, meanwhile, has continued to climb unabated. If you're looking for the root cause of cardiovascular disease, you won't find it in this book. If you're looking for interventions that split with the already-disproved AMA/AHA doctrine, you won't find that here either. Do yourself a favor. Use your  money to buy Colpo's "The Great Cholesterol Con", McCully's "The Heart Revolution" or Francis' "Never Be Sick Again". Your heart will love you for it 
 This book is horribly difficult to read, it is very terse. I found that I could easily follow the things I knew already, but it is not a good book to learn new things from. It is a collection of research results, in a sensible order, but little effort has been made to explain things to the novice. In fact there are research papers which introduce more advanced topics than covered here, and are much easier to read than this book (for example Alur's paper on ATL). It is probably good as a comprehensive reference if you are already familiar with the techniques. It is a shame as there seems to be no other comprehensive book available on model checking. The most accessible introduction remains Manna and Pnueli's "Temporal Verification of Reactive Systems", although it only has one chapter on model checking 
 This book does a great job of paralleling basic business concepts with Monopoly game play.  This would work perfectly if business was conducted by four persons in your living room.    The book covers concepts including aggressiion, opportunity, maximizing odds and negotiation.  If you find these concepts new or intriguing then this is a great book for you.  I found it somewhat humorous and witty but not enough to recommend to friends.   I do find myself oddly excited about my next game of Monopoly as I now have some insights on game strategy that I never knew or cared about before 
 This book is short and poorly written and I didn't find to be so extremely inspirational as everybody else writing reviews on this site. In Fact I found it to be boring and pointless. This book about a religious nut who thinks he is some sort of modern day jesus didn't impress me at all. I reccomend that anyone thinking of reading this book should reconsider. Altogether, this book was just a steaming pile of garbage 
 This book has a beautiful gallery and wonderful pictures, but there are only like 3 projects in the whole book. I can see how a very early beginner like someone who just decided to try this would like it but for more experienced flower makers you might find this book dry. I waited for weeks to get a copy of this book and found myself a bit dissapointed when I finally got it. I just expected more projects 
 Clancy has gotten the best-selling writer thing down to a formula: a taut, suspenseful plot populated by militaristic all-American heroes and the evil-doers de jour. His merit lies in coming up with gripping, if improbable, settings for his stock characters. On the other hand, his actual writing is mediocre, unimaginative, and devoid of art.  Rainbow Six is the conservative Clancy's broadside against the environmental movement. The book's basic (and typically unbelievable) premise is that, in order to save the planet, fanatical environmentalists in charge of a major corporation devise a plot to kill off nearly all of mankind, while the brave men of the elite multinational force to which the title refers strive to thwart them. The unbelievable part: environmentalists in charge of a major corporation! Everybody knows that all the big corporations are in the capable hands of patriotic, polluting, profiteering Republicans 
 Sylvia Plath was a mentally sick person who was encouraged by one of her psychiatrists to write. I have seen photographs of her and Ted Hughes, and Sylvia is in an appaling state. I can't even relate what Sylvia is doing in one of the photographs. It's sad. I hope that she found some comfort in writing, but honestly, was this meant to be published?  It's not a surprise that many readers find this repulsive. English teachers/professors should not require students to read this; it goes against every basic human tendency to be happy and not to be anti-life. I don't know how else to put this but the best writers aren't suicides. Don't read them. Their opus is one long goodbye note. 
 One start , for some very acurate dramatic and terrorific  facts about the Ebola, but very weak regarding origin of the virus, very unconvincing about possible "theories". sound more like that old music of desinformation, he almost blame another monkey for the Ebola like they did before with HIV.. 
 This film is just like the The Sixth Sense film.  Both films have the same borring plot.  THE BORRING PLOT. In the two movies they have 2 boys who can see and speak to ghosts and in the 2 movies there are 2 teenagers girls who are ghosts who want help and showing the boy and man the people who had kill them.  After the boy and the man shows and tells other people who has killed the 2 teenagers, the two teenager girls ghosts are happy and they are at pease at last.   The Sixth Sense and this film is deserve to be seen only one time and after that you dont want to see again.  If you are like me and love ghosts who are bad and evil and kills people, you will love 13 Ghosts.  That film is what I called a good ghost film 
 This book is merely a hundred something pages long and yet 99% of what the two authors said are in defense of the traditional church doctrine. The only credit they gave Dan Brown is the fact that he stirs up the debates reguarding Mary Magdelene. That's it. The rest are just praises of how the church's version of the history makes better sense, has more morality and is more ethically-oriented. They completely dismissed any Gnostic ideas. You don't need to waste a few dollars on this book when you can attend the church for free and have the pastor tell you the same things 
 I usually would briefly summarize the plot in my reviews, but there really isn't one to write about.  It feels like a "days of our lives" soap opera of Betsy's life...she and eric are in love, she and eric have a fight, then she and eric make up, re-wash and rinse.  I wouldn't mind this as much except Betsy is getting more annoying with each book.  I keep waiting for her to grow up and be more queenly.  Her though process is like a 13 year old, and I just want to shake her and tell her to grow up.  I feel like the author is making Betsy more immature so that she can put Betsy in sillier situations (that anyone with a brain can figure out in 2 minutes) to get a cheap laugh from the readers.  This is one book in the series that you can skip without loosing anything.  To be honest, I truly think Betsy's demon sister is a better character to read about.  Maybe the author could do that after Betsy's story fizzles out...like the next book.      
 Let's see, I've owned these recordings on LP, cassette and at least 3 prior CD incarnations. I've dumped them all off in the past because I have never heard what so many others hear in these recordings. Where most hear demonstration-class recordings of a virtuosic band in a top-ranked interpretation, I hear a shallow, brittle and depth-less recording of a decent orchestra with less-than-sterling technical execution in a rather perfunctory interpretation by a fabled conductor.  Being so far off in my assessment when compared to received opinion, I've come to believe that there is something wrong with my ears. With that in mind, I picked up this recording/mastering for $5 at the Tower close-out yesterday, hoping to have my reaction to these recordings changed. Sorry to say I'm again gravely disappointed in these recordings on every level (as mentioned above).  If you really want to hear Richard Strauss in all his glory - both sound-wise and interpretively - than I suggest you turn to Karajan's non-digital DG recordings, Mehta's set with the LA Phil or Kempe's recordings on EMI (though I'm not fond of Kempe's Alpine Symphony).  I think I'm finally ready to give up on these over-rated recordings 
 Ron Kovic is a Marine whose life was blasted and changed forever by the paralyzing wound he received in Vietnam. Confined permanently to a wheelchair, without mobility or feeling below his chest, Kovic successfully turned his enormous inner rage to a public purpose in opposing the continuation of the Vietnam War and telling his story to a new generation of impressionable kids likely to think that war is cool.  Kids, whatever else it is, war ain't cool. Believe Ron Kovic.  But this a book review, not a personal tribute to a man who channeled his victimhood into political activism. In book form, Kovic's rage makes for a tedious, repetitive read. All Kovic wanted to do was to serve his country, fight communism, and be "like John Wayne" (who, unknown to young Kovic, never served in the military in any capacity). And look what happened. Yet despite the terrible personal cost the war laid on him and so many others, the Washington politicians waging the war paid no attention. They believed the national interest as they undrestood it took precedence over personal disasters like Ron Kovic's. One of the problems with Born on the Fourth of July is that the author can hardly believe that, or that Marines are expendable. But what else should a young Marine expect?    Older readers may prefer the late Lewis B. Puller, Jr's autobiography, Fortunate Son.  Puller's father was "Chesty" Puller, a legendary Commandant of the Corps, and young Puller wound up a quadriplegic after just a few days in country. Like Ron Kovic he came to oppose the war. I found his book to be a more satisfying reading experience than Born on the Fourth of July. 
 I awaited the arrival of this book with much enthusiasm.  However when it arrived I was disappointed.  I prefer Glynis McCants' take on numerology.  Her book "Glynis Has Your Number" is much easier to read and to understand. 
 As "Everyman" opens, the main character has already passed away.  From here, the plot moves back and forth in time to see how his life has come to this point.  This includes three unsuccessful marriages and strained relationships with offspring.  Ultimately, "Everyman" concerns how quickly life can pass us by- how death can come and people can be ill even when they feel they should be young and healthy.  And that's just not fair.  Quote: "My God, he thought, the man I once was!  The life that surrounded me!  The force that was mine!  No "otherness" to be felt anywhere!  Once upon a time I was a full human being."  I honestly cannot figure out what it is with folks and this book.  I did not find it to be interesting, nor the characters compelling.  Although I realize that the point could be made that in titling his work "Everyman" Roth is insinuating that the main character is actually representative of any man (who might not be a good man at all), I cannot find this convincing considering that I am unsure of whether the average man early has passionate affairs with European models thirty some odd years their junior . .  . maybe they do.  The virtue of this book is in its look at how an average man reflects on his life and death, but this man is not "average" enough for that to be pulled off here 
 I started this book because I love the quote about writing being but a different word for conversation.  Yes, there are moments of great wit.  However, they are lost within a mass of verbiage so dense that it makes your mortgage agreement look like a Little Golden Book.  It's not the sublime non-linearity of Joyce's writing or Ornette Coleman's playing.  It's the amplification of the self to an unbearable degree.  Certainly a unique achievement, I guess.  But so is Lou Reed's "Metal Machine Music.&quot 
 As i still have not received this book, which is long overdue, i can not review it!! 
 Susan Sontag used to say in interviews that she admired the way TS Eliot lived his life, specifically, TS Eliot never called attention to his own life, he wanted to be judged on his work.  That is a particularly modernist idea, one that Susan Sontag shared.  This book is really bad, every so often you get the feeling that the authors think there is a grand conspiracy going on and it is usually related to Sontag's bisexuality.  Sontag obviously wanted to have a large vision of the world and at times thought if she called herself a "woman writer" or a "bisexual writer", it would ghettoize her writing, which after all was the most important thing to her.  
 Lots of extra stuff that wasn't in Kaysen's memoir--that bothers me. It just seemed like it was a chance for Winona Ryder to attempt "real" acting, and to gain respect as an actor. Instead, Jolie snagged the Oscar, and Ryder slipped into A Scanner Darkly. Ryder again showcases her highly over-emotive acting ability that has been overrated from day one, and Jolie gets to look crazy and beautiful at the same time for the umpteenth millionth time. YAWN. Read the book instead 
 "If you tell a joke and it isn't funny and you put a laugh track under it it still isn't going to be funny." -Robin Williams (as Tom Dobbs in Man of the Year)  In a momentary lapse of judgement I rented this from a redbox. I knew  with Robin Williams as the lead that I was taking a risk but I thought that the prescence of Chris Walken could maybe redeem the movie. Besides I figured even if it wasn't that great it would only be a dollar investment. Today I sit in quiet reflection over what i must boldly state is the worst movie ever. I watched this with some friends and never once during the movie did I hear the sounds of laughter. Just uncomfortable, embarassed, awkward silence as Tom Dobbs (Williams) threw out zinger after zinger, perhaps hoping that the sheer volume of terrible jokes could compensate for the incoherent story line. But it was all in vain. Much to my dismay the movie actually continued after the election and turned into a "thriller" about a big business trying to kill an employee with a shocking secret. Now let me tell you a secret, this movie is not funny and not thrilling it's just old fashioned terrible 
 I am an avid sports fan and I love football, but sorry, I didn't enjoy this book one bit. I kept waiting for the Grisham who writes compelling dramas (The Broker, King Of Torts) to pop out, but realized midway through it wasn't gonna happen. As someone else here summarized - "it's chick lit about guys who played high school football" 
 I read the excerpt in March Fortune.  Just that was enough to make my decision.  While some may like his style, I find it tiresome and not one that I want to spend much time with 
 it is juust a copy of the frist book. if you read the frist the world is flat, then don't waste your time. jo 
 Very little offered in this book about what to do for the ravages of Menopause, except "take more time and use lots of LUBE". Once the hormones are gone, so's any motivation your partner might have had to get things back on track. Barry keeps telling us that WE are responsible for our OWN sexuality, and that you have a RIGHT to be sexual, but when your partner's more motivated over the cat hucking up a hairball instead salvaging your relationship, Oh, Well. Perhaps in a future edition the McCarthys should add an additional catagory to marriages that should get a "mercy killing": the "I'm done with that foolishness, and you should be, too" marriage 
 This was one of the worst books I've ever read. It is definately the worst book I have ever read on my own. The whole book could have been summed up in one page. It was way too long and just dragged on about the same thing the whole time: how she would seduce her teacher, make herself over to be a lil' teeny bopper, and how they would have sex. That was all it was. It was pathetic. There was nothing interesting, intriguing, or amusing in the book. When I finished reading it I fhad suicidal tendencies for days afterwards. I don't know how this thing got published, but I really hope that chick doesn't right anything ever again 
 The author advances that cities either thrive or die based on three variables: 1) their sacredness; 2) their safety; and 3) commerce.  Sacredness seems like a very questionable driver of a city's success.  Is Jerusalem or Mecca ever likely to be a more successful city than Dallas or Seattle?  Unlikely.  Also, safety does not seem like a differentiating variable but more like a necessity for a city.  It is like saying you need to speak English to be a successful student at Harvard.  You need a lot more than that.  So, does a city need a lot more than to be safe to become a successful city.  Finally, the third variable, commerce, is self-evident and appears the only valid one out of the three mentioned variables.    The present and future of a city most probably depend on a number of variables not well detailed by the author including:   1) Fiscal condition, or does a city has a healthy and growing tax revenue base that can suffice to cover its related cost of delivering public services and running city government?   2) Quality of municipal services including transportation, and most importantly education.  For a city to thrive, it needs to deliver very strong secondary and post secondary educational services.  3) An innovative business and cultural environment.  Is the city a nest of creativity resulting in a high rate of innovation within commerce, but also the arts, and other domain?  Does the city develop other related competitive edges associated with specialized network of professionals?  New York benefits a great deal from the huge human capital concentrated in "Wall Street."  San Francisco and San Jose benefit greatly from being within close reach of both Silicon Valley and venture capitalists  4) A strategic location.  Is the city located at a gateway of domestic or international trading routes?  Is it located near a coast, an airport, and a major harbor so it is quickly accessible from around the World?   5) A strategic virtual location.  How connected is the city?  Does its information infrastructure measure up to other World-class cities?   6) Economic demographics of its residents.  What is the educational level and per capita income of its residents?  What is the level of homeownership? Business ownership?   Obviously, many of these variables are interconnected.  And, many are associated with what the author calls commerce.  However, he did not drill down on many of these related variables.  Even though such variables would allow you to truly differentiate in a statistically meaningful and analytically insightful way between cities.    Meanwhile, the author offers just vague platitude devoid of much insight on the subject.  The model he proposes based on his three variables explains a bit about distant history, but much less about the future.   This book was especially disappointing given that the same author has written one of the most original and insightful books I have read.  Indeed, back in 1994 he wrote an excellent book called "Tribes" that does an excellent job of differentiating the culture and behavior of many of the World's most interesting clans or ethnic groups.  He also maps out what such cultural and behavioral features entail in terms of the present and future success of these different demographic clans (clustered by either religion, race, or nationality).  Thus, the author was able to deliver much insight about the various clans of the human race.  Unfortunately, he delivered nearly none regarding cities.  Thus, I strongly recommend you skip "The City" and read "Tribes" instead.              
 Light hearted and easy to read (but must then be put into practice) directions to navigate a happy life 
 I just took a week-long trip to New Mexico and gave up using this book after the first day.  I found my free AAA New Mexico Tourbook far more complete and informative 
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist [...] fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 I had  gotten  one other  copyof this book  in hard cover through Amazoin and expected  that  this copy would  be the same quality. I was not told that it was  a paper edition and was very disappointed in its appearance and the quality and color of the print and illustrations - altogether  very bad experience 
 I agree with all the other one star reviews (would give it zero if I could).  The author is a snob who  doesn't see the people whose lives she is supposedly reporting on as human beings in any way equal to herself.  If they take their "menial" jobs seriously she looks down on them.  She demeans hard work and celebrates entitlement.  For another view of the poor with some conception of how people's behavior shapes their lives, read LIFE AT THE BOTTOM. 
 This title is billed as the Sixth Edition, and reflects the coming and going of co-authors.  It is too bad that the editor had so little influence. Sections of this book that stick to their cartographic knitting are excellent.  Historical information is very intersting.  Basic explanations, such as the evolution of ellipsoids is very well done. Some  of the writing is so bad it could have been extracted from a sophmore term  paper, sprinkled with such inept phrases as "such as",  "similarly", "however" and "in fact". The  most glaring deficiency is in the area of computer technology.  Either this  material has not been updated since some earlier edition, or the author(s)  are very uncomfortable with the subject matter.   As examples: "Most  common procedures used by cartographers have been translated into software  programs written in special computer languages such as FORTRAN and C."  "Today's well-rounded cartographer is routinely involved with these  'canned' (prewritten) mapping programs..." "The professionsal  cartographer should, therefor, have a working knowledge of at least one  computer language."   We are regaled with three pages of detailed  obselescent material on computer structure, but only 23 lines of overview  on current instrument technology.   There is a whole chapter on fonts and  lettering, but no algorithm for conversion from Lat-Long to UTM. The  central meridians for the UTM zones are not provided, nor is the DoD  lettering scheme. One of the responsibilities of a text book is to arrange  the subject matter in a structure where it can be easily referenced.  This  book reads like a series of articles of varying quality published under one  cover, with overlap resolution left as an exercise for the reader 
 This is a good product, except it keeps shutting down when I have my outlook or when I have a web page open.   My main goal for an antivirus would be to run when I search the web or get in new emails!   What good is it if it shuts down when these are open!   It did find a trojan on my first scan.  This was one that Norton missed.  I will be getting NOD32 soon.  Sorry this product did not work for me! It was very easy to use 
 The book I am going to talk about is the book Arms and the Man By Bernard Shaw. I really did not like this book because it was hard for me to understand.  The reason I didn't like it was because it was challenging for me. The English was hard to understand. I liked how the writer wrote the book and I would probably look for another one of his books. This book was more like an opera with out music. If I could have and known to I probably would not have this enthusiastic about the book. One reason I picked the book was because it was dealing with war and I thought it would have been cool to read about war, but when I got more in to the book it was really not about war it was more about a love at war. If you're an older audience it would be a good book, or if you're looking for a good love-war story. 
 What's the matter with you people can't you tell the awsome sounds from the awful ones this cd is garbage except for the singles I tried hard to like these songs and I can't. They are so boring and dumb. I'm planning to give this cd away for free even I can't stand it 
 I broke and chipped most of my short fingernails trying to unlock where the keys are suppose to go. Once I got the keys on the holders the zipper broke. I threw it away, but had to scape up my nails again to get my keys off the holders 
 I love Cook's other Black Company books, but this one is atrocious.  Bleak Seasons is possibly the worst book I have ever read.  Confusing, convoluted, and a real chore to get through.  I hope the final three in the series are better.  What a stinker 
 This book is based more on psychological theory then hard fact.  The author's attempt to explain why southerners allegedly did not like baseball is laughable.  Greenburg would have been better served to do more solid research, as there actually were a lot of southern baseball teams.  Still, it's always fun to read about the Jeff Davis in drag story 
 This book didn't make that much sense to me as far as a plot goes. It was mainly pornography. I like steamy scenes as much as anybody but after a while, for me, the repeated sex got tiring. Merinus (not a very attractive name) was a contradiction. She claimed to be able to do the job of tracking down Callan Lyons and getting him to open up to her. She finally talks her stubborn brothers, who were major irritants, into letting her do this and then she proceeds to make so many blunders that it was hard to take her seriously. Perhaps this book wasn't the right one to read first as this is a series but the plot just wasn't there. There was a bit of disjointed story in between bouts of sex. I liked Callan but Merinus was also an irritant. There was just no meat to this story. If you like steamy sex scenes and plenty of them, then this is the book for you. If you like a plot too, then maybe this isn't one you'll enjoy. 
 As a songwriter I found this of very little help.  There are SOOO many more possibilities for rhyme in contemporary music that this book is really only good if you want to know the perfect rhymes for a word 
 Whatever happened to the wall of sound vibrations of such tracks as "Strange Fruit" and "Black Metallic"??? Here, in a so-called "return to form", Rob Dickinson does a Bob Mould, cranking up a Linn Drum programmer to about 175 BPM and leaves it nailed there for about an hour while he tries to make SOME kind of lyrical contribution (despite the fact that alot of his attempts at political commentary are embarassingly outdated and overconfident).  Meanwhile, synthesized and over-treated guitar tracks weave in and out, sounding like some weird hipster Starbucks soundtrack. PLEASE.  If I wanted Dave Matthews-style jam band yuppie noise with a click track, I would have bought My Morning Jacket!!! Good grief. 
 The Language activities are often book specific, and the activities are designed for younger children--through 8th grade 
 Great Expectations was a mediocre book.  I was not impressed.  I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.  It was too long and boring.  I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.  It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.  Every chapter was boring.  I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.  Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?  This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.  In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!  If you want to read a good Dickens story, read "A Christmas Carol" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 I bought two Clarisonic brushes - one as a gift and one for myself.  Although the product works well, unfortunately, both brushes were defective.  The trouble started occurring about two months after using.  One brush started out with two speed settings, but eventually only functioned at the low setting.  The other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged!  My experience with the customer service has been terrible.  They would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty.  Be careful if you are going to travel abroad.  The warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v!  
 This book is a mass of allegations and assertions and ignores inconvenient facts in favor of sensationalized storytelling based mainly on gossip and cognitive leapfrog. Entertaining, yes, if you love history but enjoy the peculiar experience of having your blood pressure raised by seeing it badly reinterpreted. There are far better and more reliable works on this time period and this subject 
 I was surprised to find positive reviews for this heating pad, since I just returned mine after one use.  Perhaps the one I got was defective, but even on the highest setting this heating pad was barely warm to the touch and wasn't hot enough to penetrate my sore back muscle.    I also thought that the convenience of strapping the pad on would be excellent to target the lower back area, and found the shape of the pad and the flimsy elastic strap provided to be very uncomfortable to wear.  The placement of the strap doesn't allow the pad to conform to the body, but only to press against it where the strap runs through - just the center, not the rest of the pad.  I realize there are probably now safety standards for heating pads that preclude them from getting too warm, but hopefully they are not so stringent as to not allow any electric heating device from getting warm enough to penetrate sore muscles properly.    For the time being I'll keep wearing Thermacare(TM)  back wraps (which are expensive - could have bought two heating pads by now) but do last 8 hours at a time and provide intense enough heat. Also, this disposable product is surprisingly comfortable to wear and more directly applies heat to the area where I need it.  If you need intense heat for a sore back, I'd skip this heating pad 
 Perhaps I set too high of a standard for this book after reading Robert Massie's "Nicholas and Alexandra" and "The Romanovs: The Final Chapter". I picked up "Fate of the Romanovs" because it seemed to be, at least in its own words, "more updated" with "new information" that had not previously been released.  This book is highly detailed, but that seems to be one is its greatest downfalls. It becomes so boring because of the fact that the authors were bent on giving the background history on EVERY SINGLE guard who watched over the family while they were under arrest. This would be fine, if it weren't for the fact that most of the guards did not spend much time with the family and are therefore very minor characters of the book. It actually leaves you wondering why the authors spent so much time devoted to their lives, when they were not the ones who made the decisions controlling the Romanov's fate.  Another disappointment was the style in which the book is written. It is very repetitive, and therefore, you will see the same material in several different chapters. It seems there was no outline for this manuscript. You will literally feel as if you are reading the same stuff over and over, because you are. It does not make for the most enjoyable of reads.  Finally, it appears that much of the "new" information is actually speculation that the authors themselves have come up with in hopes of their myths actually being true. They are hell-bent on the idea that the two missing corpses mean that those two members of the family actually survived. Yet, nowhere in their commentary do they provide a reasonable theory for where the bodies are. Another idea they want to misprove is the idea that the two bodies were burned. The authors speak of many unauthorized accounts of why there is no evidence of a fire in the Koptyaki forest; it apparently never occurs to the authors that 70+ years of rain, heavy snow, and ice would make the fire harder to uncover.   Other unreasonable suggestions (against the face of known historical facts or first-hand, eye-witness accounts) include: The idea that the Grand Duchesses were raped on board the Rus; the idea that Grand Duchess Marie had a fling with one of her guards; the idea that not only could anyone have actually survived the massacre in the Impatiev house, but that the guards helped some of them escape; and the idea that the Romanov's grave was completely fake in terms of authenticity.   The authors, try as they might, appear to have an agenda: to makeover the Imperial Family from one of a loving family (which is well-known) into one that basically deserved what they got. Their bias is clear, which wouldn't be so bad except for the other problems I've mentioned above. Sadly, I can't recommend this book. It is not on the same wavelength as Massie's work. 
 The GI Bill is the subject of a great book. The human interest stories of people affected by this landmark legislation should inspire us all. Unfortunately, this is not that book. It reads like a doctoral dissertation (which it may well be), with all the dryness and academic disinterest that implies. We get statistics and conclusions, with random personal impacts thrown in as filler. Never once do we get engaged in the subject. I looked forward to this book, but I read to the end out of a sense of duty, not because I really wanted to. The opportunity for a great book about the GI Bill was there. Ms. Mettler wasted it. The stars are for the stats, not the story. 
 I returned this contract and asked for a refund but NEW ignored my first two emails. Then I called them and they informed me of their shady business practice that it would take 8 weeks to refund my account. I then contacted Amazon and they resolved the matter in one day. I read reviews for NEW and most people that actually had to deal with NEW were not happy. The 77% positive rating they have is misleading because the majority of people rating them have never actually had to use the product.  
 I've grown up in the shadow of Uncle Ted. I'm almost 50 and when I was about 20 I remember reading about his draft dodge story when he was being interviewed by some magazine. Don't remember which one.  I've seen him in concert a couple of times and must say he puts on a great show and no one can put more of themselves into a concert than him. That's who he is to me. A brillant rocker. He has walked through rock and roll history. That's what I wanted to hear about. I was really embarrassed for him. I love guns, hunting and right to carry but what does that have to do with what he has given his fans for over 30 years. He lives a stones throw from my house now. If I met him on the street I'm not sure I would know what to say to him. He's a great man. It's just a sadly boring irrelevant book.  I really hope he gets a good ghost writer and tells of all the amazing things he's experianced in his life 
 Why did they stop the regular videos with the supermodels. Does everyone have to get into the reality show rut? 
 I was disappointed in this product as it had been edited from the TV version I had originally seen.  I didn't realize the DVD was being offered by a 'family values' group.  Although the original version was barely PG, the editied version is now definitively G.  Several lines of dialogue between the 2 main adult characters were removed and an early scene which defined what kind of man the main character was has also been removed.  It's still a good movie and if you haven't seen the original, you probably won't care.  Personally, I dropped off the DVD at the Salvation Army and just kept my video-taped off the TV version - commercials and all.  For me, the interaction between the 2 main adult characters was what had made the movie worth $25 (with shipping), so losing that was a big disappointment for me.  For me, it was a waste of money.  If you have kids, though, it would probably be a good buy 
 We actually went through two of these in two weeks. The first one cooked the bottom 20+ wipes, so we returned it thinking that it was simply defective. The second one did the exact same thing! We wasted so many wipes with this warmer, since they were "cooked". We have even emailed the company and sent them pictures, but never heard back from them. Save your money 
 I've read every one of Iris Johansen's "suspense" novels and have loved most of them.  The last couple though have been so painful to get through. This one however, I don't think I can even finish.  I read where someone called these characters "cardboard," and I couldn't agree more.  The female heroine randomly throws in curse words in a cheap attempt to create tension between herself and the supposed male protagonist.  Whereas in the Eve Duncan Books and the Wind Dancer books we are drawn into the story and come to care for the characters, it is patently obvious what will happen with each of these characters - makes me think of a writing 101 class.  "Now this should happen here, and this here, and this here and boom, climax, happily every after."    I hope that Iris can get her groove back and begin writing novels worth my time.  
 I saw the originals broadcast on TV.  Liked them so much I bought several of them from Amazon and Wal-Mart.  But the DVD are edited SO MUCH, it's unbelievable.  So much is chopped up.  Can't follow the story line.  These Spanish soaps when they make it on DVD get edited by up to 70% that it's a waste of money to purchase them.  I won't do so again.  Maybe if you the sellers mentioned to your distributors of this problem they would improve the editing.  Keep the entire story but sell it for a bit more money.  Many people would pay more to get the entire FULL story 
 I thoroughly enjoyed the fresh juiced fruits & vegetables and did feel more energized from my Jack LaLanne Juicer which was given to me as a gift.  However, after 2 months of using the juicer 4-6 times a week, it stopped working and it did not juice the apples and beats easily.    Of course, there is no longer a warrenty so I cannot get it replaced.  
 No, it's certainly not as good as the first one, but I did enjoy some of DEMONS 2. The beginning is cool enough, with the demon's resurrection and it's gaining access into Sally's apartment via the TV set. The tension and dread seem to build quite nicely. That is, right up to the scene where the kid-demon's chest pops open to reveal an idiotic, rubber demon puppet! Ugg! It reminded me of those stupid monsters in GHOULIES, HOBGOBLIN, or some other wretched '80s mess! The apartment building setting was interesting, but seemed to be mostly wasted on the few, precious bursts of action we actually get. I did like the weightlifter folks in the gym. They were hilarious and at least they put up a fight against the infernal invaders! The battle in the parking garage was ok too. Maybe I just expected D2 to be a bit more frightening and disturbing...           
 After reading this book, it is just not quite what I expected. It's definately not for someone who is very heavy or out of shape. Some of the stuff was inspiring but it just seemed too much for me 
 I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice 
 Sorry...it's not what I expected. I kept thinking, "where is this going???" It just wasn't funny. It reminded me of something written 100 years ago. But that's not to say someone familiar with Portuguese linguistics (maybe a German academist or an up-in-coming Dr. Dr. Longname, etc. etc. hrumph, cough), could not read between the lines and find this humorous...it was just a little dry and boring to me. After the first couple jabs at these pompous doctors, it got tiring. I read every single book in the Ladies Detective series and couldn't wait to sink my teeth into the next Precious Ramotswe story. This, however, was a disappointment. I'm only sorry I bought all 3 in the series, sight unseen, based on the other books I'd read by Alexander McCall Smith 
 Even with the questionable veracity, I enjoyed Frey's first book, A Million Little Pieces, since it stayed true to an addict's experience.  Leonard, on the other hand, came off as pure fantasy, with very little substance.  Even the description of Frey's struggle was too contrived to be believable.  It was not even interesting as fiction. 
 i have read just about every popular book on horserace betting and the acid test is: does it help beat the races? the name of the game in betting thorougbreds is data mining and processing, which can only be done with software on a computer. i have software that allowed me to test some of the factors cited in this and other popular books. the bottom line... yes you get a high percentage of winners but unfortunately these horses are overbet, indicating that the info in this and other popular books is well known and used by the betting public. to beat the horses you have to think outside the box. so in conclusion don't waste your time reading this book. 
 First of all, the only reason I started watching this movie was because my roommate got it and we're both lovers of the Romantics. The only reason I kept watching this movie after the first 5 minutes was because I could already tell it was going to be completely and totally awful and would make for a few good laughs between the two of us.  Beyond some very basic facts about the party of writers, this movie is not grounded anywhere in reality. The acting is way overdone and quickly becomes grating. There is no plot whatsoever to speak of and the movie lacks any sense of clear direction or purpose -- it is simply a collection of random, inexplicable, and nonsensical events filled with frenzied sexuality, animalism, and vaguely-defined hallucinations. While I'm sure the actual experience was not entirely tame and prudish, I find it hard to believe that this is anywhere close to being accurate. Even when it tries to delve into pseudo-philosophical discussion about the nature of love, fear, poetry etc., that you would expect to emerge among these great literary figures (which, strangely, does not happen often)it utterly fails to make any understandable conclusions or statements and their real views, beliefs, and visions become hysterical ravings rather than the passionate philosophies that they were. The film does not deal fully at all with Mary's creation of the Frankenstein story, nor do any of the other characters write ghost stories as Byron challenges them and as really took place. The idea that the story was born out of Mary's personal fears is an interesting one but this too spirals out of control and has almost nothing to do with Frankenstein.  The premise behind this disaster of a movie is a good one and I think with the right script, actors, and director it could be an amazing exploration of authorship, literary exploration and exchange, and this fascinating group of writers. That is not, however, what this film is.  P.S. If you do get seduced by the other reviews, pay particular attention to the scenes in the billiard room...I didn't know they had light bulbs in 1816!  
 So we have this book in our house because my fiance is a veterinarian, and so everyone gives us dog and cat books.  I picked this book up for the first time during a late-night power outage, and I've got to say, the pictures in this book had me laughing and smiling, but the text had me pulling my hair out.  Sure, all dog owners put words into their dogs mouths, but most of Mr. Blount's are painfully irritating.  First off, if dogs are going to be poets (which I don't really get), they ought to at least rhyme, not just ALMOST rhyme.  Furball and terrible?  Blount too often struggles to to be poignant (though the bulldog with the stick is right on) and ends up missing the mark.  Valerie Shaff has captured the essence of what makes dogs special in her pictures, but the messages conveyed by these wonderful images are cheapened by Blount's poor poetry.  I've got "I am puppy, hear me yap" on the shelf, and I'll bring it out during the next power outage.  Hopefully Blount spent more than 10 minutes on the text for this book.. 
 Purported knowledge not IN style anymore by the socalled academic elites.  Evolution, in the boxing ring got a KO by Professional scientists who UNderstand that KO means down.  Who LIVES for evolution other than those who live IN illusion.  Some day there will be enough people on EArTh to expose the lies of this ridiculous theory.  Until Then, Lies they will tell, and Exceptional lies they will be 
 Someone's trying to kill Soap star Mary Lisa Beverly, and how I wish they'd succeeded. This book doesn't do either the mystery or romanance genres justice, and thread throughout is a lame shooting report from the set of the soap whose title forms the title of the book. Does anybody care that Mary Lisa's character in the soap meets her long-believed dead father? What does this have to do with the death plot? And what's a small town cop from Oregon doing stepping into an investigation in California? The book explains Mary Lisa's father and a rejected lover both asked him to, but Jack Wolf's got his own murder to sleuth, so what's he doing in Oregon, other than making eyes at our heroine. Much of the book centers on flirting between the Oregon sheriff and Mary Lisa, stuff that has little to do with the plot and indeed detracts from it, and the book is in serious need of an editor. At one place, Mary Lisa refers to the "Sheik of Aran." Argh!  This is one to skip. Generally a good writer, Catherine Coulter must have pulled this one out of the rejected pile. It should be thrown back 
 This book romanticizes mental illness in its quest to emulate Joycean prose. Dense, illogical monologues are unrelieved by dialogue, action, or time orientation. The effect is about as interesting as listening to  someone explain their dreams in detail.  Undisciplined, reads like a good  first draft.  Language is sloppy and cliched.  All it needs to be more  irritating is the addition of footnotes 
 Ah yes, HIM started to go downhill after and with this one.  This one I acquired after getting Razorblade Romance, Love Metal and Greatest Lovesongs, and I was quite surprised that I hadn't ever heard of this one.  I got it, rushed home to listen to it, and I did, and I have been revisiting that horrid memory every time I listen to those few songs I liked in this one.  "Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights" marks the beginning of HIM's descent into mellower, less moody, wasted-potential music, which they later described as "love metal" when it had lost all connection with what it used to be.  This album also marks the start of "Ten Songs Per Album" rule of HIM, guaranteeing what will most likely be a short and catastrophic listen.  "Heartache Every Moment", "Pretending", "Love You Like I Do".  That's it.  The rest of the album sounds like it has been taken out of some dreamy pop album with electric guitar and overall too much acoustic and cheery melodies, complete with all songs regarding love or loss thereof, as usual, however, without the edge they delivered in Greatest Lovesongs and Razorblade Romance.  This album takes a lot of getting used to, simply because it takes for you to get used to the idea HIM could have gotten this dreamy and cheerful.  Like I said, after this, the band went downhill, with the brief interruption of "Love Metal" 
 I love step2 products, my daughter is only 2 yrs old but we already have MANY of their items. We decided to get her the lifestyle deluxe kitchen for the holidays this year & needed to get her some playfood to go along with it, I really wanted wooden sets but after spending over $200 on the kitchen I decided I'd go with the step2 plastic... big mistake! As another reviewer mentioned there is no retail packaging, they come in plastic bags. The plastic pieces are tiny, very thin, and sized strangely (ie a banana is smaller then an egg etc), the "boxes" are a joke, they are smaller and weaker then your typical snack size raisin box... I didn't even dare give them to my toddler as they'd have been ruined in 2 seconds. The "jars" are also very small and instead of interesting as one reviewer said they are just odd, disgusting sounding food items and very boring design. Having nothing else on hand I did give these to my daughter, she seems to like them well enough but I will be buying her some wooden playfoods soon and tossing these up on ebay or a garage sale. Not recommended 
 For average people who want a camera that just works-and takes good pics you should not buy this. I don't know about the specifics, but like other reviewers mine got stuck and quit working for no reason after a couple of months. So, I don't really see what all the bells and whistles are for if it doesn't even take a picture. It was fine while it worked, it ate batteries but the pics were good 
 What is up with this cd?  Sounds like a karaoke collection? Who is that really?  The recordings sound like they were done in a tunnel.  If you're looking for vintage Juice don't look at this one. 
 I`m trying to remember what made me pick up this book. I know I wanted some light reading for the summer days sitting on the beach but the Face was so bad it took me a month to finish it. I literally had to force myself to read it. The writing is vintage Koontz to the extreme. Koontz likes to describe things that not many people really care about and this book is yet another example. I call it diarrhea.(Spell check)  I respect Koontz, for example, Odd Thomas is really good but the face is a story of a boy who is the target of a sick, demented killer. Thanks to some spirit who led a disgraceful life while alive, the boy lives in the end.   A good 200 pages could have been deleted from this book and maybe then we would have had something decent. My advice is skip this one.   I would love to know if Mr. Koontz is being paid by the page? The face makes me wonder.. 
 Save your money.  Or, if you need to spend it, buy plain yogurt -- you will find the bland white stuff much more exciting than this novel. If you do buy this book, you will wade through pages and pages waiting for the story to get started and then you will not care about a single character you meet.  In the course of the book, there are love affairs, savage beatings, and a kidnapping or two, and all these incidents unfold without an ounce of passion, desire, or emotion.  Anna, the long suffering wife, is so strangled that she can't bring herself to demand a new washing machine.  She and her obtuse husband never talk to each other or to their children.  And we are supposed to care about the marriage of these two?  Buy yogurt 
 This is a film about two soldiers captured during the Chechen war.  Normally the Chechen rebels don't take prisoners but one of the men is hoping to trade the soldiers for his son who is being held by the Russians.  As time passes the younger of the two soldiers, Ivan, begins to feel for the rebels and to wish he could live among them.  The soldiers are told to write to their families and have them ask the commander to trade them for the rebel's son.  Ivan's mother tries but ultimately fails in her attempt.  Eventually the rebels get tired to waiting and kill the older soldier.  Ivan gets free and runs for the hills ending the movie with his escape 
 I'm no prude, but I have to say this book is completely inappropriate for children of any age unless, as a parent, you think potty humor is okay. I ordered this for my son's teacher and one for my son as well, but will be returning both copies. Some of the "brain teasers" are okay and not terribly off-color, but too many of them are just...wrong. I was disgusted and wouldn't even let my kids look at it 
 The total absence of normative values makes for tedium, and revulsion, not for greatness.  Nor even, for that matter, for titillation.  When even father/daughter incest is treated as a matter of callous indifference, it becomes easy to see why the French are exterminating themselves, by refusing to reproduce themselves. At the fertility rate of 1.4 children per family, the French nation will be gone in another few generations. This movie will help the viewer see why.  Sociologically and philosphically interesting, in that it epitomizes the banality of evil, and demonstrates the futility of putting lipstick on a pig. Secularism is devoid of soul, and offers nothing to live for, nothing to live by. 
 Based on the advertisement at Amazon this was the book "In Search of Excellence.  It was not the book but an interview about the book.  I was very disapointed.  I still want the book on CD but feel it futal to try ordering it again on Amazon as it is a nusance to order and return.  If you can help, I would love to purchase the actual book on CD.  Thank you.

 Unfortunately, this book does a poor job of bridging a gap in marital therapy self-help books. It seems a pity that there is little, if any, information out there covering the territory between books on how to save your marriage and those on how to divorce. Thus, I had high hopes to get a fresh perspective when ordering this book. What a disappointment. The basic idea of a planned separation is an interesting one, and probably helpful in some (perhaps many) situations. But this book is so poorly written that it takes a strong stomach indeed to wade through it. Filled with cutesy acronyms and psychobabble jingles, be sure to have a barf bag nearby. And the book sorely needs reworking by a competent editor to pare down her blatant and transparent self-promotion. Seinfeld could do a great episode lampooning the author- she comes through as a pathetically insecure person who can't separate her needs from those of her patients. More space is wasted on her bragging than practical (or even theoretical) advice. If her painfully self-referential style and anecdotes had some substance it would be OK, but one ends up feeling like the person deriving the most benefit from the book is the author. Perhaps the only one. But It's even more frightening to think of her attempting to function as a therapist. Scary. Somebody stop her before she writes again 
 They clean the screen, so to speak, but also leave a slight film behind which can be seen when the monitor is off. It doesn't really affect viewing while the monitor is actually on, but I still don't like the fact that the screen is not completely clean after treatment. The monitor would have been cleaner overall had I just wiped it with a dry lint free cloth.   Perhaps some people would view this film as a relatively minor flaw, since it doesn't affect picture during use, but regardless, I am extremely disappointed to pay money for a product specifically marketed as a screen cleaner with results anything other than excellent. I thought these would be a solution but they've turned out to be just another problem I have to figure out. 
 I'm a new fan to Bob Dylan's music.  Oh Mercy, Another Side of Bob Dylan and Desire is where I started.  After listening to Empire Burlesque I have to think that Bob somehow was blindsided by the 80's.  Every cheesey production trick to come out of the 80's is on this album (reverb, background singers, glossed up production).  So it's kind of a hard listen.  You get through all that crap to get to the songs which aren't Bob's best (in my humble opinion).  My suggestion is to stop wasting you time and move on to Bob's 90's music which is far superior to his 80's music.  His 90's music is good but not as good as his 70's music.  However, his 60's music is probably close to scripture at this point in a lot of peoples minds.  Enter this record at your own risk.  At the end of it you might be searching for spandex pants.  Maybe Bob could re-record this album and free the songs of the bad production?  That's a thought...  
 Pretty graphics, no art.  Looks nice but playability sucks.  Terrible keyboard controls, requires multiple clicks from scrolling lists to do simple things like cast a spell.  Quests confusing, sometimes screen pixel hunt and click required.  Very limited, laughable, quick key assignment.  Can't even bring up the area map with a single click/key!!!  No personal journaling or marking maps on this huge game area.  Wait for it on the $9.99 rack, or maybe user content will make something of it.  Seems like a great graphics engine with little RPG behind it.  Seems very much designed by committee with features removed when anyone didn't like it.  Get NeverWinter Nights 1 instead.  Update after about 50 hours into it:  The inside caves, it seems, are made of a very limited tile set.  There is a narrow tunnel, an open cave, and open cave with upper shelves on each side, or a cave with an above cross-over.  Textures are cut stone, some are rough stone, but the shapes are the same.  Very boring, you now know where to look for the monsters.  Guess console players are less demanding.  Too much money went into the cut scenes, not enough into the RPG engine 
 Blood and Chocolate, in my opinion, was a book not to waste your time with.  The whole "love" situation with Aiden and Vivian is not real love.  It's lust and sexuality, and is telling teens that it's perfectly fine to go and have sex with someone that you don't give a crap about.  All the teens in this book did drugs, smoked, and had sex.  That's it.  There wasn't one, what they would call, "goody two-shoes".  What, is it cool to go out and get drunk and doped up now?  I thought drugs were illegal.  I'm 15 years old, and I hated this book.  It makes teens look bad, and gives them the okay to be doing stupid crap that they shouldn't be doing.    Not to mention the overall writing was just horrid.  I didn't like the way she wrote, and you can tell Anette is one of those women who misses her teenage hood so bad, that she writes about being a teen so she can re live those days.  I don't know.  The book was horrid.  I definitely reccomend "Twilight" and "New Moon" by Stephenie Meyer if you're looking for Vampire/Werewolf fantasy.  This book had nothing but sex and swearing and drugs in it.  Whoo hoo.  Cause we don't get enough of that on a daily basis. 
 When I bought the book I did not know that they already made a movie out of it but I learned about it later on. So I was really excited when I started to read it - also because other comments were really good. Unfortunately the book could not live up to my expectations at all.  First the story development is really slow- it takes an awful lot of pages before the actual crime happens.  Second, several passages in the book do not contribute anything vital at all to the story but only slow down the pace significantly.  The worst part of the book though is its style: It does not matter if a person really contributes anything at all to the story or the crime - he/she gets an extensive characterization. Most of them are several pages long and bore the hell out of the reader. Without this absolutely unnecessary amount of information this book easily could be about 200 pages shorter.  But even if the pace is slow and the book should be shorter, couldn't it still be an interesting book? Unfortunately those of you who hope to find a decent crime story will be disappointed big time as well. The detective aspect is so simple it could be told in less than 100 pages. On top of that the solution to the crime is so simple that after the first clue you know who the murderer is - and wonder why you need to go through over 200 pages to find out officially.  Conclusion: If you are a psychologist and/or like in-depth character studies this is exactly the right book for you. BUT for those of you who like fast-paced stories, ample twist and turns, surprises, action, thrilling developments and/or elaborate detective stories this book will be an absolute waste of your time. Please do not come anyway near it. Watch the movie instead - this way you will see some really great actors and are over with it in 2 hours 
 I could not use this book for a reference. The content is to brief. This book is like a novel, Once you've read it, your're done, and will never go back read it again.  The pictures inside is also very poor, some even  completely can not be read. I bought this book because I wanted to know  about web site security. But the security chapter only (briefly) discuss on  several types encryption. This book should not titled as Web Programming  Methods 
 Jeanne Martinet's book the "Art of Mingling" would have better been titled "An Overview of How To Be the Party's Fool." Her advice often degrades both the mingler and the group they wish to enter.  Many of her tips actually separate the mingler from the rest of the party  goers. Her worries over how someone may interrupt her remarks are well  placed considering how snide and repulsive they are. Mrs. Martinet's  callousness is uncalled for in any social setting. 	What happened to  the strides the feminist movement has made? Mrs. Martinet's advice degrades  both the mingler and the group she wishes to enter. The "Helpless  Hanna" routine smacks of a female incapable of taking care of herself.  The theory of pretending to be someone else, "star," achieves the  same outcome. If everyone at a party choose to be someone they are not the  purpose of minglingwould be lost. Her opening gambits concerning clothes  and "a room with a view" is base and a turnoff. Most groups would  see through the ploys and soon the mingler will be known as false. 	The  definition of mingling, as given by the author, is to join with others.  However, many of the tips keep the party mingler from joining with the  group. There is never a nerd at a party. Everyone is there for a reason,  and the mingler may find that they have much to contribute to the party.  The same is true for the "Changing of the guard" exit routine.  The "dot, dot, dot" trick is degrading to the speaker and all  other's in the group because they know that the mingler is not paying  attention. In her smooth escape the mingler comes off as rude and  superficial. The advice to be constantly moving from group to group may  appear to other's that the mingler is the center of the action, but they  lose the meaning of mingling. Even constantly scanning the room removes the  mingler from the group from the beginning. 	Throughout the book Mrs.  Martinet is concerned with how others will see her. If the antidote of her  mother telling the author everyone in the room is more concerned with  themselves is true, the author may wish to apply it. The audacity of  playing with another language, speaking style, or an accent is risky at  best. What would be the consequences of saying something in Spanish or  German and receiving an answer? The use of accents and speaking style  especially a regional one is offensive. Even her advice to use "little  white lies" to make yourself better is snide. She may be surprised  that in the real world most people consider the little lie repulsive and a  turnoff to the present company. It may surprise the author how fast the  warning that there is a liar in at the party gets around the room. 	It  is not wise for any new mingler to follow any of the advice Mrs. Martinet  offers. Try to be oneself and relax. Any gracious person will realizes that  help is needed and most will come to the nervous person. The parties that  Mrs. Martinet attends are not the norm. Hopefully, one day she will come  down off the horse and write a decent book. She has a wonderful writing  style 
 This book of the disintegration of Jugoslavia is very detailed, nicely organized, and easy to read one. It covers the step-by-step death of Jugoslavia, and like many reviewers I found biases dragging all over the book as if the Muslims are saints and the Serbs devils. The blame on Milosevic is constant, but the blame of Tudjman does not exist. How good or bad Milosevic is/was, it was designed and decided by the USA and the Western Europe-same like in Irag, with once Western darling Saddam Hussein and suddenly the evil, the demon. The ethnic differences in Jugoslavia were created and provoked by the USA and the Western Europe ONLY by corrupting the Balkans governments in search for more markets for their collapsing empires and places for their oil tubes for their SUV's and poluted fat ways of living.  
 "The Magic Barrel" was a collection of stories that intrigued me, if only for the whimsical sounding name. I was disappointed, however, to find that the stories themselves were themselves not whimsical in the least. Malamud has created a world where paranoia is abundant, and worse, where poor, lackadaisical decisions are abound equally. There are no winners in any of Malamuds stories. I found myself becoming angry at the characters, for the way in which they responded to conflicts was alarmingly pathetic. His character development is strong, however, and I did enjoy maybe one or two of the stories until I found the ending rather dreary. If a literary work is "sad," that is not a deterrant for me. Malamud's characters, on the other hand, are hopeless. I can't seem to enjoy reading about people who operate in such ways

 The key concept of this book is the existence of a new Creative Class. Richard throws into the Creative Class almost everybody and groups them in two categories: the Super Creative Core and the "creative professionals". These two groups include: scientists, professors, poets, novelists, artists, entertainers, actors, designers, architects, non-fiction writers, editors, cultural figures, researchers, analysts, programmers, engineers, filmmakers, financial services, legal and health care professionals, business management and the list goes on.  The problem is that the definition of this class is so loose. Even Richard admits that the definition is not really clear, but he goes on discarding the importance of rigour. A class must have political alignment as an expression of a common ground in the way wealth is created and distributed. It should be reflected in the way people vote; otherwise the class does not make sense. It is difficult to convince anyone that you can put these people in the same class: engineers and artists, accountants and actors.   The book uses shocking statistics and quotes and then follows through with flashy language to wrap up a nicely packaged chapter. The problem is that the book has enough time to loose the reader after seemingly never ending debates. This book has so much information and so little structure. All those tables are useless because they do not support a coherent system of principles or story. The writing is difficult to read and very repetitive. After the first fifty pages the same arguments are being rotated again and again: creativity is important, the time of agriculture has passed, the heavy industry is not important for global leadership, there is tension between individual freedom and corporation rigidity, etc.   In describing the new class, Richard Florida observes that "Fewer than one-quarter of all Americans (23.5 percent) accounted for by the 2000 Census lived in a 'conventional' nuclear family, down from 45 percent in 1960. This is social group is mentioned many times in the book. By contrast, the family social group is almost completely ignored. I have the impression that this is actually the creative class and all these indexes (Bohemian, Single, Gay, etc) match quite well the group's dynamics.   I gave this book a two stars rating purely on style and clarity and overall coherence of the book. I think that regardless of the political affiliation, the reader will have genuine difficulty in following the book from the beginning to the end. For instance, in discussing the transformations of every day life, in a polemic with other authors Richard says:   "Juxtaposed to this view are those who believe technology and unbridled market forces are making us work harder and faster, leaving us less time to enjoy each other and out interests, destroying human connections and damaging our neighbourhoods and communities. If the techno-utopians romanticize the future, these techno pessimists glorify the past. Unfettered hypercapitalism is leading to the end of work and the demise of high paying, secure jobs, according to social critics like Jeremy Rifkin. Worse yet, the elimination of such jobs destroy an important source of social stability, argues Richard Sennett, casting people adrift, corroding our collective character and damaging the very fibre of society. The workplace is evolving into an increasingly stressful and dehumanizing "white-collar sweatshop" in Fill Fraser's view, beset by long hours and chronic overwork. In the eyes of cultural critic Tom Frank, business has become an all-powerful and hegemonic cultural force, as entities like MTV and The Gap turn alternative-culture symbols into money making devices. Neighbourhoods, cities and society as a whole are losing the strong sense of community and civic-minded spirit that were the source of our prosperity, argues Robert Putnam. In his nostalgia for a bygone era of VFW halls, bowling leagues, Cub Scout troops and Little League, Putnam contends that the demise of these repositories of `social capital' is the source of virtually all of our woes..."  If you were able to read the text above without losing your concentration and you remembered what started it, then you might be able to read the book and even like it.  Otherwise you will probably find that after you read page after page you realise your thoughts were wondering somewhere else. You come back, re-read those pages, only to find you lost your thoughts again.  
 I was, unfortunately, a victim of the hype this novel has generated and went out of my way to obtain a copy.  The writing is quite good for a first novel, but the title character of Sarah is not even well-developed enough to be called two-dimensional.  She represents nothing and is nothing but a catalyst that brings disparate types of individuals together.  The ending is a mishmash of diverse philosphies and ridiculous scenes which seem forced and stilted.  Let this Canary fly away

 I love Linda Howard books.  I always look forward to her releases and this book was a gross disappointment to say the least.  I think the characters are not developed well, and the relationship between Cal and Cate occurred too fast.  The story was rushed and I'm sure Linda could have done much better writing on this book.  
 What can you say about "Dead & Breakfast"?  I picked this up at the store not knowing much about it other than it had a cute title, clever holographic packaging, a few decent reviews and a young, appealing cast.  I can say that the charms, unfortunately, of the actual film are relatively limited.  Pretty standard fare, really--I didn't necessarily dislike it--I just felt that it was so obvious in its intention.  This film wants to be cool.  It was designed to (hopefully) be a cult classic.  It wants you to revel in its self-aware kookiness.  But that's just the problem.  Taking its cues from so many better movies, this is a self-indulgent and unoriginal mess.  The cast and filmmakers seem to be having a good time--you know this was a party set.  It seems as if they feel that they are doing us a great service by letting us in on the joke.  Well, I've heard the joke--so don't do me any favors.  I'm not saying that there aren't some amusing moments--how can you fail with redneck zombies?  And musical numbers are always fun.  And the TV-ready cast will be familiar to many, even if you can't always place from where.  The movie imagines that it's "Evil Dead 2," but it lacks real cleverness.  It works slightly better as a comedy than anything else, but it's hard for me to imagine anyone being captivated by this 
 According to Armstrong ADD is a conspiracy theory?  I just couldn't get past that!  I looked at a few of the 50 ways... Less TV?  Do you really need to include that?  Common sense!! 
 I tried to read this book, I really did but please Daffyd you could really do more with this book. I have had trouble reading other books before but I am a pretty open person and usually manage to finish them. However I  couldn't even get halfway through this book, it was that terrible. Still,  everyone is different, don't let my silly ramblings, dissuade you from  buying this book you may like it. Nothing ventured, nothing gained 
 The Crossing is set in New Mexico and Mexico in the late 1930s, during the last days of the Wild West before the onslaught of the motor car ends the frontier once and for all.  	The story is centred on two adolescent, monsyllabilic farmer's sons in New Mexico. When a wolf comes up from Mexico the farmer and his two sons decide to set traps and catch the wolf. McCarthy takes us into the mind of the wolf and an interesting, but sadly short, period of the book ends when the older son, alone, catches the wolf. Here he decides, rather than kill it, to return it to Mexico from where it came. When he reaches Mexico he is surprised to find the Mexicans don't see his generosity in quite the same light. After they commandeer the wolf and set it to fighting dogs Billy shoots it, and drifts through Mexico before returning home where he finds his parents murdered by horse thieves. An obvious plot at this stage would be for them to seek revenge but no. Instead they become thieves themselves and we find ourselves heading back to Mexico, with an unclear goal except to find their horses, a big country in which to find half a dozen horses, and our two protagonists becoming less and less likeable by the page. It is a pity that although McCarthy manages to take us into the mind of the wolf he never once reveals what the two boys are thinking, nor why. What motivates Billy and Boyd? For the entire book we never find out.  	 They meet a girl in an encounter that will be confusing to anyone who does not speak fluent Spanish. They also meet several Mexicans, some with their parent's horses, and they reacquire some of the horses in equally confusing scenes. Later Boyd, the younger brother, runs off with the girl; Billy returns to the USA, tries and fails to join the army (we are now in the 1940s) and so works on various ranches before returning to Mexico, for the third time, to find his brother.  	In `The Crossing' there are in fact three `crossings' into Mexico, which is projected as a lawless country full of generally unpleasant people, much like the USA. In fact, through the book there are few endearing, likeable characters that the reader can actually root for; the wolf and one or two horses are the possible exceptions. Much of the dialogue is in Spanish and difficult to follow. McCarthy may be pleased with himself for speaking Spanish but many readers of English literature do not and with so much dialogue in Spanish, and untranslated, it makes the story difficult to follow. 	This is further aggravated by a lack of proper punctuation. Mr McCarthy should remember that punctuation is something that has evolved with the English language and is there to make the language more comprehensible. To eliminate this not only distracts readers from what you are saying, but stops readers from enjoying the writing. Reading a sentence of 80 words without so much as a comma is very hard work. Lawyers often omit punctuation when writing a legal document to protect them legally. At times, `The Crossing' was much like reading a legal document, you need to read each sentence twice to understand exactly what McCarthy is saying.  Yet McCarthy still gives a compelling story described in vivid locations. Behind the faade of Spanish dialogue, unpunctuated English and dull characters there is a powerful storyteller at work here. It is a pity he chooses two charisma free lads having a loosely connected series of mini-adventures to express himself 
 Not worth it honestly for the price. It was not what I thought it would be because I was hoping it'll be similar to 200-thread count. The fabric is like nylon and created a lot of static. I think it is good for sofas or futons and the burgundy is a nice color.

 The quality of this swaddle blanket is very good, I'm not complaining about that. The problem we've had with our newborn is that as he squirms the blanket rides up and hits his cheeks.  This triggers his newborn rooting instinct, which makes him search around frantically for a nipple to suck on. Instead of lulling him to sleep it gets him frantic with hunger.  I recommend the sleep sac from this same company instead of this item. We own two of them, and they keep our baby very cozy and warm 
 "I was flushing the evil out....It was a good feeling knowing even though I might not be able to sleep, at least I'd feel clean."   17 year old Brendan and his friends Will and Kevin are the dregs of school society, the outcast, the fringe. Now they're in for a night of memories. After throwning back some Acid, they've hit the streets of Philly to enjoy themselves when the Pure Sunshine kicks in. The best and worst part about Sunshine is it makes everything else boring. It takes Brendan past all the normal experiences to where he can't enjoy anything anymore because of his desire for the next hit.   That's where Sunshine leaves him---at a place where the real and surreal mix together and separate in a way that leaves real life not worth as much as induced life. In the middle of a midnight trip, Brendan and the guys visit Sally, the downtown girl, so they can relax safely and enjoy their high. With so many girls that Brendan wishes he could take things deeper with, their night with Sally awakens a spark in him for something more. Not necessarily with Sally. Or any specific girl. But with something. For once, he feels his void.   Brian James' PURE SUNSHINE delves into the euphoria and pain people experience when addicted to LSD. While the details of the high can be intriguing at times, a sense of arc and story are strangely missing all the way through. The story is more a realization that drugs may not be everything Brendan's made them out to be. Thatâ(tm)s the only thing that can bring him back to the point he can enjoy reality again, give him a chance with the girl he's always wanted, and get him to a place he can feel clean for the first time in a long time.

 It always saddens me when an author I thought was good turns out to be...well, not so good. I was willing to forget about Anne Bishop's previous trilogy and go into Sebastian with her original Black Jewels Trilogy in mind.   This just was not a good book. It was not a fantasy novel, so much as a romance novel with some fantasy concepts. And they are interesting concepts, as Bishop's often are (although a bit confusing until you get far enough into the book to make the right connections). But she seems to have no idea how to truly utilize them. The balance between fantasy and romance is horribly off kilter, with romance winning out. It's your typical soulmates, meet-each-other-and-fall-in-love-without-knowing-each-other type of romance. The kind that makes my head hurt. If the characters were better one might be able to root for the romance, but they're not.  First is Sebastian, your typical dark, brooding bad boy with a bad past etc, etc. Now, I am as much a fan of this type as a number of other women, but Bishop has too many of them in her stories. While not entirely unlikable, Sebastian just isn't terribly interesting. Been there, done that. Making him a half-incubus really does nothing to add to his appeal, either. Lynnea is irritating as hell. I'm not asking for every female lead to be headstrong and tough as nails, but she's SO sweet and SO innocent and SO naive that it made me want to puke. And then, somewhere in the middle of Bishop trying to balance her elements, Lynnea turns into this tough little sex kitten. Huh? That sure came out of left field.  Some of the other characters are mildly interesting. Glorianna Belladonna (a nominee for Most Ridiculous Name Ever in the Fantasy Genre) is just like Jaenelle from the Black Jewels Trilogy: powerful beyond all others like her, hated and feared by almost every other person, an outsider who takes the burden of the whole world on her shoulders. The only difference being that Bishop actually goes into Glorianna's mind, making her motivations a bit easier to understand. Teaser, Sebatian's incubus friend, has the potential to be a lot of fun but that potential isn't realize. Glorianna's brother Lee is a source of some amusement, because the two of them have a decent dynamic together.  Overall, though, it was simply a mess, plagued by A Strong Need to Use Pretty Words: ephemera, aurora, sanctuary, belladonna, etc. Too romancy and slightly ridiculous, too. I'd read the second one (though I wouldn't pay hardcover price; nor did I on this one) out of curiosity. Which is more than I can say for her previous trilogy. But Biship will need to strengthen the fantasy aspects, spin deeper, more interesting characters, and write a romance that is actually believable. Otherwise I doubt I'll ever want to read another one of her works again 
 overpriced and overrated.  too many candid celeb shots - wasted pages that couldve been filled by more fashion spreads or images.  and i got really annoyed by too many images of his stark, boring homes. can anybody honestly live in places like that? so devoid of any kind of color or creativity that he brings to his clothes.  i am in love with tom ford as the next fashionista, for he is a great talent, but for someone who is going to put out a book about himself and his work - where are the pics of the countless people behind the scenes who helped propel him to his superstar status. maybe pics of him hangin out with the seamstresses, i dont know -- something that would show that Tom is indeed human...instead i thought the book, although did present some fantastic images of campaigns and such, was lacking -- straight runway shots are so boring - papparazzi shots of celebs are boring also - im sure there were arty photographers out there at his shows taking pics all those seasons.. i am glad all the image campaign ads were included 
 In reality, this humidifier is quite noisy. Even on the lowest speed I have to put it in the farest corner of the house so we can sleep. I don't understand why is it so difficult to balance a fan... This Humidifier is made in China by Kaz and Honeywell puts it's reputation in jeopardy by outsourcing to Kaz.  In addition, occasionally humidifier fails to start (probably fan gets stuck and I have to turn it by hand).  $8-$12 Filter gets mold in 2-3 months and needs to be replaced 
 I listened to a CD from the library.  Then bought the book, simply to get the one-time use ID code required to take the test.   For about 20 bucks, you get a quick guesstimate of your strengths.    I'm a bit disappointed, at the lack of direction, e.g.  Deliberative Ideation Learner Analytical Intellection...With only a small paragraph describing each strength.  If you are serious, I would suggest spending serious money.  For example, about 4 years ago, I paid $2500 for a psychologist to administer a full battery of IQ tests to my son (6 year-old taking 6 or 7 hours of tests)  For $2500 I received a 30 page detailed report on how to best teach my gifted son.  If you are looking for TRUE INSIGHT as to career change, I would think that you would be better off investing some real money.  Twenty bucks only gets you thinking about a journey, but provides little in the way of a road map.  If it happens to help you, great. To me, the book is more an appetizer than a full meal.  The website informs you that you can have additional guidance for about $2000.  If you have that kind of coin, I would advise you skip the book and have testing administered by a psychologist in your neighborhood, so that you get advice tailored specifically to YOU.    
 If you never grew up on Italian food or if you are not a Italian born, there's no way one can regognize the true authentic flavors of real Italian food. You can certainly try to immediate it, but its like comparing Leather to Pleather.   I see Mario multi talented in his huge glossary of fancy words that describe history and perhaps description of foods in a high ranking cooking university.   He is best suited somewhere in northern alps of Italy teaching Italian foods to the very elite and most sophisticated snobs who would be very interested in learning Italian Mario abstract-style and maybe paying a few hundred dollars for a fancy odd meal 
 When I started this book, a friend of mine said "He needs a new editor".  And I couldn't agree more.   This book could be called "Bonfire of the Vanities Goes to College."   It's pretty much the same book, but this time Wolfe skewers college students and athletes instead of investment bankers and radical ministers.   The characters all share the same "one-noteness" which seemed new and interesting in Bonfire, but seems forced and a tad boring in this book.   And he does go on and on and on with his descriptions.  What would be funny if done in a sentence or two (e.g. , the scene describing the gym habits of the basketball players) turns tedious after the third or fourth page.   The story was also predictable.   While worthwhile as a cautionary tale for anyone going or sending a child to college in this day and age, the same effect could have been accomplished in far less pages and with far greater success. 
 Should Martha Rules have included any information regarding her going to prison as a "business decision"? I would have been interested in reading about the pr strategy used in this "criminal spectacle" designed to make the question of Martha/Mdiddy's innocence a moot point. Are honest business practices being pushed to the side? By normalizing, generalizing, and minimalizing Martha/Mdiddy's crimes, are we loosing our morality? How important is integrity to a leader...former CEO of a company? Be "thoughtful 
 I was surprised how much this book was lacking.  It didn't even contain names that I considered to relatively common. Also, it only lists a name under its most popular spelling (under that lising it will give alternative spellings but still...)  I ended up buying a different baby name book.  This one just didn't cut it 
 I did not like this book. At all.  Lyanka and Gitana were both disgustingly perfect. Beautiful, talented, fantastic fighters . . . Mary Sues. Both of them. Ick.  The story was interesting, but I found that I just could not get into the book. The writing style seemed amateurish. It was a slog. I was on vacation, and I had nothing to do but relax and read. This is the sort of situation in which I go through a day. This one was so boring that I read it between other, much better books. I finished it mostly because it was a birthday present.  The only good thing about this book is the fact that there are many, many lines about Angel shoving Spike up against walls, which makes us slashers happy.  I've read better fanfiction. Don't waste your money 
 I hate the fact that this "group" has "made it" simply because some a-hole at the record company never heard of "Massive Attack." I swear I gave this album a good-hard listen: just me and a pair of headphones hoping for something new.  What I heard was a girl who has a good voice, but lends that voice to some of the dumbest recycled lyrics that I keep hearing over and over on the radio. (now, the radio isn't bad, but aren't you tired of hearing the same lyrics re-arranged to a different peice of music?) It also wouldn't be so bad if I didn't already love Massive Attack and never heard of them. SERIOUSLY go listen to "Mezzanine" From Massive Attack and tell me that Evanescence isn't HEAVILY influenced and to a point copying them. Don't just rip my review just because "I LOVE THAT SONG THEY PLAY ON THE RADIO" go get Mezzanine, sit in a dark room and just listen. You'll see that I'm right. also, the album cover? please. come up with graphics, or something. I hate ego maniacs that put their damn face all over their cover. 
 I'am unable to get this message to anyone.  This is the second book I orderd and both books are bad.  This one starting on disc #4 all is bad. I sent back the customer card and explained my displeasure but no one has contacted me.  I had the same problem on Vanishing Point, the cd left will not play on my player.  I will not order another book from You. Once I can see this happen, but twice is unacceptable 
 What a waste of money.  This book wouldn't even make a good short story.  It's a bunch of random thoughts, put together in a sort of stor 
 Pretty OK coffee. Nothing special, but I suppose its a fair deal for the price. We picked up the pack of 3 as an emergency stash, and it has worked well for that, but its not my caffeine deliver system of choice ;-) Of course, my coffee of choice is over three times the cost of this stuff, so the comparison is not very fair 
 As part of a $250.00 order, I ordered the Michelin France Provence map in English, and the Michelin 2006 Red Guide France: Hotels and Restaurants in English - both Items they sent me were written in French, which are of no value to me.  I requested a shipping label to return the map and the book and asked they send me the English versions. The Amazon Outsourcing Desk in India refused both request.  I requested an American Amazon Customer Service Manager contact me on this Issue.  That has never happened.  I am also being asked my Satisfaction on a 3d book - Markets Of Provence - which they never sent me.  The remainder of my $250.00 order were the English Versions, as ordered.  My Overall Satisfaction:  Well below the 1 Star shown.  Actual Satisfaction "F Minus" for all departments in Amazon and far less for their very poor Customer Service and lack of ethical follow-up for their mistake 
 As a dog lover and past owner of two dogs who will remain in my heart forever, I was disappointed.  Marley would try the patience of a saint.  Instead of being entertaining, the story struck me with sheer frustration. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal 
 I rated this a 2 only because it is not what I expected, I'm really not qualified to rate it's accuracy. This book is more a botanical treatise than I expected. Lots of artwork and diagrams for the person who wants to draw/paint the most accurate trees in great detail 
 The late Dr. Kelly is one of my all time favorite authors in the field of Church History (_Dictionary of Popes_, _Golden Mouth_, _Jerome_), but this foray into Biblical Studies, is quite disappointing.  Dr. Kelly merely retreads tired interpretations of what are three of the most overlooked but most interesting of the New Testament epistles.  The inclusion of 1 Peter with 2 Peter & Jude is highly dubious as well.  For really interesting writing on Jude & 2 Peter, I would suggest E. Earle Ellis' or Richard Bauckham's work.  There are many excellent commentaries on 1 Peter, too many to list.  I guess even brilliant authors have their off days 
 This one's easy.  The lies start showing up even in the book description.  "The Zionists established a sovereign Jewish state in 1948. Had they been content with that, peace might have followed the 1967 war, when Israel could have backed the creation of a Palestinian state in the occupied territories."  Actually the Zionists were willing to accept the tiny country that was initially Israel, but the surrounding Arab nations attackeed immediately.  After the 1967 war, Israel offered virtually all the so-called West Bank, but without East Jerusalem, back to Jordan.  They offered Gaza back to Egypt.  They did not offer the Golan Heights back to Syria, because they no longer wanted to be sitting ducks for Syria's artillery.  Israel's offer of the West Bank and Gaza back to Jordan and Egypt was offered at a price: recognition, peace and negotiation.  At the 1967 Arab summit in Kartoum, the Arabs responded to Israel's offer with No, No and No.  Israel had every right at this point to annex the territories won in a defensive war, but under pressure from the U.S. and elsewhere, Israel did not.  After the war, in 1967, there was no talk of a Palestinian state in the territories.  For 19 years Jordan occupied the West Bank, and there was no Arab or Palestinian clamor for a Palestinian state.  For 19 years Egypt occupied Gaza, and there was similar silence.  There was no reason for Israel to talk about yet another Arab state when even the Arabs hadn't talked about it.  The whole idea of a Palestinian state was a concept invented by the surrounding Arab nations to make war against Israel by a new method: public relations.  If they could make the world believe that Israel was an occupier of lands not theirs, they hoped world opinion could defeat Israel where Arab armies could not.  Nevertheless, in 1973 the Arab nations tried yet again, but were trounced, and the war by public relations started to ramp up.  In my opinion, Neuman's solution, "The only solution is for Israel to withdraw, unilaterally, to its 1948 borders.", shows real impoverishment of thought.  For almost 60 years the Middle East's Arab and Muslim nations have been trying, unsuccessfully, to destroy a nation that was recognized by the United Nations and which was purchased totally and legitimately from recognized landowners, but it is Israel which must surrender?  At the time of Israel's creation, Arabs who were residents and who had not decided to flee (at the request of the attacking Arab nations) were to be given full political rights, unlike, for example, Jordan (Transjordan at the time), in which Jews were not allowed to live.  In fact, although there is racism on the part of individuals in Israel, Israel itself is not a racist state.  It is the surrounding Muslim and Arab nations who are the racists.  In my opinion, Neumann's book, even if you consider only its Book Description, is trash in the spirit of the anti-Semitc Czarist forgery, Protocols of the Elders of Zion 
 Catholics thinking about purchasing this book should know that it is written and published by representatives of the break-away organization the "Society of St. Piux X," that the book bears neither an Imprimatur nor Nihil Obstat from Catholic bishops, and that its contents and commentaries are not necessarily conforming to Catholic doctrine 
 I am a Nikon fan I have Nikon 6T and Nikon D50. But about Coolpix 4600: All picutures are always blurred or atleast fuzzy. It somehow take decent photos of face and buildings(if they have strong straight edges/stripes) 
 After carefully researching as many rain recordings as possible on Amazon and reading all reviews I had hoped I had made a good choice with this CD.  Unfortunately I discovered that not only is the recording looped about every 60 seconds but there is an unmistakable low frequency rumble that is very apparent listening though my 5.1 system and my Bose Tri-Port headphones.  As a recording engineer I recognize this to most likely be a truck or car passing by and passing the sound up through the microphone stands that were obviously not de-coupled from the ground.  The bottom line is I hear this rumble each and everytime I start to relax and it renders the CD completely useless to me.  The recording is otherwise a good one and the stereo image presented seems authentic.  Since nobody else has complained of this rumble, I will assume that it will only bother someone with a trained ear 
 Hancock makes important points in this book: many aid projects do more harm than good, many aid officials are overpaid, too much aid money gets funneled to US companies (for more on this, see Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, by John Perkins), and publicly funded aid organizations are insufficiently accountable to the public. But his extreme rhetoric warns us that if there is a good side to aid, it certainly won't be represented here. Here's a sample of his accusations: "These lords of poverty are the druids of the modern era wielding enormous power that is accountable to no one."  On the one hand, Hancock's anecdotal evidence is unconvincing. He tells us that his often-chilling anecdotes are representative, but we have no way of really knowing. That said, he provides so many anecdotes that - by the end - we start to feel like they are, if not representative of all aid, at least insightful into an uncomfortable proportion.  But the litany of anecdotes is also tiring. The writing is not particularly great, and I felt that some of the analysis was flawed. (For example, in two places he argues that Western nations don't give nearly enough in aid, but most of the book argues that everything we give is wasted anyway. It's not clear how giving more would help, given his theses.)   Eventually I tired of simply hearing one aid horror story after another. He also misses the fact that there have been some major successes in aid, particularly in the realm of public health, in which organizations like the World Bank and UNICEF have played a part. (To read about some of these successes, look at Millions Saved by Ruth Levine et al.)  I'm glad I read the book, but I wish Hancock had made it a little less exhausting and a little more balanced. I also wish we'd gotten more solutions in the end. His only solution is to dissolve the aid industry (as it is "inherently bad, bad to the bone, and utterly beyond reform"), after which we have the vague promise that "it will become possible for people to rediscover ways to `help' one another directly." 
 Over the top attempts at wit seldom work, as this volume proves. I like dry humor, sarcasm and off the wall references, but this is just dumb 
 The best thing you could do for yourself is don't subject yourself to reading this adolescent book.  If buying just a small thing from Tiffany's and using the shopping bag as a planter gives you a thrill, then this is for you.  Not me!  Sorry 
 I could barely make it through this book.  I found a copy downstairs in my apartment building and thought it might be a nice read.  I enjoy knowing what people find meaningful in their lives.  This book is nothing more than a bunch of self-entitled snobs whining about their jobs.  I decided it would be best to throw this book away and top it off with my spoiled yogurt so nobody else would be subjected to this nonsense.  
 I am just sitting here reading this book, studying for a huge exam tomorrow morning, and I am just getting so incredibly frustrated with this book and decided that I should let it out on here. Oh my God, there is a mistake on like every friggin page... and to make matters worse, all the mistakes are right smack-dab in the middle of an example problem. So there you are, trying to learn how to work certain problems, and all of a sudden, there's something that just doesnt seem to make any sense. And the whole time you're thinking that you're stupid and you just cant figure out the correct way to do the problem, until a wasted-hour later, you finally realize... "oh, its just ANOTHER stupid mistake these idiots made, and i thought i was retarded." Grrrr, this is killin me.  I cannot freakin believe that they could actually charge $140.00 for a book no one even bothered to proofread. okay, so point of the story is... this book sucks, dont buy it if you can get around it, i'd recommend. 
 Rosemary Wells' book entitled Felix Feels Better is one of our family's new favorites.  I went to the book store seeking out more of her books.  I thumbed through this one and thought it looked really cute so I bought it.  It wasn't until I got home that I read the phrase, "Nora!" said her sister, "Why are you so dumb?" repeated several times in the book.  Name calling of any kind is not practiced in our house and I was disappointed to find this in the book.  This is also not a book that my son's teacher would read in class for the same reason.  I will be returning it to the book store.  Very disappointing 
 As someone who was absolutely blown away by 'Waiting' I anticipated loving this as well. I did read a pre-publication proof that I found used in a local bookstore, so maybe there were some big changes between the proof and the finished product, but I was very disappointed in this story. As a few other reviewers have pointed out, the characters are totally one-dimensional, and Jian, the narrator, is relatively uninteresting and one doesn't really care what becomes of him. Plus, while what happened to Professor Yang after the Revolution was horrible, i'm sure it happpened to many, many intellectuals, so it wasn't that out of the ordinary. Finally, and I don't know if this was in the final novel or not, there is a note from the author at the end thanking someone for 'seeing the potential for this when she first read it in 1988.' So, my fear is that this is one of those first novels that was rejected, and suddenly, when a writer has success (as with 'Waiting') their earlier work magically is worthy of publication.   Overall, not a great novel, but an interesting view of pre-Tiannammen Square China, and Ha Jin is a good writer, and 'Waiting' was SO good that this wouldn't stop me from reading something else by him, but i'd pass on this one if I were you.. 
 Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain. 
 This is horrendous movie. I will never claim it as the movie of my generation. It's one of the many reasons why I absolutely hate the "80's". The others are:Breakdancing, The Yuppie lifestyle,Power hungry businessmen/women, Women with manly handshakes, New Wave Music, and junk movies like this. I know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself, and what he can get out of life. He ridicules his friend because he's sick, and doesn't feel like driving Ferris around...especially in a Ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage, so what am I left to believe I have to wonder if this is where Ice Cube got the inspiration for "It Was A Good Day". I don't care what decade it was, or what was cool back then, or now manipulating your friends is "NOT" I repeat"NOT" cool. I know with John and Johnette Q. Public this is something of a sexual relase. I could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie, and I find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny. 
 There are a lot of really bad books on portrait painting, and this is definitely one of them.  If Amazon was giving this book away, I would not want one.  There is really no instruction to speak of in this book.  The style is also pretty boring, and lifeless.  The type of uninspired, realism, and bad painting so typical of American Artist magazine.   Instead buy any of the Charles Reid books, but his Natural way to paint is the best for portrait painting.   ...Okay, maybe I have been a little harsh.  If you took this book, and stacked it up with some other bad art books, you could angle your watercolor board, and paint in the style of Charles Reid.  So, I guess it isn't worthless, just not very good 
 It has been a couple years since I've seen this, and I can still honestly say that it's like watching a Andy Warhol movie of Salvor Dail puking.  A kind of swirly colorful mess, with Brendan Fraser and Bridget Fonda stuck in the ooze of ick, and can't escape it's yuck of a screenplay...On a positive note, Jim Carrey isn't in it. Other then that, nothing can redeem Henry Selick, Kaja Blackley, and Sam Hamm for this putrid monstrosity, and I mean that from the bottm of my heart 
 I loved Operation Ivy immensly so I was so disappointed by how lame Rancid is. This album is pretty lame and its one of their best. After hearing Tim sing on this album I realized why they needed Jesse as lead singer in Op Iv. Now Tim is in that horrible "Transplant" band with the lame Blink 182 guy. Not to mention he's friends with that loser from GOOD CHARLOTTE!!! And the new Rancid music is sooooooo poesur. Ugggggghhhh. Although some of these songs are catchy they are all non-political and non-offensive. A lame excuse for punk rock, I probably would have liked Rancid back when I used to listen to Green Day. 
 In the first 7 books, there was the same reader, now, with the mark, there is a new reader,  which is always a pain in the butt.  This new author also tried to imitate the accents of each person.  Not fun to listen to.  Add to this my opinion these books are nothing but poorly constructed religious porn 
 These shoes are hideous! Who would wear them? They are so uncomfortable. They always give me blisters! I hate these shoes. Do not buy them unless you like getting blisters 
 So much could have been done with this story, but was not. While this book shines at descriptions of political events, it utterly fails to give context a current reader will need, and by indulging in every whim of detail without giving as clear a picture as even would have been needed in the time, it inundates us with fragments without showing a convincing experience. I hope Woodward and Bernstein wrote better newspaper stories, because while I was compelled to read the content of this book, it was not a pleasant venture into highly repetitive, aimless description. Not sure I'd recommend this to anyone, no matter how many overpaid hacks call it a "classic. 
 Having seen the movie once I would definitely say that I will never come back to it again. May be I have overgrown this kind of movies. But still it is more for kids than for adults. It is a disaster if you compare it with the top French comedies with Belmondo, Richard, de Funes, etc 
 The Virgin Suicides starring Kristen Dunst, Josh Hartnett, Kathleen Turner and James Woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline. This film is directed by Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), I really tried to like this movie but I was fooling myself, you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the Coppola legacy but just because your father is Frances Ford Coppola doesn't mean you belong in the same category as best director of all-time. Sometimes magic does not stirke twice. How can all five sisters end up killing themselves, their homelife wasn't that unbearable, a lot of parents are religious, but that doesn't mean you'll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide. Kristen Dunst just gets on my nerves, her acting is the same in every film. Don't believe the hype, The Virgin Suicides is not a groundbreaking, poetic film 
 You can't beat the price for this very colorful atlas with lots of pictures and graphs that kids will like, but it has a major flaw in that almost every map is split by the tight binding.  Information is lost by being buried in the gutterless pages, which makes the maps almost usless.  Hopefully, future Scholastic (and other publishers') atlases will be designed with a map on one page and the graphs, pictures and info on the other.  We had high hopes for acquiring such a reasonably priced atlas for our library patrons to use, and were very disappointed.  It's a shame to waste such nice resources on poor layout 
 Glass has some good suggestions on how to rebuild your marriage after an affair,  however she made some very troubling comments in regards to affairs with ex's and/or "Old Flames".  Some of the comments almost seem to encourage affairs with Ex's.  Her are a few examples: 1) Page 34 - If the old flames reconnection results in marriage these unions are highly SUCCESSFUL?  How can she describe an adulterous affair that destroys a marriage and family SUCCESSFUL? 72% of rekindled romances stay together.  If they were 1st loves, the stay-together rate is 78%.   2) Page 130 - "There is a 60 % divorce rate in 2nd marriages...unless you are marrying an old flame from your youth.  The chapter notes state that the old flame marriages had a 72% stay together rate. Chapter 15 talks about giving up and the steps to take to have a smooth divorce. Not a good chapter to read if you are trying to save your marriage. 
 This is one of my favorite PKD books, so as far as a review of the story itself, it is incredible.  A must have for every seeker in the cosmos.  Now, having said that, I bought this edition, and was saddened deeply that it is unreadable.  There is a huge portion of the story which is missing altogether, (perhaps 10 - 15 pages?), and in it's place is some modern political essay about the European economy.  A publisher's mistake, I'm sure, but I can't have the only one like this.  If you can find a different edition or version of this book, then by all means buy it.  Then it would be 5 stars rather than 0 stars.  
 I wanted to read something "light" but the characters were too simplistic and lacked depth. The story was predictable and the plot presentaton was choppy.  Comparing this book to others where, I believe, friendships were the main theme, this book lacked substance 
 I actually saw the advert for this work on Sean Hannity's home page - "The Turth about Hillary" (sic). The spelling probably tells you all you need to know about Mr H and the book. If you seriously wish to learn about real politics, the issues or US political system, this book will not be of use. If you believe that Elvis is still alive, then it is possible you may think it a worthwhile read.  It does however show the appalling state to which US politics has fallen. Most debate is at playground level and this book shows that in clear detail. Free speech is a privilege, not a right, and I will defend Mr Klein's privilege; but that does not mean that I think he is accurate or that I agree with him. I would ask if he would allow me the same courtesy? He certainly would not allow it of Mrs C 
 I loved this magazine in 1995, until a few years ago.  They have changed editors a few times and now it is not even worth reading the ads.  No new information.  Glossy pics of models with bright red lips.  What is about health here?  Get Life Extension magazine and Alternative Medicine Magazine.  They've changed too over the last few years, but still a far sight better than this one 
 OK so was I the only one that thought this novel was depressing?  I found the characters to be weak individuals and all frightened of each other; they have to tiptoe and walk on eggshells at every turn.  Who has that many regrets and self doubts about EVERY SECOND of their lives?  Not the enjoyable summer reading I was expecting.  Do not bother with this one!!  If I could this would get zero star 
 Spend your money for some other DVD. If you're interested in watching this movie, just rent it 
 I really love the genre of memoire, and I do read a lot of them.  This book, however, failed to meet its mark with my on several accounts.  I felt that her spiral into addiction was really self indulgant at times, and that it just led to nothing for the book.  I think, really, this would be a much better short story than a book.  Her beautiful, yet redundant writing, about how long her addiction lasted, the brothals she served, her views about it, really made me wonder what the author wanted the reader to carry away from this.  I think that is the really self indulgant bulk of the story.  Maybe if there were more of a resolution at the end, it would make up for all of the beautiful gore she presents the reader.  I doubt it though.  Frankly, I'd have liked to know more about her loving family that really helped her and stood by her throught all her trials.  I think a memoire from their point of view would be more productive.  I felt mostly sickened by this sad account of herion addiction and sprial and love affair with prostitution.    If this would keep a person from trying herione, then it's worth that.  But as a well rounded, quality memoire, there are so many better than this that have more to offer. 
 While this book had an OK beginning, the imagination and original creativity of the book quickly went out the window.  There is a scene where a thief is being hung, but his friends just waltz on by and free him from  execution...not a bad idea, but I saw it first in the movie "Robin  Hood: Prince of Thieves".  And then the readers discover that the  thief has a distinct personality which is none-too-subtlely ripped-off from  the thief Silk in David Edding's books.  I am abhorred that TSR actually  published this book which barely retains a shred of true originality 
 Having read All the Pretty Horses, Blood Meridian, and now The Crossing, I feel a little compelled to comment.  I got through 3 of McCarthy's books because the writing technique is very good. The imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid, and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take, but in retrospect, this book was awful.  The book should have been titled The Crossings, because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into Mexico three times, each time for a less compelling reason. I almost expected he'd make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove. Each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey, and while McCarthy's writing is good, it's not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips.  The 3 books I mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with Mexico. McCarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture, until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession. For McCarthy, Mexico is the land where the upright, brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty, slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food, or test his manly mettle with their perfidy. Referring to Mexico as a "negligible republic", and comments about being "nigger-rich" make McCarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability. A McCarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a Ralph Lauren model.  Another tendency of McCarthy: extended pseudo-philosophical monologues by wizened codgers. The pathetic thing is that the protagonist's response to these windy metaphysics is usually, "Uh huh. Well, gotta move long now."  If you have to read McCarthy, read Blood Meridian, and plan on skimming 
 Echo & The Bunnymen, are one of those bands (like My Bloody Valentine or Depeche Mode) that everyone tells me I am going to like, but don't. I am a huge fan of a lot of 80's brit-pop (The Smiths, The Cure, Aztec Camera, etc.) but these songs just don't compel me. I will say the guitar playing is excellent and these guys really gel together as a band, but the melodies are not exceptional and the songwriting lackluster. Maybe this is not a good place to start or maybe I am too young (or old) to "get" this band, but I have to be honest: Not impressed.  
 I have long had the desire to read a Grisham book, because I have heard good things.  Well, my chance came and I was sorely disappointed.  The audio cd's were on sale at a truck stop and I decided to get them for The Chamber.  The opening to the book kept me going, but by chapter three, I had already decided this, "If Sam Cayhall lives I'm going to be mad because I get furious about hate crimes, and if he dies, he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the "hero" to the story."  Sadly, I pursued curious about the ending.  I'm very glad I got the cds instead of the book, because it only took six hours to get through it.  Sure wish I had those six hours back and the money invested so I could try a diferent author.  Mayber Grisham's other books are better, but I won't be reading them 
 The title of this book is misleading.  to call it the new male sexuality is quite the statement and one would thinkit encompasses  all forms of male sexuality.  This is not the case.  I totally agree with writing a book concerning straight male sexuality but that should have been a subtitle to the book.  The doc chooses to simply ignore bi and gay men as if they didn't exist.  This is not the new male sexuality.  Male sexuality is much more then five to eight minutes in the missionary position.  Straight couples these days are experimenting with new ideas and techniques.  The penis is only one component to the overall male sexual make up.  there are other areas to be explored as well.  If you want the straight nuts and bolts I guess this book will do but if yu are an adventurous male, look elsewhere 
 This book is okay for an organization trying to funds for businesses and such. The title of this book was misleading to me by saying (Everything Series). I was looking for help for an elderly family on a very limited income who needs major home improvements. This book has not helped me in finding them the help they need at all. A little disappointed!!!!!!!!! 
 The only good thing about this product is its price (I saw it being sold at $160 on some other site). There are several shortcomings though: - The greatest drawback is the complexity of the menu. There is no 'home location'. Also there are only two navigation options available - shortest time & shortest distance. So if you are caught in a traffic jam for example, there is no 'detour' function. Also, you cannot see the next few turns when you are navigating. Hence you cannot plan if you immediately need to turn right after a left or vice versa. - The maps are probably very old. I used this device in NJ, VA & MN. In every state, I faced problems multiple times, when the unit did not know that the road bifurcated ahead & it would not tell me to keep on left/right, or it would ask me take turns when there were none.  - The unit was very slow in calculating routes (I dont know how the Sirf Star III chip helps). Also it would freeze often & I would need to reset it at critical junctions. - The viaMichellin website is only dedicated to Europe. When I went to register my product, I had to register it in viaMichellin UK, since there was no option for US! I dont think they have any support for the US models. - The POIs are very less compared to other competitors within the same price range.  I returned this product after trying to make it work for 2 months. It was great on part of Amazon to accept it even after expiration of return policy (although they deducted 20% restocking fee). 
 Austen-improvisers can keep trying, but I've yet to read anything really worthwhile by any of them. If you enjoyed this story of an independent, talented young woman living in a historically difficult time, I'd recommend just about anything by Judith Merckle Riley. Historical detail and well-drawn, completely original characters put her books at the top of my list of favorites 
 Having really enjoyed Happiest Baby on the Block, I thought this book would be helpful too. I was so turned off by it, I couldn't even finish reading. Dr. Karp is pushing evolution in explaining why toddlers behave the way the do. I just couldn't take it anymore. 
 I want my money back. I feel like a burned a hole in my wallet. The only songs I like on this CD is Hero, Shelter, My Nutmeg Phantasy, Farewell, and Main Titles but the others suck and most of them aren't even Spiderman. Shelter is a great song it's from Fast and the Furious and it's also in the movie in the part where Peter wants the money after he wrestles Bones but the reason why I like the song is because it's from The Fast and the Furious and that's a great movie. The CD cover was great to look at it even had images from the movie including a cool 3D Spiderman cover on front but from what I got when I listened to it some of the songs weren't even in the movie it's just songs that some dude really wanted money from Sony and he just put the Soundtrack in stock but main reason why I got it is because I really wanted to listen to the themes from the trailers like Hell Above Water, Pompeii, and Leave You Far Behind but they weren't on there including the World Trade Center theme it wasn't on there too but still I'm warning you Spiderman fans do not buy the soundtrack but if you really loved the score go buy it I own it and listen to it all the time it's great but please do not waste your money on this soundtrack stick with Danny Elfman's amazing score. Spiderman 2 soundtrack is way better than this piece of crap CD. 
 I honestly have to say that this novel was not very satisfactory. The basic premise was quite interesting, but the overall execution seemed fairly amatureish. Most of the sci-fi touches in particular were pretty laughable. Wilson's "The Philosopher's Stone" was much better 
 Margaux with an x is about a young lady who seems to have it all. Beauty,Popularity and can do about anything without getting into trouble at home. Yet she is not happy she holds a dark secret that happened to her when she was young.She is tired of every boy drooling over her and wanting to date her and most having no content to them.  She has a gambler as a father and a mother who just watches television all day. Her life takes a different turn when she meets Danny. He is the total opposite of all the guys she has dated. He is a year behind her in high school he is thin and is not shapely, yet they both start a bond with each other. The book was interesting but after awhile I got tired and could not keep up with the constant bantering and sarcasm of the main characters 
 The book could have given you the message in half the pages. I found about ten pages of really good information but a lot of fluff as well 
 I felt this was a highly disappointing and unsatisfactory book about an 8-year-old child who has autism. Kristy, the 13-year-old protagonist in this story baby sits Susan, whose autism is so severe that she does not communicate meaningfully. She has an extraordinary gift for music and can reproduce any song she hears on the piano. She does not play or interact with others.   Other kids soon learn of Susan's musical prowess and charge admission to hear her play. They exploit her talents until Kristy intervenes. Susan can also provide any given date and her mother explains that Susan once saw a perpetual calendar which sparked this interest.   Parts of the book reflected antiquated attitudes and misperceptions about autism. Kristy looks the word up in the dictionary and the definition provided was that it is a form of schizophrenia or withdrawal from reality. Autism is NOT schizophrenia and people with autism don't necessarily "withdraw from reality." Indeed, people with autism often feel bombarded with outside stimuli and develop coping mechanisms to "come even," that is to tone down the sensory onslaught that is so much a part of the autism experience. Suggesting that autism is in any way, shape and form related to schizophrenia has proved very costly to people with autism. Sadly, this kind of thing has caused many people with autism to be misdiagnosed. This in turn has led to many inappropriate treatments and placements being inflicted on people with autism! This kind of thing does not help anybody and has harmed many.   This book is not meant to be a diagnostic tool, but I wish autism had been defined in a more accurate way.  Rest assured, autism is NOT a disease but a neurobiological condition that affects sensory integration and communication based on the individual.  I for one am good and tired of seeing characters with autism being portrayed as having savant abilities. That only applies to roughly less than 10% of the autistic population and I can't help but wonder if this story just reinforces those stereotypes of people with autism to the neurotypical population. Same old tired tune, just a different performer.   To the author's credit, no promises are made. Susan is by the close of the story enrolled in a residential program for autistic children. I did feel the story was extremely weak. I also wondered why Susan was sent to a residential school as opposed to a day program in her area.   Read Ann M. Martin's "Inside Out" instead. That is a much better book by this author about a child who has autism.  At least James is a Beatles' fan 
 I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the "extremely difficult themes" and "brilliant artistry" of the play 
 Almost half of this book has nothing to do with using Quickbooks, and the half that talks about Quickbooks instructions is shallow and almost useless. Every time something confused me when I tried to decide how to use the Quickbooks features, I looked it up in this book. Half the time there was no information, and the rest of the time the information was less helpful than the instructions that appeared on the Quickbooks screen. I ended up calling my accountant so often, he told me buy a book. When I told him I'd already bought this book, he told me to buy the other bestselling book on Quickbooks , which is the one he used. He was right 
 I bought a paperback that included both "Of Mice and Men"(OMM) and "Cannery Row."  For me, "Cannery Row" seemed like it was not written by the same author. Whereas OMM had me in its grip, even though I have seen several movie versions, "Cannery Row" left me asking just what was so great about Steinbeck anyway?    I just think whereas OMM is a timeless story (the story of two guys, one smart, one not-so-sharp but innocent, trying to make a buck will play out forever), "Cannery Row" just doesn't seem to withstand the test of time. Yes, Steinbeck has some nice still-relevant social comment about the impact of the automobile and how the traits we don't admire in someone are the same traits that can make one successful. Howver, outside of that, the story was just a mediocre character study.  And therein lied the problem for me-too many characters I had no interest in.   I have to side with the other reviewers who suggest Steinbeck's other work in order to absorb the full wonder of this man.            
 I bought this for my pilates class and in middle of my plank my feet slid right out! Very dissatisfied, socks do not have enough elasticity to stay in place.  I much prefer the yoga socks where each toe is apart from the other. I would not recommend these for anyone 
 This review is being written by a patient of Whitaker Wellnes Institute, a subscriber, and a customer. Dr. Whitaker has revised most of his books except for this one.  After Tens in print this book is ready for Revision and Expansion.  Buy it used if you must have a copy.  Then wait for the revision 
 I bought this for two reasons: because I wanted to learn about LBOs, and because I had heard that the journalism was good, and was hoping for something like 'The Right Stuff'.  The cover of my copy blurbed 'unflawed' writing, and 'all the suspense of a first-rate thriller'.  The last is true only if your expectations of a first-rate thriller reach no higher than Michael Crichton.  The writing is a plodding 'you are there' journalism-school pastiche of the New Yorker: Gulfstreams are sleak, CEOs are silver maned, side-kicks are bantams, lawyers look like they model for GQ, etc. Investment bankers bark, curse, are struck by inspiration, work off grudges and wave their lingams around at the sort of comic book level Stan Lee would scorn.  I finally realised, after slogging through the first 200 pages or so, that 'Barbarians at the Gate' is, in large part, essentially porn for aspirational middle managers.  There is no-one in this book whom I would want to know, unless I were a sociologist.  But I don't even trust the sociology, because the psychology is so superficial.  I did learn something about the process of LBOs, and for that a star is in order.  I didn't particularly enjoy learning it. 
 if there was ONE original thought in this book, or even the same old thought presented in a unique way, i'd have given it two stars. as it stands  this book is a collection of the most vapid, common sense cliche concepts covered in every mediocre self-help book ever written.  if you've never read a self-help or pop psychology book before, this might read like groundbreaking stuff.  for everybody else, everything in this book has been done to death a hundred times...go out and apply what you already know, take some action - your time will be much better spent than in reading this stuff.  AGAIN 
 Perhaps its my own fault for even reading this to begin with, but I have never felt worse after reading a book ... it's one thing to read about the facts and figures and 3rd-person experiences, but this book contains so much of the author's own experiences that I just felt kinda sick afterwards having been immersed in the mindset that wants this stuff. Maybe that's her point, but ugh, I feel terrible. 
 I bought this because my 8525 eats batteries and it's nice to have one charging while I'm using the other--you don't have to be tied to a wire to charge your phone.  So I also bought one of Boxwave's batteries for the 8525.  Well, the spare battery charger will charge the Boxwave battery just fine, but it refuses to charge the battery that came with my 8525.  This really limits its usability as an off-line charging device.  The cradle itself plugs into the USB port on the phone, which was not designed with cradling in mind, so it's not easy to get the thing lined up to use as an actual cradle.  Since the camera button is on the bottom of the phone (who's idea was that anyway?) it almost always gets pressed while I'm wiggling the phone in or out of the cradle.  This is just a bit of nuisance it just means you have to quit the camera application every time you put it in or take it out of the docking station.  Anyway, just my opinion, but it's actually easier to connect the standard USB charger to the phone than it is to put it in the cradle, so I'd recommend save your money and just sticking with the standard USB charger.  If you really want to do all charging off-line you may need to buy two Boxwave batteries instead of just one 
 Do you love to hear spoiled women talk about how hard they have it with thier maids, nannies and how you should dress like them, eat like them, and reform your style of thinking to be exactly like them...THEN THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU! Super annoying Darla Shine spends 90% of the book telling us how fab she is!!! She tells you how other people repulse her because of the way they shop, eat, act, and dress then goes on to give such handy tips as you can wear sweat pants as long as they are tight?!? She also seems to have some pent up agression towards the television show, desperate housewives, taking the title as a personal insult. Darla is most definitly desperate but a housewife...no not really... SAVE YOUR MONEY and call the meanest most shallow woman you know instead. 
 I am really looking for feedback here to see if anyone else agrees with me. I feel so strongly about some of these points that I wanted to call or write the editors (the John Ordover person or whomever took his place.)  The Tezwa books are not science fiction. They are war fiction. These are books about people fighting a way that is obviously very much like Iraq. We have here a war book and the only science I see is better technology and a few feathers.   I have read about 500 trek books; I have a mania. I am a deeply disappointed fan.  War is bad. War kills. Administration and presidents are corrupt. Innocent people get framed. I got these themes in the books. These themes are not new; they are in the alternative news media every day. I don't agree with the Rodenberry "no conflict" premise and the premise that Earth is the garden of paradise. We know about section 31.  So know we reveal that starfleet top top people are not the generally benovelent folk they appear to be. We have gone from no conflict at all (well, mostly) to the Nixon administration (or Bush, but I don't want to get into that).  What the hell happened to star trek?  If I am going to read a war book, and I don't want to, I would read one with characters who are fully developed. These trek characters are pretty flat, save a nasty father here, a dead nephew there, a pushy mom, an emotion chip. Does this pretty much sum up these characters? Troi has dark and she's real pretty and nice. Ok, I get it. Blah, blah blah.  I don't care about Beverly and Picard. There never WAS a Beverly and Picard. It's been 20 years. Get over the Jack death already.  Crap or get off the pot already.  THE women characters are the most flat. We don't even know if pretty Trioi has a job at the Titan or if she is just following her man. Didn't  she go through the command thing and order a person to his death? Did she have to take command when Picard was elsewhere in the ship coping with little kids?   Actual dialogue from our scene where the star-crossed lovers pledge their undying love after 15 years or so. From a Time to Hate page 250. Just the high points:  "I can't bear the thought of living without you!"  "Marry me, please!"  "You are too important to let slip away!"  "We were meant to be together from the moment we met!"   ,,,Will took Deanna into his arms, all (other thoughts) banished. All he saw was her beautiful face. He heard her breathing, the rapid rate of her heart. ...His eyes twinkled and he went down on one knee....she didn't reply, she just looked up and kissed him...  All this built up leads to this. After Riker says on TV, "Don't forget, dear, that Tom Riker is still me and you might still get your pretty little heart broken, you of the rich dark hair and rich dark eyes."  This is the dialogue of an earnest  high school girl writing her first romance novel when she is done with her poems about flowers and kittens. This is a truly so bad Strange World submission that the editor's eyes hurt.   This is the finality, the high point, the resolution of the push-and-pull 10 year crap or get off the pot resolution of two leading characters.  O'Brian and Keiko have more real relationship in one scene of DS9.   Should I dare suggest that all this results of war and earnest hearts and flowers the result of a committee of only men? Of male writers who don't have a clue? I have no idea, but if it walks like a duck...  Here we are in the age of we-have-evolved perfection, both in trek and decades after the women's movement. And the women characters, as someone else pointed out, are from the 1950's.   OK, I am blathering.  Permit me to go though the Kubler-Ross stages of mourning.   Am I the only one who feels this way?  It coudda been a contender.  
 I bought this book and then did some background checking on the author. Seems Mapes's PhD is from a "diploma mill" - a phony and now defunct outfit that purported to be "San Moritz University," but is really just a printing shop. In fact, San Moritz is one of a group of unaccredited "universities," many of which were closed in an ongoing effort by the FTC. Since San Moritz claimed a UK address, it is not a recognised body as described by the UK Education Reform Act either. San Moritz was famous for giving out academic qualifications, transcripts and phoney reference letters to anyone, sight unseen, just for a few bucks. Do a Google search on San Moritz University, and you will see what I mean :-) 
 Maybe it depends on the car, but I couldn't get it tight enough in my SUV to prevent the dogs from knocking it down.  It also probably depends on the dog.  If the dog really wants to get past it, they will.  If you have a more mellow dog who will be satisfied with a "psychological barrier", this would be ok.  Oh, and as a previous reviewer mentioned, the "trombone" style sides slide easily back and forth, I had to get some hose clamps to keep them in place 
  To be honest, I do pick up this Mag from the Newstand 4 to 5 times a year, but I can hardly call myself a fan. If you are looking for a solid computer or tech mag, Wired is not for you, It tries too hard to be hip and trendy, but it's group of Left/Lib Nerds too often come off as being lame and borish.  Wired needs to be "ReWired" to meet the needs of the modern tech community 
 I bought this as a would-be Christmas gift for my grandson.  I tried it first and unlocked the door using the code given but was unable to re-lock it.  After several attempts to lock the box, the lock jammed and would not turn in any direction and the door would not lock.  Needless to say, I returned it and am presently looking at other options 
 This little book is really a "coffee table" book for those who enjoy these kinds of compilations, but don't expect much from this one.   Each page has a very short line about "why a daughter needs a mom..." i.e., "to read to her," "who can play on her level," "to listen closely to what troubles her," etc. etc.     I found nothing overly moving or memorable here, in fact, the black and white photographs accompanying each of the 100 Reasons do nothing to bring these pages to life.  Most photos are clearly contrived portraits of "everyday-type" models posing to reflect the sentiment on the page.   None of them look spontaneously photographed to capture a feeling or a moment.  I'm assuming that the author, Gregory E. Lang, aimed at tearing at the heartstrings, but I'm not so sure it was accomplished here in that you'll find very little originality and even less to keep you turning the pages to read more.  By the time I got to Reason #100 (...because without her she will have less in her life than she deserves) we are pretty much bored and will think twice before giving this book as a gift.    I'm both a mom AND a daughter, and I normally love these kinds of books, dedicated to capturing the feelings and sentiments behind family bonds, but this one just doesn't hit the mark.  Save your $ 
 While this book put together by the Detroit Free Press has action photos, they are some of the most disappointing pictures i've ever seen in a book about a team's season. Where are the photos of Tiger players actually hitting a baseball? If you want to see photos of players celebrating and covered in champagne, talking to fans and media and blowing bubbles, then this is the book for you but if you want to see some actual fine baseball action shots from the diamond itself, be prepared to be frustrated. I much preferred the photograhy in the George Cantor paperback "Out of Nowhere" The Detroit Tigers' Magical 2006 Season. I know that this volume covers the Play-offs and World Series whereas the Cantor book doesn't, but it's photo collection is poor, the photos in the Cantor book are superb. If you are a Tiger fan you may enjoy this book very much, (the writing and articles are quite good at least)but my enjoyment was spoilt somewhat by hardly any pictures of Tiger players hitting baseballs or fielding grounders etc. Very disappointing, worth only 2 stars 
 Williams' claim is that all porn is not the same, but her book title is very specific which would lead one to believe she will make claims about only hard core and not about the attendant debates over all of porn's place in society.  You have to be suspicious when the majority of reviewers of an academic book have not graduated high school.  I can barely get my university students to read academic writing 
 I really like Thomas Moore's books but this one was definitely not one of his best. I found it very boring and it was kinda one of those books that just made no sense at all. I found it hard to continue to read the whole book even tho I did... 
 Admittedly, there aren't many books devoted to the LA river so we have to make do with what's available.  Unfortunately, if you're looking for an in-depth historical biography, this certainly isn't it.  Entertaining, maybe -- a big maybe.  The text is so lightweight and airy, I half expected it to drift away.  The Blake Gumprecht book is more thoroughly researched and thought out, and a much better choice 
 It is authors and books like these that continue to show that there is no evolution in the novels put out but white wolf...they only want action, no character development or originality, is really very sad. You want a good fanatsy book...read someone like Sharon Shinn, Glen Cook or Mercedes Lackey and steer clear of  poorly written amateur books such as this one 
 I really enjoy watching Tyler Florence on the Food Network, and the other recipes of his that I've tried from the Food Network website have turned out well. However, I've just finished making the Arroz con Pollo recipe in this book, and I'm so annoyed that I had to write. The cookbook really could've used more careful editing. The rice to liquid ratio was so off that the rice ended up a gloppy mess. I know I shouldn't have followed the recipe blindly, since if I had stopped to think about it for a second, I would've realized that there was no way that the proportions were correct, especially when compared with the Arroz con Pollo recipe on Epicurious.com. What's even more frustrating is that the flavors of the dish were excellent, and the dish had the potential to be outstanding. Thus, I'm wary of trying another recipe in the book, but if I do, I'll be a lot less blindly trusting 
 Not particularly interesting or funny. None of the ridiculous turns of language of a Dave Barry column, no elder-statesman crabbiness like Andy Rooney's. Just routine bitching about airlines, office supplies, and so on. Save it for "A Walk in the Woods" or "A Short History of Nearly Everything 
 I miss the shows like "Roco's Modern Life," "Angry Beavers," and "invader Zim" (Which is all right because that show is already on DVD). I want these shows to be on a disk 
 I was looking forward to this book; I had grown up with the comedy of Sahl, Lehrer, Freburg, Cosby and the others.  I was unable to finish the book, primarily because of many egregious errors of fact that Nachman and his editor allowed to pass into print.  I list here a few of the problems that I found with the chapters I read:  In the Introduction, re: Allan Sherman, Nachman mistitles  "Shake hands with your Uncle Max", calling it "Shake hannds with your Uncle Moe"; he also erroneously attributes the original tune of the parody as "McNamara's Band"; it is actually a parody of a tune called "Dear Old Donegal", also called "Shake hands with your Uncle Mike"  Re: Tom Lehrer, he titles the song "MLF (Multi-lateral Force)Lullaby" as "MFL  Lullaby"; and later claims that Lehrer "set his `Elements' to the tune of  [Kurt Weill's song from Lady in the Dark] `Tchaikovsky'"; in fact "The Elements" is set to Sir Arthur Sullivan's song "I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major-General" from The Pirates of Penzance.  In addition, Nachman incorrectly transcribes and alters the order of the lyrics he quotes to "National Brotherhood Week":  It's national Brotherhood Week National Everyone-smile-at-one-anotherhood Week It's only for a week so have no fear Be nice to people who are inferior to you Be grateful that it doesn't last all year   (Nachman's  text)  Actual lyric:  But during National Brotherhood Week, National Brotherhood Week It's National Everyone-smile-at/One-another-hood Week Be nice to people who/Are inferior to you It's only for a week, so have no fear Be grateful that it doesn't last all year.  Re:Stan Freburg, he attributes the source of Freburg's parody of "Rock Island Line" to Johnny Cash; actual source is a version of the song recorded by Lonnie Donnegan and His Skiffle Group, a popular English band  Re: Freburg's parody of "Sh-Boom"; Nachman calls Freburg "an engineer [presumably the recording engineer of the faux-recording session at the heart of the piece] screaming for more mumbling"; in actuality, Freburg's character on the recording is that of the lead singer of the group making the record  Re: Freburg's parody of "Rock Island Line", he states that " `Rock Island Line'. . . ridicules the whole precious folk-song craze ("Are you going to sing this or read it?" asks an irritated Freburg) [Nachman's italics]."  In the parody, this question is actually asked by a character played by the actor Peter Leeds, a Freburg "repertory company" member for many years, who in this case is, in all likelihood, supposed to be either the producer or the recording engineer for the "session."  Re: Freburg's Lawrence Welk  parody, "Wun'erful, Wun'erful"; after describing the confrontation Freburg claims to have had with Welk over the piece (where Welk denies ever having said "Wun'erful, Wun'erful"), Nachman states: "Decades later, to Freburg's everlasting joy, Welk titled his autobiography Wonderful, Wonderful."  Which misses the entire joke, of course, since Welk's autobiography is actually titled Wunnerful, Wunnerful: The Autobigraphy of Lawrence Welk.  How any book, presumably edited and published by professionals, could have this many errors (and who knows how many more in the sections on comedians whose lives and careers I was not as familiar with) is beyond me. 
 If a story doesn't hook by the middle of Chapter 3, there are other books to open, books that kick in by PAGE 3, thank heaven. I bought TIME BOMB because the reviews on the jacket made it look fast and thrilling. I could not even finish chapter 3. I'd read something once by Jonathan Kellerman that made me remember him as a reliable author of great escapist fiction. I can't remember what it was.  *sigh* I don't see where these rave reviews are coming from. The book is so boring.  Also, the racist meanies I saw lurching up over the horizon, as well as being hackneyed and ho-hum, were unrealistic. Even the meanest harshest republican white adult male doesn't picket a school in a high income neighborhood shouting "wetback" and "greaser". Not even in wacky California, I shouldn't think. 
 I have ordered the items twice and still have not received it by now, because your shipping department have problem to provide the correct mailing address to DHL. 
 I received this product in the open state. Box was open. I checked inside to see if anything is missing, nothing was missing. My doubt is whethere the ink set will work properly or not. I cannot test it because I bought it to gift to somebody. I cannot return or replace it because I don't have time. Shipping sucks. 
 The author attempts to paint some trends from haphazard internet-related happenings. His intent seems to be to say --  The internet changes _everything_, becomes a social leveller. Youngsters are making big changes not just in inventing new things, but also new processes, new paradigms, and oldies feel endangered and rightfully so.  He uses stories like a kiddie making big stock gains and being investigated by SEC, another being a freelance lawyer and making it big fast, yet another writing programs to napsterize everything.  He indicates "flattening" of normally hierarchically defined relationships in society and corporations, and has this concept of "insiders" being unseated by "outsiders" due to the ease with which radical new ideas can be imagined, developed and brought to market, thanks to the internet.  There is some truth to his observations, but the few examples he quotes may not be sufficient to determine a wider trend. It is of course true that the internet gives "access" and "freedom" renewed relevance. I like to think of it as "digital democratization" of society.  
 I purchased this particular french press two months ago.  I was delighted, as it stated that it was 'top rack dishwasher safe'.  However, despite diligently following those precious directions, the press came apart without any hope of salvation as I went to press my coffee.  The beaker was fine, but the broken press left me with a nice cup of sludge.  Something that feeds such a vital addiction as the morning cup of coffee should not fall apart when one needs it the most 
 Since the reviews printed on the inside cover of the book all are blurbs, here are my blurbs:  "Really hard to get into ... tough to follow who's who ..."  "Opens strong, but fizzles out early ..."  "I literally feel asleep while reading this book one night ..."  "You'll finally give up without really wondering who did it ... 
 I thought this book was going to be a wonderful improvement on an 800 year old ideal, modernizing it to fit a less hostile and disgusting world. I was wrong. If you're against republicans and war, this book will infuriate you like it has done to me. Don't pick it up if your morals are not Christian conservative, do yourself a favor and find another mentor. I'd recommend anything by Gandhi or the Dalai Lama.   I give this book two stars only because the author presents his viewpoint well enough to be useful to those that agree with him. The rest of us were at a loss picking up this book 
 I read this book after watching the brilliant movie version of "The Hours."  If that's your motivation, don't waste your time.  My English teachers will cringe when I say it, but this book, well, sucks. It may well be great literature, but the characters are not engaging, and if it was Woolf's motive to out-do James Joyce in chronicling a day-in-the-life and in writing a stream of conscious narrative, she doesn't pull it off.  Again, the characters and the internal mental life simply don't have the power that "Ulysses" has.  Reading Woolf is necessary for a good eduction.  I recommend, however, that you read "To the Lighthouse". I may still be motivated to read the book version of "The Hours" given how great the movie was.  But my taste for Woolf is all done now.   
 Decent starting point for cooking-impaired college students if they don't mind eating eggs and potatoes often.  A little more variation in the recipes would be nice as well as some pointers on how to substitute ingredients and an explanation on why some ingredients do (What is the purpose of using cornstarch?  I know, some of it is common sense, but heyyyyyyy.... I'm a stupid college student). For example, for one recipe for frying chicken, I used pork and it tasted fine.     Also, some of the recipes don't really work.  Baking chicken drumsticks at 375 degrees in the oven for 40 minutes is not enough for thoroughly cooked chicken.     On the upside, the cooking tips were really helpful.  The book could use more of those, like be aware that if you heat oil, it pops and it could land on your face or burn your arm.  Overall, this book provides some ideas, but I wouldn't rely on it too much.  Not really worth the purchase.  Flip through it in the bookstore like I did and save some bucks for uhhh.... buying food. = 
 One of the very best TV dramas ever made, enjoyment of it is almost totally ruined by appalling picture and sound quality. I have no idea what "digitally remastered" means, if this is the result. It's a disgrace to charge almost $250 for a product this inferior. I actually thought my copy was a bootleg, made by some bloke pointing a digital camera at a TV screen -- it's that awful. There is also a constant "shadow" track on the audio, which sounds as if someone has a radio on in the background. Just disgraceful. Avoid 
 This is by far the most stupidest book ever written. I think most reviewers have already said what there is to say. This book is about HATRED and nothing more. I also read the author's review on the "Journey Of Man" here in Amazon, where he said 99.5% of all the arts and music came from Europe. As a historian I can only laugh at this statement! - Asian countries like India & China were the cultural centres of the world. India is the bithplace of language and music. It is from India where Europe learned that it is a good idea to have a bath more than once a year!! This man surely knows nothing about history and this book proves he knows nothing about science either!  All human beings were black once. Our color differences come from adapting to various climates. And if this man hates black people, he is not a human being!!!!        
 keith rehashed not new?  what is this coming so wack you sound like you are lost.  Love your earlier work.  Going to see your show tonight 
 I've been a fan of Heinlein's SF for just about as long as I've been an SF fan at all (somewhere around thirty-five years). But when I read this collection some twenty-odd years ago, it nearly turned me off to the old man altogether.  The fiction is pretty good (although even that isn't Heinlein's best). But to describe the nonfiction accurately, I'd have to use words that Amazon will remove from the review anyway.  For the most part, the pieces collected here represent a side of Heinlein I strongly dislike. Though I respect _Starship Troopers_, it's never going to be my favorite Heinlein novel no matter how many times we quibble over the precise definition of "fascism" -- and I'm not going to have much respect for the nonfiction in this collection.  And mind you, it's not because I disagree with Heinlein's opinions; it's because he gave bad arguments for them and called other people nasty names when they differed. Some of the stuff collected here is tendentious to the point of being propagandistic. (At least in his fiction, he was able to create characters with points of view that differed from his and get into their heads well enough to present them sympathetically -- in short, to grok them. Not here, boy.)  Heinlein (who bought into the Korzybski/General Semantics fad pretty early on) spent a lot of years dismissing philosophers as tailchasers who derive their premises from their conclusions. But his own attempt at philosophy, as represented here in e.g. "The Pragmatics of Patriotism", is very nearly the worst writing on ethical philosophy I've ever seen.  Then, too, people who knew Heinlein report that despite his overall gentlemanly demeanor, he could be pretty churlish toward people who disagreed with him. Well, he's certainly unpleasant here; anybody who doesn't agree with him on the need for massive nuclear buildup is dismissed as a poltroon or a custard-head. Even in the unlikely event that I thought he were _right_, I wouldn't find this a very helpful approach.  Perhaps more surprisingly, his popular writings on _science_ aren't very good. Asimov's reputation as the "great explainer" is in no danger here.  This volume is second only to _Grumbles from the Grave_ in cementing Heinlein's posthumous reputation as a rather mean-spirited fellow whose fictional characters were generally much better company than he was. When I want Heinleinian company, I'll stick to D.B. Davis, Manuel Garcia O'Kelly Davis, and (maybe) Lazarus Long.  And when I want to read some humane nonfiction by an SF master, I'll still turn to Asimov. I credit Heinlein with three magisterial novels, several imperfect-but-great ones, and a good number of brilliant short stories. But the stuff in this book should have stayed in his drawer 
 True or not, I can't help feeling that ANGELA'S ASHES has destroyed a generation of Irish/American writers (or any writer wanting to write in the field).  Not to say that CARRY ME DOWN is ANGELA'S ASHES all over again, but I can feel its ghosts tucked between Hyland's spare, plain, beautiful, yet graphic writing style.    Haunting is a word that will pop up time and again as you read the book, and it is a haunted book to be sure. The last time I actually got this involved with a character and their moods and feelings was with Will Perry in Phillip Pullman's A SUBTLE KNIFE, so, why the low score when all it seems I have nothing but praise and teaspoons of surgar for this novel... well, there are some problems.  As good as the prose is, it still comes across like a play with all the stage directions wedged into the story trying to pass itself off as legitimate fiction - it's not.  Everything is stark, sharp and literal.  Cup. Table. Chair. Fireplace - you name it, it all reads flat on the page and never sticks in your mind.  Some of the ideas do.  The subplot about being a human lie detector, the struggling and desperate end to a marriage and the breaking of the family unit, it's all done very well.  But then there are the triggers and emotional landmines that cheapen the deal.  The fate of the kittens being the most grevious, and sore thumbed.  It's a brutal scene, and pulls at your heart - not because it's so well written, but because it's murder most foul, plain and simple.  I could ring tears out of that scene in any novel, no matter the subject, so when I read it here it really felt like a scene Hyland had floating around in a journal that got transplated into this novel.  And while the dialogue was well written, and often sharp, it tends to sound flat inside your head.  Almost like you've walked into the 1,000 performance of a play, and the actors hearts are tired of the material - it's colorless, humourless and dry... but still compelling in its decay.  It's a tough novel, one that I wanted to love every time I turned the page, but by the last page I simply could not love it as a novel, but could find some heart for the process and art of it trying to be a novel.  CARRY ME DOWN comes across like a work in progress, much like its lead character, and as he develops we hope the novel will as well, but it never does.    It ends without ending, much like life itself 
 I love the FIRM workouts, and I love the instructor Allie, so I was so excited to try this new workout.  I was unfortunately extremely disappointed.  This workout was not complicated, but it also wasn't much of a workout.  I didn't get my heart rate up at all, and didn't break a sweat.  Some of the moves are just not very good, and having to repeat them everytime we add on got really annoying.  The disco part was my favorite, but overall, this is a workout that I can honestly say I would rather have the money then the workout.  I will keep it and periodically do it on a VERY light day or in addition to another workout, but that's just because I have it.    I've tried a couple other of the new FIRM workouts that are more worth the money...this one I am sad to say is not. 
 This "movie", which was obviously meant to be a pilot but was aired as a stand-alone feature, lacks nearly everything that made Babylon 5 a great show. It's set in the same universe and contains the same races and ships, but the plotting feels like, well, a failed pilot.   G'Kar's scenes in "Rangers" are an embarassment to the character. After a spectacular sendoff on the original B5 series, he re-enters the universe apparently having regressed two or three seasons' worth of character development. There is no reason for him to be present except to spout off some gratuitous quotes from Babylon 5 and remind us that we are watching a B5 show.  Overall, this show would be without much value if it stood alone. As an episode of the B5 mythos, it is worth even less 
 So this page-turning thriller was on the best-selling list for a gazillion months and put Catholic and fellow Christian faithful in a defensive uproar. I'm fairly well read and, yes, I've earned a few bucks with my prose. I'm also a sucker for historic tales, ancient folklore, mythology and Old Testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits. OK, I decided, now that it's in paperback, I'll give it a read. What I concluded was this: Those who found The Da Vinci Code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that Brown's work is a literary steaming pile. I read page after page, waiting for the moment when I would start to give a rat's ass about The Da Vinci Code's protagonists. What a bunch of twits. Langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology (I don't know if I spelled that right, but I'm not about to go back in that book and check it). Apparently, there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that Langdon's books sell better than Brown's, entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status. Sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly French chick who's easy on the eyes -- someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn't a dipwad like Landgon. She's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough, but she's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most French probably couldn't tolerate it. And then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic British snob Teabing. From cradle to some approptiately haught estate near (but, of course) Versaille, this memeber of the Royal Lucky Sperm Club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a Euro. So he's been free to pursue his fascination with Bigfoot rumors about how the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and those cool Holy Grail Knights from the third Indiana Jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that Jesus made a baby girl and God had originally intended women to be in charge of everything. Or something like that. Oh, I forgot, Teabing's crippled so I should feel bad about talking bad about him. Anyway, this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do -- make lofty, self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag. The point is that these characters aren't very approachable and Brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy Christian faith as we know it. Hell, it's been more than 100 years since Darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution, yet the Christian faithtul still pack churches around world. But back to how bad this book is. Trite doesn't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase. I would give you some examples but, like I said, I'm not going back in there. One of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when Langdon and Sophie meet up with Teabing in his metrosexual parlor. By now, Sophie and Langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times, been on the run and are exhausted. With a straight face, Brown describes how Sophie's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by... crumpets. Yes, crumpets. Hell, Teabing, shut up about your conspiracy theories, roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat. Offer Langdon a stiff drink. I sure needed one at this point. By now I'm pulling for the albino. Then they escape the jaws of death yet again and, naturally, high-tail it to England on Teabing's private jet. I hoped maybe Teabow would turn back upon discovering he'd left his Grey Poupon behind. I stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the Albino wasn't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists. I don't know how it ends. I don't care. However, there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the History Channel and Discovery. Who knows? You might like it. This is just my opinion 
 This story is full of surprises, which really made me want to keep reading. In one point of the story Palmer tells the "gang" that he does not want to become a wringer. This surprised me greatly because I thought that Palmer would become a wringer so he could keep his friends. I learned to always show your feelings and don't do something that you don't want to do just to get friends. I recommend this Fiction-Horror genre to readers of all ages.   
 O'Leary made an honest effort to provide insights into the mechanics of apocalyptic reasoning. Moving from definitions of apocalypse and rhetoric, O'Leary extracted three basic topoi: time, evil, and authority.  By means of a case study of the Millerites and Hal Lindsey's writings, O'Leary gave  the three topoi a home in the tactics of persuasion of Miller and Lindsey.  Though the subject matter is a timely one, the book does not appear  accessible to everyone. This scholarly written book includes intense  philosophical and literary discussions and presumes one to be acquainted  with rhetoric.  However, for the scholar who can follow the flow of the  argument the application seems rather trite.  Yet for the layperson the  application seems of utter interest but the discussion of methodology and  the foundational presentation of apocalyptic reasoning seems beyond grasp 
 "The human race today is in a really bad state, mainly because most people do not want to wake up. They want to be told how to behave instead of understanding their own power." -- Miceal Ledwith in The Great Questions in the Hamburger Universe, Vol. 1 of Deep Deceptions  I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD "What the BLEEP Do We Know!?" mostly for the engaging snippets of dialogue from scientists, theologians, and mystics. I also enjoyed Ramtha's DVD "Create Your Day", even though it wasn't quite as good as the BLEEP cameos.   It was with great expectations that I viewed The Great Questions in the Hamburger Universe, Vol. 1 of Deep Deceptions by Miceal Ledwith. Unfortunately, the plodding pace of the 57 minute DVD--as well as the ramblings of Ledwith--was very disappointing.  Ledwith brings up some great points in this DVD, but never goes beyond the surface. He asserts that thinking people have discarded most of the infantile tenants of the "hamburger universe" (i.e. the "vault of the heavens" overhead with the vault of hell underneath). Yet, instead of treating his audience as intelligent folk, he makes nebulous comments without explaining the "what and why".  He mentions string theory (quantum physics) and the "true" nature of the big bang, going on to say that levitation isn't a "miracle" but only a matter of superseding gravity with the "Torsion Field". The problem is that he's tossing about these terms in support of Jesus' words that "ye are all gods" and "greater works than these shall you do" without actually explaining the meaning or *science* of a Torsion Field and just how consciousness supersedes natural laws. (FYI: The Torsion Field is quantum spin waves of empty space. Einstein and Elie Cartan did some preliminary work on this theory in the 1920's. The Einstein-Cartan theory could possibly be used to explain ESP, among other things.)  Ledwith spends a good portion of the DVD highlighting the silliness of traditional Christianity, including the clouds and harps of heaven. He goes on and on about how a cloud is, in reality, damp and would be uncomfortable to sit on (duh) and that if one were to play the harp for eternity, they'd wear down the fingers to the third knuckle. I understand highlighting the damage that traditional Christian thought has caused humanity, especially in terms of evolution. In fact, as a former minister trained in theology myself, I probably "get it" more than most.  But while poking fun at Christian thought is popular these days, you had *better* have some theological and scientific claims to back up your assertions--especially if you want to be a part of the "thinking". Christian apologists know their Bible inside and out, so if Ledwith wants to undermine their fear-based, illogical ideas he needs to do so with his supposed area of expertise...THEOLOGY. Heck, even at a simplified level, all one has to do is consider that if an individual set a paddle on fire and repeatedly hit a baby with it over and over and over, this act would be considered a barbaric tragedy condemned by Christians (and others, of course).   Yet, God the Father would do much worse by condemning humanity to eternal torment forever and ever? Apologists would say "Well, humans CHOOSE to go to hell." The interesting thing is that the Bible says "no man can come to the Father except the Holy Spirit draws him" because his understanding is "darkened".   This is just one of the many points that Ledwith could bring up, but instead, he preaches to the New Age choir by ridiculing monotheistic religions (primarily Christianity) via nebulous assertions. In fairness, Ledwith makes excellent points, but nothing that you couldn't get (much more eloquently) from Marianne Williamson, Gary Zukav, Eckhart Tolle, Neale Donald Walsch, and others. Some of these points are:  "We are pawns tossed about by those people we perceive as more capable and enlightened than us."  "If Jesus were on Earth today, he wouldn't recognize his own teachings."  "Anyone who looks back at our history can only be appalled at the small-mindedness, the hostility, the barbarism that has characterized our whole traverse as a race."  "We don't realize how following another's image of God is spiritually and evolutionarily limiting. We don't even think of it."  "The flat earth mentality still corrupts and completely distorts our fundamental beliefs at the basic level still today."  "We've never gotten rid of the Inquistatorial mind to this day."  "The answers we've been given by religion are bizarre, emotionally charged, and childish."  "Heaven varies according to the broker (Christian denomination), but the basis is pretty much the same: earning credits for good behavior so you can immigrate to heaven."  "God is just a human magnified (in monotheism). We take these categories from the lowest plains of existence and impose them upon the Divine. As a result, we're left with something so sentimental, mawkish, and inaccurate that it bears no relationship to reality."  "Whatever God is has no gender. These childish images are holding us back."  Ledwith makes other interesting comments, but they beg for elaboration. One such comment is:  "(That) Jesus' death was to appease the vengeance of a savage God...this had NOTHING to do with what Jesus Christ did."  I'd love to hear his explanation of the crucifixion! Spiritual teachers such as Williamson have brilliantly explained the metaphysical aspects of the crucifixion of Christ. Does Ledwith have a clue as to why Jesus died? If he did, why didn't he share it?  He quotes Jesus by saying "greater works (than I) shall you do", attempting to make the case that humans are living far below their potential--mostly due to a flat earth mentality. What he fails to mention, however, is that polemicists and theologians debate the meaning of "greater works" (meizona toutn in the Greek) in terms of whether "greater" refers to quantity versus quality. (My Greek professor made a case for the former, saying that converts would multiply miracles by sheer numbers.)  Ledwith also perpetuates the biggest misquote circulated in New Age circles, attributing "It's not our weakness that frightens us, it's our power" to Nelson Mandela. The actual quote is "Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure...", which was uttered by Marianne Williamson in her book "A Return to Love".  One of Ledwith's comments that I found particularly insightful is "As human knowledge grows, the territory of God shrinks. God becomes a refugee." The "God of the gaps", as he called it, are areas that we try to fill with human knowledge in the attempt to explain what we don't yet understand. An example would be ancient paganism attributing lightning to the actions of Zeus. Despite this interesting observation, it's not enough to enliven the rest of the DVD.  What separates the tight, insightful segements in "What the BLEEP Do We Know!?" from this DVD is that the conversations captured in BLEEP were the result of directors Chasse, Arntz and Vincente ASKING probing questions of the experts...questions borne out of the directors' own curiosity and personal paths. On The Great Questions in the Hamburger Universe, Vol. 1 of Deep Deceptions, however, Ledwith is left to ramble at the camera rather aimlessly, which doesn't make for good viewing and does not offer lucid alternatives to the flat earth mentality of the hamburger universe. Perhaps this is more the fault of "director" JZ Knight.  In the end, I couldn't help but feel like this DVD was thrown together in order to capitalize on BLEEP's popularity. Let's hope the subsequent installments of this series are tighter, deeper, and smarter 
 The movie was trash. And this revival isn't much better. I saw the original both in Workshop at the Public in NYC and 5 times at the Shubert. AND ... this new revival though I give them all credit for trying ... it just doesn't cut it. There isn't any magic in the mirror. Ed Kleban ... are you rolling over in your grave??? Someone wrote that the arrangements et al were pretty close to the original. Not! There is just something missing here in this production. Perhaps it's the fact that everyone is trying to mirror ... er ... create (re-create) the original. Perhaps it might have been better had they had  felt less restricted (in creating a historic theater fable) and had more freedom to get up the energy, drive and passion A CHORUS LINE must have to tell all the stories. 
 I am a long time beer brewer, who suddenly decided to switch to cider. This book starts with planting trees. I didnt want to wait that long. I wanted recipes! The section on yeast was a real disapointment, it listed one yeast not to use. Elsewhere I have read of the debate over English Ale yeasts or Champagne yeasts. This was the info I wanted. If you have NEVER brewed this is your book. If you have ever brewed and want to make a batch skip this one, get Paul Correnty's "Art of Cidermaking". Yes its out of print and runs nearly $50.00, but its worth it 
 After 9/11 happened, I didn't have the stomach to read (or listen to) Stupid White Men.  With the fifth anniversary of 9/11 arriving today, I thought it was time to look back at how we looked before we were attacked.  I have great respect for Michael Moore and had high hopes for the book.    Alas, I was very disappointed.   The book opens on its high point -- Mr. Moore's excellent characterization of how the first W. Bush "election" was stolen.  In the recounting of the "accomplishments" of the administration, you'll be fascinated to know that many of the areas where spending is through the roof now were originally cut back . . . such as areas related to national security.  After that, the only other good section was the one about how racism is based on false beliefs about African Americans rather than personal experience.    For the rest of the book, Mr. Moore indulges in creating "solutions" that have a surface validity for someone who doesn't know anything about what he's describing.  If it were just humor, I would laugh.  But the "solutions" seem to be seriously intended.  For instance, the Middle East will become peaceful if Arabs learn to emulate Gandhi and use non-violent protest methods.  Really?  I wonder if he even knew that there are two groups of Muslims that are routinely waging war on one another.  In other places, I think he was trying to be humorous . . . but it didn't work well enough to be funny.  For instance, the book "humorously" describes the solution for creating peace in Northern Ireland as having all of the Protestants convert to Catholicism.  It just didn't seem funny.      Mr. Moore also prefers to look at every issue from an economic class point of view.  I felt like I was listening to neo-Marxism in places!  Unless you don't know how the first W. Bush election was "liberated" in Florida by Jeb Bush and his compadres, you can skip this book.  You'll think more highly of Mr. Moore if you do 
 I LOVE some of Harry Crews' work so this came as a real disappointment.  It seems designed to work as a sort of anti-establishment fable, and some of the characters are typical of Crews' better work.  But this book lacks the heart and the careful plotting of the better books.  It's almost as if this is self-parody, a kind of Harry Crews-meets-Soylent Green.  I don't suggest this unless you are a committed fan 
 I don't even remember why Brazilian Duos was recommended to me here on amazon. Perhaps it is because I enjoy Bonfa, Deodato, Gilberto, Gismonti, Nogueira and some other Brazilian musicians that amazon's computer decided I would probably like this as well. I don't. I bought this several years ago and listened three or four times before deciding to shelve it. Then recently, I listened again hoping to find something I missed. I didn't. It remains underwhelming. There is nothing special in her voice, in the music, or in the arrangements. Despite that I am more than willing to try something new, I just can't find anything on this CD that inspires me. I'm not saying its bad music, I'd rather listen to this than a lot of other music that's out there. All I am saying is that it doesn't speak to me! Perhaps there are other Luciana Souza albums that I would like more, but after my experience with Brazilian Duos, I would have to hear them before buying 
 The author belies a hostility towards his subject early on in the book by referring to him as "Charlie" as though he was the cop on "Bad Boys" who had caught the guy in the video who had obviously  done something which gave him the right to speak condescendingly to him.   In Clark's own mind Olson has become an unworthy father who he has to beat  down.  Wierd !  Totally misses the point of Olson's art which is that each  page is different and a unique attempt at truth.   Shows too how the  Thruway West (oh Gunslinger) has obliterated belief in an actual earth of  value. Which Olson's actual text does manage to keep alive 
 Amidst all the tirade and rhetoric, cold hard truths emerge: the way IPRs are framed, especially those pertaining to the biotechnology field, is biased towards the interests of multinational corporate entities, and that the current mechanistic gene-centric paradigm in the "life" sciences ignores holistic perspectives of lifeforms and nature which are useful in their own way. While the urgency and potency of the message is not in doubt, the presentation of the content, with all the sidetracks and rambling discourses, leaves much to be desired. Read this book with an open mind, don't take everything in it too seriously, and look up alternative sources of information as well 
 I only have used this about 8 times for just my husband and myself.  I took it out yesterday and the temperature knob fell off in two pieces in my hand.  Then I noticed the handles are all cracked and ready to come apart.  VERY DANGEROUS.  This gets very hot and if lifted it would cause a real problem 
 Everyone knows that the rapid increase in real estate sales prices isn't sustainable.  People searching for a book like this want more information; this book doesn't deliver.  Good data presented in a readable manner is a difficult undertaking for any author.  This author didn't do the homework 
 anybody who is a true 2pac fan will understand that this album would leave 2pac rolling around in his grave. 2pac would never have worked with artists like eminem or elton john and what is even more sickening is the clear distortion of his voice to fit in with eminems beats. These are not songs that 2pac would have ever produced himself, does not even have a familiar 2pac feel or vibe. Anyone purchasing this album is only making eminem richer and defaming 2pac's legacy as far as I am concerned. People who disagree should listen to 2pac's original albums and then understand what i am talking about. This album is an embarassment to somebody as great as 2pac 
 Rather than write another review here, I will instead include the letter I was compelled to write to REA when I purchased this book:  I am writing to express my deep disappointment in your Physics Subject test GRE study guide. I found its review section inconsistent and incomplete, and the sample tests utterly failed to match the tone or content of the real exam itself.  As for the review section, it was disappointing enough itself. Your Temperature section spends its entirety discussing the different units used to measure the property. THIS IS NOT GRE MATERIAL. If a senior year physics student cannot change between Celsius and Kelvin in his sleep, I assure you, he has no aspirations of continuing study in the field. Frankly, he does not even have any business doing so. The rest of the Thermodynamics section suffers the same failing. The three laws of thermodynamics are the starting point for any college level thermodynamics coarse, yet they close your discussion of the topic. This book fails to purvey any of the complexities of this broad, interesting, and very difficult field. There is no mention at all of statistical physics, which is an entire branch of physics which is on the test. While this thermodynamics section was the worst part, there are many problems in the rest of the book. Optics ray traces are ambiguously and inconsistently labeled. The book does a poor job of differentiating equations that are part of a derivation from those which will be encountered on the test. There is no mention of inductance in the electromagnetism section, though I encountered this topic several times in actual tests (both practice and real). Impedance is also not mentioned in the circuits section. The quantum mechanics section is cut short with no mention of any of the kind of material that would be encountered in a second course, such as spin, angular momentum, and electron transition rules. Again, these are on the test.  Further, your sample tests did not match up well with my experience of the actual content of the test. The GRE is not designed to be a test of student's algebra. Numerical values are very rarely given for the relevant properties in a question. As such, students are tested based on knowledge of equations and unit analysis kinds of rules-of-thumb. However, your sample tests included numerical substitutions in most problems, and thus tested algebra abilities heavily. Students are not allowed calculators at the test, so time spent on calculation is wasted. In fact, I found that ability to test formulaic answer choices by unit analysis was one of the best approaches to novel or difficult problems. Had I relied heavily on your book, I would not have learned this.  I'm sure I could catalogue more important subjects that were missed, and find more confusing notation. Frankly, though, I do not have the time to waste with this book. Please realize that I understand that compiling the entire subject of physics in a single volume is a very difficult task. However, in order for a book to be worthwhile for GRE preparation, it must be much more complete and better organized. I consider this book a waste of my $28.95 and the valuable time I could have been studying more useful resources.  I write not to ridicule or be combative. There are not many physics GRE study guides available, and a good one would be tremendously helpful to those preparing for this difficult and stressful test. The inclusion of practice tests with explained answers is a great idea. This book does have potential, but it is not a good resource as of right now. It most certainly not "The Best Test Preparation for the GRE." I suggest a full review and rewrite of this book. I trust that, with some work, the REA can put out a study guide that is truly helpful to physics students. Please consider my encouragement to do so.  Thank you for your time 
 Simply, a terribly written book.  It has a shallow plot, flat characters and no style.  His descriptions of people are often late, and tend to consist of someone's skin colour.  And that's all.  The story moves ok at first but degrades into the most uninteresting chase/camping trip in the history of the world.   The ideas presented are soft, touchy feely sort of "the soul is love" type crap.  Seems like it's a rip off of The Celestine Prophecy, which isn't something anyone should want to rip off in the first place 
 Would you stand in line at an Applebee's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good---maybe better---at a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes?  Of course not!  Why, then, would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two James Patterson books, or a Patterson and a Connelly, or two Thomas Harris books...my apologies, Greg Iles, but for a simple, formulaic serial killer book, Blood Memory was just WAY too long.  The book has two co-plots; one involves a serial killer who murders older men, the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead.  The serial killer plot is actually the more interesting, but at least two-thirds of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the "secret" is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book.  All in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if Iles---or his editor---had chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text.  Iles just LOVES to have two characters sit and talk for 3o, 40 or even 50 pages, but since most of his dialogue is what I call "soap opera" speak, meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths, these chapters dragged on and on and on.  Iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream, taking showers, and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely.  Come on, Greg; why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it's some strange, exotic treat that no one's ever heard of before?  Just as some people love to hear themselves talk, I think Iles loves to see himself write...and although some of his books have been quite good, Blood Memory misses the mark by a long shot 
 These outdoor window thermometers SEEMED like a good idea,  however, they're worthless!  The LCD display is NOT bright like shown in the picture.  The numbers are so light they are totally unreadable.  Also, the suction cups will NOT stay stuck to a cold window.  I'm returning them 
 I love 70's horror movies like the exorcist and The Changeling.  This movie is so stupid, I turned it off half way through.  It's poorly acted and not in the charming way that so many older movies are either.  I would suggest renting it before you buy.  I just don't know what other reviewers saw in this.  
 Too much dialogue. Too many characters. Too much information. I put it down too often, and it took me a long time to read it,  which is not a good sign. Every character was eating; the sister with the biscotti, the doctor with the peppermint stick, the ex hubby with the popcorn - it was his writing style just slapping me in the face and too obvious.   
 No thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story.  The whole thing is based on who wants to kill Darby and why. And that is where it falls apart. The FBI or CIA could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could, and what is the point of trying to kill her?  To bury what is already out in the open? The FBI, CIA and White House all had a copy. What are they trying to silence? Nothing at all. Perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself 
 Some women  might term this a horror novel due to subject matter; at fifty, Lu expects The Change, not all the changes she finds herself facing.  Her new editor is a snide, condescending, not sweet young thing; her husband wants to trade her in, and one night of passion results in a baby.  Abortion is never even considered as Lu handles all her challenges and changes with aplomb and humor.  Her experiences bring new love and new chances to help others facing difficulties.   Through it all, she laughs to keep from crying, giving new definition to the term midlife crisis.  
 A careful reading of this book compared to your favorite Bible verses  about the Personage of God shows how misbegotten is the whole enterprise to  refashion deity into a palatable, preferable,processistic being with little  resemblance to the Biblical God of Truth. If you're looking for a finite,  multi-present, penultimate, quasi-eternal, reductionist deity, you've come  to the right place. No matter your position on process or openness or  free-will theism, as Clark Pinnock once said, 'theological novelty and a  high view of Biblical authority do not fit well together'. 'use of process  thought cannot be explained in terms of Biblical reflection, but in terms  of the influence of secular modernity.' What God hath been wrought 
 It is because of this book and the other books James Fetzer wrote with his dishonest pack, that people have lost so much interest in the JFK Assassination. Honest authors like Harold Weisberg and David Wrone attract less attention because they only published what they could prove and not what they dream up. The Z-film was altered, many know this, the Warren Commission published it in volume 18 (18H1-84) with frames missing. In case you don't know this, that counts as alteration. Z-film tampering was not to the extent that Fetzer claims such as painting Jackie's face on the film itself. The film was not stolen, or doctored up in anyway. No one would be dumb enough to take that risk 
 One of the worst films ever. I don't know why such a movie must be made. May be studios don't know how to spend their money. Sharnon Stone's character as a mother is very, very riduclous. It isn't worth watching even one time 
 As many reviewers have indicated, this book is not nearly as good as Patterson's earlier works.  Is it possible Patterson now employs a ghost writer?  For people who enjoy thrillers, his first few books are fun. Don't bother with recent ones, though 
 This book was extremely short, relying on large type and large margins to fill the book. It was devoid of any real plot and left me with a bitter taste. It was typical of "Oprah Book Club" books in that it is very depressing. I think this could have been a great book had the author expanded on the topics and built out the characters more fully. You did get a sense of the main character, but with such a short book, the rest were very weak.   
 Yum...play food! This is a great set. I will buy it as soon as I find it. This is a great set! Lots of cans (good for storage), ice cream, boxed treats, cookies, (yummy), and of course, much more. And who could resist the spaghetti with meatballs? And is that chocolate chips on the ice cream? Oh my gosh, it's better than I thought. You might think that to have a good time, your child needs 40 dollar Melissa and Doug wooden play food with real cutting noises and a Fisher Price 100 dollar kitchen for imaginative play. Bullpies, I say. I have tons of dollar-store food. I have ultra-realistic foam food from a kitchen set I got. I prefer the dollar store food. Dollar store food is better because it has more in one package, looks real, is cheap, pretty durable, and looks nice. I have a really silly play food set that came with a stovetop (small, but the knobs turn!), a pink and purple propane tank, a can of "barracuda" (seriously), and a can of "barracuda hash" which included barracuda, ham and eggs, chicken, turkey, potpie, and more eggs. But the logo has spam and a hotdog, and the front of it has beans, turkey, fish, sausage, and lots of weird meat. But it says "Eatable, 100% dainty, Present!, Daintiness, Dainty". Just wanted to let you know.  So, bottom line is, dollar store play food is much better than you think it is. It comes with lots of things that the expensive companies would never have dreamed of 
 Wow.  Star Trek literature is simply not what it used to be. This book lacks any of the science fiction excitement that made the series itself or the better books readable. This is a collection of subpar stories slapped together to drain Trek fans' pockets, on the logic that we will buy anything that has to do with Star Trek (true enough for me in the case). Not one of these stories is memorable or compelling; they just don't feel like Star Trek.   Avoid this one and spend your money elsewhere. 
 The plastic threads were stripped after taking the unit off the faucet once!  A very frustrating product!  Do not buy 
 im usually a big fan of the 80s music (thats when MTV used to play videos )the 90s decade was musically ruined by garage bands that couldnt sing for ****.   quite to the contrary, the 90s had some decent songs .... its just not featured on this box set (whatever 
 When "Pearl Harbor" came out three years after "Saving Private Ryan", I was hoping for a similar dramatic blockbuster that infused admirable and likable characters into an action-filled, heart-tugging, and well-directed/produced movie.  Instead (and how can I articulately put this?) well, quite frankly, it sucked.  The acting was extremely poor in the lead roles (Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale).  Even with the number of high-quality actors in it (i.e., Jon Voight, Cuba Gooding Jr., Alec Baldwin, Josh Hartnett, etc.) they were not enough to save this film.  The special effects, however, were quite remarkable and one of the few bright spots in this cinematic bummer.  Unfortunately, these first-rate effects didn't make up for the awful acting 
 i saw this and bought it from qvc because they raved asbout how it moisturized thick curly/kinky hair. it didn't do anything for my hair and i didn't like the smell (but its not that big of a deal)--i returned it. i don't think its for coarse-kinky curls, but maybe for others textures.    <for coarse 'naturals' try carol's daughter's healthy hair butter and khoret amen line 
 Who lives outside in barns, begging for food? Well, in a book called The Midwife's Apprentice, Alyce, aslo known as Dung or Brat does. Since she is starving, she asks people for jobs she can do. Aluce finally convines a midwife, called Jane, to give her a job. Alyce also tells Jane if she works, she wants food in return. Jane agrees to the deal, and that's when Alyce journey begins.   I didn't really like this book since it was boring. Even though the book was dull, I think Karen Cushman did a good job of expressing emotions of the characters, like when boys called Alyce names. I also feel a connection to the book. When Aluce didn't do an important assignment, she felt ashamed. I  feel ashamed when I don't do something important properly. Karen Cushman has also written other books like Catherine Called Birdy. Really, I wouldn't reccomend this book to to anybody since it was boring. But I think people could learn from the moral of the story: which is hard work pays of.   
 This film is among the worst, most pointless, and most inane garbage that I've ever had the misfortune to view. Contrary to popular belief the alien was not cute he was CREEPY! The little boy was extremely annoying, and his relationship with the alien made me ill! Actually it made me more than ill, it was down right disturbing! His bond with the alien was one of the most freeky thing I have ever had to witness, and the kids family was just obnoixious. By the time the alien go home no one really cares anymore. You are just relieved that the film is finally over. Watch it only to say that you've seen this. 
 I was really looking forward to this book because part 1 was so good but this book was a bore and very disappointing. 
 Let me sum up this software "total junk"  Pinnacle will give you one free support phone call for help, then $25 for the next call.  They give you free email support, but answer everything but your problem.   They try and blame it on Windows XP, and will have you reload Windows.  I owned Studio 8, and it worked fine.   Went to Studio 9, and had a few problems.   Upgraded to Studio 9 Plus, and after a week of trying to make it render my projects with no sucess, and crash after crash, I removed it from my machine.  They sent me an offer of their all new 10.5 plus upgrade, Hollywood FX, 3 of their Premium packs, and a hat that says Studio 10 on it.   This said that the program had been rebuilt from bottom up.    This program should be called "Crash after Crash", and the only thing that works is the hat.  If you feel the urge to waste $100, and hours of your time, just buy this product.  Look at the reviews on Studio 10, and the other Studio products, and most only have one star.   Out of over 100 reviews over 95% had one star.   I found one with 5 stars, but looking at the reviewers other reviews he is obviously an employee, or share holder in the company.   He wrote a 1 star review on a Sony competative product, and 5 star reviews for other Pinnacle products that you would not own if 10.5 worked 
 This was sent from Nextar as a replacement for a defective MacVision MP3 I ordered for my daughter, it took 3 weeks to send in the original(they don't return calls in 48 hours as their voicemail states) and then it took another 3 weeks for them to get me a replacement(which was a step down in price and options from the one it was replacing).  For about a week this player worked and then it started to do the same things the original did(would not play a full song and then goes into a starting 'loop').  I would not buy another product from this company 
 I want to like Dr. Schoonmaker's book.  He seems like a nice guy, and he clearly understands that for many of us, poker is still a fun game.  A couple of pages are a refreshing change of pace from the macho, "everyone wants to be a pro," "poker is to win money and nothing else" approach of some pro-authored books.  That said, his writing style is repetitive and dull.  Despite his pleasant tone at times, his approach to instruction appears to be similar to that of an abusive high school football coach, only with milder language.  Once you've read him telling you that you stink 18 times in the first 50 pages, you stop respecting his desire to clear your mind of delusions and start wondering if he's actually going to offer any help.  When he does get into the helpful content, the soil is very thin and, again, the same small number of points are beaten into the ground.  The endless surveys that ask you to assess motivations in percentages don't seem to be of much utility whatsoever.  His four player style types are not terribly useful in that they are too overgeneralized, and the analyses of each type are shallow and repetitive rather than broad or deep.  This is a good companion book for a problem gambler who needs to go to Gamblers Anonymous.  It's not terribly useful for a healthy player who knows his limitations and, rather than wanting to be reminded of his limitations ad nauseum, simply wants to learn.  There are some decent nuggets in there, but their buried in repetitive, awkward language.  I just got done reading it, and it's infecting my writing style as I type this 
 THE ONLY THING I SEE WRONG WITH THIS MOVIE IS THE TITLE BUFFALO SOLDIERS. WHY WOULD THE PRODUCER OF THIS FILM DISHONOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN ARMY MEN WHO ORIGINATED THE NAME BUFFALO SOLDIER. HE COULD HAVE CALLED IT DUMB SOLDIERS. THIS MOVIE POISONS THE MINDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT BUFFALO SOLDIERS WERE GOOD ARMY MEN WHO DID THEIR MILITARY JOBS WELL. WOULD IF I MADE A MOVIE CALLED TOP GUN, AND SHOWED YOU HOW SUBURBAN WHITE KIDS SHOOTING UP A HIGH SCHOOL IN COLORADO. AND WHATS REALLY SAD IT'S THAT NATIONAL CABLE TV WILL NOT SHOW DANNY GLOVERS BUFFALO SOLDIERS MOVIE. I SERVED IN THE ARMY AND THE MARINE CORPS, SO CAN YOU UNDERSTAND WHERE I AM COMMING FROM 
 I agree with "A Reader"  I bought this book thinking I could use it to get on top of levels, get infinite ammo, etc.  What I got was some pretty useless guides for Halo 1 and 2, plus a bunch of what felt like ads.  If you're a die-hard Halo fan, this book might be worth buying, but otherwise I would advise steering clear of it 
  This is possibly the worst book I have ever read. It is not only inaccurate and slams ministries that have brought thousands to Christ (like John Arnott), but actually cruelly brings up very personal issues that fellow Christians are trying to heal from by the grace of God. This book has always been harmful and it is full of Pride and Judgement. Avoid it at all costs! Instead read John Eldredge, Max Lucado, or Brennan Manning 
 Before reading this book, I had no idea what Phillip Pullman's personal positions on faith and religion were and that was pretty much what this book was about -- variations on the theme of "Phillip Pullman wrote this series as a rebuttal to C.S. Lewis and Christianity".  I picked this book up because I had so enjoyed Pullman books and had found the previous "Smart Pop" series books I had read so enlightening and mentally stimulating.  Unfortunately, this one did not reach that same level of interest.  I found the majority of the essays to be rather simplistic and very little of what I read made me think.  It was illuminating to hear the underlying philosophy that Pullman brought to his writing, but I would have liked it if they essayists had not all addressed this same topic but had instead looked at other aspects of the book 
 This brainless, low-budget attempt to cash in on the success of John Carpenter's Vampires was so foul and lame that the studios couldn't even bribe one of their lap-dog "reviewers" to crank out a glowing review for the DVD cover. Or maybe they couldn't afford the kickback--who knows? In any case, the bad casting and inept acting had a kind of narcotic quality like an over-the-counter sleeping pill and the movie had so many plot holes that I used the DVD later to drain my spaghetti. "John Carpenter Presents"--a piece of incredible crap!! Its general level of radioactive badness probably made me sterile 
 It amazes me that not a single previous reviewer noted the gaping hole in the logic of the plot that renders the entire reading excercise an utter waste of time (not mention the waste of money in purchasing the book).  The hole is this: Did the Giordano parents "look in" on Amy when they returned home from their evening out? If so, and if she was asleep in bed, than the suspicion of Eric would be no greater than anyone else in town. If she was missing on their return home than Eric has some major explaining to do.  Incredibly this issue was never addressed. It is beyond logic to me that neither Giordano parent would check on their 8 y.o. daughter upon  returning home from a night out.  Would you?      
 I read this book anticipating an honest and unbiased treatment of an important and tragic event in Utah and Mormon history.  However, I was greatly disappointed instead by the biased voice of the author reflected throughout the book, which in numerous instances were unsubstantiated by questionable and unsupported evidences. I frequently examined the end notes supporting the quotes as I read, and found the author's sources were taken from the conclusions drawn by other authors, not direct sources. Many times the author gave quotes without any documentation whatsoever.  It was difficult to find additional light and knowledge on this subject when the author's bias was so plainly manifested in his writings.  It appeared that Bagley's ulterior motive was to negate the veracity of Brigham Young and the leaders of the LDS Church down to the current church President, Gordon B. Hinckley.  In my opinion, this book has little merit for a scholarly study. In other words, let's put it this way: Juanita Brooks -- You're still Number #1! 
 First, I listened to the unabridged audio edition. Its clearly missing a few scenes referenced in this novel. However, what I don't miss is the endless scenes of people falling to their knees, weeping, invoking God and tearing their clothes. The count choc-u-lah voice of Anti-Christ was ludicrous and painful to hear. The endless discussions of hacking, and reading lengthy sermons from Judah, and listening to Chloe whine and Buck cry. I honestly can read no more. I thought I could finish out this series, but the Desecration was the worst book I've read in the series to date. Carpathia cavorting on the back of the pig was the final straw.  What made this series great- the trials of an everyday Joe caught up in events beyond his control has devolved into a Christian themed Ludlum novel with Buck and Rayford traveling the globe to rescue small-time Christians who get killed anyway, while ignoring their own families. Christians in these books bait and mock unbelievers and the bad guys act like keystone cops. If Satan were as stupid as he's portrayed in this novel Eve would never have taken a bite from the apple.  Frankly, I finished this book, hoping Carpathia would whack Rayford and the rest of the tribulation force. They are so annoying and sanctimonious. 2 stars. 
 This book is devoid of humor or insight. Save your money and apply it towards "Adventure Capitalist" by Jim Rogers.  I wish I had 
 Jennifer Weiner is such a good writer; if only she could get past her neuroses! Enough with divorce, enough with overweight women! Many of these stories made me uncomfortable or turned me off altogether. There was a reason why various publications rejected these stories way back when, and so should have her current publisher. Ms. Weiner needs to break from the advice of many a writing teacher, i.e., write what you know. Explore new situations, new emotions, and include some happy endings 
 In her book, Kathleen Brown offers a revision of colonial Virginia history. Relying almost entirely upon previously known and explored primary materials, she constructs an argument that gender heavily influenced colonial development.        Breaking her book up chronologically into three parts, Brown focuses first on England and the Virginia colony's early days. In discussing the former, she establishes the role of women who adhere to social behavioral norms as that of good wives, and those who do not adhere to those norms as nasty wenches. In the case of Virginia, she explores the role of women in English society vis a vis Powhatan's Algonquian society. When Powhatan offered women to English settlers, whether for marriage or a night's enjoyment, he did so for political reasons; the settlers, however, thought Indians valued women less, and differently, than they did. Settlers further grappled with the fact that women farmed while men, they thought, took it easy, hunting and fishing.        The second part focuses on the change in roles of women, and the corresponding change in how men though of them. As Virginia became more permanent, and as slaves became more prevalent, "good wives" came to mean the elite women, whereas "nasty wenches" meant servant or non-elite women. Following Bacon's Rebellion, this labeling shifted somewhat as elite men attempted to break the unofficial alliance between black slaves and white servants. Principally, the violations of white women that formerly would have made them nasty wenches now were less serious, while those same violations of black women were more so.        The last part explores the domination of men and the lives of elite women. Men became much more patriarchal, establishing social norms and laws to that effect. They were "anxious" in the sense that they were now required to hold domination over their wives, families, and farms, and maintain strict adherence to those norms and laws. Relying heavily on the writings of William Byrd II and Landon Carter, Brown points out the fears these men had of declining virility, disobedient sons, and the like. Women, meanwhile, came together against their husbands, quietly undermining them on occasions, especially in discipline issues, and generally developing a women's society of tea parties and such.        On the one hand, Brown's revisionist attempt is a worthwhile endeavor; only the foolish would say women had no role or impact whatsoever in colonial development. As historians have largely ignored or downplayed this role, her study is therefore relevant. On the other hand, she delves far too deeply into the sex lives of leading men. Her study was not one solely of the role of gender, but also of sexuality. To a certain and very limited extent that exploration is worthwhile-certainly the colonists were concerned with fornication, bastardy and the like-but do I, the reader, really need to know on which days Byrd gave his wife a "flourish," and whether or not he was "vigorous"? No. Furthermore, certain inherent flaws exist in a reinterpretation that relies heavily on modern and liberal views of sex and sexuality. Consequently, there are certain aspects of the book that are worth reading, but one should select those aspects carefully. 
 The third book of the Bourne trilogy just does not stand up to "The Bourne Identity." He lost his character!  He never comes close to bringing Jason to life, and making him real,and yet,larger than life, like he was in "The Bourne Identity."   This book calls to my mind the question of who really wrote it.  I get the same feeling from Tom Clancy's later works; they do not ring of the author's metal  There are so many mistakes in this work,and it is so cluttered-up with half explanations, and under developed situations and characters,that it would hardly rate a C- in any college creative writing class.    I was very hard-pressed to complete the read,very sorry to say. It is about twice the length it should be,given all the flaws,requiring the reader to really work hard to finish. 
 the mic's quality is okay but i tried using it with my iriver mp3-player and my computer and i get that really annoying white noise in the background all the time (it's really loud). before you buy it check out some sample-recordings on the internet if you are interested in high quality 
 Daz Nigga Daz & Kurupt the Kingpin are clearly gone. When you hear quality material like "Dogg Food" and then switch to this "Saga" CD... One has to wonder where the effort went?  It's always a treat to see Daz and Kurupt together doing stuff. They've accomplished a bit on solo projects and dualing on other albums. But this one was a rush-to-the-studio. Daz- has he changed this much? His talent levels have kept him bringing stylish beats in the past- very jazzy, funky with many instruments felt. That's all gone now..... Now it's bass, bass, bass with lost chorus direction and no style.  Daz's delivery isn't even what it use to be. The pitch is very high all the time, even if the production doesn't call for it. Kurupt back in the studio on this one is nice. But we get a lost focus with so many destractions. And what's clearly missing is the other lineups- no Soopafly, Snoop, Nate, Mr. Malik, Bad Azz... so forth. I know, I know that DPGC album is coming out to reveal that all. Well Daz & Kurupt should've waited instead of damaging their album archive.  Album had a couple of nice ones. Overall, not at the level of their capability.. 
 Have you ever watched a movie or TV program that started out badly, but you kept watching in the faint hope that it would eventually get better as it went along, but it never did?  Alexander and Seidman's "Culture and Society: Contemporary Debates" left me with precisely that feeling.  A bit of context: I teach an undergraduate interdisciplinary course, and I am looking for a new textbook that students could use.  I selected this book because of its advertised content as well as the inclusion of some seminal thinkers in the field of sociology -- Saussure, Geertz, and Foucault, to name a few.  However, this book -- published in 1990 -- is a collection of 31 short articles (culled from texts and journals) that were already 5 to 15 years old at the time of publication and apparently have not been updated since then.  The book is broken down into two sections: "Analytical debates: Understanding the relative autonomy of culture" and "Substantive debates: Moral order and social crisis - perspectives on modern culture."  In each section there are various subsections (e.g., "Marxian approaches to culture," "Modernism or postmodernism: Dissolution or reconstruction of moral order?", each with two or three articles addressing the theme.  However, the target audience is academe and not the layperson, given the impenetrable prose and countless references to other authors and social theories.  A few excerpts may serve as examples of the level of complexity.  "I define postmodern as incredulity toward metanarratives" (Lyotard, 1984, p. 330).  "Introjection implies the existence of an inner dimension distinguished from and even antagonistic to the external exigencies -- and individual consciousness and an individual unconscious[ness] apart from public opinion and behavior (Marcuse, 1975, pp. 287-88).  "The danger of academism is obviously inherent in any rationalized teaching which tends to mint, within one doctrinal body, precepts, prescriptions, and formulae, explicitly described and taught, more often negative than positive, which a traditional education imparts in the form of a habitus, directly apprehended uno intuito, as a global style not susceptible to analytical breakdown" (Bordieu, 1968, p. 208).  If these three quotes resonate with your understanding of culture and society, then this is the book for you!  There are a few bright spots in this book.  Robert Bellah's entry on "Civil religion in America" is well worth a look in light of recent developments.  Marshall Sahlins' "Food as Symbolic Code" is another interesting consideration of a topic we take for granted.  However, a reader who is looking for cross-cultural analysis and discussion of contemprary debates in society would be hard-pressed to find many answers while wading through all 370 pages of this theoretical text 
 So this is the fate of rock and roll packaged in one album -  hipsters for hip's sake. It will be interesting to see if these guys ever make a mark again. If you ask me, the gimicks are pretty much exhausted and crashed into the ground after about the fifth song or so. I mean we got it - we are no longer so innocent about the mediums of art and communication as being something transparent and autonomous - the avenues of expression have been pressed to the limits.  So now we revert to 'meta-music'! If we can't be progressive or effective we can still be hip. I think the crucial moment in the album for me was during the second listen of 'my little brother' where the singer/talker says something like 'all we ever wanted was for our parents to worry about us.' Isn't this kind of like a self-critique of the whole Art Brut project/aesthetic? As if rock and roll never functions for political/social purposes but instead only functions in service of narcissistic self-defense in the context of bourgouis familial dramas. As for the whole 'hipster' craze - yes - rock and roll does work in the service of bourgeois narcissism.  However, when out of the hands of hipsters, is this the case of 'rock music'? That, I think, is yet to be determined and has defintely been proven otherwise in its past history 
 I have to read this text book for one of my 3rd year Computer Science course.  My professor picked the worst book there is for us to learn.  The exam is open book but I can't use any of the stuff that's written in this piece of sh*t.  Whever wrote this book should jump off the building and die.  It tried to include too many topic at once and fail to explain how to used each of them.  All it does is throw you examples of the stuff they wrote.  Firstly, their examples don't work. Secondly, that is not now most programmer will approach it.  It tries to teach connection with a database but did not provide any PreparedStatement or Statement and did not provide text on DriverManger.getConnection.  How the hell do we connect then??  Bottom line is this book sucks!!  EJB, Servlets, Jsp, JMS, JNDI, XML, JDBC, JavaMail my A**!! 
 this is the third Chris Botti CD i purchased and listened to.  i think Botti is a great trumpeter.  on PBS' Legend of Jazz series, his performance with the PBS house band was amazingly good.  i never heard or saw him perform in pure jazz setting and may be Botti was awared that the PBS audience is quite jazz sophisticated thus he returned to the root of jazz and did a serious jazz rendition. that performance was the BEST of everything i heard from Botti.  the trio really helped bringing about Botti's Jazz ability.  sadly, in all his CDs, including this one, Botti applied the mechanical background "noise" (uninspiring back up) and it is totally artificial, lack of improvization and lack of swing.  without improvisation and swing, there is no Jazz. the PBS performance proved to me that Botti has all the capacity of a jazz artist but he is making pop to earn his mercedes.    i hope Botti build on from his PBS appearance and make a CD with a conventional trio setting. no more mechanical electronic beat machine, artificial arrangement and also, DROP THE SYNTHEZISER noise at the back. let the trumpet do the talking, Count Basie proved that silence is the best and most difficult music to play. let the improvisation element go, let it swing a bit more.    fantastic artist but extremely disappointing "jazz" production.  1 star.  
 This book is still used a great deal in law schools, but there are better casebooks now with modern, more interesting cases and more thoughtful analysis.  Instead, try Goldberg, Sebok and Zipursky, Tort Law: Responsibilities and Redress 
 This was one of our main texts for a class on the Ancient Rome I just took this semester. The information in here is solid, but in many (most) parts of the book I was bored to tears...something I've rarely said about any history book. A very dry read. Truely devoted students of Ancient Rome or Classics may find this book useful, casual readers or general history buffs I suggest look elsewhere 
 It's definitely an unusual book.  With some severe editing it could be given a 3 or 4-star rating for fiction.  But non-fiction it isn't.  Even allowing for memory lapses that might have caused factual errors, no infantry soldier in the German army could possibly have had all the experiences, all the luck, and all the fortuitous circumstances that Jung claims.  It would be interesting to know what Jung and Nesbitt were thinking when they collaborated to write this book, but not so interesting that one would take any time to find out.        
 Don't waste your money on this crap. There are plenty of great books on solid game like The Game, The Mack Witihn, & The Lay Guide. This book is really a joke/ comedy book 
 Mark Bittman's "How to Cook Everything" is a treasure trove of vegeterian recipes, including tons of recipes for cooking legumes, grains, and vegetables. Unfortunately, those sections are all missing from "The Minimalist Cooks Dinner," which is essentially about cooking meat, poultry, and fish. Vegeterian Bittman fans would be better off sticking with "How to Cook Everything" and/or trying out "The Minimalist Cooks Vegetarian.&quot 
 I bought it and was extremely disapointed.  I think that I got the shaft.  It was represented as a new novel.  Instead, it was 2 old novels combined into one book. Buyer beware, I think that this is a case of gross advertising deception 
 Alan Dean Foster's The Approaching Storm is his third entry in the Star Wars universe, but his first in the modern era of EU. He was the ghostwriter for the novelization of A New Hope (credited to George Lucas) and also wrote the vintage Splinter of the Mind's Eye, one of the handful of novels from the days of the original trilogy. The book's front jacket proclaims "An exciting prologue to Star Wars: Attack of the Clones," while the back mentions two Jedi and their apprentices fighting "impossible odds" while "the entire galaxy watches and waits."   Unfortunately, I must charge the dust jacket with over-hyping the scope of this tale. Though the book tries hard to convince us that Ansion is critical to preventing the breakaway of many systems to the Separatists, the story itself just feels too leisurely and the planet too insignificant to carry this weight. Essentially the two Jedi and their apprentices take a long field trip to find some nomads out in the plains of Ansion and convince them to make peace with the city folk, thereby ensuring Ansion's continued loyalty to the Republic. The aspect of this I found most frustrating? After reading in extreme detail about their journey there, Foster totally glosses over the actual negotiations between the two most powerful nomad factions facilitated by the Jedi - there's no payoff! One minute they're about to go to war, the next they've sat down and rapidly become old friends.   I also found the writing to be curiously stilted. Star Wars is certainly not noted for snappy dialogue, but most of the conversations in here don't even read fluidly on the page, let alone if they are read aloud. Like Rogue Planet, this book seemed rather like a non-Star Wars science fiction tale re-skinned with Star Wars trappings and published as such.   Despite the book promising more, I did enjoy seeing the Jedi on a small-scale, personal mission. There aren't many books dealing with Obi-Wan and Anakin's relationship pre-Clone Wars, so it's good to see that explored. Since the book is set immediately before Attack of the Clones, their dynamic is very similar to what we see in the film. Visually, Luminara Unduli and Barriss Offee are a terrific pair, and it's fun to see their personalities fleshed out. Separatist scheming is always welcomed as well, and I have a weakness for Hutts as characters: Soergg's repartee with Barriss in the climax was easy to visualize and quite entertaining. Also, the creatures of Ansion were diverse and well-realized and the planet itself vividly described.   I would have liked to see more from The Approaching Storm; I love Attack of the Clones and was very excited to read a book setting up the events of the film. While it's a fleetingly cool feeling to know all the details of the "mission to Ansion" Mace Windu mentions early in the film, I think this book missed an opportunity to try for something more.  
 After many years, I decided to finally give Kathy Reichs' Temperance Brennan series a go.  So, where better to start than her debut novel 'Deja Dead' which introduces Reichs' heroine.  Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist working in Montreal for what I'm guessing is the French-Canadian equivalent of a Medical Examiner's office.  Of course our heroine is head strong, independent, and unlucky in love (aren't they all?).  Well, some murders start turning up and, amazingly enough, our intrepid anthropologist is the only person that links the crimes together.  Do the police believe her?  No, so she must investigate the crimes on her own.  And by doing so, the murderer then turns his attention to Brennan and her family and friends (don't all killers eventually do that?).  First off, the book is bloated.  The book (at least the paperback version) clocks in at about 530 pages.  Reichs' writes too much about menial tasks that her character, Brennan, does during her usual day.  Does anyone really want to hear repeatedly about what a character had for dinner or what paperwork she does at work?  I know I don't want to read it.  Now I'm a person who enjoys a nice, long book but 'Deja Dead' (where did she get that title anyway?) is about two hundred pages too long.  And it is a very slow read.    Secondly, her main character, Brennan, just isn't likeable.  In fact, I found her quite annoying.  The policemen in the novel are portrayed as incompetent, arrogant jerks who are too worried about being right than they are about doing the right thing.  When in fact I think that they just didn't want to deal with this overly nosy anthropologist who is obviously stepping on toes and irritating people who are just trying to do their jobs.  Reichs' tries to portray Brennan as a lone crusader fighting against all these odds to get to the criminal.  When in fact she is an irritating anthropologist who has no business investigating a murder.  She is, basically, a laboratory-based employee who should not be in the field.  So I don't blame the cops in the book that don't like her.  She's butting her nose in where it doesn't belong and, in a part I actually liked, she ends up bringing irreparable damage to her family and friends.  I thought it a just outcome.  Also, after about the twentieth time of Brennan looking at some cop's rear end and saying "I like the way his butt looks...Oh, stop!  You need to get laid." I wanted to scream.  Dr. Brennan, at least in this debut novel, is extremely irritating.  Thirdly, I have read the basic plot of this book in a hundred other novels.  The suprise "switcheroo" ending is not suprising but more annoying...  It is just a cheap way to trick the reader.  And if I have to read about one more main character who ends up becoming the target of the "killer", I will scream.  Its pathetic.  How many times does it need to be written?  Its ridiculous.  Now, 'Deja Dead' is the first of Reichs' books that I've read.  I've heard that the following books in the Brennan series are better and I certainly hope this is the case.  I really didn't like the book:  not the characters, the plot, the writing...  But I will give Reichs another try and read the next book in the series.  If its as bad as 'Deja Dead', I don't think I ever read another one her books 
 This book is a good compilation of Richter's work.  However, the reprintg of these images are incredibly small.  The writing is good but the actual images are almost postage stamp size.  For the price, this book is not recommended unless you a die-hard Richter fan 
 Beware of this money-sucking stunt, "by those who knew him best." What a joke, even were this being offered for free.  Not one of Jimi's band-mates is interviewed, nor any of his closest and most beloved girlfriends, and most criminally, this so-called documentary leaves out the elegant, aristocratic Linda Keith, who falling in love with Jimi as well launched the chain of causes that made him into a star. The phrase "those who knew him best" is an outright lie.   What the film does unwittingly expose is the severity of the infestation of the leeches, users, and music-industry philistines (who bled Mr. Jimi and kept bleeding him onto death), who all then get a magical glint in their eyes recounting what "good friends" they were with a being who in ancient times would've been considered a Demi-God and who held onto his dignity, despite the forms of human life swarming and swamping him.  It's tragic the Hendrix Estate itself doesn't issue more footage, both musically and philosophically, but Ms. Janie Hendrix afflicted with the Christian neurosis and ever-sprouting puritanical impulses is thereby incapable of telling the truth about her half-brother's personality and life, and is constantly trying to "clean up" his biography and fake his history: nothing needs to be "cleaned;" Jimi Hendrix had more nobility and humaneness than the Dali Lama, Pope, et al., and neither this cheap film, nor the Estate propaganda convey the character of Mr. Hendrix. Anyone who wants more insight into who he was would be better served by the interview included as an extra in the new (2005) Jimi at Woodstock Dvd, as well as the Film About Jimi Hendrix.  
 The problem with this book is that the author completely overlooks the culpability of the U.S. in the acts of genocide discussed.  The U.S.bombing of Cambodia although not in itself an act of genocide was the reason why peasants flocked to the Khmer Rouge who previously were a marginal group.  It was the U.S. who blocked any attempts of the UN to send more soldiers to Rawanda.  As well, it was the U.S. that armed Indonesia so that they could attack and occupy East Timor, a clear case of Genocide.  etc. etc. etc 
 I've read many of Jayne Ann Krentz's books - especially the more recent ones, and have found them to be very enjoyable. However, I'd have to say this was the worst book I have ever read.  The "possessive" theme, with the hero (although I'm not sure that I would call him that) continuously saying "You belong to me" or "You're mine" to the heroine, is completely disturbing. The author seems to be conveying the idea that as long as someone loves you it's okay to make these statements. Possessiveness is not romantic in any way shape or form.  It was a struggle just to finish the book. New readers should stick to her more recent books.  
 Whoa! What flimsy piece of television journalism.  This biography episode manages to make the life of Juilia Child boring and dull. My guess is that the producer has never cooked a meal in his/her life and thinks of Julia Child a big lady with a funny voice.   Please just by Julia's My Life in France autobiograpy.   It's a fast, inspiring read any night and day from this hackish disservice to one of the most important figures in American culinary history 
 I was excited to see what all the fuss was about after hearing about kettlebells and what an effective training tool they are.  However, after  reading this book it was evident that it is incomplete and poorly conceived, of poor quality and lacking in too many areas to be taken seriously.  (Also, it has since been superceded by "Enter the Kettlebell" in which Pavel contradicts himself.)  I was confused by the many typographical errors with whole paragraphs being repeated out of sequence in non-related chapters and the lack of photographs required to do a good job of conveying how to properly execute the various movements.  This could be quite dangerous for the trainee who doesn't have the time, money or inclination to spend $1500-2000 to take a beginners kettlebell course.  Surely this must be a Russian plot to bilk hard-working Americans out of their money and send them on a mission of useless training programs?  I got the distinct impression that Pavel's books are written in serial fashion to either 1) convince you that you MUST take a "certified" kettlebell course or (2) get you to buy more expensive books or (3)get you to buy expensive DVD's.  "Take down that wall Gorby"...so those wacky Russians can experience the American dream by selling over-hyped books supposedly containing valuable Russian training "secrets".  As much as the kettlebell "cultists" would like you to believe how great they are, fortunately most of us are not confined to a Russian gulag or currently in exile in Siberia working out with balls of iron with a handle in the sub-freezing cold, performaing boring, mind numbing endless repetitions of snatches and swings.  No, here in America, a long time ago, someone came up with the idea of ADJUSTABLE dumbells and barbells with which you can progressively add weight and thereby grow in strength and muscularity.  Plenty of trainees around the world have built great physiques and strength without ever having touched a kettlebell.  Keep that in mind and try to see past the hype 
 The last person we need to learn from is a rapist and racist like Eldridge Cleaver 
 I have found only one game out of the many that i have tried that the codes on this thing actually work on.  This action replay is basically a twenty dollar or more waste of plastic and the cardboard that it came in.  avoid like the plague 
 I have now seen two Judy Garland movies -- The Wizard of Oz and this one. All bets are off about a third.  I Could Go On Singing has the morbid distinction of being Judy's final film. She plays -- get this -- a world famous tough-talking yet vulnerable vocalist with a tormented personal life and an appetite for prescription medication and martinis. Quite a stretch.   Overall, this movie is a confused hybrid of a melodramatic soap opera, a London travelogue, and a "live" Judy Garland stage performance. It will probably be filed under "Musicals" at your video store, but that's not really accurate -- nobody spontaneously breaks out into Wizard of Oz-style song and dance production numbers. Instead, the tunes are performed by Judy's alter-ego "character" Jenny Bowman at pseudo-live sold out (of course) solo shows at the London Palladium. She sings a handful of oddly forgettable and unremarkable showstoppers, including the title song which features unfortunate lyrics such as these:   I could go on singing, til the cows come home And the rooster starts to crow, crow, crow When I see your eyes, I go all out I must vocalize til you shout "enough already!" I could go on singing, til the moon turns pink Anything from Faust to  Ink-a-dink-a-dink!  Not even Judy can manage to deliver this stuff convincingly, but she gives it her best shot.  The notable exception is the little-known gem of a torch song, "It Never Was You" by Kurt Weill, which certainly deserves to be heard more often. There is also some remarkable instrumental soundtrack music by Mort Lindsey (co-composer of the Jeopardy theme song), especially the zippy "Helicopter Ride" symphony and the experimental, Ives-ian "Matt's Dilemma" interlude. And you get to see Judy's son (Matt -- the dilemma being he doesn't yet know he's Judy's son) performing Gilbert and Sullivan in drag, if that's the kind of thing you're into.  Otherwise, Jack Klugman, Dick Bogarde, and the rest of the cast are merely props on Judy's stage, though the kid who plays Matt is a likeable enough chap I guess. Dramatically, though, I Could Go On Singing is awfully cornball, overwrought stuff, and it all comes to an abrupt, unsatisfying conclusion.  It also doesn't help that the MGM DVD is a cheapo affair with no bonus features to speak of (no, the "theatrical trailer" doesn't count) and only barely adequate mono sound.  Grade: C 
 This book purports to be a Dictionary of American political slang but should be entitled "Washington D.C." political slang.  To test out the book, I looked up some commonly used Chicago political slang terms.  None of them appeared in the book.  Had the author bothered to look outside the Beltway, he could have found words like "chinaman" (a political sponsor/source of clout) and "fetcher" (a legislative bill proposed solely for the purpose of generating campaign contributions from an affected industry) 
 I am grateful that this conversation has begun, but this book is by no means the final word on the subject.    I found 200 pages of individual acts of backstabbing to be uninsightful.  We already know women can be vicious.  While this book takes heroic steps to sympathetically rationalize treachery and dispel the "good girl-bad girl" dichotomy, it would be a far more inspirational read if it gave practical advice for dealing with our inevitable day to day confrontations.    I was hoping this book would lay out the nuances and pitfalls of working with women before dispensing some apt suggestions for diffusing tense situations.  Perhaps with some humorous/memorable examples of these tactics applied.  I was disappointed.    I had to glean from the anecdotes the sorts of environmental conditions which could lead to thinly veiled hostility: feeling threatened by youth, talent, beauty, race, social class or contested token woman status.  Should I find myself in possession of one of these threatening advantages, I'm unsure how to react outside of warily paranoid.    Although this book alludes to individual advocacy, at its core it is a collective action cop-out.  Women are reluctant to make individual changes because their less altruistic coworkers will take advantage of them.  The solution?  Macro-level reform meted out by our government, media and employers.    Amidst a slew of gratuitous quotes, it seems Margaret Mead's critical message has been left out: "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed people can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has."      
 Would you stand in line at an Applebee's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good---maybe better---at a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes?  Of course not!  Why, then, would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two James Patterson books, or a Patterson and a Connelly, or two Thomas Harris books...my apologies, Greg Iles, but for a simple, formulaic serial killer book, Blood Memory was just WAY too long.  The book has two co-plots; one involves a serial killer who murders older men, the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead.  The serial killer plot is actually the more interesting, but at least two-thirds of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the "secret" is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book.  All in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if Iles---or his editor---had chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text.  Iles just LOVES to have two characters sit and talk for 3o, 40 or even 50 pages, but since most of his dialogue is what I call "soap opera" speak, meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths, these chapters dragged on and on and on.  Iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream, taking showers, and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely.  Come on, Greg; why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it's some strange, exotic treat that no one's ever heard of before?  Just as some people love to hear themselves talk, I think Iles loves to see himself write...and although some of his books have been quite good, Blood Memory misses the mark by a long shot 
 My book club strikes again with this inane, predictable and hard to complete selection.  I think Kim Edwards found the novel difficult to finish writing, because the ending was even more bland and poorly developed than the rest of the book.  The premise of the novel is interesting enough, which is why I found it mildly engaging.  However, I found myself hating all the characters in the book (save Phoebe).  The metaphors the author uses are for the most part cheap, and are further deflated by their constant repetition.  How many starfish metaphors can she make in the course of just a few paragraphs?  Then there was the overuse of several phrases..."silverfish" is just one that comes to mind.  Still, this was Kim Edward's freshman novel, so I can excuse some of the overly-elaborated and amateur metaphors; hence the two star rating.  I had a difficult time trudging through this book to reach the end.  The middle section could have been half as long and still sufficed.  The characters were all, without exception, poorly developed and painfully uninteresting.  This doesn't make the invisible plot any more tolerable.  I would say that if you really wanted to feel like you wasted your time reading something, then choose this book.  There is certainly nothing to be gained by reading it 
 If this is your first Barbara Taylor Bradford book, you may never pick up another one.  I, on the other hand, like to give an author the three strikes rule, so won't hesitate to try something else, but it won't be very soon.  If you want to read one of her novels, do NOT start with this one like I did.  This is very boring--like snails serving as soap stars--not to mention slow and predictable.  I listened to the entire thing on cd, but think it was mostly because I liked Ms. O'Karma's narration--she has an appealingly smokey voice like Carolyn Jones from the Adams Family.  It still couldn't save this story with its endless self-serving "what-about-ME!" mantras and Valentine's overly moralistic attitude.  I'm the same way, and I bore myself!  You knew from page one where this story was going, and the dialog was as insufferable as the descriptions of everything from food and clothing to moths reproducing on peeling wallpaper.  "I was a war photographer and my mommy was mean to me" resounds every other page, yet she wants to get away from all of that.  Nothing's worse than a character or real person who brags, then turns around and screams "Look at me, look at me...How DARE you look at me?!"  
 I'm a beginer sewer.  I just took my first 2 lessons in sewing, and am able to use my machine to make simple things, like pillows.  I checked this book out from our library, and looked at the first project.  It seems pretty complicated, and I felt like there were some steps missing.  It was explaining how to create a simple apron, but the steps didn't all make sense to me.  I think this book is more for an intermediate sewer, who knows more of the terminology, and all ready understands basic sewing methods 
 Zahlan covers the history of the Gulf states with special emphasis on the history of the various monarchical families. Sadly, her attitude is unflinchingly fawning; she seems afraid to say one negative thing about  these countries and their economic and political challenges. As well, the  writing style is very dry and wooden. Her bias is symbolized by one of the  maps showing the UAE as extending westward all the way to Dawhat as Salwa,  at the southwest base of Qatar. This reflects absurdly ambitious  territorial claims of the UAE at a time when the Saudis have claimed the  coast in the vicinity of Khawr Duwayhin, southeast of Qatar. This map is  emblematic of the book's flaws. A much better book despite its age (1980)  is 'Arabia, the Gulf, & the West' by J.B. Kelly 
 I bought this book because I am a 22 year old male, who still plays video games every day for many hours.  I saw Mr. Thompson on TV and he peaked my interest.  I thought wow am I crazy since I still play video games?  So I picked up his book.  I was in tears at some points, I couldn't believe this man actually gets anyware.  [...] Shame on you Mr. Thompson for taking advantage of parents fear for the childrens saftey to make a buck 
 Having had the miserable pleasure of being "taught" by Joan Cashin at The Ohio State University I can tell you that this book is as dry as her hair.  Has anyone seen the original movie for Great Expectations?  Cashin is the original Mrs. Havishome.  If only she would immolate in that wedding dress and save us all the 20 dollars we spent on this book 
 This book is not a serious or scholarly piece of work, and I recommend that you not waste your time reading it.  It begins with a description of the life of Mohammed, the origins and spread of Islam, and the creation of various Islamic sects.  This is probably the best part of the book, but it is still very poor.  For example, Schwartz never really explains even the basic distinction between Shi'a and Sunni Islam.  And Schwartz's overall goals badly tarnish his discussion:  He wants to portray traditional Islam as being perfectly pluralist, tolerant, and peace-loving, so as to contrast it with hate-filled, intolerant, and violent Wahhabism.  As a result, his description of the Ottoman Empire (representing Schwartz's traditional Islam) is completely uncritical and consequently not credible.  For instance, he never even mentions the Ottomans' barbaric and murderous treatment of Armenians and Kurds, to name just two salient examples.  The rest of the book follows a similar pattern:  There are Muslims Schwartz likes (especially Sufis), and there are Muslims he hates (Wahhabis, plus others who are not Wahhabis but whom Schwartz describes as "Wahhabized," though he never explains what  that's supposed to mean).  The "good" Muslims can do no wrong, and the "bad" Muslims are behind just about every act of terrorism committed anywhere on the globe.  I know this sounds like it must be a charicature of the book, but it's not.  Rather, Schwartz's book is itself a charicature of the complexity of contemporary international affairs.  An example will illustrate Schwartz's appalling sloppiness with evidence.  On pages 217-218, he claims that a "manifesto" written by Osama bin Laden proves that Saddam Hussein is connected with bin Laden and Al Qaeda.  I found this surprising, because there is, to my knowledge, no proven link between them whatsoever (and I have followed this issue very closely).  In fact, it is well known that bin Laden has always hated Hussein and secular rulers like him, that bin Laden had called for Hussein's overthrow, that Hussein hated bin Laden and had brutally repressed Islamic fundamentalists like him, etc.  (See, for example, the analysis of this issue in a report by the Carnegie Endownment for International Peace).  So I was very curious to see what evidence Schwartz had found in bin Laden's "manifesto" to support his conclusion that, in spite of all that, Hussein and bin Laden were allies.  Here is Schwartz's evidence:  In his "manifesto," bin Laden (1) called for an end to the UN sanctions on Iraq, (2) lamented the destruction inflicted on Iraq in the first Gulf War, and (3) also lamented the deaths of Iraqi children that were caused by the UN santions.  I'm not kidding--that is the sum total of Schwartz's "proof" that Hussein was an ally of bin Laden and Al Qaeda in their global terror campaign.  It's absurd.  The book does contain one interesting thesis:  Schwartz claims that for most Americans, the face of violent and dangerous Islamic extremism is Ayatolla Khomeini and the Iranian revolution, while Americans have regarded Saudi Islam as "moderate" because the Saudis are US allies.  Schwartz plausibly argues that the reverse is true:  Saudi Islam (Wahhabism) is much more dangerous because of its support for a "holy war" without borders, while the Islamic revolution in Iran was really about liberating the Shi'a of Iran from oppression under the Shah, not about waging a larger war beyond Iran (although Schwartz does acknowledge Iranian support for certain Palestinian militant groups).  The thesis is interesting and possibly true.  But that one interesting point certainly doesn't make this dreadful book worth reading.  If you are looking for an introduction to Islam, or for insightful and well-reasoned discussion of world affairs, please look elsewhere 
 Although the book could be praised for its excrutiatingly thorough detail, I was personally disappointed.  The book is more suited to a "credit class" scholarly group than the casual reader, such as I,  searching simply for an entertaining understanding of the event. Despite the fact that the author includes minute detail such as pay records, important illustrations such as maps relating to the campaign and battles are not included in the text at point of discussion and lack clarity when found in the Appendix.  Adding to my personal confusion was the omission of a glossary defining a multitude of terms which would be familiar only to those with a background in medieval warfare.  
 I should have taken heed per Alan Williamson. I'd heard this band could be like Led Zeppelin. I was hoping for something like that or maybe a Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam or Nirvana. If you're looking for the kind of music I've just referred to, the Stone Roses aren't going to do it for you. 
 Susan Sontag disparaged the idea that dis-eases are caused by mental states, and her resolutely taking this position illustrates the great and willing blindness of this talented but dis-eased anti-white racist. She had such a beautiful basket of blossoms to offer, and between their leaves and stems crawled poisonous snakes she could not free herself of because she wasn't willing to look in her own basket. Unfortunately her work is forever tainted with her hatred.  Sad - 
 My son and I absolutely LOVE Chicka Chicka Boom Boom, and I was thrilled when I saw this book at our library.  I checked it out right away.  Unfortunately, it lacks so much of what made the first book so delightful.  The rhymes are not nearly as fluid as in Chicka Chicka Boom Boom, and as another reviewer says, it is confusing why Zero is the Hero of the apple tree.  There are better counting books out there.  Check it out from the libary first.  You might like it, but I would recommend trying it out before you buy it.  You won't want to waste your money 
 I have often been exasperated with Henry James and his determination to make a simple sentence into a complicated puzzle and an intellectual game. But I have never been disappointed by James until now. I was surprised to see that this was written within 3 yrs of one of his masterpieces, Portrait of a Lady. If I didn't know better I'd say he wrote this one on a deadline for purely financial purposes 
 Very surprised at the ratings on this book. I thought it was very poorly written and really boring. Actually, just the first 100 pages were boring, I gave up after that. 
 The prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again.  I was disappointed, soon after, when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts, with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle-and then even that was disappointing.  I mean Graceland for a first date?  I noticed a lot of similarities between Roz and the mayor in Northern Lights, and Logan and Nate from that same book.  None of them can talk in complete sentences.  And Stella, who comes across as this loving mother, who puts her kids before anything else, works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she isn't there to oversee everything, even though the place has been successful for years.  There is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband, she just does it. Unless, of course, it was in the last 50 pages which I didn't bother to read because I just couldn't torture myself any longer.  And I'm a big fan of Roberts.  I love her Quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work.  But this just stunk because I could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be.  I'm certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out. 
 Could not find any application for my needs. May be usefull for professional photographers with press print application in mind, but for andvanced and amatuers photographers is useles 
 First of all, if you know anything at all about encryption, computer security, and things like that, the technical stuff in this book will have you laughing.  Dan Brown obviously didn't research the topic, or decided to rely on public ignorance.  That's not a slam on the public, though.  Cryptography, computer security, and the like are not trivial subjects.  Still, he clearly didn't know what is and isn't possible, and in several cases his attempt to define technical jargon was just plain wrong.  The major characters in the story were extremely shallow and stereotypical.  What saved it character-wise was all the minor characters, who were somewhat interesting.  The locations and event descriptions were also good, and helped you envision what was happening.  Technical and character issues aside, the overall storyline, while somewhat entertaining, was not even remotely plausible.  The climax of the story was outright laughable.  You have a bunch of genius techies and codebreakers trying to figure something out that is blatantly obvious to anyone with any math/science/technology background, but the ideas they run through are what you would see from "average Joe".  No problem if these were average Joes, but they weren't.  So, I guess if you have nothing better to do and don't expect much realism or technical accuracy, I guess its as good a way to kill time as any 
 I was dissapointed when i picked up this Book at my local Barnes&Nobels because i confused it with a REAL Science book. When are the creationists going to get a grip??? They have already been exposed about their nasty habitt of distorting information, misquoting serious scientists and misleading their followers. Life evolved on this planet. This is backed up by a ton of real evidence. No, not speculation from the Bible but real life, you-can-touch-it-and-see-it evidence. Not to mention the extensive DNA research done on the subject. Religion has always fought Science for simple reasons: ego, fear and control. And that's what's behind this. Any balanced person that can understand evolution should not have a problem accepting it 
 Amazon sent me an email asking me to write a review of this product.  Usually I like to have actually used the product before writing a review, but since I haven't received it yet, that is not possible.  It has been over 1 month since I ordered this with the Crutchfield storefront at Amazon.com.  Amazon's site indicated the product was in stock, but since ordering, it has been placed on back order twice and expected to ship in a few days from now.  I just wonder how it could take so long to get a product from manufacturer to end user.  I don't know where this is manufactured, or who Crutchfield's supplier is, but needless to say I am not entirely pleased with this whole process... which doesn't really have anything to do with Amazon.  I hear DV cable does it's job, but I'll have to wait and see 
 This towel holder is functional but flimsy. The stainless steel is too thin at the base and the actual weighted part of the base is plastic. As long as no one's using the holder it looks OK but as soon as you try to yank a towel off the roll the base moves around and you get that "cheap feeling. 
 I wasn't too into this one. I'm a big fan of Steinbeck's fiction, but this memoir is rather dull. I was looking to hear what he had to say about the zeitgeist of America at the time he wrote it. But as an older man (as he even admits) he isn't as inspired to talk to or rub shoulders with people whom he crosses paths. The ones that he does write  about come across as a bit uninspired. Nothing much happens on his journey and it almost seems like he doesn't have too much to say.   The one highlight was the last couple of chapters, when he goes to the South (New Orleans) and witnesses all the slimy, seperatists as they scream and holler, with pure craven hatred at the first little black children to be integrated into public schools. He is disillusioned and angry and when he tells the tale of what he saw it is absolutely heartbreaking.   As much as a mediocre work as it was, I did take an interest in it because I am a fan of Steinbeck. It was cool to hear him write a memoir. Other Steinbeck fans make get something out of it as well and for them I recommend it, just on that basis. As long as you take into account the stuff I said above. If you haven't read Steinbeck, please...start with "The Grapes of Wrath" or "Tortilla Flat." Those are much better works and will give you something to go on if you try to read this 
 After one year of owning this scale I replaced the batteries and it stopped working 
 I read this book in college, not as part of a course, but out of curiousity because it was the favorite whipping boy of many of my peers and professors.  After reading it, I understood why.  The effect of this book, intended or not, is to preserve the reverence for the outdated "Western canon".  Ultimately, I found the book self-serving in the extreme, as it secures Hirsh's place in academia, if it is believed.  I admit that reading the list of items Hirsch thinks we should know and trying to place them is an amusing parlor game.  However, one should not draw conclusions about one's self worth from success or failure at this game.  The list itself is deeply flawed for more than one reason.  First, it is heavily weighted towards the knowledge of old college professors, not young college professors, and certainly not college students.  Second, it is heavily weighted by Hirsch's Anglophilia.  Third, although it does not purport to be exhastive, the danger of any list, and this one is no exception, is that it will be taken as exhaustive by the lazy reader.  Finally, Hirsch's argument that his concept of cultural literacy is finally pragmatic and not philosophical in that it lays the groundwork of "common experience" for students and teachers is particularly narrow.  Hirsch must have been wearing cultural blinders when he wrote this not to see that much of the common experience that people draw on today is formed not by the Academy, but by popular culture.  Hirsch's argument breaks down here because he tries to force the popular culture of a different age upon the public so that they will have a common experience with him, instead of exposing himself current pop culture simply because it doesn't meet his narrow aesthetic criteria.  If you read this book, read it as a cautionary tale about trying to quantify any concept so nebulous as "cultural literacy."  Interrogate the precepts of this book by trying to have a converstaion about Buffy the Vampire Slayer and its relationship to religion among American teenagers with any of your "old guard" religion or philosophy professors.  Now who's culturally illiterate 
 Mr. "Dow 36,000" wants you to believe him this time.  No, really, he means it.  Right.  In 2005 he he wrote an article denying that there was a housing mania about to go bust.  I think that's a pretty good indication that there is a housing mania about to go bust.  This guy is amazing 
 People magazine is one of the worst expressions of American life.  Instead of makiing our own lives more meaningful and exciting - which is possible - People encourages us to oogle and fixate over people who are essentially images, people we will never meet, and in many cases people who have very little going for them. Does anyone really think that Britney Spears has anything to say about anything, or that Paris Hilton is barely  aware of her own existence?  Does it ever make a whit of difference to your life how many times J.Lo is engaged (in order to get on the cover of another magazine) or who Demi Moore is grinding with today or where Gweyneth gets her gowns 
 While maybe at one time this book used to be valid today it is grossly out of date and there are multiple inconsistentsies in the first several chapters that would not make this a great 'how to' and a great beginners book anymore.  The electrical section fails the current check, the couplers they recommend haven't been made by the company mentioned in over 15 years, and many other things 
 [the two stars here are for the audiobook only. I give the book six stars.  I loved the book. Best book I've read in years. Couldn't put it down.  But the audiobook is dismal. The voice artists are amateurish, their speech clumsy and unnatural. It's as though they're reading from a script that they haven't rehearsed and they don't know how to get "in character". The attempts at foreign accents are overdone and painful to listen to.  (I love listening to audiobooks and radioplays. I listen to many hours of BBC World Service every day. I know what foreign accents sound like. Not like these).  I strongly recommend that you find a preview of this audiobook before buying it, to see if you'll dislike it as much as I do. Or buy the book instead. Heck, buy five copies of the book like I did and give them to your friends. Awesome book 
 How could Carpenter, who created an unduplicated masterpiece with the original "Halloween" have been part of the writing team for this? The premise was respectable enough, the day after where the original left off with Jamie Lee Curtis in the hospital, Donald Pleasance on the hunt for the maniacal killer Michael Myers, who at the end of the original left the audience hanging when he disappeared after being shot several times and falling out a second story window. A strong place to begin a sequel. But what they do with that premise from that point on is no more than what every "Priday the 13th" type slasher flick did throughout the 80s, and then some. While the original used suspense, masterful direction and camera work, the sequel cheated with the camera and exploited its use to take the kills to the next gory level rather than rely on on storyline alone for it's terrifying effects. It also began "Jason-ifying" Michael Myers into the indestrucable beyond belief killer for the sake of leaving the audience hanging, rather than the more plausible premise the original relied on. Add to that the part III of the Halloween Series that many awaited to rectify the sequel had absolutely nothing to do with the first 2 and the viewers of the original had every right to feel betrayed and lost their patience. Who could fault them if they didn't care when "Halloween Ressurection" came out to relatively decent reviews. By then who cared. They'd lost their original audience and deservedly so. I suppose Jamie Lee alone is worth the price of admission to anything, particularly in her "scream queen" hey day. Heck, I even sat through the abysmal "Terror Train" due to her credibility, and of course her comeliness. But Pleasance character goes way beyond the 3 point line in order to score horror film points. The ending of this sequel is unworthy of Carpenter written material, and I'm ashamed for his association with it. I remember looking so forward to this movie, and when we left the theater we were so disappointed in so many ways. This movie was indeed the beginning of the end. Not just for the Halloween saga, but for adding a credible brandname to the likes of "Friday the 13th" type story lines that never had any plausibility to start with ("Texas Chainsaw Massacre" would later be guilty of the same.)  What a wasted opportunity 
 As a previous reviewer reports mine broke as I was lifting it out of the oven the 5th or 6th time I used it 
 I think there may be a hint of jealousy in this book.  I've often thought of Zizek as the kind of guy who strives to be the rock star of philosophy. Of course, more than ten years after his death, Deleuze is packing more philosophical arenas than Zizek ever will.  This is because, in my humble opinion, Zizek is and always will be a second rate philosopher.  He is the Douglas Coupland of academic philosophy in that, while he is often an interesting read, one always walks away from the book feeling like they've gained nothing but a few perverse ways of stating the obvious.  I will admit, Zizek has a flare for writing, notably, I think in the Ticklish Subject and Welcome to the Desert of the Real.  But this book not only failed to accomplish it's goals but it did so rather uninterestingly.  Somewhere around the end of the first third of the book he quotes Deleuze's famous passage about buggering other philosophers in the behind.  I've always loved the passage and til that point I thought the book was heating up so I had hopes of engaging in an eye-opening debate about Deleuze with both the text and my own preconceptions.  But what I got from that point on was a stream of endless, pretentious comparisions between what most people assume Hegel meant and what Zizek somehow interprets Deleuze to mean.    Basically, it seemed to me like Zizek's project was misguided in that it relied too heavily on a limited interpretation of Deleuze based on Zizek's slight admiration for the Logic of Sense and his disdain for Deleuze's work with Guattari.  Zizek almost comes off as a crying child who wanted ice cream when everyone else wanted cake and couldn't have his way.  He passes over without even the slightest mention the idea that perhaps A Thousand Plateau's truly is a revolutionary text (or radical series of texts - whatever).  He does this because he likes better the ideas he has developed out of the Logic of Sense.    In other words, Zizek is fatalistically attached to the offspring that emerged when Deleuze's logic of sense poked him in the butt.  The joke's on you, Slavoj 
 We loved Murphy's "Henry the Fourth", but we didn't particularly like this book.  While the artwork is delightful, the rhymes are clumsy, and worse, the premise just is not very interesting.  At least, finding out what happened to the cow's utter-mittens did not engage my kids (almost 3 and 5).    On the plus side, the book did give my almost 5 y.o. and myself a place to start talking about even and odd.  And the way that the artist showed the pairs of mittens and the missing mitten in outline made it easy to point out what the story was taking about.    But I'd give this book a pass unless you are desparate to find an edutainment introduction to even/odd numbers 
 I bought the shark with hopes that it would save my kitchen and bathroom from hard to reach grime and stains that wouldn't come off any other way. It was sadly only a mediocre help to my housework. The shark does a good job of removing the grime that lives around faucet handles and in the jam of the refrigerator, but I found it totally useless when trying to clean the stove, or any expanse of tiles that was more than three or four inches. The process of cleaning takes so long, a person would go mad before they cleaned all of the tiles in the bathroom! I was thrilled to buy this product, but it didn't live up to my hopes and dreams 
 Cute bookshelf -- looks goods and serves its purpose. However, the tips of it that screw together break really easily.  We were using it at trade shows where we put it up and took it down once a week; it only lasted through 3 shows.  Two tips snapped off the last time we unscrewed it, even though we put very little weight on it when it was in use, and NO weight or funny angles on it when unscrewing.  Probably would work well if you never plan to take it down, but I'd question how much weight it can hold over a long period of time 
 I bought this set just for that movie and IT'S NOT ON HERE!! Why?! I am so mad 
 Contrary to the vendor's arrival date, one of my items have been placed on backorder for nearly a month. I was not notified about the change and only found out when I inquired by phone. The customer representative did not apologize for the company and did not offer any form of resolution for the inconvenience. The first product arrived in good shape and on-time, but I am dissatisfied with the customer service when a mistake is made 
 The best out of three guide books I looked at, and a must for the first trip to the big island.  
 The book is almost nothing about the garage you already own.  It is about fancy buildings with garage doors to use as offices, dwellings, exhibit spaces, furniture factories, archtectural statements.  If you want to keep your car dry, you will need to build another real garage 
 Inspired by his uncle, Eddie, who worked at an amusement park, Albom writes a well-coordinated tale of people who connect here and in the afterlife, which is described by him as a very materialistic ambience. The concept is old: a better life beyond and a reason for the people with whom you cross paths. There are concepts to be learned from the five people. The story is delightful and cavalier.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope and South State Street Journal 
 Having to study this book for an undergraduate Middle East course, I was wearily annoyed at Dr. Goldschmidt's illuminated bias during the entire book.  Chapter 3 alone is no where near a "history" but rather an author's editorial justifying any and all actions of Muhammad, including the slaughter of Jews during the seventh century for not accepting the authority of Muhammad as a prophet or messiah, adultery, polygamy, theft and pre-emptive war in support of it all.  Dr. Goldschmidt portrays the Western and Christian world as ignorant to understanding the great works of Muhummad and trys to pull any new student of the Middle East and Islam into his little realm of prejudices.  Any humane Christian or Jew who reads this book will be outraged at Dr. Goldschmidt's justifications.  I understand history is bias but history isn't insane.  This book most certainly deserves no praise 
 You loved Ender's Game, right?  And even though the next couple of Ender-related books were more confusing and not of the same quality as Ender's Game, at last came Ender's Shadow, the parallel story of Bean.  Terrific.  Then came Shadow of the Hegemon.  It is, literally, a shadow of the original talent and quality of the first five books.  The dialogue is tedious, the story line pencil thin, and the plot has a huge Achilles' heel (pun intended).  This is another example of a book out by an author (in this case Orson Scott Card) who must have been pressured to produce, because this baby needs more cooking.  It will make no sense if you haven't read Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow.  It hardly makes any sense at all.  Beware 
 When I read this, I was not expecting to become a commie, but at least I was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories (especially re Jews) that the authors came up with.    I understand that people accord this book some respect because it has influcenced many people.  But that is what hate litterature does.  This book is especially powerful in its attempt to find sharp class lines to allow the "masses" to hate 
 The battery does not last very long and takes a long time to charge. Very frustrating for kids. Not only that, it is slow and if you are not careful it can sink 
 I wanted to like this book.  I love Sagas of Icelanders.  I was ecstatic over the Poetic Edda.  Snorri's "Prose Edda" was frequently mentioned in my other reading, and I decided I would have to check it out.  What a disappointment. I must clarify that by saying that the Prose Edda is an EXTREMELY important book of immense value to students of Medeival literature (specifically Scandinavian / Norse / Icelandic.)  It is the single most complete record of  Norse mythology which we have today, and along with the Poetic Edda, constitutes practically the sole source of material for all books which re-tell the mythological stories.  But the Edda is, unfortunately, a book to be read only for the value of the information it contains; not for entertainment.  All of the interesting material in the Edda is re-told (in much more readable ways) elsewhere.  Snorri himself, in the course of this book, re-tells "Voluspa" (from the Poetic Edda) and gives a brief synopsis of the Volsunga Saga. Edda was written as a handbook for poets and scholars, to aid in understanding ancient Scandinavian poetry, which was thick with mythological allusions. Edda also provides guidelines for composing new poems using traditional forms.  It was written two or three centuries into the Christian era of northern Europe, when old pagan lore was already nearly forgotten.  Snorri's book kept his ancestor's cultural heritage from disappearing completely.  He treats the old myths very kindly, but is careful to throw in the obligatory Christian warnings about "false religion."  According to "Gylfaginning," (the first and most interesting part of the Edda) the Norse gods - the Aesir - were originally a tribe of people who migrated to the North from Turkey.  They were veterans of the Trojan War (!) so cultured and technologically advanced that they were regarded as gods by the ignorant folk in the lands they conquered and settled.  According to Snorri, most of the mythological stories are analogous to episodes from the Iliad. The second section of the Edda is called "Skaldskaparmal" and it is very tedious.  It consists of a mythological discussion between Aegir (the sea god) and Bragi (the god of poetry) in which Bragi explains various kinds of kennings.  A kenning is a poetic figure of speech in which a person or object is referred to by describing it in terms of another person or object.  Then that secondary person or object can be referred to by yet another substitute, down to 4 or 5 levels of circumlocution, all of which has to be figured out by the listener to determine exactly what the poet is talking about.  Kennings are like riddles, allegories, metaphors, and allusions rolled all into one.  A fairly detailed myhtological background is required to make sense of them - thus, the reason for the Edda.  A few stories are told which explain some kennings, but gradually Snorri loses track of the "conversation" that initially provided structure for this section, and the reader gets mired amidst interminable lists of poetic synonyms for swords, ships, gold, and so on.  Quotes from old poems illustrate the use of many of the kennings. The translator - for reasons which are certainly valid - opted to render all of the verse as prose, preserving its literal meaning [with allegorical meanings choppily inserted in square brackets,] but utterly detroying its power as POETRY. The final section is called "Hattatal" and it consists of a few verse quotations and three original poems composed by Snorri himself in a different style for each verse, with sections of prose in between stanzas to explain the technical details (rhyme, meter, alliteration, etc) of each style.  There's a total of 102 verses in the Hattatal, and the poetry here is actually somewhat interesting; more so, at least, than the nuts-and-bolts discussion of the fine points of skaldic composition.  In this section, each verse is presented in the original Old Icelandic (with modernized spelling) with English translation underneath. At the end of this volume, the translator has provided a handy eight-page summary that will tell you what you missed and/or forgot as you slogged in a bleary-eyed daze through Skaldskaparmal and Hattatal.  There's also an alphabetical index of names so you can look up things and use the Edda for what it was intended to be: a reference book. I'm glad I read it, I guess, since I am pretty "into" this kind of thing ... but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who is just curious about Norse mythology.  Sure, this book is "the Source" but you'll have more fun reading one of the dozens of more recent re-tellings 
 kitchenAid 5 ply was not what I expected.  Plus its all made in china.....GET THE ALL CLAD and spend the extra 100 on the 9 piece set 
 I found the book had some ideas that helped, but it was unrealistic in many ways.  I am spiritual, but I didn't appreciate the religious opinion it gave 
 I'm a senior at Oglethorpe University, minoring in English, and I have to say I was disappointed in having this text as my last assignment in our class "The Child in Literature" and as my last English assignment ever.  I found the characters flat and the symbolism overt and unengaging.  At first I thought that the children acted the way I expected them to because they are children.  Children are easily manipulated by their environment.  But as the book progressed, the reader could see each character take the expected turns, and land in the expected outcomes.  Cody needed a father, throughout the entire novel, so obviously he will emulate his father in his adult life.  Jenny is a brilliant girl searching for real companionship, so her end is just as predictable.  And Ezra.  From the monopoly scene in the beginning to defeat in his love life, I never once thought he would veer from that path, and end up any differently than he did.  A book that does not challenge it's readers, and does not invoke any hope in a different outcome, is a very flat and disappointing book.  Even the food symbols, or the name associations, or the exact mirrored images of some of the characters (Luke and his game, or Luke and his recorder, anyone?) are blatently handed out and explained.  I like what Tyler was trying to do, and I can take the characters for what they are, and maybe enjoy them, but as someone who loves to remove the author's intention and just delve into a text, this book upsets me.  Tyler leaves literally no room for interpretation at all.  That might make her a "good" writer, but it certainly doesn't make it a good book.  A book you can't discuss or argue over the meaning of seems pointless.  I can see myself in every one of those characters, but I didn't learn anything from it.  This, to me, seems like light beach reading.  Though the subject is so dark, I don't think I could even recommend it for that. 
 Actually I have not read this book and probably won't anytime soon.  I understand there is more than one side to everything but am totally offened at the response to Dr. Barach from ISSD.  The organization helped me tremdously when I first found out I had MPD/DID.  I could not find Dr. Barach's response anywhere on here but I would think that in defending the organization the Dr. is also defending those of us who have a legitimate diagnosis of MPD/DID 
 Hey, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Yoshimi, but this is just atrocious. Maybe I just don't get it, but I don't want to have to "get" random sounds with Wayne screeching in the foregound. The point of music is for me to listen to it and enjoy it, not be constantly confused about what is coming out of my speakers. Nothing on here comes even close to the greatness of (in order):  Do You Realize? Are You a Hypnotist? Fight Test Yoshimi part 1 Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell Suddenly Everything Has Changed  The only two songs semi worth listening to on this album are: Vein Of stars Pompeii  Download these two and don't waste your time on the rest 
 I'm such a big fan of Tori Amos and Kate Bush that I gave this album a chance to grow on me and really, really tried to like Charlotte too.  The problem is she sounds like such a knockoff of her influences all I can hear is her copycat style, no true depth or originality.  No offense to her fans but sorry, I have to agree with the minority here and say she needs to develop a little more of her own musical identity and stop sounding like her mentors.  If you think you like Charlotte but don't have all of Tori and Kate's work in your library yet, I suggest you start there. For now, I'll give Charlotte two stars for potential. 
 I may not be a teenager anymore, but I too have suicidal tendencies occasionally. After reading this book, it doesn't seem to be a big deal to actually go through with it. In fact, it sounds pretty neat! Thankfully, as an adult, I still have some good sense left to decide against it everytime that thought crosses my mind. This book would have a tragic result in the hands of a suicidal teenager. Of that, I'm certain. However, unlike most other reviewers, I do not believe Anne Puryear had ulterior motives other than to help others in similar cirmcumstances. I do not believe she is the epitome of evil like some have portrayed her. One reviewer even went so far as to suggest Puryear intentionally drove her son to suicide so that she could write about it and make tons of profit. Those types of allegations are absurd and heartless when the simple fact remains she only meant to help. Nothing more, nothing less. Unfortunately,she was too grief stricken to realize how her book might do more damage than good. That's where her fault lies. All other accusations are ridiculous and border on the bizarre 
 Amazing how a writer can attempt to make an immoral organization, the corporation, look moral. Only someone like Al Capone could sympathize with this group on the Oregon. How can anyone justify having the sort of firepower as is on the Oregon. The US apparently is willing to finance the group, but the US also financed Sadam, Noriega, ... Unfortunately, in this sense it is too much like real American policy, which absolutely disgusts me (the ends justify the ends no matter how many bodies are left behind, as long as they are not righteous Americans). The characters are clichï¿½, there is no suspense since everything goes as planned, and anyone in the crew can just about do anything, including being a successful rock band. It makes me look back on the Dirk Pitt books and wonder about Dirk's morality 
 Most everything included here is common sense.  There are a few important concepts included here, but they are better covered in other texts 
 The author reviews mathematical history but mentions no India nor China. He presented a biased view of mathematical history. The books is misleading in that regard 
 Well, if anything this was a decently written story, with good dialect and character detail. However, this story felt like it was going around in circles without any indication of ever ending. Grafton seems to have an idea of where she wants to go with this story but never really gets there.    The story starts off with PI Kinsey Milhone in her office at night when she hears a knock on her door. She opens it to find Janice Kepler, mother of Lorna Kepler standing before her with the tale of her daughter's mysterious death. Not only this, but she also explains to Kinsey about how no one ever solved the murder because Lorna's body was left to decompose for ten months in her isolated cabin house. They talk for a while about the strange circumstances surrounding her daughter's death until Janice tells Kinsey about a pornographic video that was sent to her house after Lorna's death. This tape leads Kinsey on a wild goose chase of suspects in the red light district and gets her nowhere when it comes to turning over the real murderer.   	Millhone dives even further and searches through the world of Lorna's day job where she uncovers a mysterious lead about an expensive, elaborate project which is angering several people a considerable amount. Kinsey also checks up on Lorna's family members, and with the exception of Janice, all seem to have a motive to murder her Lorna.  	 Not being a fan of these types of novels, I decided to at least give it a chance but this story got me nowhere. By the middle of the novel I wanted to give up and skip to the end of the story, but when I got to the end I had to go back to the middle to figure out how everything ended. I stopped caring about the whole murder after so much more emphasis was placed on so much side stories and it seemed like Grafton did too. The ending left me with a strange feeling and I didn't know if the book had actually ended. All in all, it was just not the right kind of book for me but if you're a murder mystery fan, try any other of Grafton's alphabet themed novels besides this one 
 This is supposed to be a good book, a life changing book, but its a hard read. A hard read. I find it boring myself. 
 I think the story wasnt that great.I didnt think it was very good because it was only about mainiac magee running away and him beating every one in all the sports 
 In 1872 Charles Darwin's "The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals" addressed how emotions were an evolutionary adaptative process of the human species. In that book and in other similar books since (e.g., Johnston's "Why We Feel: The Science of Human Emotions," 1999), evolutionary biologists have shown that the adaptative function of emotions is to get us moving very quickly without having to rationalize or think about imminent perils as we had to do in our earlier hunter-gather society. In 1995, Daniel Goleman in his pioneering book "Emotional Intelligence" brought many of these evolutionary and scientific ideas to the attention of modern readers, advocating much greater attention be paid to developing healthy emotions in all of us, beginning in grade school and in the home. Now, Goleman returns in a book that highlights a symposia consisting of philosophers, psychologists, doctors, and the Dali Lama to see what insights Eastern thought in general, and Tibetan Buddhism in particular, might glean for us. The effort, while noble, has very little to recommend it.  Most of the book tangentially describes the goings on of the symposium itself; hardly electrifying knowledge! The rest of the book tries to correlate (where possible) Eastern Buddhist thought about emotions with the modern Western scientific paradigm. Often, this is no more than using Tibetan language for English terms. The neo-Darwinian prototype is occasionally raised, but never fully addressed. Then, in a systematic fashion, the emotions, affects, afflictions, emotional balance, etc., are described in a metaphysical context of how the Dali Lama and other lamas regard Western insights. Some spiritualists, transcendentalists, Eastern philosophers, and religionists may find the Dali Lama's comments insightful, but I found them bordering on the naive and over simplistic. Don't we already know (in the West, at least) that some emotions are healthy while others are simply inappropriate? It doesn't require new semantics in old wineskins to show us what we already know.   There's no question that some of the emotions we've developed over epochs of evolution no longer serve our modern-day purposes (although this isn't even explored). Further, there's no question that some people have either excessive or deficient emotions that could benefit from a reappraisal and some reeducation. For example, while anger in some people may precipitate compassion for the injured or harmed (a good effect), others blow off steam with weapons, familial abuse, and inappropriate agitation (bad effect). So, what's new about this insight? Nothing. Goleman does devote a chapter to writing about "schooling" the good effects from bad, but I found the reeducation slender and lanky (e.g., "our secular goal should be to support a healthy emotional immune system"). The analogy and metaphor are quaint, but not very descriptive or prescriptive of the reeducation program.  Emotions, according to most scientists as opposed to the doctrinaire religionists, are generally regarded as a normal and healthy part of our intrinsic human nature (see Johnston, supra., Pinker, "How the Mind Works," Wright, "The Moral Animal," Ridley, "Origins of Virtue," Sober & Wilson, "Unto Others," et alia). For those who suffer from inappropriate emotions, and obviously many people do, there are excellent self-help books (e.g., Cohen, "What Would Aristotle Do?" Ellis, "A Guide to Rational Living," Nussbaum, "Therapy of Desire," Burns, "Feeling Good," et alia). Reading the signposts from Eastern philosophy does little to inform us either about our emotions or how to control the inappropriate ones. Giving Western concepts Tibetan names does little to nothing to edify. Unlike Goleman's earlier book, this book not recommended 
 Just not funny, I returned the book and got my money back 
  i had heard of cannibal ferox for quite some time before watching it. i heard that it was the most violent film ever made. i enjoyed umberto lenzis eaten alive and thought this would be even better. i was dead wrong. cannibal ferox is a boring, unpleasent film that definatly doesnt live up to its infamous reputation. im not saying that cannibal ferox isnt gory or violent but i cant see how it was ever banned in 31 countrys. the few gore scenes are pretty effective, but that dosnt make up for the films many many flaws. if it was for giovanni lombardo radice[one of my favorite italian horror actors] starring in it, cannibal ferox would only earn 1 star. 
 O'Reilly is looking out for the elite interests who pay him and give him a platform.  He certainly isn't looking out for the general public.  In fact, he regularly attacks the civic organizations that the American people have created like the ACLU (which protected Limbaugh's medical privacy), the NAACP, unions, the National Organization of Women, and many other groups and individuals who are doing all sorts of worthwhile work. I feel sorry for those who are so isolated and intellectually impoverished that they take O'Reilly seriously.  If people need help to think through O'Reilly's brand of elite propaganda, they can check out DVDs like "The Corporation" and "Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media." See also good radio shows like Democracy Now!, Alternative Radio, and Head on Radio with Bob Kincaid.  "Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people.  To destroy this invisible government, to befoul the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politicians (and, I'd add, corrupt radio hosts) is the first task of statemanship of the day." -Theodore Roosevel 
 If you don't know anything much at all about Shakespeare and film and if you like criticism that is almost pure description with little argument or analysis to weight you down, then you'll probably like this book.  For scholars in the field, however, the book will be a major disappointment 
 We buy many dvd's and I can't remember the last time I actually said to myself I can't take it anymore. This is the most confusing and boring movie I have ever seen. If there is supposed to be a point to it, neither one of us could find it. I think it would have been less painful to have teeth pulled than to watch this movie. 
 While this is a great movie, this DVD reproduction does it severe injustice. The sound track is out of sync and the production quality of the DVD is marginal 
 I saw on the cover it said something about the New York Times bestseller list, so I kept reading (for a while) since I thought it must have something good in it to get on the list.  Well, it never did!  It's just a bunch of ridiculous long-winded drivel that couldn't get to the point.  The author dragged out the most boring unimportant acts for pages upon pages upon pages, and nothing ever happens.  The LONG descriptions are of something like Val whining ad nauseum how she doesn't want to go to this memorial service, or Jake acting crabby on the plane, or how Val sat around for hours looking at Tony's picture in her apartment, etc.  Anyway, I don't know how it got on the NY Times list, that's for sure 
 This essay may be worthwhile reading for someone getting started in the sport but it useless for the experienced sportsman. Little more than a superficial retred of what so many others have written. Save your money and buy something from the classic outdoor writers like Ruark, O'Conner, or Gene Hill. You could also try the nature writers like Teale, Carrighar, Thompson-Seton, Paul Brandreth, John Taintor Foote or many others 
 Jimmy Carter used to be my favorite ex-president. Now, it seems he has aged beyond the point at which he can reason clearly. He goes on Larry King to criticize a former colleague (Zell Miller) for standing in support of the President, AND writes a book, for which he will probably make millions of dollars, to do more of the same. He is using his roles as elder statesman (well-deserved) and Nobel Laureate (well-deserved) to undermine our country; but seems to have forgotten that he was impotent while our hostages were held in Iran for 444 days. You know the saying: "them what can't do, teach". If one of the virtues of aging is exploitation of public opinion for your own advantage (or that of your party), Jimmy Carter is VERY virtuous.    
 I've seen and heard Sheryl live when she's not surrounded by rock and roll dinosaurs.  She's great - she's hip, self-assured and kicks butt!  But here, she tells the audience in "Leaving Las Vegas":  "I'm playing Central Park tonight... but I have some friends coming up so can you be patient...Please? For lil' ol' me? Be very patient...." almost begging the audience not to walk out while she's singing solo.  It's almost as if she knows that the audience will have to suffer her solo attempts until the "friends" arrive.  The irony is that Sheryl solo is the best part of the album.   With the others on board, we can't see what Sheryl can do, and those familiar with her know that Sheryl is capable of a lot.   She's overwhelmed by Keith Richard, Stevie Nicks, Eric Clapton, Chrissie Hynde and by including so many rock gods she herself is diminished in importance and stature.  Her songs "It Don't Hurt" and "There Goes the Neighborhood" stand out on the album showing that Sheryl can rock harder and better than any of her "friends." Too bad she didn't include "Am I Getting Through" -- the Part 2 of that was a great rock moment.  Natalie Maines' grating voice (like fingernails on a chalkboard) completely ruin "Strong Enough."  Chrissie sounds like a zombie on "If It Makes You Happy", Sarah McLaughlin is so hopelessly unhip and white-bread in her Lilith-Fair mode that she adds nothing to "A Difficult Kind"...in fact, by the end of the song Sarah seems to disappear from the song as Sheryl belts it to the end.  That's Sheryl's song and should remain so,  Tombstone Blues stands out for its guitar work and the best part of "All I Wanna Do" is the New York audience.  Happy, White Room and Gold Dust Woman are three classic rock standards, so overplayed that anyone who grew up to 70's FM AOR radio has heard them ad nauseaum.  Problem here is that nothing new is added to them, they sound like karaoke versions.  Despite Sheryl's plea for patience, I was bored with the old-timers.They didn't bring Sheryl's career forward, only backwards 
 It's true that a woman's general health may play a role in her fertility (and certainly in her ability to carry a healthy pregnancy), and that certain medical problems can drastically increase the risk of infertility (untreated polycystic ovary syndrome, STDs).  This book might be useful in suggesting some testing that women in their early 30s might do to help them decide how long it might be relatively safe to delay trying to conceive.  But this book also contains some of the same hype that makes women mistakenly confident that they can easily get pregnant with their own eggs after age 40 (or even 45!):  "You can have it all. A challenging career. A satisfying personal life. A loving mate. And a baby when you're ready." (back cover)  "In addition to the women's revolution and the technological boom weighing in on the age of childbearing, it's become downright fashionable to be a mature mom. Our superstars are looking more capable and beautiful than ever with a baby in tow, including Geena Davis (first-time mom at age 46), Madonna (second-time mom at 41), Kim Basinger (gave birth at 44), and Susan Sarandon (who had babies at 39, 42, and 45). Former *cover* girls are now focused on their *baby* girls (and boys) including over-40 moms Christie Brinkley, Iman, and Cheryl Tiegs (mother of twins at 52 who used a surrogate to carry the babies, although the eggs were her own)." (pp 4-5)  It's true that most women can get PREGNANT and GIVE BIRTH in their 40s, but what this isn't telling you is that a very significant percentage cannot get pregnant with their own eggs in their 40s, and a majority cannot get pregnant with their own eggs in their late 40s.  If a woman is happy to go through several cycles of in vitro fertilization, spend tens of thousands of dollars for the medical procedures and the egg donor, and become pregnant with the genetic baby of another woman (as most of the celebrities mentioned above did), then yes, medical technology has much to offer - and that's wonderful! I don't at all mean to suggest anything negative about this way to become a mother.  But many women reading the tabloids and this book may not understand that that route (or adoption) is the route that they very well may HAVE to take if they delay childbearing until their 40s or perhaps even to their late 30s.  As a woman who didn't find my husband and marry until age 35, I understand well that there are plenty of weighty reasons not to have children younger, and I'm all in favor of options.  But I hope women's decisions will be informed ones.  This book is a mixed bag when it comes to helping women be informed 
 The movie is widely considered a classic for Hong Kong action movies.   Leslie Cheung is a fantastic actor, and I enjoyed Bridgitte Lin very much in Chungking Express.  So, even though I don't normally enjoy action movies and certainly not kung fu movies, I still decided to watch this movie.  I was extremely disappointed.  The cinematography is boring and poorly done.  The plot is juvenile.  It is the type of movie that would appeal to teenage boys.  I hated the movie.  However, I fully understand that many, many people love the movie and that it is one of the most important HK movies ever made.  
 Don't buy it, I'll sum it up for you...give 10% of your earnings to God or in doing God's work and then watch the bucks roll in. 
 Certainly the subject material is interesting. It's the writer's style that is lacking.  It's like she is writing a thesis for university and has to increase the size of the paper and so she writes on and on.  It's overly scholarly and analytical when the reader just wants the story/history of these courtesans.  As others have said, I mostly skim-read it,  skimming over the paragraphs to try to pull out the tidbits of interest 
      Do we really need another Mencken biography, especially one as disparaging as Terry Teachout's?  Mencken haters already have Kemler's viewpoint and Angoff's discredited account (Teachout draws from both).  The rest of us can choose from the more detailed versions of Goldberg, Bode, Manchester and Hobson, though Mencken's autobiographical works are preferable.       Why does Teachout wish to discredit Mencken?  Is he another government or religious sycophant?  Could this otherwise obscure journalist be jealous of Mencken's talent, fame, accomplishments and free speech?  Does Mencken's dismissal of his precious Henry James rankle?  Won't his publisher accept accuracy?  Perhaps the reason is buried in the "About the Author" page at the book's end:  Teachout is a jazz musician, and Mencken hated jazz.  If Teachout also likes disco, I sure don't want him writing my bio (not that I rate one).  Since Teachout doubtless considers his book's title derisive, let's return the favor and dub him The Virtuoso.       "The Skeptic" is more subjective commentary than biography.  Ideally, a biographer should stick to the facts; bias, in either direction, belongs on the op-ed page.  The Virtuoso faults another Mencken biographer for trying to copy Mencken's style, yet he falls into the same trap.  He also copies from his own introduction to A Second Mencken Chrestomathy.  Several typos betray a poor job of proofreading.  Little new is added; most of the Mencken quotes can be found elsewhere.  While reading it, I kept stopping to consult Mencken's far superior writing.  I never felt like I was actually there.       Rather than choose a defining moment in Mencken's career, such as his coverage of the Scopes trial or his agreement to review books for The Smart Set, The Virtuoso begins his meandering prologue with the 1934 Gridiron Club speeches that he claims sparked Mencken's lasting hatred of FDR.  Mencken wrote against Roosevelt II since at least 1920; after FDR became president, Mencken waited until Prohibition ended before attacking the New Deal.  Perhaps Mencken wrote more about FDR because he was president for so long, but he had a valid point, since Roosevelt II was as close to a dictator as America came until Bush II stole the election.  Besides, Mencken was at least as hard on Hoover, Coolidge, Harding, and Wilson.       The Virtuoso wonders why Mencken could write "I am thus inclined to believe that the world is constantly growing better, at least on its more enlightened levels....Every time the scientists take another fort from the theologians and politicians there is genuine human progress" during World War II.  Should we examine his own commentary during the Iraq wars?  He also claims, "Mencken failed to grasp the full extent of Nazi Germany's depravity".  As early as May 12, 1933, Mencken wrote in a private letter, "...by talking and acting in a completely lunatic manner, Hitler and his associates have thrown away the German case and given the enemies of their country enough ammunition to last for years."  He later wrote, "I dislike all of Hitler's ideas save one, and that is the idea that England should keep out of Central Europe."       The Virtuoso claims that Mencken wrote no more fiction after 1904, completely ignoring A Book of Burlesques, published more than 10 years later.  He calls Clarence Darrow an atheist; Darrow was an agnostic.  He quotes Mencken's conclusion that "journalism is not an exact science":  neither, apparently, is biography, when conducted by today's journalists.       Mencken's inconsistencies bother The Virtuoso.  He notes that Mencken had -- and met -- tight deadlines during his Smart Set years, then complains that Mencken's writings lack depth.  How, exactly, is that consistent?  Among his various categorizations, The Virtuoso accurately calls Mencken a contrarian, though only once.  Had he followed up on this description, perhaps he'd have found some consistency.       The Virtuoso plays only the tunes that he wants us to hear; one of his favorites is anti-Semetism.  Mencken spared no ethnic groups; he even insulted Germans and the English, despite being 3/4 German and 1/4 English.  His most vicious diatribes were against hillbillies, yet no one objects to that.  Why is deriding Jews forbidden while hillbillies are fair game?  If The Virtuoso wants consistency.....       Both sides generally agree that Mencken's political forecasts were right about half of the time; The Virtuoso allows Mencken only a few accuracies.  One that he missed was Mencken's prediction of Bush II's presidency in the July 26, 1920 Baltimore Evening Sun:  "On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron."  Step aside, Nostradamus.       Mencken's lasting values, among others, are that he thought outside of the mainstream, and his often timeless writings are a major archive of the 20th Century's first half.  Whether friendly or hostile, no biography can compare. 
 This is a decent collection of tales.  All the popular stories are included; however, there are some tales that didn't make much sense.  Readability is average.  I wouldn't recommend giving this book to a child to read.  As for a parent reading this book to his/her child, the overuse of colons, semi-colons, and commas can make for difficult story telling.  Overall, if you're looking for a good collection of tales by Hans Christian Andersen either just to keep or to read to your child, you may want to pass on this book 
 One of the things I love about Robert B. Parker novels is the witty dialogue between the characters and a strong, unique story line.  That element is missing from the new Jess Stone novel and is replaced with the 'f' word (Jess uses the word, Jenn uses the word, they all are engaged in the word and basically is the entire premise of the book) and continuous sexual references.  The entire book was disappointing. 
 Seller would not accept return or even respond when informed about it being the wrong product 
 I read for some time waiting for it to be interesting.  No such luck 
 it is pretty general,there is no such thing as advice or anything the like about practices.he insists in almost every chapter that the mission is the most important thing.the only intersting ideas in his book are some about leadership, but i felt very much that i already knew them,he only confirmed them.this is not to say i am a genius.i am 18, so i guess if you are involved in running a nonprofit for more than one year, you would be able to write a better book.  for a beginner it might be intersting to get it from the library, and read it in a train or so.  not bad, but getting a book on leadership,and other one  on marketing is a much better idea 
 Here's the scoop:  The stories and essays in the book are hilarious, but the audio version is not an exact duplication of the paper copy - some stories are missing, and others have been added.  That's only part of the problem.  David Sedaris narrates, and he has a very monotone voice.  If you sit there and listen carefully, you'll find the stories quite funny, but if you (like me) do mindless tasks while listening, you'll find yourself tuning out the narration without any effort.  Then you'll have to go back and listen over again, only to tune out the next part.  Amy Sedaris has small voice parts in the stories, and her voice is much better at grabbing attention.  However, her parts are very small.  I wish someone with a more enticing voice was chosen to narrate, because then this audiobook would be a gem 
 Rebeccasreads highly recommends WHY WE GARDEN as an almanac of helpful tips from a Pacific Northwest gardener's decades of experience, along with musings on the "Zen of gardening", & yet it is much, much more -- it is the story of how to take inspiration from the history of the written word, & epiphanies from global cultures.  Come walk with this gardener (who, by the way, talks to whales) as he plants a treeling that will live a thousand years, & get a glimpse of TIME as you've not known it.  Come sit a while in his gardens while he shows us the "temporal charisma" of the PLACE wherein we finds ourselves.  Come wander in this gardener's wonderings as he unearths the roots of our ancient yearnings about paradise to our more recent ideals of utopia.  Month by month, Jim Nollman takes us out where the wild things grow,  where spirit, mind & body come together in the most enduring of our "pastimes" -- digging up healing, planting hope & harvesting contentment.  WHY WE GARDEN is a mystery -- no matter where we do it -- atop highrises,  in window boxes, on city blocks, or where the trees outnumber the houses -- wherever we garden, that is where we dig up our souls & nurture our own unfurling.  Much to learn, relish, think on -- all year long, for the rest of our lives. WHY WE GARDEN is the perfect gift for your gardening friends 
 This is undoubtedly the best illustrated and informative guide to birds of North America I have ever seen 
 Five Osars??? This movie got FIVE Oscars? How sad is that? This is the culture we are exporting. This is why they hate us. Okay, I can see that some people like the idea of the poor, put upon patriarch finally standing up to his unappreciative family. Lots of deep, dark, disturbing images - we in America seem to like that sort of thing for some reason. What is it that makes it OK to celebrate old men seducing little girls? Okay, so he doesn't follow through - when she tells him she is actually a virgin. Would it have been okay if she had not been? Does that make it okay that he gets killed? That the only decent relationships the man seems to have is with children? And we're supposed to have COMPASSION for the character?  Kevin Spacey has taken some risks with his career, most of which I have great respect for. I have to say this one makes no sense. Sexy naked teenaged girls and images of Annette Bening with her legs in the air may make a lot of money, but there's plenty of that on the Internet.  The violence, the homophobia juxtaposed with homosexual imagery that only contributes to the phoniness of what passes for "family values" - perhaps it is the hypocrisy above all that so many could relate to.  I'm glad I saw this movie just so I can say I saw it, given that it seems to be such a cultural icon. Now I can discuss it if I have to. But it's a sad day when a movie likes this says something this important about who we are as a culture. A sad day indeed 
 When I bought "The Draco Tavern" by Larry Niven it was rated "4.5" or "5" on Amazon reviews.  I was disappointed; it seemed more like a "1" or "2".  Larry Niven has written great short stories in the past, but these stories aren't worthy of his name 
 Busy with a project of my own (Author of "Warrior of the Three Moons") I have finally found time to catch up on both the SoT and the WOT series. Now having worked my way through Book 8 of SoT and Book 9 of WoT, I am determined to end my own series in 5, possibly 6, books.   Ok about "Naked Empire." I enjoyed the parts with Zedd and Nathan and Chase. And it was good that Adie was back in the story. Those vibrant charaters basically saved the book. Having said that, the book could have easily been reduced by 200 - 250 pages. All authors, myself included, tend to inject our life phlosophies into our stories. Unfortunately, TG went overboard in Naked Empire. I found myself skipping over Richard's pedantic preaching. Hopefully TG will rediscover his story-telling abilities in Book 9.  
 I'm giving it two stars, though it may deserve one more, to balance out the rave reviews by others.  Take warning, this book is not what it appears to be.  The cover looks appealing, the subtitle is misleading.  There are better books to help you "discover greater creativity and artistic confidence."  (One is Paint Happy by Cristina Acosta.)  This book is mostly about keeping artistic track of your travels throughout the world in the form of a creative journal.  It does also include ideas for making business meetings more entertaining--i.e., by drawing your colleagues--but many of those ideas may not appeal to  stay-at-home or housewife types of people (which I am).  About half of the activities are less exotic, but there were too many exotic or really boring ones for my taste.  The book is not set up very well.  The chapter titles are clear enough, but the pages are sort of mushy looking.  It is not easy to tell at a glance if the page is a project page or a sample of other peoples' art page; it doesn't seem to have many projects.  The main media used in the book were drawing and watercolor.  The collage section was kind of nice.  Most of the projects are for pages in your creative journal, not for paintings you might want to hang up somewhere, but she does show you how to develop some the ideas into paintings, which is nice.  All in all though, this book just didn't appeal to me.  It should have been crammed full of fun ideas and it wasn't.  My advice is to look through the book completely before you buy it because it is an expense and it takes up space 
 but this is not saying mcuh because the rest are very bad. What each of these books needs are realy thoughtful thinkers who know philosophy, who i n this case know Seinfeld, and who have sense of humor to go with insights. Writers are dull, take themselves too seriously even when they have something okay to say 
 Jean should have stayed dead.  If you read the original stories after she became Phoenix there were many things that she still did as Jean Grey that meant a great deal.  Her and Wolverine had an odd relationship together as he grew to love her and she grew closer to Scott (Cyclops).  She formed a psionic rapport with Scott where they could keep in constant touch and share their love for one another.  They had adventures and the newer team members (at the time) became closer to Jean and fought side by side with her.  She sacrificed herself in issue #137 of the Uncanny X-Men and the readers really felt an emotional loss.  She had been someone we and the new X-Men came to know and care about.  The whole Phoenix Rising storyline and Jean coming back just cheated everyone of that investment in her character.  It wasn't really her that we were caring for and blah blah blah.  That's a bunch of crap because some of those stories from issue #101 (1st Phoenix) to issue #137 (death of Phoenix) were the best in Marvel history.  Jean, the person, was a big part of those stories and saying that it was not really her is just the biggest farce that a comic series has ever pulled.  I know that a lot of characters die and then come back but her death was so well done and played out and led to many other things (Scott leaving, team remorse, etc...) that bringing her back just really left me feeling cheated.  Basically it means Wolverine didn't really love Jean, but some clone or piece of her or whatever.  That's just dumb.  This all leads up to the Inferno storyline that was dismal.  A very weak conclusion to Mr. Sinister/Jean Grey/Madelyne Pryor storyline.  It was a poor poor poor (have i mentioned poor?) decision to raise Jean from the dead.  We had all moved on and had our memories of her and the glory days of the X-Men title.  The decline of the X-Men as a title is a whole other story.  The book stayed good for a few more years after (prob up to the early #200s), and had splashes of brillance here and there (Jim Lee art), but after Claremont and Byrne parted ways there was definitely a decline in the title culminating in the horrible Inferno storyline and the eventual splitting into 2 teams (another bad idea). So are Captain America's original sidekick Bucky and Spidey's old flame Gwen Stacy coming back too? Jean Grey coming back to life was/is a BAD IDEA!! A bunch of baloney! I still call myself an X-Men fan, but I am a fan of the large box full of back-issues I have.  All you younger fans out there (I'm 27) need to read up on the old school and see how great this series used to be 
 I bought the book several years ago and listened to John Talbott and others that have been harping on this topic forever.  Sure, a boom or bust will happen eventually but who knows when and how bad it will be.  In the meantime houses may double, triple, quadruple, etc.  The fact of the matter is many bubbleheads have been calling the top for several years and each year they are proven grossly wrong.    "The Coming Crash in the Housing Market" was written in 2003.  In the meantime, house values have doubled and my personal savings to buy a house are now worth 50 cents on the dollar.  Thanks Mr. Talbott!  In order for Talbott to be remotely creditable housing would first need to plunge to 2003 levels, roughly a 50% drop, and then it would need to fall more on top of that to account for what he argues in his book.     The sad thing is that when housing eventually does see a modest drop, the media will immediately praise Talbott and others like him as great visionaries.   Just wait and see.  The lesson I took away from this is that Talbott and other bubbleheads are fortunetellers and, in reality, have absolutely no clue what is going to happen.   They capitalize on peoples fears and make money doing so.   Save your money and do not reward the guessers with the purchase of this book and books like it. 
 what's the point of making this movie? the pain of the japanese youth lost in the crazy, totally pointless tokyo concrete jungle? a guy obsessed with a handgun, making a homemade one then finally got a real one with 5 bullets, then what? street gang fights, chasing, beating, killing, suicidal, wounds....what else this movie was trying to deliver to you and you thought you might get it? for what purpose? what's so deep in this clueless movie that you think you absolutely understood? you didn't really mean anything meaningful here, right? you just have to say it's so cool to show that you've got it. well, actually, this movie is such a stupid and pointless one, don't fool yourself, okay? if you're trying to tell me something meaningful about this movie, then you're just a pretentious shallow member of the generation x, y, z or whatever you think you are. grow up, guys.  why not just keep watching the 'taxi driver', then go to the bathroom, facing the mirror, imitate robert de niro by saying to your image in the mirror: 'you talking to me? heh, you talking to me?!' then raise your hand with your point finger, 'pow!!!' yeah, you're so deep. i just know it 
 Interesting experimental fiction.  In Big Trouble, Barry employs the technique of shifting protagonists so well that in the end the reader isn't sure who the story is about.  Characters are abandoned with abandon and neglected through carelessness, leaving a laser sharp focus on what the novel is really about--which is not the psychodelic frog.  It's something less original.  The genre is also well disguised.  Is it a comedy or a thriller?  If a novel is funny, can we take the thriller part seriously enough?  In some cases, yes.  When, for example, the comedy is built on clever dialogue by characters truly capable of mayhem.  In this case, no.  It's a little jarring when a comic cop is traveling around, chained to an entertainment center, while a teenage girl is in the clutches of a sex-oriented crazy.  In all fairness, the novel does feature a ticking clock, which is handy to have in a thriller.  It's more effective if there is something believable about the story.  I expected a novel with an overdose of silliness, but I was spared that, which was a plus.  No characters with absurdly meaningful names.  The nuts and bolts aspect of writing was competently performed.  While there was little depth to any characters, that's probably less of a requirement for characters  we want to laugh at.  The characters could have used some personality, but that's a common flaw.  The novel should have been funny in places, for a list of situations would show some potential.  But I had no difficulty keeping a straight face throughout.  Others would disagree.  The politically incorrect portrayal of Miami was entertaining, if not actually funny.  The overall effect of reading Big Trouble is to bring about a yearning for the days when an editor would say, "Sir, I know your name is a household word, and I know we could make money on whatever you write, but I have to turn down too many good novels to give a green light to...to something like this."  If there ever were such days.  
 Having heard so much about this revisionist school, I was propelled to read this book.  Such unscientific biased absurdity certainly has some motive behind it. Interestingly enough, many of the details within could be used as a treatise behind Herman Goering's testimony at Nuremburg that the extermination of Jews, gypsies and countless others never happened. They merely died of starvation in war-like conditions.  This book ignores detailed existing records that document orders and transport of Zyklon B for the vast death camp complexes.   How can one even concoct theories like those within when there are still numerous witnesses alive who watched Jews enter the gas chambers and then retrieved the bodies? (Sonder Kommandoes). Perhaps the eyewitness accounts of Jews are not admissible evidence to these "scholars"?  With regard to the author being persecuted and driven from his  country, I have no compassion since he and his family, unlike millions,  were spared their  lives.   My immediate family includes survivors who witnessed the Holocaust with their own two eyes. Isn't is a great coincidence that their stories all coincide with  hundreds of thousands of other victims? Were they all given a Holocaust Mainfesto after the war's conlusion?       
 I don't like this cd, in my opinion, the great progresses she reached with "Crystal Clear" was not reached with the latest albums. She's doing more of the same boring songs as in the beginning. I prefer crystal clear because it sounds more modern than this 
 This is a good product - sounds great, gets good battery life, everything you'd hope for in an iPod dock.  But it has one major flaw.  The iPod docking port is really flimsy, and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves.  After a little bit of use, the connection between the iPod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down, and sometimes the sound cuts out all together.  If they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the iPod wouldn't stress the electronics, I'd give this thing 5 stars.  But without that, it simply breaks quickly, and no longer performs its only job - to sound good. 
 Schuller desires to take the reader down a feel-good road.  Unfortunately, the path is littered with little more than cliches and pop-psychology.  The text is a series of sound-bytes which is easily equalled or surpassed in most any book of collected quotations, or, if one prefers, a Google-search under choice key words.  The road signs of the book (i.e. the gist of the text) are 1) you feel unfulfilled; 2) don't worry, be happy; 3) oh yes, and God wants you to be happy.  All the road signs are supplemented with the above-mentioned sound-bytes and pop-psychology.  In keeping with the spirit of the book, I took the path and stopped at Schuller's lemon tree.  Unfortunately the lemons were not good.  I then tried to make lemonade.  Unfortunately the lemons were so bad that no amount of sweetner could make them palatable.  In fact, it became unhealthy.  I tried several other uses, but all were equally unproductive and unhealthy.  I began to wonder why--then I realized that lemon trees, in order to produce palatable fruit, must be trimmed regularly.  The lemon tree at the side of this particular road is in need of serious trimming.  There is better and more nutricious fruit to be found elsewhere.  Even the old cliche "when life gives you lemons, make lemonade" is of no use when the tree itself is no good.  It is this last part that Schuller fails to adequately address.  Too bad.  I strongly suggest you take a different and more scenic road that bears much better fruit 
 This product is not very good. The speed registers at least 6 miles per hour faster than radar gun. Getting the grip on the ball correct to make it even register a speed is difficult and frustrating. Avoid this ball 
 I find it annoying that the author includes Chicago in the same tier as NY and LA.  How can the buckle of the midwest rustbelt be in the same league as the premier coastal cities?  It's absurd I tell you 
 This tepid,disappointing sequel is far better than Beyond the Re-Animator but dosen't equal a good sequel to the excellent original. Dr.Herbert West and his friend Dan re-animate dead bodies and when Dan's girlfriend is dying she is re-animated just like Bride of Frankenstein. The gore effects are good including the crawling eyeball but the movie becomes tedious and more predictable as it goes along. The new director Brian Yuzna does a good job taking over Stuart Gordon but this movie fails to entertain and make watchable that this looks like a Sci/Fi channel movie that would debut on TV and the movie is just disappointing compared to the first with a new cast(Except Jeffrey Combs and Bruce Abbott),lower production values and lower budget,and tepid to atrocious acting. If you seen the first your not missing much but for some reason you can recommend this instead of Beyond the Re-Animator.  
     Who was it that said there's a sucker born every minute? Never underestimate the sophistication of your audience? I am giving it two stars just because it is SO creatively contrived, and there is such an essence of authenticity- Down to the fake website with pen and ink drawings of the characters- yeah, like dozens of people just disapeared because an entity which is in fact a building itself called RoseRed, gets jealous. er... right. The fact that some academic phd found a diary at a flea market ...!! oh this is very clever.needless to say I read the book cover to cover .It's worth the 75 cents I paid for it. Good gimmick I say.   
 Given the nature of things online and how easy it is to misrepresent something as being *THE GREATEST EVER*, I am usually skeptical when any book has glowing reviews and it's only been out less than a month.  I hate to burst the shiny bubble that the other two reviewers have given but Christopher Hart's books are not worth the time or the money for the serious would-be comic book artist or established artist looking to improve.  Don't just take my word for it though go to your local library or bookstore and have a look at Hart's books yourself.  In all of his books on superhero drawing and manga style drawing, you will find no more than 25 pages of artwork done by Hart.  This book I believe only has 16 - 18 pages of art attributed to him out of 144 pages.    So exactly who fills out the rest of Hart's books?  A number of other artists who draw considerably better superheroes and villains in American, Manga and Fusion style than Hart can.  It's a shame those artists don't have their names listed on the book covers.  To even put Hart's name on the cover as though he'd done all the work (or even most of it) is very misleading.  Again, don't just take my word for it, visit your library or bookstore and look for the contributing artists listed in the first few pages of the book.  You will quickly find that Hart is good at drawing very basic and general characters but not the type of superheroes that populate comic books.    Now you might think well if the other artists are pretty good isn't the book still worth it?  No and the reason I say this is because I've seen them and most every one is light on technique and instruction. How light? Try a page or two at best on topics like facial expressions, poses, clothing etc.  There are better books out there which are more in depth and devoted to one or two topics rather than skimming over many as Hart's books do.  I can only guess that the popularity of comic books, comic books turned movies and videogames based on comics has served to fuel the book buying of how-to drawing books that have made Hart a best-seller.  It's also served to prompt many others to toss crappy how-to draw books out there as well.  Sadly, there's at least three worthless drawing books for every solid book on comic book/superhero drawing.  With the string of Hart books coming out seemingly one after another, that ratio of bad over good will only continue to grow.    I just hope that more people discover the truth about books like this one and not buy them sight unseen based on the sales rank or number of glowing reviews. Hopefully the result will be fewer sales and ultimately fewer useless books clogging up the market. 
 I am on my third off-camera cord (about one per year).  Two have broken.  As other reviewers noted, the four screws under the metal retaining clip on the "female" end of the cord loosen and eventually fail.  I have found that a thin narrow knife can be used to remove the black "spring" cover over the screws on the shoe.  You can then tighten the screws with a screwdriver.  If you use Locktite on the screws then they will not loosen.  Canon should do this at the factory.  I use this cord with a Stroboframe "portrait/landscape" grip which raises the flash over the camera by six inches thus eliminating red eye and providing a much more pleasing light.  The stroboframe grip comes with the right size threaded screw for this cord.  When my cords failed I lost the extended-through the lens metering just like another reviewer noted.  I am not a professional photographer and only use the camera occasionally yet the cord still fails.  Canon should re-engineer this cord to make it more durable.    Unfortunately, I do not believe that there are alternative cords. It looks like I will need to keep buying Canon cords 
 I bought two sets of candles from a Target store in Minneapolis and was very pleased.  You can't imagine my suprise when I recieved my online order. The candles looked nothing like what I had purchased previously. They didn't even look like the picture(not marble).  I let the candles burn for about an hour and half of the candle actually burned. This did not happen on the others I bought from the store.  I only regret that I gave some away as gifts and can not return them.  
 Extremely difficult to dig through the excessive examples in order to find the relevant theorems and results. Because of this, the problems at the end of each chapter become exercises in tedium, as more time is spent searching for the necessary theorems in the text than in actually working out the solution.   I do not recommend 
 I just logged in to see this item's price so that I could price ours for the consignment sale.  Neither of my girls was crazy about tummy time, and this didn't help that at all.  
 I got this book from the library after seeing it on a list of good picture books, and I'm certainly glad I didn't pay for it.  Sailor Moo is a terrible choice if you're looking for something to enjoy reading with young kids (my kids are 4 and 6).  The rhyme is loaded with words and phrases that are way over kids heads, and reads like it was written for adults.  I like a story that can be enjoyed by both parents and children as much as anyone but this one leaves the kids cold.  Skip it. 
 Overrated. OOooo, look at me, I write something weird. Oooo look at me, i'm so cool. There are rarely good parts to the story or interesting characters. The main character is dull, no question.  The writing is dull for the most part. There are a few pasages that are written well and inspired, but for the most part...I just finished it to finish it. 
 I found this DVD real cheap and bought it. I really tried hard to like the movie, but I just couldn't because the acting was incredibly bad, especially that of the bad guys causing havoc in the city. Even the guys who don't have lines display bad performances.   An hour into this movie you ask yourself why you torture yourself just to watch a bad sequal to a good movie. I broke this DVD and threw it out, something I've only done to 4-5 DVDs I felt needed to disappear off the face of the earth 
 The result of using Outlook the way this author recommends is that you'll essentially have two separate lists:  one list of all your projects and another list of all your "next actions".  Since you'll be able to sort your next-action list according to the context in which each action will be done, this arrangement is better than nothing.  But the problem with this arrangement is that with it, Outlook maintains neither project-to-next-actions connections nor next-actions-to-project connections.  The author would have you list "next actions" within each project's Notes field to link the project to its next actions, and the author offers no link of each next action back to its project.    The author has missed a simple, powerful solution to this problem.  When using Tasks in Outlook, the Tasks folder offers a heirarchical directory structure in which it's very easy to add folders and subfolders, just as one might do in Windows Explorer.  Each of these folders that you create can be named to represent a project, and the next actions for each of these projects can be stored within the project's folder.  Then all you have to do to see a list of all your next actions (across all projects) is to run a quick "Advanced Find" on your Outlook Tasks folder.  Once you get the criteria of your search the way you want them, your search criteria can easily be saved, allowing you to recreate your "next actions" list with current data whenever you want it.  If you include the "In Folder" field to display in your search results, then this field provides your next-action-to-project connection; and when you're reviewing your Outlook Tasks folder, the directory list of folders is essentially your project list, and within each project you see only the next actions associated with that project, so it's easy to maintain a project focus when planning your projects.  Also, when using Outlook this way, many additional Outlook features can be used as well.  This book offers a few good ideas, but by failing to describe a simple and powerful way to have Outlook itself maintain the association of each project to its next actions, this book cannot be strongly recommended 
 Dr Laura gives some good advice but it is mixed with absolutely stupid advice such as when she says that a person should stay in an unhappy marriage because of their commitment.  It is unfortunate that she chose to use this relationship book as her soapbox to promote her own religous beliefs. If you dont believe in God and as Dr Laura, you can never be happy is the moral of her story. Laura makes a number of irresponsbile and misleading statements such as calling daycare, modern child abandonment. She talks about chastity until marriage several times and about 'shacking up' to use her term but never once does she explain why monogomy is important in a healthy relationship and she absolutely never mentions that a relationship has a natural progression part of which is physical. She moves the step of marriage up to be much sooner than it should be in a relationship while at the same time saying people should wait 'through the 4 seasons' or a year before being married. Actually says 'it is dangerous to pursue a physical relationship without the promise of marriage'. Is she saying men should promise marriage before they are ready?  She would have produced a much better book if she had given more examples of callers to her radio show or letters and given less malformed advice. Her rants and raves are actually entertaining, too bad that along with examples were cut short with her religious promotions and poorly thought advice snippets.  I listened to the whole thing(audio book cd) and I couldnt list the 10 stupid things implied in the title. I guess they are there and maybe under chapters 1-10 in the book. I could call out several stupid things but I didnt see 10 that stood out. Lots of it was common sense and phsychologically off callers made it obvious.  It is fun to listen to but make sure it is not the only book you use as a source. There are other better sources for relationship info. 
 I'm giving this Better Than Ezra album two stars. And that's generous considering how bland and generic the album overall is. The two hits it spawned are the obvious standouts, with "Good" the better of the two. The bassline and song structure in "Good" reminds me of something off Green Day's Dookie. "In the Blood" is more serious but still quite nice. The rest of the songs are dull with a rock/country blend that surprisingly doesn't manage to be interesting.  There were many bands out around '95 that had this 'safe' version of Alternative perfected. These kinds of bands lacked the unique vocals, kooky lyrics, and bizarre perspective that bands like Sublime, Local H, and Goldfinger offered, while still retaining the same kind of overdriven guitars and bouncy basslines. Some other bands that churned out this 'safe' brand of Alternative and only had a few hits were The Rembrandts, Collective Soul and Toad the Wet Sprocket. But the kicker is this: I'd have no beef with Better than Ezra and their ilk if they actually put out a greater volume of hook-filled or at least memorable tunes. For a 'safe' Alternative band that put out a ton of great music, I would suggest Live's Throwing Copper.  
 My 2 year old daughter got this for a present and within a month it was broken. While it worked, she loved it and was very good with it. It was often frustrating though when she would push the handle down over and over and get no bubbles. Eventually, the thing stopped working altogether. I figured the batteries had died and when I went to change them, I found that the bubble solution had leaked into the battery compartment. I initially chalked it up to my daughter and maybe I didn't see her do something to it so we bought her another one. This one was broken within a few days due to the same problems. The concept for this is great, but is not worth the money at all 
 The collection of articles from 1991 to 1996 primarily focuses on differently seeing in manufacturing. They have missed a major  discontinuity, and used the fatal strategy in a time of change - listening  to the HRB customer's needs, the Hardware industries, with no prescience of  E-commerce or Web as vehicles for innovation. Harvard B School, like Sears,  had missed the chang 
 This book is about a man named Ray Atlee whose father has just died, leaving $3 million in unexplained cash.  Someone else knows about the money.  The three major questions for the book to answer are:  1) Where did the money come from? 2) Who is the mystery person (or people) trying to get it? 3) What will Ray do with it?  I have reached page 261 in this book, and NONE of these questions have been answered.  Ray has moved the money around, been vaguely threatened by person or persons unknown and had many conversations with side characters that all led nowhere.  261 pages in, all I know is where the money DIDN'T come from.  This is a legal thriller that does not thrill.  The pacing is deadly dull and I keep waiting, waiting, WAITING for something to happen and nothing does.  Finally I threw the book down in frustration an hour or so ago when I realized how close to 300 pages I'd gotten with nothing happening.  I don't know why I even gave the book this much of a chance.  Nothing bad has happened to him, and even though three million is at stake, none of the bad guys have taken any but the most harmless ways of trying to get it.  If they were really following him as much as it's alluded to in the book, they could have easily put a bullet in his head any time and taken the cash.  He spends half the book carrying it around in the trunk of his car, for God's sake!  I may finish it one day, but as of now I just don't care about the money or the characters who are after it.  Not Grisham's best, by a long shot

 This dictionary was required material for my first Arabic course.  However, I often found natives saying "we never use this" when I would ask them about translations found in the dictionary.  Very rarely, if ever, are the translations within it correct.  As such, it has found its place in my home as a home-made picture frame.  If you need an English-Arabic dictionary, you can't go wrong with Al-Mawrid.  I'd stay away from the Oxford at all costs.  It is so concise it has left out accuracy altogether 
 this is a wonderful value. full of fact filled fun. my 10 yr old grandson has every year. he waits until christmas when he knows he will get the new one. he compares it to the other records from years back. this is a wonderful gift for anyone and is great when also bought with the ripley series. it is fasinating what records people accomplish. c 
 I am on the last leg of this book, much to my relief.  It is terribly over-written, redundant and irritating to read. Jentz could learn a few lessons from Capote about creating a compelling narrative with an economy of words.  Ever meet one of those people who insist on telling you in great excrutiating detail about how they were wronged?  How every nuance, ambiguity and off-hand comment was a significant episode in their victimization? Even if they are factual, you reach a point where you just don't care anymore.  Jentz went through an unbelievable horrible experience.  Her recounting of the experience, is barely readable.  Go buy In Cold Blood and read it again 
 Words cannot describe how ripped off and disappointed I feel about buying this book.   Having read RDPD and CFQ in the Kiyosaki range previously and finding them great, I thought this book would be great as well. I'm sorry to say it's the worst book I've ever read. The entire book is a blatant sales brochure for all his other books.   There's all these annoying references where you get a little bit of information and then instructions that if you want to know more, you need to buy one of his other books. I didn't get any useful information and it's certainly not a 'how to' book. I thought I would be reading about him and his wife's story but all I got was the same few points said over and over again. He doesn't even try to say them in a different way.  The other annoying thing was his promotion of network marketing as a good business option. It was obviously done to help sweeten the deal he has with the network marketing association who recommend all his books to their members.   I could seriously go on and on about why you shouldn't waste your money on this book but I won't.  I have NEVER written a book review on amazon before as I have never felt so strongly about a book. I generally feel if I get even just 1 thing out of reading a book then it was well worth it. In this case I didn't get anything out of it and felt really used and taken advantage of which is why I decided to post this review.   I hope it saves someone else from wasting their money. Buying this book WILL NOT HELP YOU RETIRE YOUNG OR RETIRE RICH 
 I bought this for my son's birthday last night since he is interested in music.  As I was wrapping it, I noticed half of the keys were stuck in the up position.  I took it out and managed to bang the keys back into place, wondering how many times I was going to have to do this.  I decided to test it once I fixed it because the toy just looked horribly cheap with very thin plastic keys (you can even see through them).  The dollar store has better toys than this.  The sound is horrible and uncontrollable.  The controls are worthless.  I'm returning it today, and good riddance 
 I dont know how the people who wrote this book has kept from being sued. My husband was in the Vietanaum  war. The men that came home alive had every reason to speak against the war. Remember at that time government drafted so whether you believed in the war or not if you were drafted you went or went to prison. Its time Americans got their noses out of stuped shows like survivors and started learning something about their country and the coruption going on in our government. A poll was taken and published on t.v. and the newspaper and said sadly Americans were so uneducated about everything concerning even laws to vote on 70 percent of the people who voted didn,t have enough education to know how to vote on a issue even if they had a particular feeling about it. For the last year I have almost devoted 24/7 to finding out the truth about lies and deception in our government and the people who have run it, and it hasn.t been a pretty picture. From Kennedy on It seems like about 70 percent of people in power have been lets say not fit for command.I,m beggining to feel like Edgar Hoover I have pulled up so many unclassified documents, I can only imagine whats in the classified. All I,m asking is for people to care enough about America to take the time to educate yourself about this wonderful country so we can put people the people in charge to represent us that we can be proud of.  Had I been Kerry I would have sued the people who wrote this book. Is it my imaganition but it seems like everyone almost that Bush has associated himself with or nominated for office has been indicted for one thing or another, could Kerry have been worse?  I woudn,t trust anyone connected with Bush. Before I went to the polls in 2004 I had already pulled up 5 facts that were lied about Kerry in the campaign. Last year I pulled up Fraud in 15 states on the 2004 election claiming Kerry won, Last week I pulled up a 80 page document on the fraud in the Ohio election. Am going to end for now I could do pages and pages  I,m just a concerned Citizen that still believes in America and that we still do have some decent people like Kerry we only need to care enough about our country and do some decent researching before we throw just any body in charge of this wonderfull country 
 I thought the narrator was terrible. She is under the impression that people in upstate New York have southern accents.  Or maybe she never figured out where the story takes place. It must be the mint juleps that confused her. You'd think there would be an editor or coach that would notice this discrepancy, but I guess if nobody could be bothered to edit the author's work, they certainly couldn't worry about the narrator's accents 
 Judith Butler is out of her depth in her discussions of Israel, and (the new) anti-semitism.Readers searching for understanding of post-9/11 politics will encounter lopsided arguments here 
 Patti Smith has a life story so interesting and compelling that even an account this pedestrian and unispired is interesting at times. But that is because of the story of Patti Smith, rather than the writing here, which is barely above the level of the average People magazine article.  The author failed to conduct a single interview with Smith for the book. His entire "research" consists of reading other people's work- other articles and books. Hence nothing is new here and nothing feels particularly incisive or accurate.   The author prefers to list famous people who attended a performance, rather than offer any insight into what made that performance (the art itself) interesting or meaningful. He spends lots of time with catty references and lukewarm sexual gossip, and no time analizing what makes Smith's writing and performance so compelling year after year.  There is also an ongoing series of refernces to Patti being "mean" to Debbie Harry, like the two are jealous high school cheerleaders rather than important women in rock. These refernces are utterly pointless.   At the end of the book is the one interview the author ever did with Smith, in 1972 at her first poetry being published. Reading it entertaining, because you realize the author used every single word in the book itself, desperately trying to spread this pr puff piece long enough to make it seem as if he knows Smith and her world. Pathetic.  This effort is particularly galling because Patti Smith herself did so much (and does so much today) to stretch boundaries, to make new connections, to reinvent her chosen art forms. How unflattering a contrast then, to have this "biography" be so utterly dull witted and pedantic. A National Enquirer article would be more insightful.  The book also fails to take into account Patti Smith's tremendous sense of humor. Often the "source" being cited is a pr interview Smith gives as a book is being published or a record released. She says something really funny and facetious(probably to keep herself amused with inane questions). But the author doesn't get the joke and cites what Smith says as if it were some declaration of serious intent from on high, later contradicted by a different answer years down the road.  Finally, it takes balls for the author to imply Smith is pretentious while his own book jacket declares himself to be the "Poet Laureate of the New York Underground." I would like to see a recount of the election to that post 
 Embrace, though arguably the first "emo" record as others have pointed out, is simply anoying. All aspects of the record (vocally, musically, lyrically, and production wise) are sub-par. Ian Mackaye, though boasting places in two stellar bands (the now legendary Minor Threat and Fugazi, the latter my personal preference), does a horendous job handling the vocal patterns and lyrics on the album. Songs like "Money" and "Do Not Consider Yourself Free" read like scrapped Minor Threat lyrics far too pointless to be used, basic, (even then) cliched, pseudo-political rants (against greed, government, etc.). Also, Mackaye's voice does not suit the music at all, his monotone yell just sits there, not even melding with the music. He can't be called "off-key" simply because he does not even attempt to make any sort of recognizable notes. Musically, it is typical post-hardcore / muzak fare. Lame guitar riffs and repetitive drum lines (save for a few choice moments in which the music can be mildly enjoyable, and even catchy to some extent). Fans who think Ian Mackaye can do no wrong would do well to pick this album up, same goes for collectors and completists, but for listeners of music, stay away from this album.  3.5 / 1 
 Sorry to say I'm not a huge fan of Tanghetto even after seening them play live at La Viruta last month. Few of the tracks are just undanceable and the music gets pretty boring after a while. I say if you want neuvo tango try Narcotango or Otro Aires. 
 I was very disappointed to find that most of chapter 5 "Genetic Engineering" was incomplete. The chapter was cut off (on page 80) and was followed by a repetition of page 49-80. Chapter 6 "Why we should Worry" had been left out and the beginning of chapter 7 "Human Rights" (page 105-113) was missing as well. It was very important for me to work on precisely these (missing) chapters at exactly this moment in time, so I am of course quite dissatisfied with the quality of this particular product.  
 I have two objections to this book:- it's shoddily written and edited, and it is far too verbose (actually I have three, but I'll get to the third at the end).  First objection: Shoddy writing and editing.   As others have commented it's badly organized and wanders all over the place.  There are too many examples to detail here, so I'll focus only on one.  How to get software that allows the reader to try out the examples.  In the opening chapter (actually Ch 2 since Ch 1 is really more of a preface than an opening chapter) the author says "We'll use the easy-to-install Lisp in a Box", but doesn't say anything about what this thing "Lisp in a Box" actually is, despite immediately footnoting some obscure issue relating to IDE's and emacs.  And this is in a chapter titled "A tour of the REPL" - 'what on earth is the "REPL", I thought this was about Lisp?' says the curious newbie.  The mysterious "Lisp in a Box" then gets a section of its own a few pages later titled "Getting Up and Running with Lisp in a Box" which says that instructions on how to get this beast are contained in Ch. 32.  I breifly ignore the subsequent trivia about emacs buckyboard keystroke combinations and turn to Ch. 32.  Not there. Not a single mention.  In fact the magical "Lisp in a Box" is not mentioned at all in the book after p 38. and only gets 10 mentions in the entire book (including table of contents and index).  A brief google turns up a website, so yep I can download something.   Let's review the "... up and running" bit first so I know what I'm getting myself into.  I turn back and read the rest of the section.  Nothing.  Just more stuff about emacs.  Nothing "up and running" about it at all, in that section or anywhere else in the book.  So here I am, I've been given the name of some semi-mythical package that I should obtain in order to follow the book.  I've had to find the thing by my own independent means, and now I'm given absolutely nothing about what I should do next, just about 100 words on how C-h,t will bring up the emacs tutorial.  Now I'm not saying that this book should be something like "Learn  CL in 21 days", but really ... the author nominated this package, made a cross reference to some chapter at the end of the book, and in no way delivered on that promise.   Sloppy editing and instead I wade through paragraph after paragraph of non-information until I finally realize (at page 38) that the author has no intention of telling me anything more about this item "Linux in a Box" that he has felt so vital that it is raised in the second sentence of his opening chapter.  The whole book is in the same vein.   Time and time again, points are raised, referred to and dropped.  Second objection: It's verbose (see above).  In over 500 pages very little actually gets discussed, but we get a lot of admittedly very articulate, charming prose about not very much.  It seems to take forever sometimes to explain some things.  There is no way you could actually ever use this as a desk reference.  Trying to find that one thing that you don't quite get would take forever.  (The index is poor as well and seems to be machine generated as it's full of irrelevent stuff.) Some terseness would be greatly appreciated.  Third objection: Shockingly bad pedagogy.   The author doesn't create a solid conceptual understanding of the language before jumping into hard core esoterica.   The table of contents gives it away:- 3 chapters on very basic elements (Syntax, Functions, Variables), then we skip control structure (the real hurdle in learning lisp) and get straight onto macros (of all things) for 2 chapters.    To compound this the book then drifts on for another 20 odd chapters of pretty tedious examples, which focus more on implementation issues ("this is how to implement an mp3 database...") than the language itself.  Now the author is a charming guy (I've seen a lecture of his on YouTube which is quite reasonable in itself,  but it's over an hour where he mostly hangs it on Java rather than discuss lisp in any depth so don't bother), and he writes well (I'm giving it a second star for charm.)  But I expect a lot more from a programming book.  If you're looking to hack out some-n-dirty lisp to implement bog-standard answers to modern applications, this book is fine.  If you also want to get a few ego-strokes as to how you're using the ultimate-language-of-all-time-that-puts-you-right-in-the-uber-hacker-space then this is your baby.  If you want to really learn lisp, try Peter Norvig 
 I expected more from this book.  I pick "Six Sigma and Minitab: A complete toolbox guide for all Six Sigma practitioners (2nd edition) [Spiral-bound] By: Quentin Stephen Brook" as Best in Class to lead, guide an track Six Sigma Projects.   
 This collection of self-aware, music snob drivel is not completely about rock stars who kill themselves. Sure, that is a flimsy thread that the author goes back to every so often, but make no bones about it - this book is about an irrelevant person's relationships. This is only the 3rd book I've ever thrown away without finishing, and that's saying a lot.  I bought this book at an airport thinking "hey, I love music; I love pop culture; I love roadtrips...why not?". I put it down after 20 pages after the author quickly abandoned the premise of the book (the one marketed on the cover) and went off on a tangent about some relationship with some girl. I came back to it about 3 weeks later, ready to give it another shot. Two more relationship stories and 70 pages later I decided I was bamboozled and tossed it away. I just don't care about the author enough to be concerned about the one that possibly got away or the one that could never be.   Put it this way, if the book was marketed as a story of a man and his 3 tortured relationships you most likely wouldn't buy it.  He also is one hell of a music snob, throwing in some of the most obscure music references to make sure you know he knows his music. Add in that "Kid A" diatribe he went on, labeling the album as a phrophecy to 9/11 - an intentional reach of a theory. I haven't seen such stretching of lyrics since Nostradamus' words were transcribed.  Stay away from this clunker 
 After purchasing an SL that needed a cleaning I bot this book hoping to open it up and clean the viewfinder. I even had hopes of cleaning the dust from the 50mm summicron lens. My anticipation grew as I awaited this magical tome that would help me restore this old classic almost to its original condition. Then I received this book. I might as well have bought a manual on do-it-yourself brain surgery. Camera repair is not for the laymen and this book is not written for the laymen. It is written for the seasoned camera repairmen that may need to get the lay-of-the-land for the occaisonal Leica repair he has to perform. This book assumes the reader is well versed in camera repair. I put it on ebay 6 minutes after receiving it - nuff said 
 I agree with one of the other reviewers: The author's strong opinions really get in the way. In only 20 minutes of reading the parts available online, it's clear the author has made some grievous, dangerous statements for young people. First, the author states that sex is only for marriage and making babies, and that anything outside of that is prostitution. Um, no. I'm not saying we should tell teenagers to go screwing around all over the place, but this is simply wrong. To the author, even people living together but who love each other apparently can't have meaningful sex unless both reproduction and marriage are included. Second, the author cleanly disregards any mention of the existence of homosexuality. To the author, a sexual relationship must be one man, one woman, and marriage, period. And girls are only attracted to guys and vice versa. Third, the author claims for Christianity the "love thy neighbor" behavior, calling it "Christian Love" - you see, to distinguish it from Romantic Love. You know, because other religions or atheists don't care about their fellow human beings. Fourth, the author claims that Virtue triumphs over Evil. This is a fairly juvenile statement. Sorry, but it's only a general trend for the average human being. There are plenty of people out there doing evil things because they are good at doing it and not getting taken down. The statement that virtue always triumphs almost sounds like mind control for teenagers 
 Basically, the authors discuss a number of breakout and/or reversal strategies that are pretty well standard fare; I didn't see any 'breakthrough' ideas involving volume as I'd hoped for, save the usual accumulation/distribution stuff that can be found in any common technical analysis book. A few important points emerged, such as the idea that dumb money usually causes more violent accumulation spikes whereas smart money accumulates more quietly. Not really a revelation. Perhaps the main problem with the book is that it's simply overwritten and not written very well. Lacing almost every trading 'lesson' are personal accounts of the authors'---how he began trading, mistakes he's made, etc. Kind of reads like a diary and not a grammatically sound diary at that. If you were to trim all of the personal narratives, admonitions and pontifications about trader psychology personal or otherwise, you could rewrite this book in about 30 or 40 pages at a price less than half of what this one costs. Better yet, a book simply of charts with do's and don't would be far more meaningful because there is so much clutter and ineffectual writing here that it obfuscates what the author is really trying to say. The authors' foreign nationality certainly doesn't help, as he tries to sound colloquially American and it just doesn't come off right. If you're new to trading I'd look elsewhere. If you want to skim some charts and pick up a few points on breakout strategies and volume that you may not know about, I'd first look through this book in the bookstore before shelling out thirty or so bucks. 
 The other reviewer is right.  The bobbin gets loose and jams.  Mine even broke.  I've emailed Singer and asked for a new bobbin case.  Hopefully, they'll do the right thing.  My six-year-old did make 1 thing, and the controls are easy to figure out.  Threading is just as difficult as a grown-up machine 
 I have to say I agree with the prev. poster; this is just awful. Can you say "Norman Bates," people? Mom crawling on the floor to get into the kid's room? Weird.   The idea of the decrepit old mom being rocked to sleep by the grown man was so profoundly creepy I don't know where to begin. I'm surprised the next page wasn't Mom in a casket. *shudder*  Yes; these are some wonderful themes of acceptance, stages of life, etc FOR ADULTS. 
 i'v seen a multitude of documentaries, both low and high budget, and although i found the story interesting i felt this film was not up the hype it was given.  worth seeing, but not worth owning 
 This is not the usual quality that Playhut stands for.  The tent is held up by one plastic-corded pole that won't keep the tent upright.  My daughter gets trapped in it as it collapses.  The slumber bag is pretty, but the tent/tunnel is useless 
 I had a Hoover Windtunnel Supreme bagged upright vacuum in 2000.  It worked very well until sometime in 2003, when I replaced it.  I have a dog and two cats, so I need a good vacuum.   I replaced it with highly rated vacuum, that also worked well for three years until it started going downhill.   So I got another Hoover Windtunnel Supreme Bagged Upright.   This new on is a piece of junk.  I've had it two months, gone through 2 belts, and I'm ready to throw it in the garbage.  It's lighter weight than the last one, and doesn't seem to work as well.  It doesn't even hold together well - for example, the end keeps coming off of the handle as I vacuum.  Did I mention it just doesn't work very well?  Because it really doesn't. 
 I've read all of Iris Johansen's novels and thoroughly enjoyed many of them--this, however was not one of them.  I found the plot hard to follow with too many references to her previous book.  What mysterious event happened to Jock and Royd?  Who is MacDuff--well if you haven't read the previous novel, you'll never know 
 Why is this? Why are Arabic instruction books sooooo atrocious? There is sufficient demand for Arabic now and sufficient research in language education to come up with something better. What a sad testament that Al Kitaab is actually the standard in university-level Arabic instruction! It makes me want to rip my hair out. Somebody, anybody, PLEASE publish a decent Arabic instruction text. And, for all you publishers out there doing colloquial Arabic: EGYPTIAN!!  A third of all Arabs are Egyptian and it's the only dialect universally understood by other Arabs. So please quit with all the Lebanese, Saudi, Iraqi, Jordnaian colluquial courses until there is a decent Egyptian course available 
 An amusing book, in a rather sad way.  What this book is is a compilation of articles from prominent holocaust deniers, many pretty thoroughly discredited.  The problem is that the arguments are rather traditional, using theroies that were generally blown apart from an evidence standpoint long ago.  While the mental gymnastics are entertaining, they lack the creative spark that one might hope for.  In essence, if you are going to spew the idea that the Jews just wandered off, at least come up with something new.  Space aliens is a good one and hasn't been done yet.    Kidding aside, the book is a pasted together compilation of poorly constructed excuses for the Nazis and their genocidal actions.  It fails as serious scholarship and has barely a passing aquaintence with any type of scientific examinations of the existing evidence.  If you want to reinforce beliefs that the evil Jews made the whole Holocaust up and aren't troubled by poor writing and reasoning, you'll enjoy this book.  For anyone else, it's not really worth your time. (... 
 This is a hard plastic case that clips over the outside of your phone. The outside is a faux leather, made of plastic that looks convincing enough. All told it is an acceptable choice, trendy 
 The authors mistakenly believe the reader would be interested in ad nauseum details of their personal partying!  Nothing new or inspired in this tiny book 
 This book, though well writen, has to be one of the worst on the subject of writing.  I must say it does go into a great deal of detail, but that is where it stops.  The book is long and drawn out- definitely one to put you  asleep at night.  It goes into far to much detail on creating  "believeable" species, leaving little to the imagination.  This  is not a good book if you are into using your imagination while you writ 
 Having to study this book for an undergraduate Middle East course, I was wearily annoyed at Dr. Goldschmidt's illuminated bias during the entire book.  Chapter 3 alone is no where near a "history" but rather an author's editorial justifying any and all actions of Muhammad, including the slaughter of Jews during the seventh century for not accepting the authority of Muhammad as a prophet or messiah, adultery, polygamy, theft and pre-emptive war in support of it all.  Dr. Goldschmidt portrays the Western and Christian world as ignorant to understanding the great works of Muhummad and trys to pull any new student of the Middle East and Islam into his little realm of prejudices.  Any humane Christian or Jew who reads this book will be outraged at Dr. Goldschmidt's justifications.  I understand history is bias but history isn't insane.  This book most certainly deserves no praise 
 As stated in other reviews, this movie is a joke.  Granted the cinematography is good, and there's excitement, but if you film a pig flying and have good cinematography and story, you'd get the same 'excitement'.  I also am in Army aviation, and it's disappointing to have such a deviation from the truth filmed.  Many movies make some adjustments that border on reality and some go outside that boundary.  This movie transcends to another plane of existence and commits suicide.  If I were an actor and offered a role in this movie, I would have run away knowing the repercussions it would have on my career.  
 Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..?  And talking about the end...could it be more simple?   Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else 
 In a word: BORING!  This book would have been twice as good were it half as long. Selbourne has cut the end and would have done well to cut the middle as well. Jacob's incessant protestations of piety are tedious. He hypocritically condemns everyone around him for greed and self-interest but his own actions, though ostensibly high-minded, are also dictated almost solely by financial motives. For this reason his criticism of others rings hollow. His world view is remarkably narrow and parochial for someone so widely traveled. While he makes extensive observations of the conduct of others, there is no effort to appreciate their viewpoints. I am also skeptical of the provenance of this book. The social debates described have a very contemporary tenor and are relevant to our own times. If this were in fact an authenticated manuscript, this resonance would be remarkable. However, the provenance of the book is in dispute and much space is devoted to supporting its authenticity. The resolution of this issue must await examination of the original manuscript but in the meantime I am skeptical because the discussions seem too modern 
 This is a *partial* copy of the Mathworld material online at the Wolfram Research web site.   http://mathworld.wolfram.com/  It makes for a decent mathematical enclopedia, but there are many others around, which should be purchased instead - look on Amazon for reviews.   To most reasonable peoples thinking, CRC should not be allowed to make any money on this particular book.   The FAQ on the Wolfram Research web site  "Q: May I host a mirror site or create a personal mirror? A: No. The material on this site is updated frequently, and so any mirror would rapidly become out-of-date ...."  So if a mirror of the web site will soon be out of date, it goes without saying the book will too. Now I am one of those people who like to have hard copies of books, and would generally accept it might not be as up to date as the web. (I own a copy of "The Mathematica Book", despite it is all online for free).   But in this case, given what CRC did to Weisstein and Wolfram Research, I would not out of principal buy this book.   Also, I would suggest that nobody contributes to the Wolfram Research web site, as CRC get the copyright. I use the material on there, and find it useful, but I would not write something so that CRC can benifit.   As someone else said, send Weisstein $5, then buy another book. 
 In need of a fun, adventure read, I picked up an author I always seem to see on the shelves - Cussler. It was a fun, easy read, but I expected better from such a prolific author. This is a book I would have loved when I was 14 years old, but have now come to a be a bit more demanding of realism. I found the syntax and grammar of the narrator to be very poor, which detracted from the book tremendously - I was left wondering if the editor just rubber-stamped this one.  My main issue with this book was the sci-fi level of belief suspension needed to get through it *Spoilers*: 1) fully functioning artificial intelligence robots able to carry out casual conversations, circa 1993  2) Japan has secretly created a perfect missile defense program  3) an adventurer/underwater researcher sent in to take down a heavily defended fortress, instead of a trained team of SEALs/Delta/etc. 4) That a Japanese tycoon created over 100 nukes from one salvaged "Fat Man" atomic bomb from 1945.  5) That a super-secure vault would have a convenient ventillation duct large enough for a man to squeeze through.  6) Robots that drive cars 7) several ridiculously convenient coincidences that save the day  8) the usual near death witty comment, etc...  all in all, kind of fun, but don't think much or you'll ruin the plot. 
 I never saw this movie until i was 16. The girl i was dating at the time loved this movie. The rocky horror picture show was number one on her list so i tend to compare this one to that one not that the storys are similar in any way. But they do have one thing in common they are both horrible movies. I did give this movie two stars because it had some slightly entertaining moments, well so did fraggle rock! fraggle rock got cancelled for a reason! everyone burn your copies now 
 What makes George thinks he knows the heart of God??? George, MacDonald's "Knowing the Heart of God" assumes whom ever picks up this book is a Christian or is even incline to believe in (the Christian) god in the first place.  I don't feel the writer did a very good job of taking into account the fact that in theism there are many concepts of God not to mention those who recognize more than one god. Knowing the Heart of God did not explain why George MacDonald is any more qualified than the next Christian to "know" the heart of God.  Its interesting to note that if faith is all it takes then ALL religions are equally justified as Dan Barker so rightfully pointed out in his book "Losing Faith in Faith, if faith.  Woefully lacking in any critical analysis and mostly based the appeal to faith Knowing the Heart of God is the stuff of good reading for the Courier 
 This book is a piece of defecation.   It is difficult to believe this long piece of bad luck came from the same mind that brought us "The Executioner's Song".  Clearly those with a vested interest in hiding the truth have bought off Mailer, and he has been entrusted with the mission of creating an exhausting work of fiction.  After drudging my way through this unfortunate slime I have lost all respect for Norman Mailer, and will never read another word he has written.  The only thing that would be longer than this utterly pointless rant is the enormous mountain of known facts he must ignore to come to these delusional conclusions.  Out of a possible 5 stars, this book owes the scale 3.  Wretched. 
 I lived in France. I know plenty of fat French women. And French women who drink hard liquor every day. And French women who drink coffee more than just in the morning.  French women don't have the market on thinness by any means. People all over the world have guilt about eating and learn bad habits. The author starts out trying to be objective but her arrogance comes out loud and clear as the book goes on. And her dropping of French phrases here and there throughout the book are downright annoying.  Nothing new in this book. Eat less, exercise more. 
 Recently AL and Laura Ries released their latest book, "The Fall of Advertising, & the Rise of PR.".  Some may find this book extremely interesting, others may find it boring, and a book that gives the same points over and over.  I found this book interesting at first, but after awhile I just felt like throwing it against the wall.  But don't get me wrong, this book does has some useful interesting facts.  Let me explain some of the ups and down's of this book.   	Currently I am a sophomore in college, and for my public relations course we are required to read, "The Fall of Advertising & the Rise of PR."  But is it truly essential that we read this book for the course?  My feelings at first thought that this book really is helping me understand what advertising is, and what public relations entails.  Each chapter brings some new aspects of advertising to the reader, like art, commercials, etc.  These are important things to learn about when it comes to advertisement, but the way in which they keep explaining the subject of advertising just gets so boring and repetitive.  When discussing a matter in this book, the authors find it crucial to list about six to eight examples.  Is it really necessary to bring up all of these examples, over and over again proving the same point?  But are there any positive useful facts that come out of this book?  Well, at first the basic concepts behind public relations and advertising are good to introduce to a student who is new to the field of public relations.  The book also does have great examples to back up their arguments and points, but the way they go about introducing them can irritate the reader.  Is there anyway that the positives of this book can out weigh the negative?  No way, unless you need to use this book as a reference guide, or your trying to write a similar book, I do not see anyway of the positives weighing out the negatives.  Is there a certain group of people that would read this and enjoy it compared to college students?  I imagine that professors who teach courses related in this field would enjoy the book.  Also, any person who works in the public relations field would enjoy the reading, but pretty much that's really the only type of people I can see enjoying this book for what it is.   	Don't take this review too literally!  The book did have good points, and great examples.  But if the same points, and way too many examples are used, the readers are going to get bored and drift off, tired of reading the same points, frustrated, or just overall get angry that they need to read another book they dislike for a class.  This book could be used effectively, but reading the entire book or buying it, are not necessary for a college course.  
 Great idea for a book, but it felt really wooden. THe writing was stilted, the sister with cancer felt like a clumsy attempt to make the heroine seem likable and the whole thing felt really disjointed, like the author was putting in all the ingredients for a romantic comedy without really thinking about how it was all going to come together. None of the magic of Marian Keyes or Sophie Kinsella 
 This novel was our February Book group text. It was not hard to read and had a restful quality about it. Unfortunately it did not say very much at all to me or other members of the group. Many of the characters were underdeveloped and there were hints at interesting aspects of their personalities but it did not go any further than that, so left me with a feeling of frustration and irritation. I appreciate that her forte is writing about quiet village life and the attention to detail of very mundane events but I think this can be taken too far 
 I rarely write bad reviews, especially when it comes to exam guides after all the books cannot cover everything you're expected to know otherwise MCSE's would be little more than reference brains. The MCSE is not meant to be easy to pass and at the end of the day the book was written in 2003 and since then several new technologies have been introduced and added to the exams.  However, in this case I am unable to provide any support to Craig Zacker, the author. Surely, somewhere along the lines of writing this book he spoke to someone in Microsoft responsible for setting the content of the exam. However it appears not, and this book is a mish mash of content covered in 70-290 70-291 and 70-294. Now you may think he would extend upon the information provided in the previous books however this is not the case. Apart from content in a couple of chapters (IP and IKE's), I learnt nothing new from this book.   I remember when I started reading the book I was thinking to myself "this Is a little easy" as I got further through the book I though the exam would be a breeze, I was even skipping the practices since I was familiar with them from reading the other Microsoft books. It wasn't until I failed the exam I realised I'd been super "one nilled" by Craig Zacker.   To be fair to Craig, there are links in the book to "further reading" which do provide a lot of information to what you need however I didn't pay for a bunch of links and the book still doesn't even mention at least a third of the material on the exam.   Anyway enough moaning, I bought the box set and three out of the four books where well worth the purchase which is 75%, a pass by MCP exam standard so I'll let them off. However I have just purchased my Design and Elective books from Sybex publisher rather than Microsoft Press.    
 I can't follow the bandwagon of congratulations for Joe Dante's MOH episode; this is unfortunate because Joe is one of my heroes. I respect that it sets out to do exactly what Joe and co. wanted it to do, but in the end it comes off as more of an indictment of Anne Cultor than it does the Iraq War. But it isn't the politics that left me wanting in this particular film, it was the fact that Dante was able to make a balls-to-the-wall horror movie again (THE HOWLING being a particular favorite of mine), but that isn't at all what we get. In some ways it seems silly to complain, given that the war is true horror; but Dante is a monsterkid, and I was really hoping for something else. Again, I respect his decision and his choices with this particular story, I was just hoping for something a little more fun. Shallow perhaps, but I'm a B-movie maven all the way. I'm happy that he has received good notices for this episode (Dante is super underrated), and definitely recommend it to those who are not really horror, or B-movie, fans, who are looking for something with a little more substance. The film is well made, and very humorous (only Dante would crank the gag of having famous "zombie" directors names' littering a group of headstones up a notch by adding Del Tenney!), and I recommend it to those not looking for a "horror" movie 
 I remember this album well; you could hardly call it a 'barnstormer', as it was released well before "Under The Bridge" made them the bandwagon band of the year, but nothing could hide the fact that this was a band hellbent on proving the critics right--they never had a good album.  For every song worth listening to ("Suck My Kiss", "Give It Away"), there were at least four more songs that should have been discarded.  This album was and remains a perfect example of why bands shouldn't feel obliged to slam 50 minutes of crap onto a slab of aluminum just because they can.  On top of that, the vocals were pitched and pro-tooled beyond belief.  Some friends and I got a chance to see the band when they were supporting this album, and Kiedis was so off-key, it wasn't funny.  They drowned their sound in reverb so to try and drown out his lousy vocals, but the damage was done.  People were walking out in droves 
 Let me start off by saying, I have not seen the orignal Wicker Man. This movie kept me guessing all the way through, which earns it one star. I couldn't tell if Willow was intentionally mysterious or a victim of bad acting. I did enjoy Ellen Burstyn's performance as the "Queen Bee" so to speak. So many unanswered questions or things that didn't add up stop this from being a 4 or 5 star movie. I am generally not a fan of neat, tidy, happy endings, so that wasn't a problem for me, but the numerous loose ends were. Worth a rental, but probably not worth purchasing 
 For the life of me, I cannot understand why this book and so many others completely fail to mention Commodore and it's contributions to the PC world. 1st millionth computer sold with VIC-20. Most computers ever sold with C64 (over 20 million!). First multitasking, etc. with Amiga. etc., etc... Commodore created the first, affordable home computer. They introduced computers to the masses. While Apple was trying to sell their Apple II series for astronomical prices, C64 was being sold for 1/3 - 1/5 the price.  I trully hope that in the end, the historical accounts of the birth of a personal computer will give credit where the credit is due - Chuck Peddle for creation of the 6502 processor, and Commodore for creation of the most sucesfull computer ever made - C64 
 Bank goes off with out anyone in the room.  Our son loved it for about 5 minute 
 It's too bad that Clive Cussler changed collaborators on his "Oregon Files" series.  This was terrible!  I couldn't even finish it.  I read a lot in all different genres so I feel that I'm a little qualified to comment on a book I have read.  It dragged, some of the characters were changed and even though I know you have suspend disbelief, I couldn't keep my eyes open.  Golden Buddha and Sacred Stone were much better 
 I just got back from vacation where I read a handful of fun crime dramas. This one really stood out as being horrible from the very first paragraph. The writing is weak and the story was so incredibly thin that that killers were obvious from the start.   I'm not sure who the target audience is for this book, but my best guess is old guys who only read one book a year. There was a really strange mix of detail and inference. It was almost like he needed to fill space so every now and then we would get pointless detail about flying or some other random aspect of what the character was doing. And the sex scenes were just bad.   I really couldn't recommend this book any less 
 I had to read this book for a diversity class. Sennett uses language and sentence construction that is overly ostentatious and difficult to understand. Inside this fat book is a very thin book trying to get out. He needed a good editor. 
 I have always used foam rubber as a topper over our mattress but changed to this Memory Foam.  After using it for one month, I have taken it off the bed and it is back in the box it was shipped in.  I DO NOT like the Memory Foam at all.  It seems to be great when you first lie down on it and then after a hour or two my body just sinks down until it is against the mattress below it and I am not that heavy a person, 160 lbs. It is so hard to find foam rubber but I will search until I find it and never by Memory Foam again!  Doubt I can get my money back.  Have not talked to the Seller about it 
 check it. site got alot of reviews explains alot 'bout stuff. its...a cookbook, think so anyways: 1. lots of people say so b. books got a cake on the front 3. yeah people say so  theirs my proof got it all set for ya have fun ;)    
 I bought this for two reasons: because I wanted to learn about LBOs, and because I had heard that the journalism was good, and was hoping for something like 'The Right Stuff'.  The cover of my copy blurbed 'unflawed' writing, and 'all the suspense of a first-rate thriller'.  The last is true only if your expectations of a first-rate thriller reach no higher than Michael Crichton.  The writing is a plodding 'you are there' journalism-school pastiche of the New Yorker: Gulfstreams are sleak, CEOs are silver maned, side-kicks are bantams, lawyers look like they model for GQ, etc. Investment bankers bark, curse, are struck by inspiration, work off grudges and wave their lingams around at the sort of comic book level Stan Lee would scorn.  I finally realised, after slogging through the first 200 pages or so, that 'Barbarians at the Gate' is, in large part, essentially porn for aspirational middle managers.  There is no-one in this book whom I would want to know, unless I were a sociologist.  But I don't even trust the sociology, because the psychology is so superficial.  I did learn something about the process of LBOs, and for that a star is in order.  I didn't particularly enjoy learning it. 
 This book just proves that religion is something the world does not need. You can get the same effect of this book by reading a Dungeons and Dragons rule guide or listening to a Helloween song.  Avoid 
 This is not good literary exegesis, it is an unabashed apologia for a literary bureaucracy, another pamphlet of the endless "literary production" under the pseudo-Marxist homology of poststructuralism. It ends up merely as a political struggle to save Kafka for purposes of cultural and intellectual identity.    This book purports to get at "the real Kafka," by stripping the man and his work of all transcendent pretensions assigned him by critics of the old school, by making him a model for the new uniformed postmodernist-socialist man. In "Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature," Deleuze and Guatarri have done the same things they accuse the old Kafkologists of doing, in effect stripping Kafka of his old Kafkalogical baggage only to create a new Kafkology, one that focuses more on a weird interpretive biography of the man as celebrity than it does by trying to understand his works in their modernist setting.    
 First there are a lot of typings error but the most important problem with this book is that there are mistakes in formulas. Moreover I do not like it because it is not easy to use. The writing style is monotone and boring 
 I am so appalled that I contributed even one penny to this blatently anti-semitic, history denying xenophobe.  I only wish I could rate this a zero.  This book incites hatred and paranoia against everything Jewish.  He buys into every nazi and neo-nazi theory denying the ethnic and historic origins of the Jewish people. He refers to the holocaust as the "so-called holocaust."  Jews are simply Khazars from Russia who are removing native Palestinians from their land.  (Yes, I was already aware of this theory that has been amply and roundly refuted). He  makes the patently absurd claim that Christianity is the only religion that represents the Old Testament creed of Yahweh. (And makes no effort to prove it--He only goes into  talmudic "examinations" which are totally one sided.  Of course I doubt the authenticity of many of his talmudic quotes at all, but I am aware that the talmud contains everything "and its opposite." He doesn't bother quoting the opposite sentiments. I only wish someone had warned me about the content of this book before I bought it. I only hope that people will realize this author does not represent what true Christians believe. This guy is scary.  
 The reason I purchased this particular CD was for the title song.  However, I did not appreciate the fact that someone dubbed in an introduction by John Wayne that begins just before the song starts.  What was the point of that?  Who wants to hear John Wayne speak every time one plays the song 
 I am an avid reader of Ragnar Benson's books.I found most of his books very practical and useful for emergency situations. Un fortunately, this is not one of those books. I expected the book to be more practical in the sense that plants and other items found in the woods and local environment would be addressed as part of the concepts presented. This book is too impractical for my learning needs. Although this book is not up to par for me, I do recommend that readers explore some of the authors other works 
 I`m trying to remember what made me pick up this book. I know I wanted some light reading for the summer days sitting on the beach but the Face was so bad it took me a month to finish it. I literally had to force myself to read it. The writing is vintage Koontz to the extreme. Koontz likes to describe things that not many people really care about and this book is yet another example. I call it diarrhea.(Spell check)  I respect Koontz, for example, Odd Thomas is really good but the face is a story of a boy who is the target of a sick, demented killer. Thanks to some spirit who led a disgraceful life while alive, the boy lives in the end.   A good 200 pages could have been deleted from this book and maybe then we would have had something decent. My advice is skip this one.   I would love to know if Mr. Koontz is being paid by the page? The face makes me wonder.. 
 Get the other guidebook 'The Bugaboos - One of the World's Great Alpine Rockclimbing Centres' by Chris Atkinson and Marc Piché.  It is vastly superior to the Green guide, being written by the ex-Kain hut custodian.  It has many more pictures, a thorough description of approaches, descents, equipment, weather, history, maps, etc.  If you buy in Canada it runs for about $40 CDN 
 Very disappointing.  I only bought it because I found Ringo's 4-volume "trilogy" on the Posleen wars engaging with interesting characters.   This book does not measure up. It starts with lots of clunky expository dialogue, then goes on to a tedious, way too long set up. After 164 pages, after you've followed the tiresomely cliched characters around for a lot of totally irrelevant and uninteresting non-events, when you're wondering for the tenth time if the story is ever going to start and which of these cardboard cut-outs you're supposed to care about (you never come to care about any of them) there's a betrayal (finally, some action!) for what turns out to be a totally uninteresting motive, followed by a long tedious stalk (here we go again) and frustrating out of character behavior of the survivors: A master sniper can't find a wounded guy who's crawled a few meters into the bush? Doesn't even try? When he obviously needs to leave no one alive?  And where was the Darhel's vaunted "Sense" while the murder was being planned? Then we're told Darhel can go a week sans rest without too much trouble but he's so worn out after three days he can't take the opportunity of the bad guy falling asleep to move? He exposes himself to fire to begin some great plan then two pages later is again wondering what to do next?   Don't hold your breath waiting for him to do anything to justify the book's title.  You'll be horribly disappointed. Then we find jarring contradictory details like "the hero" still being tracked several pages after he's discovered and ditched the tracking device. etc. etc. etc... The final fate of the bad guy is straight "god out of the box". Come on! I won't reveal what it was in case some masochist wants to slog through the long tedium for it but it made me want to hurl the book across the room. Or just hurl.  And the denoument is laughable.  Think of the old "Kung Fu" TV serious.  "Well done, grasshopper...." My bet is Ringo had very minority input on this.   Note to Baen: Crap is crap no matter whose name is on it 
 so very boring... i gave up halfway in. i usually hate to leave books unfinished but i felt like it was a waste of my time. my sister liked it though. 
 I still like the book, but new teachers should be careful when reading it.  Several people have written that Esquith has left out some important details.  For instance, what kind of population is this really?  There are no African-Americans on the cover, or I don't know if they are even directly mentioned in the book.  I don't believe race has any direct bearing on how well a student will do, but a white male compared to a black female teaching African-Americans in a "jungle" will have quite a different experience than a white male like Rafe teaching immigrants or Americans of immigrant families.  Also, are most of these students from single-parent households?  And when immigrants come to the U.S., don't many of them already have somewhat of a work ethic instilled in them due to their history and culture?  Otherwise, I think it is a good book and I enjoyed it very much 
 A sorry science fiction book (not a mystery novel in my judgement) not written by Ludlum but his name is on the cover to sell books (my viewpoint). The book takes advantage of todays terrorist threats and smallpox concerns to stir the readers interests but nothing in the book reflected the writings of Ludlum. I strongly suspect that Ludlum did not even write the outline for this book and the sorriest one, "The Paris Option" 
 I'm with the reviewers who thought this book was ruined by the ending. I'm all for twists, but this was completely ridiculous and incongruous and dumb.  The book tells the tale of Hamptons small-time lawyer Tom, who had a brief career as a professional ball player. Apparently sometime in his youth, he dumped the woman he truly loved, Kate, who became a hard career lawyer in NYC. We know she's hard because she smokes, and has no friends, but in the end, they band together and find true love while defending a young black ball player from a multiple murder death-penalty charge.  It's twisting and turning and super derivative, but mostly it's satisfying. Until the last few chapters, when the writers throw in a major monkey wrench that turns the books into a joke.   I felt as if the entire reading experience was false, and a waste of time. Badly done. Cheap.   Patterson's books may not be the best, but they ususally don't make you feel this cheated 
 	The book Live Writing is a basic "toolbox" for young writers. It shows different methods on how to enhance your writing, by giving you tips on grammar, topics,organization, starting out, etc. It also is an ideas index for writers in progress.  For example the author talks about how he was trying to write poems, but his baby kid wouldn't stop crying and screaming, so instead of getting frustrated and giving up he decided to write poems about his baby crying. He also gives various ideas on how to make writing more interesting or to "juice it up and give it electricity".  	There are no characters in this book, only short poems and stories about various people showing his "more interesting" writing methods. They also have surveys on young writers about writing stories. For example, the author asked a fifth grader what the hardest part of writing a story is, and he said the beginning, so there is a chapter about how to write a beginning. Also, at the end there is a short story displaying all of the author's strategies on writing.  	Live Writing is probably one of the worst books I have ever read. The language and verbs he used to try to make his book more interesting made it even more obvious that he was trying too hard at catching our attention. What I don't understand is why his intended audience was young adults, the writing seems like it was intended for 3 year olds. Even then at some level it must be a bore to read. Reading it was the worst experience, I don't know which made me fall asleep faster, the topics on chapters or the cheesy lingo. You can tell the author wanted to help young adults write better, but it didn't help me or my classmates. In short, this book was the worst book I've ever had to read 
 I found this book to repetitive.  It just keeps going on and on, on how bad Web feels about the death of his 7 team mates.  Also, it has harsh racist descriptions on some characters that don't really add to the story at all.  It just adds to the stereotype of how life is in Annacostia, Washington DC.  One such description is that of the black grandmother of the missing kid.  She is described as a big black woman about the sides of a small car with big breast and lives in a house full of rat excrements. I don't recommend this book at all, but if you are a narrow minded white male, who thinks that he is at the top of the hill looking down on the rest, this book is for you 
 Work outside the home or stay at home mom? --there is no one right way -- It is sad that people can be so close minded to only see their side as the "right" side.  There are many types of people and situations --there can't be one right way --and not everyone has choices.  Stay at home mothers may want a voice --but believe me, most working mothers want a voice --many act as though we work for our own benefit --yes, we may benefit in some ways --but many went to work specifically to benefit our families --things such as medical benefits, a decent neighborhood, etc. In the end, some may have been fortunate enough to offer other advantages such as educational opportunities or memorable family vacations after providing the basics --- Or perhaps, the opportunity for them to know their father who is able to work near regular hours since there is another income.  For some, having the father work extensive hours and have minimal time with the kids so that the mother is home works well to meet their goals.  For other families, it does not.  For mine, we originally had no choice --a bit over 16 years ago, I went to work leaving our one year old thinking I was doing a horrible thing.  I did it because there was no other way --my husband was a Architectural Draftsman making $15k per year (no med benefits).  Because we believed me being home was the right thing, we did everything we could to be able to have me at home.  He bartended on the weekend and took his office's after work janitor job when the janitor quit --I did accounting work at home and tried coordinating waitressing eves.  In the end, I had to go to work full time, we could not make it and we needed benefits.  The world was very unsupportive of me and made me feel like a bad mother for doing this --I did not want to leave my daughter, I did not want to go to work, my husband listened to me cry at lunch each day --I did it for my family.  --That one year old is now 17.  I also have a 12 year old.  I ended up continuing to work as by the time I may have had somewhat of a limited "choice", my kids were in school and my views had changed.  My working has brought benefits to my kids, my home and my marraige.  I have a very happy marriage of 20 years.  My husband is an active parent.  Have I missed previous moments because I worked?  Yes --and that does make me sad --but I also know I have had other moments that are valuable--and my kids have had significant moments because I work --with me and others.  No matter what, I am a happy person which I feel might be the most important ingredient to a good mother.  But that is me --what works for me and my family certainly may not be the best answer for all because we are all different.  I was fortunate to find a way of life that has worked for us. -- My kids?  Very happy, well adjusted kids who I am very proud of.  A couple days ago my daughter, senior in high school was discussing this issue and said I will definitely work --I was surprised and asked her why --she said that when she sees all her friends with stay at home mothers, the mothers seem very unhappy and do less for their kids than I do --(referring to college visit/app process, driving places, spending one on one time, working together, etc.)  My response was that you have to wait and see --you don't know what choices you may have --and being able to stay at home, if only for awhile can be a very wonderful opportunity --and -certainly -not all stay at home mothers are unhappy.    There is no right answer and it is a very small and close minded person who can't understand that.  As women, as mothers, I hope some day we can support each other rather than knock each other down to make ourselves feel superior.  
 the  original   book  was  great I purchased it many years  ago but  this   book   was  a poor  zerox  copy   of  the original  and  some  of  the type  could  not  be  read  to  the extent it   was  not  worth keeping  so I sent  it  bac 
 Despite the talented cast this is perhaps the most ridiculous film ever.A goofy hippy copy laughs along the way trying to catch an eleven murder serial killer.This writer did Moonstruck, but this is Moonstink.Seeing Rod Steiger with this material is a tragedy.The case is a joke, the characters are impossibly lame, and the dialogue would gag a collie.This film is worth seeing only to gain appreciatiation for the value of screenwriters.No amount of acting talent can lift this turkey out of the Bankok privey.I just watched this film and at the conclusion I just sat there with my mouth open not believeing how bad the film was.Saradon, Keitel,KLine, Steiger, and Rickman....will try and forget this dog their entire lives. I cannot imagaine how any studio or distributing company let this turkey reach the public.Have I gotten the point accross that the film is weak....I hope so.If I could give it zero stars or even better, minus eleven stars, I would

 I was disappointed when I received this CD.  Although it is original, the music is hard for me to listen for more than a minute or two. By your side, (my favorite) is good for about two minutes.  Then the beat gets off track, and starts to sound terrible.  If this was done on purpose, I cannot fathom why. I know this is "lo-fi", but a hint of bass wouldn't hurt at all.  As it stands, the CD sounds like an unfinished product, and is not nearly good enough to stand on its own. I think this CD would best be used for some sampling...especially in today's hip-hop.  If you are looking for beautiful, relaxing music...look elsewhere 
 Ben Franklin is my hero, I have 12 biographies on him, this was the worst. I first started collecting Franklin biographies forty years ago, Van Doren, Fay, Issacson, Brands, Wood and a half a dozen others. At first glance, and after reading the rave reviews it looked like here was something new and different... a new take that concentrated on France. Well it was new, and very different - it put me to sleep in my chair several times. I eventually gave up and shelved it with the others. What a shame. Boring.   
 this book is simply a re-hash of old Vanity Fair articles. She gets paid for those articles then slaps them together in a book for a second payday. What a lazy way to "write" a book 
 Unless you like watching a girl clean for two hours... then don't see this movie. Other than the beautiful scenery, nothing was explained, there was hardly any dialogue, there was barely a plot, so if you didn't read the book then forget about understanding the movie. It is a complete bore!! I usually don't give movies bad ratings, but this is THE worst movie I ever saw! However,the book was amazing. Read the book. DO NOT WATCH THE MOVIE.  
 My all time favorite book is Deavers THE BLUE NOWHERE and The Testament by another author.  I think this book is on the bottom of my list.  It was a combo term paper and novel.  I wonder where the editor of this book is.  Where was he/she?  It read like it was written by two different people and a poor editor combined them.    Don't worry Jeff, I'll still buy your next book...I've bought them all but please ...get a second opinion about your editor. I good editor wouldn't have let it go out in this shape. 
 this item will keep drinks cold but it is fine if you have it in the car in a cup holder for long trips but if you intend it for a child to take to school it spills all over their lunch bo 
 This book speculates about both the advance of computer technology in the 21st century and the socio-political response to it.  Although it is peppered with a few interesting notions worth skimming, much of the speculation is unreasonable and philosophically naive.  In the first chapter, Kurzweil attempts to lay a sort of theoretical framework for his speculations, which boils down to his belief that Moore's Law is just one instance of a cosmic principle of exponential advance which explains everything from the first second of the universe after the Big Bang to the evolution of life on Earth and now the evolution of technology.  The second chapter argues that it is possible for an intelligence to create something more intelligent than itself:  just as evolution "intelligently" created us, we will (soon!) create computers which will build machines of far greater cognitive ability than us.  It is indeed intriguing to consider that someday machines will outperform humans in many ways, but the book to this point is best skimmed, because there's actually very little substance and a lot of dry, pseudo-intellectual filler.  Chapter 3 examines the philosophical problem that is going to be brought to the forefront by super-advanced computers:  what is consciousness, and can machines possess it?  Kurzweil unimpressively touches on a handful of schools of thought here (his sentences on Descartes made me wonder if he has read anything on the subject besides pop philosophy), though he does not try to decide between them.  Instead, his prediction is social:  eventually machines will be accepted as real people -- just as real people will physically merge with technology -- even if that sounds bizarre to us now.  This theme comes up again and again, and it proves to be one of the only thought-provoking issues of the book.  Chapters 4 and 5 talk about the field of artificial intelligence, where it has been, and where it needs to go.  In a section entitled "The Formula for Intelligence", Kurzweil provides his recipe for the strong AI of the future:  recursion, neural nets, and genetic algorithms -- all taking hints from the reverse engineering of the human brain.  This wishful thinking is one of the Achilles' heels of this book.  For a software entrepreneuer, Kurzweil is strangely blind to the evidence:  software is hardly becoming more complex or "intelligent" at all, let alone exponentially.  Today's software systems are perhaps bigger but not significantly "smarter" than systems of past decades, and software quality continues to barely meet the lowest of expectations.  Despite Moore's Law and the faith that it will continue to provide more and more cycles in the hardware world, progress in the world of software seems, to this software engineer of 15 years, to be nearly a flat line, not an exponential curve.  Just compare how many hundreds of man-years have gone into the lastest version of Windows, versus what it would take to design and implement Kurzweil's ideal of software that is able to write more powerful software.  Part of the problem may be that Kurzweil simply ignores the fields of cognitive psychology and epistemology, which are in their infancy.  He does not seem to even be aware of the issues in these fields which would have to be solved (probably by geniuses) in order to create "strong AI."  Instead, the solutions he predicts are purely materialistic:  brain deciphering, massively parallel hardware, and genetic algorithms.  Part 2 of the book focuses on potential technologies.  The most powerful computers he speculates about are quantum computers, and he doesn't waste any time before asserting that someday we will be able to download the entirety of a brain into a quantum computer, so that the computer will in effect have a clone of that person's mind.  Kurzweil, in his materialism, does not seem to even be aware that there is a philosophical argument that this is impossible.  He also speculates about nanotechnologies and how they will eventually give us a unprecented ability to manipulate physical reality.  Part 3 of the book is comprised of specific predictions for 2009, 2019, 2029, and 2099.  This book was written in 1999, and we can already see that some of his 2009 predictions are either just simple extensions of things we were starting to see in 1999, while others wildly miss the mark, such as:  "the majority of reading is done on displays", "the majority of text is created using continuous speech recognition", and "intelligent roads are in use, primarily for long-distance travel."  That Kurzweil could be so far off in his 10 year predictions does not bode well for his 20-, 30-, and 100-year predictions.  Indeed, his predictions for 2019 sound like a science fiction novel, and of the ones that sound plausible I think he must be off by at least 30 years.  His speculations for 2029 are just fantastic.  In general he seems to "predict" based on the assumption that new technologies will be deployed as soon as they are available, underestimating a myriad of resisting factors:  legal, political, social, market, scientific, etc.  Ultimately this book can be fun for skimming and raises a couple of thought-provoking issues, but as speculating about technology more than 10 years in the future is necessarily a foolish activity, there's plenty of foolishness to be found in here 
 In Paycheck, Ben Affleck plays engineer Michael Jennings, who works on highly lucrative projects for big companies, then has his memory erased so that he can't reveal any trade secrets. He's paid millions for the privilege, of course, and everything seems to sit just fine with him.  However, on a particularly well-paying gig, Jennings awakens from his memory erasure to discover that he's traded his obscenely high paycheck for an envelope full of random personal items. As the movie progresses, we learn that Jennings has risked everything to save himself, his girl (Uma Thurman), and (of course) THE WORLD. (Insert booming soundtrack music here.)  Although I found the premise of Paycheck highly original, and the action more than adequate to keep me interested, the scenes between Thurman and Affleck fell flat. (In addition, more than a few melodramatic moments had me rolling my eyes.)   This movie was fairly entertaining, but it just couldn't find its heart. Paul Giamatti, in a turn as Shorty, Micheal's tech-savvy friend, struck me as the most real character of the bunch, and he didn't even have much screen time. Verdict: skip it 
 No thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story.  The whole thing is based on who wants to kill Darby and why. And that is where it falls apart. The FBI or CIA could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could, and what is the point of trying to kill her?  To bury what is already out in the open? The FBI, CIA and White House all had a copy. What are they trying to silence? Nothing at all. Perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself 
 Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...  But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of "The Partner" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks 
 Rather bland and boring; covering overly general neuroscience topics. Many better neuroscience books have been written covering the same material. 
 This book is a worthless exploration of the city through the dubious analytic framework utilized by Mike Davis in "City of Quartz."  What separates that book is Davis' intimate familiarity with Los Angeles as a lifelong resident.  Whereas D'Eramo is an Italian who's polemic is as cliched as any other European assessment of America which comfortably embraces false stereotypes and broad generalizations about american urban culture.  What mystifies me about these modern marxist urban theorists is they vilify modern american cities, yet ultimately believe that cities provide the best social mechanism for engineering their normative philosophies.   anyway, none of this is to imply that Chicago is immune from criticism.  It is, as is any city.  It's has a sordid history of racism, corruption, an dubious institutional choices.  But any comprehensive analysis of Chicago that refuses to recognize Chicago's virtues or at least attempt to understand Chicago on Chicagoans terms is intellectually bankrupt and a worthless read. If you want great polemic pick up the works of the great chicago polemicists Algren and Royko, not the work of this Italian Huckste 
 I haven't bought this book because it's $80.00!!  Why is a paperback book of less than 300 pages 80 bucks? 
 J. Michael Veron apparently sat down to write The Greatest Player Who Never Lived in the same manner a trial lawyer would write a closing argument.  He tells us what he's going to say, then he says it, then he sums up what he just said.  There was very little tension in the story, only piles of documents to sift through along with the main character.  It is at times laborious reading with a pleasant twist at the end.  Golf fanatics and lawyers (who play golf) will enjoy it.  Otherwise skip this tiresome read 
 At first I thought this was going to be a great book. I love zombies. No one loves zombies more than me.   If you love zombies, you will hate this. Zombies are classic and no one should change a classic or you get horrible results like the Resident Evil Movie (Paul Anderson)...   This book is really about aliens.   I was very excited and very pleased with this book until I got to the part where the "zombies" started speaking and using mental telepathy to communicate. And then they started driving trucks and cars and forming unions and then the novel came crashing down.  It's not really about zombies. It's about aliens. It was misleading and for an alien book it wasn't too bad. But for a zombie book, it was terrible 
 This must have been fun to record but it feels to me like they were just having a lark w/country music. As a result, it's competently performed, but bland in a sort of Country Lite kind of way. When famous musicians cross genres, it's more rewarding when they at least bring us something new, or dive in w/both feet and give us the texture of the new genre--I was looking forward to something more. Instead, it's like hearing a good country cover band in a Las Vegas lounge (nothing wrong w/that, but at least in Vegas the music is free).  There are many better country or folk or bluegrass albums on the market right now that are more rewarding than this. Start with, say, "You Don't Know Me - Songs of Cindy Walker," just released by Willie Nelson, a better example of how to do a tribute album. 
 This was my first experience with Stephen King and I made it to page 150 before I quit.  It was agonizingly slow and it just wasn't my cup of tea.  I told myself that I would quit at page 100 if it didn't seem to go somewhere but I gave it another 50 pages because it was Stephen King.  It was brutal 
 The sound quality is really awful!! I gave it a two star, because I give credit to the other aspects of the product like the casing, the gooseneck support, and the fact that it is easy to turn it back on when it loses its power.  HOwever, the most important thing is the sound quality, which really is very, very poor 
 This isn't quite a streetmap of Mexico City so if you don't intend to buy a guide of the city then you won't be disappointed by this map. What it does show you are some less than ideally detailed maps of the center city (from Chapultepec to about the historic score) and a little north and south. Not that useful if you wanted to make it out to other parts of the city like Xochimilco for example. This is not that useful unless you plan on staying confined to this area of the city. 
 The first 70 pages of the book are nothing more than the author trying to convince the reader this is an effective method towards releasing weight.  But, even after the author gets to the point, the convincing continues, ad nauseum.    I became so bored reading the same statements over and over again that I started skimming through the book to find relevant information.  Unfortunately, the relevant information is so scattered that its very tedious to put it all together.  For example, the author says most Westerners expect a list of foods to eat right off the bat.  After trying to convince the reader  this is an unhealthy approach to eating, a food list is given (about 20 pages later).  Yet, its another 50 pages before the author explains why those specific foods were chosen.    This book is supposed to be written for Western minds to understand Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in order to bring their bodies into balance.  Yet, very little explanation is given about the priciples of TCM.  The author only glosses over the divisions TCM practitioners use (hot/cold, dry/damp, internal/external, etc.), making it difficult to know how to use them correctly.  This may be an effective method for reducing weight, but the poor presentation makes this book practically worthless 
 I bought this book thinking it would be a more specicfic musculoskeletal companion to Braddom's generalized PM&R textbook. Unfortunately the treatment paragraphs (most important section from my perspective) for each topic were very thin and nonspecific.  They were woefully inadequate for an attending or physiatry resident.  I sent the book back which unfortunately meant I didn't get to critique the DVD.

 Strongly influenced by an analytical interpretation of Nietzsche from Danto's Nietzsche as Philosopher Nehamas does more harm to Nietzsche than good.  Nehamas's own "creative" interpretation of Nietzsche is utterly irresponsible. Interpreting Nietzsche analytical only makes Nietzsche's moral properties run amok. Nehamas interprets Nietzsche like most Christians interpret the Bible: He takes away a few things he can use, dirties and confounds the remainder and reviles the whole. Nietzsche asserts, rather than believes, that "untruth" is indeed a condition of life. But he does not assert any kind of "theory of truth," as Nehamas would have us to believe. Nietzsche's moral philosophy is Descartian - doubting to believe to discover one's own perspective of truth - not a dogmatic religious truth! His intent is rather, to give us his perspective to help us discover truth in ourselves, not in Nietzsche, himself 
 I was hoping for a book that had actual plans and dimensional drawings of various coops.  Instead, this book is more of an "ideas" book or a grand tour of various coops that people have built.  Definitely a disappointment 
 This book is badly dated.  Worse it shows configs for new to Linux administrators and leaves the harder configurations missing time after time.

 This was a Medieval Project in my 7th Grade Humanities class   The Summary: Catherine Called Birdy was a conflict type book. It was mostly about her pig head of a father trying to sell her to the richest man. If you like the way it sounds now you should look for a copy. It is quite interesting and has a lot of conflict in the book.  A phew funny things were when Catherine caught some objects on fire! Rating: I rated my book 2  stars because it was kind of boring. Why is because all the book was really about was Catherine's father trying to sell off to the richest man. When I did like it was when she tried to get out of each man. Who this book would be suited for:  I would recommend this book to someone who really likes conflict books in the Medieval times. Also is if you are interested in action books. 
 I an not a prude but I watched this movie after it was recommended by a friend. I watches this movie with a pretty liberal girlfriend and we both found it to be extremely vulgar and not even funny, with the exception of the fist scene.And the language was ridiculous and gross! YUK 
 dont get me wrong. i like weezer. i've liked them for a long time since their debut cd. i just found this to be a bit annoying. they're just giving into this image that all these other losers are grouped into and its sad to see that happen. the single is weak. the lyrics are pathetic. anyone could write lyrics as boring as that. sounds like he made it up while he was playing it. it's like "The Joker" meets "We Will Rock You". like a lame attempt at making an anthem for rich people. we dont need that from weezer. let the other mainstream pop idiots do that. hopefully this is just a fad and it will blow over. the live tracks are ok i guess and the video, but forget the single. yeah, its catchy, but its just not weezer material. 3 chords? thats all they're giving to us? come on. they could do better than that. i could write that. my dog could. but im not giving up on them yet.. 
 My wife ordered the Rectangular Baker just after Christmas, and it arrived without the glass insert (I wish we would have read the two other reviews).  I re-read the product description and it states it does not ship with the glass insert.  Nonetheless, I called Wilton Armetale to find out their side of the story.  The customer service agent said that Wilton stopped shipping the baker with the glass insert around January of 2004.  The agent suggested I take up my grievance with Amazon.com 
 I've written to the National Audubon society and several geologists concerning an omission in this book.   I can't remember when Michael Landon and I discovered our mutual love of geology, but it remained a constant in our friendship. Shortly before he began to film for his finest role as Jonathan Smith in "Highway to Heaven", Michael Landon and I embarked upon a geological survey of Northern Canada. Using his celebrity influence, Michael Landon was granted a royal charter from Franz Joseph II, then Prince of Liechtenstein, to finance any mining capital should we discover a new gem to add to the Prince's famous gem-trunk.   We eventually found a quiet piece of land within the traditional lands of the Nis'gl't'k people. After spending seven months documenting and learning their language I anglicised their name. The "Huxtable people" spoke of a cave famous in their stories for being the home of N'gaask'ul'k'ot, or "Gelman." Instinctively, Michael Landon went there, to Gelman's cave. He refused to use anything but a 10 inch hunting knife when quarrying. He furiously knifed at the cave wall for 4 or 6 hours without any apparent consistency to where his knife struck. Suddenly the cave stank. I looked at Michael Landon with contempt, but to my surprise his face was not sheepish. I wondered then where the smell came from. I followed his peepers, and he was using them to look at a gem that lay before his fallow blade. We both knew what we had discovered, but we consulted our Audubon guide. It wasn't listed. In his excitement, Michael Landon first suggested naming it "stinkrock", then "stankrock" and finally "smellrock." I took on a soothing tone to pacify him and delicately suggested we call it the "Landonquicklyite." He put a single finger to his pursed lips, furrowed his brow, squatted, started walking around while squatting, and then eagerly said "let's call it Michael Landon's Rock." Kenneth Waltz later characterised our relationship as having a power imbalance, probably a reason why the gem came to be known among us and in some geological circles as "michaellandonsrock."  In weight comparable to the density of those memories, I still have 10 pounds of michaellandonsrock. I even put some in the rock tumbler and they look nice.   So, perhaps my review is biased, but I hope that in the future the Audubon Society will investigate my claim. 
 Detailed look at the workings of the Agency and the influence of its Directors on work and morale; however, the author presented an uncritically positive characterization of Tenet and an equally rosy portrayal of President Bush's handling of foreign affairs. The author ignores lingering questions and concerns (e.g. where are the weapons of mass destruction, statements by the Administration linking Hussein and al Qaeda), frequently uses partisan language and soundbites to describe President Clinton, and, overall, comes off as an apologist for the current Bush Administration 
 No, not really. Since this novella first appeared in Harper's some years back and then was the prologue in Underworld, this makes the third time it's appeared in print. And while it is brilliant, why buy this when you can buy Underworld for about the same price 
 Complete waste of time!  I am done reading Robin Cook books for now..The story line for this book is so stupid I am amazed Mr. Cooks editors even allowed it to be printed..I'm not sure about the hospitals where Robin lives or works at, but in the area where I live, if just one patient died there would be an immediate investigation, but here we have several patients die from unknown causes and the characters just move along like it's no big deal..The Wilsons even allow their daughter to be admitted!!!  Give me a break!!  Like I said..don't waste your time on this one!!

 Hit and Run is a typical rock bio, full of the cliches and inaccuracies that we can expect from an uncreative person trying to write about, in this case, a truly creative person.  Hopkins takes a person who is publicly known due to talent, work, and accomplishment and reduces him to a fashion plate without a real job mindlessly indulging in the trends and vices of his time.  The author predictably hops from one conspiciuous milestone to the next with little insight into the music and even less into the man.  This book shows how short-form rock journalism extended to biography is an injustice to a significant artist who deserves a better profile.  Fortunately this artist already has in such books as Black Gold, Crosstown Traffic, and others 
 In all honesty, I found this book contrived and irritating in the extreme. It talks down to the readers, and the only time I have seen language as overtly flowery was when I picked up a Danielle Steel. The author has no identity of his own, and is instead trying to accomplish something that freely borrows from Marion Zimmer Bradley and J.R.R. Tolkein. If you're looking for something that reaches out to an audience above the age of thirteen, give this one a pass 
 All homeschool books that are hardcore Christian need a warning label - right on the front cover and probably on every page too.    Meaningful church involvement is a necessary ingredient for homeschool success?  I have to have a biblical conviction that God has called me to homeschool?    I guess I have to forget about homeschooling then, since neither of those apply to me.  Then she gets into curriculum and tells you to save yourself some time and settle on a traditional curriculum (if I wanted a traditional curriculum I might as well leave my kid in public school) designed for Christian or public school use.  That's great if you want a traditional curriculum.  But there are FAR more curricula out there than the Christian and traditional curricula she suggests.  And a great many kids have been successfully homeschooled using other than the "traditional" method.  Seems like she could at least have mentioned that fact.  On the last page I read before I could read no more, (which was about a third of the way in), she notes that instead of attempting to meet any state-mandated objectives, one should strive to realize God-given directives.  However let me warn you - if your state requires certain criteria such as standardized testing that you fail to do since it was not a divine directive, be sure to get a lawyer because the state will take you to court.  If she had only titled this book The Ultimate Guide to Christian Homeschooling, I think it would have been great.  All of us non-Christians would have avoided it and Christian homeschoolers would probably get a lot out of it.  There is a tremendous amount of information in it that is of value - if you approach it from a hardcore Christian point of view.  But if you DO NOT believe (as I DO NOT) that children are in desperate need of training if they are to grow up to bow their knee to the Lordship of Jesus Christ, then give this book a pass 
 Deepak is looking at God through India glasses, tinted differently than rose-colored perhaps, but definitely different than the God I know and love. There are better books on the market which explore and take God "out of the box," such as Tiffany Snow's "Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life - Tools to Connect." Through Tiffany's glasses (and I know we all wear some version of them) I saw many more facets, rainbow colors and true gems of the nature of God than I did through Chopra, whether you are a Christian or not. I did like Chopra's "7 Laws" though, and some of his other works 
 This film is painfully outdated -- and it was never good to begin with. I suppose you would have to call this a "romantic thriller comedy." And it fails on every one of these fronts. The thriller portion is preposterous, nothing but a convoluted story from a 60s TV show. It's not particularly funny either -- oh, but it tries to be. The romance portion probably comes across the best, but this is only because of the excellent actors in the leads.  No, what "Into the Night" has going for it is a quirky, unique premise that it never delivers on. Landis seems more concerned with jamming the scenes with pointless cameos and in-jokes. This film, which could have been regarded as an underground classic, has none of the substance to garner such praise. And it does not receive it. "After Hours", which came out the same year, is vastly superior.   The best thing about "Into the night" is watching a young, gorgeous, pre-Catwoman Michelle Pfeiffer, some LA landmarks that have since been demolished (Ships diner) -- and the original one-sheet poster is very, very cool 
 This book is a book written as a "formula" book. It has several outright inaccuracies as has been previously cited. Hawke was given the first F35 to buzz around in? Riiiightt! Come on that plane wouldn't have been allowed to be photographed much less flown by a rouge guy like Hawke. What was the point of the F35 Flight in any case?   An anti gravity train? Is this Science Fiction?  Another case was when Jet was about to be set upon by a frothing at the mouth Doberman, Jet says release the dog. It turns out the dog was a long lost pet of hers named Blondi. Riigghtt! A pet does not show fangs and froth at the mouth.   I believe several parts of this book were just stuck in for filler.   To often someone shows up miraculously just at the right time to save the day.  There is a great lack of creditability in this writing.  
 I bought this book immediately after we found out I was pregnant and was really expecting it to be "the guide" to pregnancy.  Basically, it gives pretty accurate and complete information, but every time I pick it up, I am quite turned off by the condescending tone (i.e. if you eat a slice of white bread with butter, vs. whole grain with nothing, you are probably not fit to be a mother sort of notion).  This book doesn't even make me feel guilty...just irritated that an authority on the subject could be so demeaning.  As a first time mom, I would advise you NOT to get this book.  I know I am not alone either because every time I see used pregnancy books for sale or for free, it is among them.  Many of my pregnant friends have gotten rid of this book for the same reason.  In terms of getting good info, the internet is great and of course there are many many pregnancy books out there.  It is really unfortunate that this is considered to be "THE" pregnancy book, when it is such a disappointing read.  If you insist on buying this book, check a garage sale or Goodwill.  There you will probaly find an abundance of rejects.  
 Before I read this book, I thought I understood what I was feeling after my husband passed away. I had experienced an extreme hate and incredible grief, and needless to say, I was ready for a change. After hearing the  hearting story of a fellow reader, I bought a copy of this book. As I read  it, I felt that whoever wrote it was insensitive and had never really  experienced my pain. Luckily, I have found help in my local church, and I  am recovering quickly. With any luck, I will find a book to help ease my  pain. Until then, I'm going to keep looking 
 This is sad, dirty & depressing tale. Although Kate Christensen writes beautifully, I couldn't have cared less about this pathetic character.  It lacks wit and humor and the reviewers who said "it's laugh out loud" funny are the kind of people who laugh at car wrecks. Any cleverness or wit is lost in the dark tone that overrides the entire story.  Skip it 
 Al Franken is an individual who has been mediocre at everything, this book is his attempt to take on radio giant, rush limbaugh.  All I can say is; it is a good thing Mr Franken used Rush's name on the title, otherwise this book would have been like every other Franken project: an abject failure.  If you are easily entertained by shrill, and hysterical name calling this book is for you.  I found it sophmoric, and superficial, pretty much like Al 
 I am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company's software.  The vid is encrypted so that you need Amazon's player to view it.  Blah.  You're better off buying the DVD for $20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the DVD somewhere other than your own computer.  
 I found this book a truly disapointment !! When i started the book , the story of Abby and Lucian was so intense , so passionate that i thought i was going to love it . Then the book advances to this days with the story of Declan and Lena , and it was ugelly disapointing !! They don't have anything in commun with Abby and Lucian !! Lena and Declan , they don't work as a couple in love ; to me they was no chemestry or anything between them . I only read the book till the end because i wanted to know how it was going to end with Abby and Lucian , but that too was a little beyond what i thought it was going to be , they deserv a better ending , i don't now how but that was not what i expected ! 
 This book is a very easy to read seemingly well documented work but it will not provide the reader with Thomas Jefferson in historical context. If your interest is in what Mr. Jefferson accomplished during his life and the many great achievements that he participated in on behalf the formation of the United States I would pass up this work.  If your interest lies in his carnal side and his personal sexual history this might be more your speed.  Had I known this was the piece of fluff that it turned out to be I would not have wasted my money on this work.  This book would probably be a good basis for daytime TV couch potato fare.  It is hardly a good work of historical content and most likely would have been rejected by any Masters level thesis committee.  Most of this book could be condensed into one chapter. On a number of occasions Mr Halliday lets his own personal political bias color his image of Mr. Jefferson pushing this work even further from the vein of relevant history. I picked up this work based upon the recommendations on the inside cover.  I have always been impressed with the historical works of Mr. Ambrose but I believe that there must have been more to his review. 
 Kipnis uses her mindlessly wielded implicit racism to make jokes about rape that reinforce the myth that her audience (explicitly white upper middle class women whose money she wants) are raped by strangers (when even ABC news admits that the vast majority of rape victims are raped by people in their own socioeconomic group...who they already know).  She's not accountable to her audience, she's merely profittng from the hyper-spending tendencies that she diagnosis them with.  When I had the disheartening opportunity to discuss the book with her she used every tactic of male chauvinism to dismiss my critique of her book's racism...even to the extent of insisting that since her editor was black she couldn't be racist.   Don't waste your time 
 My husband purchased the Pedometer with FM radio for me.  I loved it and used it non-stop for about a week.  After a week the battery case top fell off so I could not keep the batteries in.  The FM radio worked only once - I thought I had a short in the headset.  Good idea but really did not perform/last for the money 
 Community Playhouse in Long Beach did the show this August. As it played, the plot didn't come through, but the wit of Shaw did. The playhouse didn't have the costumes of the military men, nor the actors to carry-off the pomp and bravado of these would-be heroes. In a time when G.W. Bush is fighting his own phantasmic enemies this play should have lapooned the whole spectre of military madness. George Bernard Shaw gave us the theme it will take some imagination and talent to make it contemporary and equal to the madness of our times. Ano 
 This book was quite boring. Within the first few pages (when Ruby describes her own birth) hints were dropped about the ultimate "big secret" of the book. By the time I'd read a quarter of the book, there were so many hints it wasn't a secret any more. By the time I got to the end, I was disappointed that there wasn't anything more to the story than that. None of the characters were particularly likeable, nor were they bad enough to hate.  The book was billed as "darkly funny and satirical" in one review. I saw no humor except for the brief slapstick physical mishaps at a wedding reception late in the book. On reflection, I gained nothing from reading this book, and got about a half-minute of laughter from that one scene. It truly was a waste of my limited reading time 
 What a load of junk.  GU 29 CD1 was OK.  Everything else these two have done separately is pretty useless.  Make sure you hear a sample before buying this.  Don't say you weren't warned. 
 All this did was make continuous noise in the bathroom. The plug-in from the grocery store was far superior 
 I enjoy reading books on Greece so I buy a lot of them. This one was a disappointment. I have to agree with the reviewer (above) who says it is a waste of time. It is one of those books that lament the advent of mass tourism and infrastructure development, and I suppose these inevitable changes deserve lamenting in several senses, but other writers have done it so much better. Maybe the first and last chapters could be recommended but the rest is boring. None of the characters come alive and none of the real issues they face are made as clear as they should be. All the people (tourists and locals) seem to do is drive around looking at the mountains and eat... and they all eat too much 
 Very disappointing and BORing! NO likeable characters, VERY uninteresting story.  Could/Would not finish--too many "better" books waiting 
 Lewin fails to clearly define what complexity and chaos mean and the jocular, conversational style of this book never actually brings things in to focus.  Much is made of "the edge of chaos" yet it is never actually defined or examplified.  What examples exist are simplistic and only erode and hide what ever the point may be 
 I am a diehard Star Wars fan and own all the scores. This one, though good, fell short. Take Anakin VS Obi Wan for instance, the beat just isn't there like it was in the movie, drums perhaps, and takes away the excitement contained in that scene. Later in the movie, we see Vader on the Star Destroyer and Padme's funeral, and the music isn't on this CD. Palpatine's Teachings is my favorite because it is as dark as we heard it in the movie, but a lot shorter. Granted, it took several years before all of the music was released for the original three episodes and I think that stinks. Why can't these scores be released the way we heard them in the movie and all at once 
 I am a Jane Austen fan. I love Pride and Prejudice and there are three very good to marvelous adaptations of that great novel. However, Mansfield Park is Jane Austen's most complex and serious novel, and on the whole it is my favorite. Fanny Price is the most difficult of the Jane Austen heroines, not the wittiest or most beautiful, but the one who knows the difference between right and wrong. She is mentored by her uncle, the righteous and honorable [and I don't use the terms loosely] Sir Thomas Bertram. Somehow, the adaptation of this great novel has twisted Sir Thomas into a sadistic, sexual pervert. Moreover, Fanny is constantly babbling to us in Jane Austen quips that are not part of this novel. They simply missed the point of the book.  The acting is okay. The settings are okay. The directing is sad. But the sense of disappointment and betrayal by perverting the essential theme of the book has left a very sour taste 
 I'm very dissappointed as I didn't get a serial key with my book to install the training edition of Enterprise Server 2003.  This has caused me to have to find someone with a valid copy of Enterprise and it hasn't been easy. 
 I have not been able to find a replacement for my 2-fold nylon wallet by Rolf's. Based on the good review this wallet has got, I went ahead with my oder.  It turns out that the wallet I just received lacks a secured compartment for storing dollar bills. This is because one end of this comparment is entirely open and the compartment for the dollar bills is secured only when the entire wallet is folded.  I fail to appreciate how this product can even be called a wallet when there is no secured compartment for bills. Granted, commados may never need to carry dollar bills or they are trained with special skills to secure them in this product. In all fairness, it would be good for the seller to fully disclose this particular feature and let the fully informed buyers  decide if this product fits their needs. 
 It was all I could do to finish this book. The subject matter interested me because I knew someone who committed suicide, so I was curious as to how a humorous spin could be put on such a dismal subject matter. There was some funny dialog, but I was disappointed in this book overall. The characters were unlikeable: an abnoxious teenager, a wimpy middle-aged woman, etc. Not only were the characters totally annoying, they didn't like each other - yet they kept hanging out together. Yeah, I get the whole idea that they were depressed and had no one else to hang out with or anything else to do, but the author didn't convince me of why they would want to keep meeting up, going on vacation together, etc. There were also some rediculous threads in there, like lying about the angel on top of the building. That was when the book started to lose me.   I made it through to the end, but it was a great effort and I just skimmed the last 75 pages or so 
 This one is worse than "Don't Kiss Them Goodbye" in the aspect that I wish she would have included a LOT more readings and a lot less of her personal stuff.  
 I found the plot of this book impossible to follow.  It contains excessively verbose descriptions with a lot of cliches. The hero almost dies twice in a row and is each time magically saved for no reason.  And there are only so many times I can read variations of "he swung his sword really hard" and "it was a really scary dragon."  The illustrations are quite beatiful, though 
 Isn't it funny that those posting negative reviews here write better, and seem better informed, than those posting positive reviews?  That alone speaks volumes as to whom this book appeals 
 I first read this book over 5 years ago after all of the management of the company I worked for were carted off to the Option Institute in Massachusetts for some management training and they all came back with these books for eveyone to read. I read the book about little Raun and his autism and couldn't figure out for the life of me how this was supposed to help my business succede. All I can say is that after a couple of years of our company from the CEO on down practicing the Happiness is a Choice philosophy and failing to notice real market conditions and corporate failures that the entire company went down the tubes and thankfully the CEO was replaced and others were able to use more standard management techniques. This stuff may actually help little kids who are banging their heads against the wall, but it's no way to run a business and the author is a kook to sell it as a business philosophy 
 While it's possible it's helpful to someone somewhere to know 700 pages worth of performance measuring information, beginning at details, and ending at details, what's really needed is a simple flowchart.  If this book somewhere had just a small table saying something about acceptable measured values, and in turn what could be done to change each one, then we'd be getting somewhere.  As it is, the book's a mess.  The book gives a "starter set" of metrics, but it's on page 110, is six pages long, encompassing probably 100 measurements, and fails to note how the expected results / measurements would be at all connected to controllable factors.  From our perspective, speed was the desired result.  It appears using the authors' standpoint and methodology that to buy a new computer would be far more economical than to run all 1200 tests that are poorly explained in this book.  
 I bought this thinking it was going to be a good healthy snack of raspberries. I was surely mistaken. The raspberries are coated with sugar, and other syrupy stuff and it tastes like you are eating gummy bears! GROSS 
 "Metropolis",Fritz Lang's 1927 silent masterpiece,is one of the most important films ever made and also a great one! But over the years,this film has been reedited,recut,and shortened which ruins the exact vision of an extrordinary filmmaker.Since its stay on the Public Domain shelf,the prints and image quality have over the years been poor.I DO NOT recommend the following versions:1.the Goodtimes Video release has poor image quality and even worse,NO MUSICAL SCORE! 2.The now-notorious Madacy DVD, which is about 5 times as worse as the Goodtimes video release,contains horrible,blurry image quality,freeze-frame opening titles,and an annoying musical score! Just recently,TCM (Turner Classic Movies) has broadcast the brand-new,beautifully restored 2002 restoration of "Metropolis" which I taped off of and trust me,it's well worth it! Buy the Kino restored version on either VHS or DVD,but DO NOT buy the horrible Public Domain versions which can definitely rip you off! A Terrific film and thanks to Kino for making this restored version a definite must-see! I also recommend the 1984 rerelease by Giorgio Moroder (which is now unfortunately out-of-print)and buy the soundtrack to go with it 
 After 40 minutes of objective viewing, and shot after superfluous shot, I sat through another 30 minutes in pain. I've come to the fairly well informed conclusion that either Peter Jackson can ONLY do epics wheather it calls for it or not, or LOTR in all it's incarnations had immense levels of supervision for Jacksons from higher-ups. Kong is not an epic, it is a tragedy. Tell me to watch the whole thing, if you will, but if the film is constructed so poorly 70 minutes in, I don't need to. On another note. Jurassic park had better CGI than this. Mr. jackson, no more 'epic fly-by shots please. 
 I have only been into Dead Can Dance for the last few months. I have purchased most of their cds. I can honestly tell you that this was the worst one I have heard.  The vocals are too heavy and so is the music. Where is the lightness of Lisa Gerrard? A better choice would be Spirit Chaser. That one is mesmerizing. Plenty of airy vocals and pounding yet soothing instrumental work. An even better choice is Lisa Gerrard's Duality. It takes you to places you have never been before.  If you want to really feel the music you are listening to, Duality is a must 
 I really started out liking this story.  Loved the New Orleans setting and the idea of ghost hunting combined with a possible hoodoo/voodoo connection.  But the character of Cree Black got on my nerves so bad that I found myself not caring much about her one way or the other.  She is supposed to be a 'brilliant' Ph.D in psychology, but she's an emotional train wreck who can hardly navigate her way through life.  Why anyone would pay her thousands to exorcise their ghosts is beyond me.  She's ineffectual, totally incapable of intimacy, lies compulsively to her friends and family, and seems stuck in this self-pity time warp over her husband who died 9 years ago!  Please!  
 I am an avid sports fan and I love football, but sorry, I didn't enjoy this book one bit. I kept waiting for the Grisham who writes compelling dramas (The Broker, King Of Torts) to pop out, but realized midway through it wasn't gonna happen. As someone else here summarized - "it's chick lit about guys who played high school football" 
 Skepticism  can be healthy, but this book is an error-filled celebration of hollow, misleading cynicism delivered with a surprising level of shallowness and lack of detail.  Sure this book points out some "legitimate" frauds and hoaxes, but it does a lot of damage and leads people astray by suggesting that a lot of things are frauds and hoaxes that are not. It seems that Mr. Randi concludes that anything and everything he doesn't understand or have proof of is a fraud or hoax. One example: acupuncture.  Never mind that thousands,  if not millions of people have been helped and healed by acupuncture, but even the American Medical Association has concluded that it is a legitimate medical therapy. But Randi includes it in his list of frauds and hoaxes.   There are many other examples where Randi errs and misleads, or simply does not understand and chooses to cast aspersions (p on) what he is woefully ignorant about. In some cases he cites individuals who have supposedly exposed frauds or disproven claims and theories, but the reader is left with little or no details to assess the claims of the "fraud buster."    In other cases, a supernatural feat is presumed to have been disproven simply because someone else has managed to appear to replicate the supernatural feat by using sleight-of-hand or other trickery.    Not everything that is real and true can or needs to be proven by science or  proven to Mr. Randi. (A large portion of the history of science, in fact, is a history of proving that what science once concluded was unreal or unprovable is in fact real.)  If you accept on face value  everything that Mr. Randi wants you to accept, your life will be much poorer for it.   This book will provide great reassurance for people who don't want to believe in anything other than their egos. As stated above, this book is a great example of where skepticism has fallen victim to cynicism and that makes this book more harmful than helpful.  To a great extent,  I am very surprised and sorry to conclude, this book itself is a fraud 
 Valuable as a reference work.  Don't read it for pleasure or relaxatio 
 This is a poor excuse for a thriller.  It lacked suspense, was too unbelievable, and wallowed in gut-churning violence.  The psychiatrist, Dr. Frank Clevenger, is given too much time and power by the police to help solve the hostage crisis, especially considering that psychopath Trevor Lucas has already mutilated one person and is likely to endanger the lives of the other people he has hostage (including a pregnant woman).  Clevenger is a hard person to sympathize with, what with his drug addiction and penchant for call girls (I also found it unbelievable that he could function very well while on heroin, and that no one-- not even police officers-- could recognize his condition).  Not only that, Clevenger's success in tracking down Lucas' brother relied too much on luck and coincidence, and the ending was too neat and tidy, especially given the intelligence and volatile nature of Lucas, and the depth and complexity of his problems.  Very unsatisfying thriller 
 Hank Hanegraff is a blatant replacement theologian where the nation of Israel is concerned.  He is further from the truth where prophecy is concerned than most groups, to include pretribulationists.  Indeed, his "scholarship" is no scholarship at all; it is pure propaganda....  To see real scholarship, get Tim Cohen's materials (see below):  Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, Zola Levitt, Thomas McCall, John Hagee, Grant Jeffrey, Marlin Maddox, Perry Stone, Texe Marrs, John Walvoord (deceased), etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's site for details on these items, which are also available via Amazon) 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 This book, like so many, is among the annoying books that pretend to offer everything to a "dummy"  The first couple of chapters look innocent and make you think that you are going to get alot of knowledge out of this book, but as you get to the chapters that are most important, the simplicity and clearity of the text is thrown out the window.   He starts using terminology without defining it, doesn't break things down, and is just plain confusing.   The approach is this: A is for apple. B is for bat. E = m c Squared.  The customer looks at the first few chapters and buys the book. [... 
 As a Design Professional, I have to say that this book is awful. I purchased it, and after looking through it, immediately returned it. The illustrations are terribly amateur and the rendering techniques are useless.   Color is better learned with a real color theory book    If you want to learn how to draw fabric, or people I would recommend looking for classic illustrators like Andrew Loomis; this book is no help and laughable. 
 There was such promise, a woman who had "escaped" her ho-hum marriage, gone back to her roots was finding herself, starting her art work back up, caring for her mysteriously crazy mother, and then she "had" to fall for a monk, and turned this story into a romance novel.  When she "married" herself with knots into the sea, and lovingly talked about mermaids, it had some hope of independence, then it failed, going back to her husband after the "affair" (she got dumped for God.)  She didn't go back stronger, she went back wimpier and needy.  Sure, she had art in a gallery, but whee....where was her growth??  There wasn't any.  Sorry.  This novel leaves the reader disappointed and sad.  Ugh! 
 Let me start by saying I LOVE SHANNON McKenna!...I've read all her books so far with "Standing in the Shadows" being my favorite...I pre-ordered HOT NIGHT and eagerly awaited its arrival...and was sooooooooooo disappointed!...One of the things I've always liked about her books was the fact that the characters had other relationships/family...that provided a great insight into the central characters...Zan's family wasn't explored...He was the typical "alpha" male - which I have LOVED in Ms. M's other books...but Zan was just incredibly UNLIKEABLE and uncouth in not a charming way...I look forward to Ms. M's continuation of the last of the McCloud brothers...Get the other books....much better reflection of Ms. M's work.. 
 Were do I begin? It was a challenge just to get to the end of this movie. For one there is much too much cursing, but wait...that's not all. The story isn't interesting at all, in fact, it's down right depressing. The acting is B class at best. Which was a huge bummer. I was surprised how bad this movie really was since some of my favorite actors are in it. It seemed like I was watching a really bad after school special...SERIOUSLY! To say it is a bad film is a sad understatement. It is horrible at best and I don't recommend this movie 
 This book really sucked! Save your money!  The I have tried to contact Mr. Herman about some of the problems I have encountered with the contact addresses he provided.  He has yet to respond, meanwhile, I have wasted valuable postage for addresses that are incorrect or not in existance.  One other note, many of the persons contacted were not accepting new talent, and hadn't been for quite sometime 
 It is very evident that the author is not familiar with the game of Soccer. He has written a book that simply accounts lives (that are nothing short of boring)  with a Soccer game thrown in on the side. This is ok for  the Oprah show but not as a book recounting a great  sporting upset.  It  would been have far more interesting if the book explained in detail the  then current global state of the game , and  some history of the U.S  national team up until that time.  How did they get entry to the World Cup?  were there qualifying games?  Give more analysis to the actual game. Were  there any more goal chances for the U.S. did the English control the game  for long periods?  The book also does not give enough attention to the  actual 1950 finals themselves. In short a disappointing boo 
 This book has a great title, but somewhat lackluster content. The book is really not so much about changing the world, and more about one organization in particular. In addition to focusing on an organization, I find that the stories of the people *in* the organization take up as much of the book as actual stories about people they've found who have made or are making a difference in the world.  It's not necessarily bad-there are plenty of inspiring people and stories to motivate you. It just takes the book a long time to get to them and seems to deviate often 
 This has to be my least favorite of my Kiyosaki collection.  I will sum it up for you...think and know the power of Leverage, Passive income is taxed at a lower rate than Earned income, and you gotta buy assets!  There, you can continue shopping 
 Full of gimmicks and silliness. If you are into "gimmick therapy", you might like to call your eating disorder "Ed" and talk to "him" in an empty chair. Not helpful at all, although Ms. Schaefer seems sincere enough. Glad I checked it out of the library instead of buying it. I prefer to be talked to like an adult 
 This is my third Vince Flynn book, and I was thoroughly disappointed.  "Executive Power" incorporates two stories, neither of which have anything to do with each other.  It's as if Flynn had enough for two half stories and then squished them together.  The first is a story about an American family kidnapped in the Philippines. Lurking in the background is another story set in the Middle East.  I thought Flynn was going to bring the two stories together.  But he never did.  He resolved one in sweeping fashion and then focused on the other.  If you only read one Vince Flynn book, I recommend that you read "Transfer of Power."  THAT is an exciting book.  But stay away from "Executive Power."  You'll be thoroughly disappointed 
 I thought Weston's book was a little too short when I first picked it up. Turns out I should have relied on my instincts.  While I believe Weston does a fair job introducing readers to the concept of arguing, he fails terribly overall. Basically, any student that took Math in high school that involved "proofs" would know Weston's entire book.   The only thing I really enjoyed was the index on "cheating."  Don't get this book if you have ever taken anything involving mathematical proofs or philosophy. Otherwise, knock yourself out 
 ...Having also been an American woman, living on my own, in rural Ireland, at the same time as Rosemary Mahoney was taking her leave of that country, I can not stress enough that this woman did not spend enough time there or spend her time in any way that would bring about real understanding or learning of what Irish society and community is like. Not only does she portray every single person save for two maybe, in an ugly light, but she obviously did not pick up on the "Irish sense of humor". Very often, the Irish way of having a giggle means "humoring" someone else, especially someone else who is naive to this sort of fun.And who better for the folks in Corofin to humor than a woman who spends each day holed up in a castle or sitting in a smalltown pub of regulars where she is a total outsider. Corofin is not far from Ennis, and there, Rosemary could've enjoyed a livelier pub scene where people of her same sex and age group would gather on a regular basis...I thought the book was hilarious because I could see these Corofin folks just humoring the [stuffing] out of Rosemary. She took all of them seriously and at face value...This is one of the funniest things about being American. Our culture is so widespread that often the Irish get a laugh out of playing into what they think is our idea of them, and the folks in Corofin sure enough got a giggle out of Rosemary I'd say. Its a pity that she never immersed herself into their world...instead, she just hung around hoping to catch glimpses of skeletons in closets and kept to her... self. She was well known in Kerry, and I was twice mistaken for her with, "Oh my gosh, you're not that Amerry-can girl who wrote down all those things about the folks she lived near...are ye?" I had no idea who they were talking about atthe time. Well now I know, and its a pity so many folks here in the US eat this book up as a example of society in Ireland.   Interacting as an aquaintance, Rosemary managed to pick up surface bits and pieces of some folks' lives during their leisure hours drinking.  I feel this hardly gives her leverage as a reliable authority on Irish society...or even Corofin's community.  Even in the very dialogues Rosemary quoted from her conversations I was mortified for Rosemary that she did not pick up on the fact that she was being played and humored just as much as the Dublin girls in her book played and humored  Sister Keaton.The book, to me, only displays how very ignorant most of us Americans are of other cultures and their ways of communicating, and how content we are in our smugness of thinking we know it all in just a quick glance. A good read only if your Irish, or have lived in Ireland with Irish people for some length of time, cuz then you can laugh...Oh, and to everyone who still thinks this book an accurate portrayal.. 
 The author presents several different "methods" for sharpening a knife. They all boil down to "scrub the knife back and forth on a stone". This will produce an edge of sorts but not a very good one. He dismisses the collected wisdom of millennia of knife sharpening as "bull" without any evidence to support his claim. The author says he has "studied" and tested his methods. This mean he tries shaving with each blade until it feels right. The rest of the book is an ad for his products. Don't waste you money.  If you are interested in the actual science of sharpening with detailed instructions on how to sharpen almost anything then Leonard Lee's The Complete Guide to Sharpening is the book to read.  If you just want to sharpen you kitchen knives, send them out to a sharpening service every couple of years.(Ask at the local Chef supply store) They will use a slack belt or hollow edge sharpener to put a perfect edge on. This is impossible to do at home without a couple hundred dollars of equipment 
 I can't find any notes in this book, only exercise, i was so disappointed with this book 
 Alexander Nevsky may be an Eisenstein film, but that doesn't make it any less cheesy. In fact, it makes some of those Italian peplum look substantial by comparison, with it's crude stereotyping and propaganda as the Russian people rise to save their homeland in defiance of the capitalist and aristocratic oppressors of the people and do battle with the baby-burning Papist Germans (how Stalin ever signed the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact after this hatchet job is a mystery).   Much of the filming is as clumsy as the characterization, with obvious painted backdrops, clumsy medieval-speak dialog, constant reversion to silent moviemaking techniques at their least compelling and a tendency to go for height in the image to such an extent that the action is often barely clinging to the bottom of the frame. It's reputation rests on Prokofiev's dreary score and the spectacular battle on the ice, although both are a mixture of the good, the bad and the downright lazy. Only moments in the aftermath of the battle retain any real potency 
 It is clear that the November reviewers are all the same person... loser!  Anyway, this machine is not easy to use, leaks, very wet foam... bla bla yuck!  I opted for a Breville... the die cast 800ESXL and immediately noticed the ease and consistency. Of course my best recommendation is a Rancilio Silvia for home (friend has one) but it is labour intensive, have to wait for the boiler to heat up after pulling your shot... etc... if you want consistency in taste, ease of use, and good steam on command... do not buy this machine 
 This is not a rating of the magazine - just a warning to check your Wish List address if you "wish" for magazines.  My son changed his address in his Amazon account when he moved 2 years ago within the same city. Amazon did not use this information to update his address within his Wish List. When I ordered $138 worth of magazines from his wish list last December, Amazon hid the street address "for privacy" - therefore I could not know the magazines would be sent to the wrong address.  In November, I asked my son if he'd like to have these magazines renewed and he said he had never received any!  After I spoke with Amazon, my son now gets a message when he goes to his Wish List that his address doesn't match the one in his account, so it's clear Amazon is now aware of this problem.  The publisher will not redo this Communication Arts subscription, saying the magazines were never returned to them, and Amazon has not responded to my request for a refund 
 I can't fathom why this book is beloved.  It's just awful.  Alright, that's a little strong.  The first third-to-half of the book is just awful:  tedious, depressing, tiresome, plotless.  Indeed, Lawrence put a sentence in that, amazingly, perfectly summarizes the first half of the book:    "The days seemed to grind by, with curious painfulness, yet nothing happened."  That really does say it all.  The protagonist plods through her dreary, depressing life, and nothing happens.  At times during this book, I got the feeling that Lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist, because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story.  For a while I had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant I'd never heard of, until I finally just gave up.  Eventually, in the last third or so of the book, it starts getting a little more interesting.  But sadly, while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing, in the end nothing very much comes of any of it.  But we DO get long, windy, insufferably self-righteous political nattering, of a Rousseau-ian nature:  all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed (in reality, life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short).  This is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken-little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in 100 years unless we give up industrialism/capitalism and all.  Well, the book came out in 1928, so he's still got some 20 years to not look like an utter nincompoop.  But I could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good.  It is not.  The biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it.  This stems largely from the fact that Lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people (so much so that I strongly suspect  that he was emotionally crippled himself).  Every character is decidely neurotic, each in their own special flavor.  The closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be Mrs. Bolton.  The central character Connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book, but it sure takes her long enough.  I just could not identify with these people one tiny iota.  Repeatedly I just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes.  To its credit, the book does advocate an unabashed, unashamed joyous love of sex, something with which I am totally on board.  But that's about the only good thing I could find to say 
 I'm not all that familiar with Kellerman's work since I try to stay clear of serial character novels. But my wife, a Kellerman fan, bought the book and suggested I read it.  While the pace was mostly okay, two things really bothered me about this book. First is that the author is obsessed with wardrobe. He feels the need to exhaustively describe what many characters wear in each scene down to the last stitch! But the thing that I was most unhappy with is that Kellerman does what I don't recall seeing an author ever do. He walks away from the book. Just ends it with no conclusion! It's as if he decided he wrote the required amount of pages and said, "Well, that's it!" and sent it off to the publisher. Two big no-no's for a writer 
 I wouldn't go so far as to call it brilliant. Zorba is a refreshing and likeable character, but at times i felt that he was a bit too preachy, his dialogue a bit overly pedantic. The story to me felt a bit too long and choppy, with not much of a plot. But there are a few interesting and beautiful moments that reminds us to enjoy life to the fullest. Like I said, not a brilliant book, but pretty good nonetheless. 
 This one got way too much attention from NPR. I loved the interview there with the author, but, quite frankly, his entire story was told in that very sitting. This "book" is really an "essay" that doesn't deserve all the paper it's printed on; I would've been much more appreciative of this author's sentiments had it been marketed more appropriately 
 I found Yi Yi to be a tedious film, at times the action and characters felt quite contrived and cliched. The subtitles were poorly highlighted and I often could not figure out who was speaking the line. The only refreshing thing in the movie was the final scene at the grandmother's funeral, but it was not worth a three hour wait to get to this poigant scene. Do yourself a favor, and skip this one 
 I was surprised to learn, after reading Bay of Souls, that this was Robert Stone's first in five years, because it seemed hastily thrown-together.  I thought the story of Kirsten and Michael Ahearn and their son was wonderful and then more or less dropped.  According to his blurb at the back, Stone had some interactions with Madison Smart Bell.  I wish he'd written about Haiti, instead, essays, and finished the tale he started, which was like Updike with a little more edge.  Maybe I'm just not a voodoo guy, but I was sorely disappointed with the promise of the beginning of this book set against its patched-together ending 
 Excellent book, especially for a first time dog owner.. 
 This novel could have been so much better, and it's hard to forget that when reading.  There's no question that the authors know the world they're satirizing inside and out, and at first it's fascinating to have an entree into the world of High Society.  But that fascination isn't enough to carry a whole book (especially when other books take on the same world:  The Nanny Diaries and Bergdorf Blondes).  Melanie Korn is a sweet bubble-headed blonde who's way out of her league.  But unlike say the heroine of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, another book about a social-climbing gal, she lacks the humor and irreverance to make her vulgarity really likable.  The shifting points of view and multiple narrative threads don't help-- there's a really nasty sub-plot about a neighbor who wants to kill his Latina mistress.  The book wants us to sympathize only with him as she's portrayed as a terrifying shrew, but the snobbery is ingrained in the narrative throughout.    Then, once Melanie has her dreams dashed, I kept waiting to see her somehow triumph anyway and make it to the Top via a surprising strategy.  Instead the moral of the story is there's more to Manhattan than  just a few blocks, that people live on the West Side, that love and marriage and children are Good.  Well, duh.  The last thirty pages of the book were a homily to the joys of the Real World-- it's well meant but terribly condescending.  Where do they think their readers live?  The two mean gossips who narrate some of the book are tiresome, and never get the comeuppance they really deserve.  I gave this two stars because it's such a missed opportunity.  With better editing and direction this could have been a sort of Jane Austen type book for our times.  Instead, it's just a minor example of gossip lit.  The prose is fair-- better than The Devil Wears Prada but nowhere near the humor and elegance of The Nanny Diaries.  It's a quick read, but there are better quick reads out there.  On the plus side, the book does leave you feeling grateful the world of High Society is so very irrelevant.  Ah, you say as you shut it, thank goodness I am middle class 
 It has some funny moments but it's certainly not Pratchett's best. As crazy and sometimes corrupt Hollywood is it's not the sort of industry where Cthulu would be comfortable. The combination just doesn't make sense. And then there's the talking dog. On about every fifth page Pratchett stops the plot (what little of one there is) to do yet another talking dog joke

 I'm taking Wilton cake decorating classes, so I purchased several cake decorating books to practice the techniques I've been learning.  This book is an art book as far as I can see.  This book should be in the watercolor  or tole painting section, not in cake decorating at all 
 This trivet is plastic and not shure how it will stand up to high temperatures.  Nothing in the packaging states this also.  I know that melamine does burn.  I probably would not have purchased if description had stated it was not stoneware 
 how do you ruin "alice in wonderland?"  elminate the dialogue.  And that's pretty much what's happened here.  When there is dialogue, we're forced to watch alice's mouth tell us "said the white rabbit" (or whoever) after nearly every line.  I have never been so bored with "alice in wonderland" nor have i ever been so turned off to something that looked so much like a horror film.  Don't waste your time if you're a fan of the wit and fun and knowing humor of the original story 
 There is an odd conceit found in many otherwise intelligent people to the effect that as they're brilliant on one field, they must be brilliant in EVERY field, especially as other fields must be trivially simple in copmparison with the one they're in. Hence we see doctors losing fortunes in the stock market, scientists losing money in business ventures, a generally smart people making asses of themselves in every way possible.  Penrose' argument can be boiled down into a very few simple assertions:  1. Mathematicians appear to derive proofs in a way that is not describable in the algorithmic language of computation.   2. The only processes we know that are not so describable are quantum processes.  3. Ergo the way mathematicians derive proofs, and by extension cognitive processes in general, must involve quantum processes, which for some reason he locates in the microtubles of neurons.   Now I don't know much about quantum mechanics, but I do know a fair bit about cognition and neurophysiology, and I can safely say that Penrose is talking hooey from his first assertion on. He's made a very clumsy error in looking at mental processes that occur a level not open to concious introspection, and then assuming that because individuals cannot describe these processes, they are not describable using the language of ordinary logic.  Everything else in the book derives from that simple error- an error I'd hope a second year Psych student wouldn't make. If he'd shared his manuscript with at least one psychologist, maybe this would have been pointed out to him, but again, perhaps that's just that conceit rearing its head again; how could a mere psychologist hope to understand the work of a briliant mathematician? ;-)  If you're looking for a good book that will explain cognition once and for all, I don't think it's been written yet. Certainly not by Penrose 
 This book has its good points. If anything, it helps you put into words what you want  from a supervisor, but it is not very accurate. The online test does not account for a difference between when 2 of their options are both exactly like you, or if they don't describe you at all. This messes up the results, and it did not describe me very well. I am not just in denial. I have taken a lot of personality type tests, like the Keirsey Temperment sorter and have a pretty good idea of my strengths. So, although this book is pretty good in making you understand the importance of incouraging your strengths, it still leaves you wondering about how you fit in to their terminology.  As for using this book as a manager to better serve your employees, I'v seen it done and it does not necessarily work because the strengths spit out for people were not wholly accurate. The company I work for has done this, and most of the people who were shifted around to better serve their strengths (according to this book) are very unhappy in their new positions.  Your money can be spent better elsewhere. I say its only worth about $10 
 I'm new to this type of book but the first I read was Lee Child's "The Hard Way" featuring his loner hero Jack Reacher and after that this book was an incredible let down.  Implausible plotting and idiot characters was my main problem.  This is set in rural Georgia and I didn't buy it.  Seriously- one of the main protaganists has been raped by a jesus freak, her twin sister was killed and she was being abused  by her ex-skinhead boyfriend and she had an abortion.  She's also a police detective.  Yeah- dopey 
 The number of absurd coincidences, cliffhangers, and deus ex machinas required to sustain the plot of this boy scout daydream would challenge anyone's ability to suspend disbelief.  I would rate it as slightly less credible than the Wizard of Oz.  This silliness spoiled it for me, though I might have loved it if I had run across it at the age of 12.  This book does not give any kind of reliable view of World War I.  It is a fairytale.  Also despite what other reviewers have said, I found the South African apartheid-style racism pervasive and offensive.  This kind of thought was no more acceptable in 1916 than it is today, as Gandhi made so eloquently clear at the time 
 This is a truly amazing book! This is a book written by a highly uneducated person for even less educated reader. As the author says in the introduction, this book is designed for young people of all ages... Well, what's that, "young of all ages?"  Simple: those "whose imagination has not been stifled by standard educational process."  At the very outset, the author reassures the reader that the book is not going to be a technical or scientific one. He says with a poorly concealed pride "My brush with academia was a fairly short one:  I was expelled from kindergarten at the age of four... and have never managed to resume normal studies since, not to mention graduating from anyplace."  As a result, "I am a fairly stupid fellow who could not learn any mathematics at all."  This lack of really serious knowledge of anything does not prevent the author from making judgments, always with a sort of  "elegance of ignorance", regarding very big topics, like, say, theory of relativity, and holography, and brain functioning (through electromagnetic and sound vibrations), and Biggg Banggg, of course. So, my recommendation to those with at least K12 education: do not waste time and find a better way to spend $9.97.    The most surprising aspect of  this book is that Dr. William Tiller, a  respected scientist and writer, found it possible to write a preface for this book.  This preface is the best part of the book. 
 this movie sucks.  don't buy it.  the gore looks like spaghetti and it is boring as all hell.  if you like the camera-work of 10 year-olds and people who couldn't act their way out of a wet paper bag...this movie is for you.   p.s. the infamous "eye gouging" scene can't get much worse...i'm no medical professional...but if a sharp piece of wood penetrates a person's eyeball, shouldn't it bleed...a lot?  oh, i guess not when the shot suddenly switches from a real person into a fake eye closeup that couldn't fool any re-re on the planet.   
 I thought that she was going to explain to you how to invest in rental properties without going into deep debt for yourself. However, the truth is you need money to invest in real estate. So, there's really no way around it, which made her book redundant. She just gave examples of 3 people with 3 different investment strategies. In the end, the one with the most number of rental properties ended up with the largest profit growth. I really did not find the book useful for someone looking to invest in rental properties. 
 I'm always looking for good mystery stories, and bought this first book in the Inspector Banks series thinking it sounded promising.  Sorry to say, I found the dialog stilted, the interactions of the characters not realistic or adult, and the women's lib angle poorly expressed.  If it werent for the violence and sex, it'd be a better read for someone in junior high school.  The professional characters, like the chief inspector and the psychologist, seem awfully inexperienced for people in those kinds of jobs.  Part of the reason it seems corny is that it doesnt stand up well after 20 years

 I first watched this movie on NBC back in April 1977. Though edited to make it fit its two hour timeslot and allow room for commercials, I later purchased the video from Goodtimes Video to watch the parts not shown by NBC. From the beginning of the movie shot at Dulles Airport in northern Virginia, the cast who star as the crew and passengers aboard Columbia Airlines flight 409, board a Boeing 747-123 (on loan from American Airlines) and it is typical Hollywood overacting, particularly the passengers. Some of the crew, especially Erik Estrada, who plays flight engineer Julio, does quite a bit of womanizing with one of the stewardesses. I've flown a lot during my lifetime, even aboard 747s, and have never heard so much redundancy as depicted in this movie. The sound effects were a little primitive from the Boeing 747 sounding like a Boeing 707 on take-off down to the telephone gongs that are the same ones used on the beginning of the "Rockford Files". This was in the days before George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic came into the vogue. By the way, his film "American Graffiti" was the inflight movie. Some faults are present in the film. The private pilot (Dana Andrews) identifies his plane as "two-three-two-zulu" instead of the correct identitication: N9750Y. Another fault was at the time the stricken 747 lands at Salt Lake City and runs out of runway before Charlton Heston has to turn the nose tiller to make the plane go left at a high rate of speed. Here, we see the passengers get thrown to the left instead of to the right. Another fault we see is that the passengers are catching a glimpse of the daring midair transfer. In reality it would be difficult for anyone to see such an operation. If you were to watch the movie more than once, you could see all these errors 
     One of my friends gave me this book as a late Christmas' present. I like reading about courtesans ever since I enjoyed reading "Nana" by Emile Zola. The subject is a meaty one, filled with lots of whimsy and cheekiness. This writer, however, managed to deflate every ounce of excitement I had for this book. Her writing style is best described as a mix of stream-of-consciousness and ultra-flowery wording. I managed to hang on for three chapters before I ended up donating this book to a local library. A total snooze on a very interesting subject. I would give it no stars if it was possible 
 Why do you you insist on portraying all Visitors as wide-eyed peace-loving simpletons?  This book is amusing in many ways (like, what is a CPA and why would a CPA write a book about something she clearly has made up?).  Nonetheless, this type of liberal "why can't we be friends" propoganda merely assures that your planet is destined for destruction.  Why is it that you earth-dwellers will be the only ones surprised by that event 
 First of all, I did not exactly 'read' this biography. Instead I purchased the CD version which I distilled via my car sound system every morning on my way to work (I have enjoyed countless biographies of great american figures this way, and still been able to read many more technology related books).  I had great expectations from this book, having recently enjoyed three biographies of Lincoln. I have to confess that I was sorely disapointed. I found the research of Mr McCullough to lack the kind of details that I have enjoyed in biographies from Walter Isaacson, Richard Carwardine, or Doris Goodwin. I do not seek a beautiful story in a biography, but rather a reliable source of facts that I can use to form my own opinion of a character. In this context, I find Mr McCullough's use of superlatives or long emotionally charged sentences to be a distraction from the subject matter of John Adams and his contribution to America. I also enjoy direct quotes from letters, speaches, autobiographies, as they help me refine my impressions of the context (the period, the relationships to contemporary characters, ...) surounding a promonent figure. Usage of the English language in politics has dramatically evolved since Mr Adams' time, and I missed 'hearing' the voice of John Adams. Instead, this biography felt like reading a translation where the personality of the translator overshadows the personality of the original author. Finally, having read other biographies of the founding fathers, I was disapointed to find so little about the complex relationship between Adams and Franklin.  All in all, my lasting impression is that Mr McCullough did a great job at bringing John Adams and the early American Revolution to the masses through a very appealling product that may however leave readers asking for more historical details and less emotional opinions. Had I known that, I might have passed on this biography and instead explore Mr McCullough's fictional work 
 Aslam's core story is fascinating - a culture clash that leads to the deaths of three people, and the collapse of a family. However, I found the book difficult to read for two reasons. The first was the visceral hatred thrown up on nearly every page towards Islam and the beliefs and attitudes held by first-generation Pakistani immigrants. Some of these beliefs are indefensible (such as honour killings and the fatal exorcism that appears in a subplot) but Aslam's seeming hatred of this culture - one he grew up in; he's the son of a Pakistani political exile - and Islam poisons any argument he was trying to make and makes this book a piece of anti-Islam and anti-Pakistani propaganda. The second difficulty with this book comes from Aslam's incredibly pretentious prose style (such as describing segments of an orange on a plate as "dolphins leaping over ocean waves"). Linked in with this is his failed stab at introducing magical realism (men with glowing hands and blood, peacocks and parakeets, fireflies becoming ghosts, men with golden hair), into the mix. The story that Aslam is trying to tell is the only reason why I have given this book two stars. If that hadn't been interesting, it would have just managed one. The difficulties Pakistani immigrants are facing in the UK, and elsewhere in the world, is a matter that deserves investigating and exploring in literature. But there are much better novels that explore these problems - Brick Lane by Monica Ali and Hanif Kureishi's excellent Buddha of Suburbia 
 Presents an unconvincing case about the origins of caste. Smith seems to  have been swamped by information so that he missed the woods for the trees 
 I'm sorry but I've read books a lot funnier (Christian Culture Survival Guide) and a lot more intelligent (God's Politics) then this one. I was hoping for some edgy satirical writing that The Door is known for. The author seemed to have chickened out on Chapter 6 (Too Queer for Words) as the entire chapter was 4 pages long and made little sense.   If you want to check it out sit down with a cup of coffee at a bookstore and browse it for about 10 minutes and you'll know what I mean. 
 The hardcover and the e-book version should not be linked together because the e-book version is only 12 pages! Complete waste of money, I wish I could return it. I made the mistake of reading the review of the hardcover version (which is shown on this page too), and since I had already read the original book, I though I was making a bargain. The joke is on me... :- 
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 This phone is lovely to look at BUT... 1. The numbers on the touch pad wore off within 6 months. 2. The touchpad completely ceased to function within three years of very light use.( it was a second phone used maybe 1- 4 times a week) 3.  The receiver cord is EXTREMELY short.  
 In this book, Gladwell reaches the astounding conclusion that EXPERTS know more than other people. That if you spend YEARS doing something, or researching it, or training, you will be able to spot more details than others. A real eye-opener. 
 I purchased this book with the intent on using it in my AP Literature class.  What a waste of $50.00!! 
 Thomas M. Disch approaches what should be an engaging topic to any SF lover with a holier-than-thou attitude that is both condescending and unappealing. I purchased this book believing it would study the impact of SF on American culture-as the title suggests. Instead, Disch taints his diatribe with his own offensive bias.  Perhaps his sourest assertion is that of SF as the ultimate Boy's Club-run for and by the Men. Why, Disch is so enamored of this male-dominated theory, he proceeds to deny Mary Shelley as the true founder of the genre, and instead raises Edgar Allen Poe to the pedestal instead. His weak reason? He asserts that fewer people read Shelley than Poe. Furthermore, he credits Shelley's parents and husband as the reason behind her success at all. Because God forbid a woman might have laid the foundation for Disch's beloved genre.   The entire book is tainted with these sort of chauvinistic opinions. What I thought would be a dissertation on SF in American culture is little more than one man's attempts to inflict his bias on the public. Spare yourself the indignation of reading such arrogant and bigoted opinions as this, you'll find nothing but rage at the ignorance of some folk 
 Do you remember in school when you were asked to write out a skit about a lesson, or perhaps make a movie? The students were terrible actors, either over doing or under doing everything they said or did...the dialogue was unbelievable pathetic, and the camera work (if there was any) was shaky and hard to watch. This movie shows like a bad high school attempt at movie making. The movie begins with a long dialogue about women who allow their husbands to take care of them. (Housewives are apparently an evil thing to this director.) After nearly fifteen minutes of simply staring up at a married couple from the floor of their car, we begin to enter into the meat of the movie...not that there is any. The only scary thing about this motion picture is its complete lack of imagination, its terrifyingly bad actors, and the camera work that is so shoddy...it had to be filmed using an old VHS tape JVC camcorder. Spare yourself this nightmare. I doubt the CIA would even use this movie to torture terrorists into admitting their darkest secrets...it would just be too cruel 
 What ever happened to common sense? In this book the average American doesn't exist. I am not denying the problems that exist in the inner cities. I am denying that this is life for the average American or even the average non-white American. Comparing two extremes - best case vs. worst case is always going to give you an unrealistic picture. We live in a capitalist economy, there will always be haves and have-nots. What he is pushing for is a socialist or communist system where everyone is equally miserable and those that manage to get ahead are then forced to pay the way for those who can't or won't. Hey Mr. Kozol - last time I checked there was no army on the borders of Camden or East St. Louis keeping people from moving out, and there is noone forcing anyone to accept the lifestyle they were born into. He offers a view of the problems with no real solution except maybe to hate the rich - Mr. Kozol, how much money did you get paid to write this book?? Utter liberal garbage. Conveniently leaves most of American schools totally out of the equation, only focusing on the worst cases and then comparing them to the top schools in the nation. 
 I'm a huge fan of McCall Smith's series, The No. 1 Ladies Detective, (which is captivating, by the way), so I was amazed and disappointed by the lack of depth, warmth between characters, insight, and humor in this book which usually characterizes the series I know and love. The plot lacks direction, and the characters are boring, without depth, and relate to each other as if they don't know one another. This is a very poor read and a great disappointment from a talented author. 
 This book is but a Tower of Babel of distortions, half-truth, worst-casing and prejudice mascarading as historical analysis, written by someone whose frustrated priestly vocation moved him to lash out against the Church and against a very good man to discredit the Church and thus, get even.    Don't waste your money nor your time on this work.  If you want to read a real history of the life and times of Papa Pacelli, read Rabbi David G. Dalin's _The Myth of Hitler's Pope_.  Written not by a failed Catholic, but by an observant Jew who became indignant at the soiling of Pope Pius XII's name, and who set out to set the record straight 
 While there are some flashes of brilliance in this album, it is compromised by a lack of direction. The 'Tastes so Sweet' mix of Rapture is beautiful, although cut far too short. Faithless, Afrika Bambaataa & Soulsonic, and Crystal Method are all good driving tracks at the tail end of this album. The high point, without contest, is Darude's ripping mix of Rising Star's 'Touch Me'. This is a cut to throw on for the peak... when you find the party is just outside of Barstow with Hunter. That said, then there are all the uninspired tracks in the center of the album. These are more appropriate in an adolescent Brit girl's drawer next to the Spice Girls. For some labels, this would be normal, for Ministry however, it is a dissapointment 
 This books makes a weak attempt to jump on the money wagon of Left Behind.  It fails miserably in several ways.  First, the plot has nothing to do with anything in the bible.  If you enjoyed Left Behind, this book will only annoy you.  The plot wanders around making the reader think it might pick up and get interesting.  It doesn't.  Technical parts of the plot are annoying as well.  For example, an ohm meter is used to check voltage on a fence.  The author needs to get his basic electrical concepts straight before writing stuff like this.  Other science in the book is similar, with vague references to data that really mean nothing or are simply wrong.  Overall, the book reads like it is the author's first attempt at writing a novel.  Some characters are good, but the plot development and foundation is so weak the characters can't succeed in salvaging it 
 I used to love Iris Johansen's books esp. her Eve Duncan books. The last few though have been terrible. On the Run was the final straw, she's lost me as a reader. I read about 100pgs and gave up. The plot was so dumb I can't believe she got someone to publish it. 
 I couldn't read the whole thing in order to know for sure. It was dry. I didn't get the imagery - I know it's supposed to be a classic, and I really wanted to read the book, I did - but it was long and boring and I just don't get why it's so "classicly popular". Sorry, but it's how I feel. Now, that being said, I read a condensed version of it, and I discovered the story was a little bit interesting - but that's as far as I can go, even with the condensed version - it was only "a little bit" interesting 
 Open Professor Marmot's book to almost any page and see him make firm statements and firm conclusions about research and anecdotal evidence which are in fact quite uncertain.  It seems reasonable that status affects health, indeed I believe it does, but Professor Marmot throws anecdotes or questionable research conclusions at the troublesome fact that healthier people will achieve greater status, or in other words that healthier people are healthier.    Professor Marmot cares only about "inequality", not evil.  For example, he appears to see no difference between the millions of Russians murdered by Stalin during Communist rule and the millions of Russians who have had shortened life expectancies during the collapse and aftermath of Communist rule, supposedly as a result of "inequality".  Could these tens of millions of deaths have been due to people like Professor Marmot who sought a government-mandated end to inequality, and not to inequality itself?  Perhaps because the book promotes a politically correct, leftist, government-solution, tax and spend agenda as a solution for "inequality", it does not appear to have attracted serious criticism of its scholarship. 
 I have never been a fan of Danielle Steel's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime, and those many years ago.  I'm not sure what motivated me to pick up Toxic Bachelors -- extreme boredom? insanity? -- but I slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer's work.  Actually, I think I was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was.  The writing was completely repetitive and superficial, and I rather felt that I was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself.  It read like a poor book report:  "...and then he did this, and then he did this, and after that he did this, and then he laughed."  We are TOLD that the bachelors -- who struck me as commitment-phobic, a little neurotic, and fairly immature despite their (middle) age, but not necessarily toxic -- are decent, likable guys, but we never really see too much proof of that.  When the "proof" does come, it's so ham-handed as to be laughable:  Charlie's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother, and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character.  Yeahsurerightwhatever.  Most of the story is told through narration, with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue.  The author adopted a third-person point of view, but there's certainly nothing omniscient about it, and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters.  Throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls, and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable.  THIS is how men behave and relate to one another?  I find that hard to believe, considering that none of the men I know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other.    I liked the female characters of the book initially.  They all seemed to be strong, capable, independent and emotionally healthy women.  But my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book, as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man.  And the conflicts Steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous:  mountains out of molehills.  For instance, Gray, the 50-year-old artist who has always been phobic about family, refuses to meet the ADULT children of the woman he's been with for several months and whom he claims to love.  Nevermind the fact that he's known about the ADULT children since the very beginning.  Nevermind the fact that the ADULT children live in England and Italy, while Gray and Sylvia are New Yorkers.  Nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent, self-sufficient ADULTS who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face-to-face visits.  Evidently Gray can't see beyond the fact that they are "kids" and therefore "family" and therefore not to be tolerated.  Sorry, but whatever sympathy I'd developed for Gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity.  Dump the weenie, Sylvia.  You can do better.  The other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness, and of course everything was wrapped up magically, with sudden capitulation, as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses.    Considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters, their conflicts and resolution, I have to wonder why Steel even bothered writing this book.  And why I bothered reading i 
 If you want to learn more about the Great Depression (as I did) don't buy this book. This book is not about the Great Depression, it is only about some Economics theory. And ONLY about that theory. It is a absolute dry read. I would not recommend this book 
 I was interested in this book for 2 reasons: to understand what worked and to see the rantings and ravings of a madman. I purchased this book similar to the way people slow down to see car accidents on the side of the freeway. Mostly, I found the book the same way German found it when it was initially published - long winded and boring comservative rethoric. Before putting the book down, I made the distinction that if Hitler were a plitician in modern America, he would definately be one of the staunch Republicans who are afraid of science, social progress and their own shadows. On a positive note, the book further reveals the idiocy of his following as it reads a bit like the book of Mormon...not interesting.  
 James Banks, considered a master scholar in multicultural studies, came right out of the Civil Rights Movement.  One would think that any strategy for teaching ethnic studies should be objective, but this is not the case.  His writing is infused with bitterness carried from his personal experiences, and rather than discuss tolerance and appreciation, he preaches reverse-racism.  He has a tendency to box people into groups according to their heritage: Mexican-American, Italian-American, etc.  What if you do not identify with any group whatsoever and are the product of early 20th century alien assimilation?  Those who cannot find a cultural niche are considered Anglo-Saxon.  If you pay attention to his writing, you notice that being white is not a good thing.  Multicultural studies should promote tolerance.  This intolerant mode of thinking is outdated and needs serious revision.  
 If there is ever a study of all the shameful efforts to belittle the crimes of communism, this book will occupy a prominent place. Vickery claims that there were only 740,000 deaths under the Khmer Rouge during 1975-9. How does he reach this number, which is half the size of other estimates and only a third of the true figure? He combines a low population count of 7.1 million in 1975 with a massively inflated sum of 6.7 million in 1979, producing a demographic decline of only 400,000. No credible source has given such a drastic underestimate.  In the 15 years since this book was first published, Vickery has made no effort to include the demographic studies which refute his conclusions. He has nothing to say about Marek Sliwinski's analysis, which calculates a death toll of 1.84-1.87 million ("Le Génocide Khmer Rouge: Une Analyse Démographique," p57). He has nothing to say about the Documentation Center of Cambodia, which has shown that 1.5 million were massacred and 2-3 million killed overall (Craig Etcheson, "Quantifying Crimes Against Humanity in Cambodia," online). In short, this new edition contains nothing to inform the reader that Vickery's claims are indefensible.  Vickery derides what he calls the "Standard Total View" of Cambodia, namely the assumption that the Khmer Rouge carried out a systematic campaign of genocide in pursuance of their fanatical Marxist ideology. In place of the Standard Total View, he claims that the Khmer Rouge leadership "did not foresee, let alone plan," the bloodbath which they inflicted: "They were petty bourgeois radicals overcome by peasantist romanticism" (p287). His conclusion is based on oral testimony gathered from 92 Cambodian refugees in a Thai refugee camp during 1980. Only nine of these interviewees are women and just one is a peasant. Given that the book purports to explain the motives and conduct of the Cambodian peasants, this is a shocking lapse from accepted standards of scholarship.  Unfortunately for Vickery's position, the Standard Total View is clearly correct. Had Vickery devoted space to Lenin's misnamed policy of War Communism, he would have been able to cite the research of numerous economic historians (e.g. Boris Brutzkus, Lancelot Lawton, Alexander Baykov, T.J.B. Hoff) who agree that it was a conscious effort to eliminate the market economy, resulting in a famine which killed 5 million people. Had Vickery explored other examples - such as Mao's Great Leap Forward, in which 30 million died (Jasper Becker, "Hungry Ghosts") - he could have explained why the Khmer Rouge described their plan as the "Super Great Leap Forward" (Tung Padevat, June 1976). He might have seen that the division of the population into class categories - some of which are targeted for destruction - is consistent with other Marxist revolutions and cannot be attributed to peasant populism. But research of this kind can hardly be expected in a work of political dogma.  Vickery is so determined to absolve communism that he even considers it "fortunate" that "those who predicted a predominance of agrarian nationalism over Marxism in China and Vietnam were mistaken" (p290). He does not mention that the good fortune of the Chinese people includes the slaughter of tens of millions through massacre, slavery and forced famine (Washington Post, July 17-18, 1994). Nor does he inform his readers that North Vietnam massacred 50,000-100,000 before reunification, with 300,000-500,000 starved to death (Robert F. Turner, "Vietnamese Communism: Its Origins and Development," pp142-4); or that its post-war crimes included the massacre of perhaps 200,000 South Vietnamese (Doan Van Toai and Nguyen Tuong Lai in Al Santoli, "To Bear Any Burden," pp272, 292-3); the murder of 165,000 in concentration camps (Orange County Register, April 29, 2001); and the mass expulsions which drowned as many as 250,000 boat people (San Diego Union, July 20, 1986). The facts being inconvenient, Vickery simply deletes them from history.  Those who wish to read a discussion of the Khmer Rouge period by responsible experts should consult Craig Etcheson, "The Rise and Demise of Democratic Kampuchea;" Karl D Jackson, ed., "Cambodia, 1975-1978: Rendezvous With Death" or Jean-Louis Margolin, "Cambodia: The Country of Disconcerting Crimes" in Stephane Courtois, ed., "The Black Book of Communism" (pp577-636). The history of scholarly apologetics on this subject is discussed in Sophal Ear's online thesis, "The Khmer Rouge Canon: 1975-1979 - The Standard Total Academic View on Cambodia. 
 So I've got a bookstore, and it seems like everyone who ever attempts this book calls it tedious and gives up. So why is it that I see so many positive reviews here? Myself, I thought the authentic feel was a definite plus, (much of the time I did feel that I was reading an ancient memoir) but as for being "a page turner," as somebody else called it, you've got to be joking. This book is one of the slowest novels I've ever read. I did it on audio book and I kept falling asleep. It was a lot like sitting in Driver's Ed. after lunch and trying to keep my eyes from going out of focus. Creighton has written some pretty fun stuff, some of it even mildly thought provoking, but his is neither. Timeline and the two Jurassic Park books fit well into the whole "roller coaster of a book" thing, and personally I thought Sphere was great.  I realize that there isn't too much in the way of popular Viking fiction out there and so I suppose if you've got to have a Valhalla fix you could check this out, but I'd still recommend the Kirk Douglas movie "Vikings" over this book. Or maybe the book "Grendel" by John Gardener, which is based on the same epic poem. But this book just feels to much like a boring history lesson. 
 Even though my four year old daughter loves this Barbie, it was a huge disappointment when my daughter's friend broke the tail off.  My daughter had this Barbie less than a day before the tail broke.  Mattel should have forseen that making a tail that looks bendable but isn't bendable would cause a huge disappointment to many little girls.  Our daughter wants another "new" Dori.  I probably will break down and buy another, but at least we know now to be very careful with the tail.  If you buy this Barbie, warn your child not to twist or bend the tail 
 Well, the photos are pretty. Cool idea but, as a Ph.D, I am appalled at the research methods. As a spiritual person, I appreciate what he has to say. Much more below:   My contention with this book is that the research is so clinically unsound, unscientific, and haphazardly rendered that it can bear no weight at all. Also, this seems to be a spiritual book looking for a mystifying way to support the author's points of view about conscious life, while showing some pretty photos garnered from water crystals as evidence. I have Ph.D. and I don't buy it -- pun intended. (Actually, the book was a gift :)   Faulty, unsupportable, unsound, unscientific, and extremnely simplistic research experiments. In one type of experiment, the author writes a word on a piece of paper and tape it to a glass of water -- word facing water -- then wait and observe the crystal formations of the water. He takes photos and concludes that the water is responding directly to the word (and not to him, not to anything else that might be in the environment.   However, there is no proof for the "messages from water" theory provided in this book -- he concludes that water creates certain "peaceful" and "beautiful" crystal patterns for positive words, emotions, and icky ones for negative words, emotions. Furthermore, the experiments did not account for the subjectivity of his own culturally-informed value judgments regarding what is considered positive/negative.   For instance, same example: the water's so-called response to the word -- it could be caused by any number of things, including arbitrariness. Say you go with his theory that water has messages for us, which I believe is not proven by his research, which is not to say it can't be "proven" or that water doesn't contain messages, but this is to say that he fails to consider so many other factors and influences such as:   Is the water responding to the experimenter who taped up the word? Is there a difference in crystal depending on the water source? Real science would have incorporated variables, and multiple multiple repetitions. Variables were not used such as different kinds of paper, different shapes, shades, sizes of paper, different writing/typing styles and sizes, different languages, different kinds of tape, different glasses with the same word. Instead, the author simply accepts as objectively given his own interpretation of water crystals as a true spiritual message.   Further, there is no idication of how many times he repeated the same word experiment? Because without repeat experimentations in a controlled environment, nothing is anywhere near proven. In the book it seems like each experiment is a one-time event and the parts about the crystal experiments read like arbitrary trials -- "hey, let's see how water responds to this word. Okay, now let's try another word. Wow, look at that." This doesn't prove anything. But the photos are beautiful. I'll give him that big time.   The author also fails to acknowledge quantum physics long-accepted breakthrough that an expermenter's own involvement with and presence during research effects the results of the research study? Suppose the water is responding to the researcher himself. Or some other factor. What is the margin of error for these so-called studies? I'd say huge, but the author never bothered to try to figure it out. Instead, we get a "beautiful" little "profound" spiritual book which is *really* about the message of the author, which actually may interest readers, because the message is inspirational and lovely and will make you feel good. (Unless you are is irritated as I am about his faulty water experiments held up as proof.)   The random pairing of water's messages and the author's message, while an innovative approach to draw seekers in and introduce them to his spiritual beliefs/philosophy is a dubious combination. I have no problem with his beliefs, but his attempt to "illustrate" them and concretize them with non-scientifically produced evidence is highly suspect. He has A LOT to say about contemporary issues and the spiritual state of the soul and consciousness, and I think his words would hold more water if he just wrote *that* book, instead of looking for proof for his beliefs in water crystals. His writing and thinking are very clear and his theory of life (not of water crystals) is beautiful and inspiring and mindful. but the two don't go together -- he is forcing them together. The theory is beautiful and fascinating (about the water crystals,) and would be moreso if it were true. But he provides no leaky evidence.   Yes, the water crystals are a lovely additionto the book (I guess they are suposed to be the subject of the book, but his spiritual philosophy is the subject -- they just agument, except that they don't. The experiments he did with water are fascinating. They just provide no evidence of anything other than that water forms hundreds (or more?) of kinds of crystals. But hey -- so do snowflakes. (I have no idea what the estimate is for how many different patterns snowflakes make.) But does this mean snowflakes are talking to us? Are their messages in snow?   This book will appeal to hopeful soulful people, and also uninformed, non-thinking people who will believe just about anything if novel enough -- if it is in a published book format, with photo documenation ("evidence.) It seems to be a "feel-good" book aimed at people who do not think too much and who want to be mystified by the universe.   But on a positive note, the author is a fantastic and innovative photographer, so the photographs are really cool -- an exhibit would be worthwhile. Perhaps the novelty of the chance process of how the crystals formed before the photographs were taken (which words, artworks, music) will appeal even more, due to the unusual circumstances under which these photographs came about. It would make for a great post-modern photo art exhibition and he has exhibited.   Conclusion: Phoney science; no statistics, no margin of error, no variables, no controlled environment for doing the water experiments, no accounting for the subjectivity of the author and his expectations of what he will discover -- for these surely influence what he discovers. As I said, he uses the crystals to prove his theory, but they don't hold up as objective messages separate and uninfluenced by the author himself. Representation is misleading. (In one case water provided a diffent "message" than expected, but the authors found a way to account for this difference in a way that that fit it back into their theory.)   There are SO MANY factors that could be going on in creating the water crystals and the only factor the author/photographer provide is that water has a message for us and that message is readible, and predictable, by them, through its crystals. I think MUCH more research would need to be done -- scientifically controlled with variables and so forth -- in order for his water to support his theory.   On another note, this is a spiritual book and it is interesting and in line with contemporary spiritual, consciousness, intelligent universe beliefs. He is an excellent writer and there are *certainly* "grains of truth" and "nuggests" that the reader can appreciate.   Well, drink 6-8 cups of water a day and think happy thoughts. This will produce positivity in your life and the optimism model and the water requirement ARE proven with excellent socio/scientific evidence.   Two stars to give him credit for trying. He really is intelligent, and his photos are lovel 
 Exiled Cubans in Miami up to 1987. This is real old stuff. I wonder why this book is still being published. Felt like a collection of shorter magazine--newspaper articles compiled to look like a real book. Many long, disjointed sentences. Could use an updating. There must be better books out there about this topic 
 Saw this when it came out years ago; this DVD is an 'R' rated copy of an NC-17 movie... at at least three different points, this version deletes some very erotic material from the original. Now, this could be on regular broadcast TV.  Save your money, especially if you're thinking of buying it because you think you KNOW what's supposed to be there. It ain't 
 buy it so you can set it on fire. it'll be one of the most ENJOYABLE experiences you'll ever have. trust me on this one. it's like the biggest smallest victory one could ever achieve 
 First let me say that this movie DOES, indeed, have subtitles.  Unfortunately, this is just one of those annoying DVDs where you actually have to turn them on with your remote.  I personally think that Asia Argento is sexy in a very skanky sort of way.  I shouldn't like her as much as I do, but I do anyway.  I think she's gorgeous and her pelvic tattoo is amazing.  I also think she usually has great taste in the projects she takes on in Europe, but her American films leave a lot to be desired.  Unfortunately, this is NOT one of her great European movies.  In fact, I think the other reviewers who refered to this movie as "pretentious" were being way too kind.    While I admire what Asia was wanting to do with this movie, it comes across as more of a  PRETENTIOUS ( I couldn't think of a better word) teenage-goth-girl-sex-fantasy.  It's a low budget DV feature done in a pseudo-Dogma 95 style.  Translated that means the script is very minimal and the production values aren't all that great.  Some would have you believe this is for "artistic" effect.  Personally, I think that's a bunch of crap.  The teenage-goth-girl-sex-fantasy aspect gets REALLY old after about 5 minutes.  The lack of an interesting plot doesn't even make the more superficial T&A aspects worth watching.  (AND I LOVE MY T&A!!!!!!!)    Besides the nudity, I think the only other aspect of this film I liked was the jab they took at director Gus Van Sant, refering to a fictional version of Cleopatra he would direct.  (I've heard the Italians don't like Gus or his movies.)    My personal recommendation is not to waste your time with this movie.  If you  must watch this film, borrow a copy from a friend.  If none of your friends own it, or you don't have any friends, rent a copy.  If you are so absolutely obsessed with seeing this movie, to the point you just have to buy a copy, get one from Amazon Marketplace.  Don't pay more than $5 or $6 for it, it's 90 minutes of your life you will never get back again. 
 I agree with everything Anne M. Koch had to say about this book in her earlier review of it, and I'd apply it to Dodman's other books, too. I add these thoughts as well:  Once you've read two of Dodman's cases, you know the formula: "This was the presenting case--this is what I pessimistically taught the owners to do with their pet--and THIS is the drug I prescribed!" His books are stultifying once you've learned the key behavioral factors he identifies (which are useful in and of themselves).  Does Dodman care at all about these animals, beyond their usefulness as subjects for his drug experimentation and potential appearance in the next repetitive volume he grinds out? His persona is reptilian and ambitious once you get past the stilted expressions of his caring about the creatures he so readily medicates out of their gourds.   Even more bothersome to me is his failure to draw any ethical line when it comes to dogs suffering radical predation/aggression. Were Dodman a bit less thrilled with his own pharmaceutical heroics, he might realize there's a time to say, "Either find another home for this dog or put him down, or I can't be responsible if he devours your baby or maims your friends." No, Dr. Dodman: when such a dog is 90% better on drugs, I'm not risking that 10% around my loved ones, thank you!  I think that his volumes might have a limited usefulness to practicing veterinarians, if they can get past their author's false-ringing tone, and if you know little to nothing about dogs and cats, you'll pick up a few key bits of information--over and over again.  I'm in search of better authors on the subject, and I plan to read the books recommended by Koch in her review-she seems more knowledgable and human than the author at point here is 
 As a huge fantasy and sci-fi fan, I looked forward to reading this series after seeing all the glowing reviews. I quickly realized after reading just a short way into the first book that the author had a deep issue with religion. The only other impression I had was boring, boring, boring. I kept waiting for the wonderful story to arrive. I resolutely started the second book, hoping I was wrong in my initial reaction and the author didn't truly hate religion and God. Well, guess what? He does. Not only does he blast the church and present members of the clergy as murderous villains, he introduces homosexual angels and informs the reader there is no God, just one angel who took control. Feeling like I had to finish the series in case the author changed the point of view, I struggled on. The third book jumps all over the place and I was left feeling dirty from having read this garbage. It went straight to the trash, something that I never do to books. However, as a Christian parent I am appalled that these books are being touted as excellent children's books 
 This is the second Nevada Barr that I have read. I picked it up on the strength of Deep South, which I thought was really terrific. It was frustrating that nearly all of what I liked about Deep South was missing from Flashback.  Flashback is structured with interwoven narratives which involve both the real-life murder and a civil war mystery related to Anna Pigeon's own family. The civil war story (told through letters and dream-like sequences) is clearly intended to add a note of gothic mystery to the story. Some may like the flavor that this element provides, but for me it dilutes the elements of the writing that I most enjoy. I really liked the crisp realism of Deep South, and felt that the style put it a cut above most books in the genre. Flashback, on the other hand, felt painfully contrived. The plot line with the letters was extremely unrealistic and (to my mind) unnecessary.   If you like historical mysteries with a gothic flavor more than you like realism in a detective novel, then you will probably be significantly less bothered than I was by Flashback. Barr at least made a clear choice with her approach to the book. Judging from the reviews, not everyone had a negative reaction to the interwoven plot lines.  I will go ahead and pick up a third Barr book, because I did like Deep South so much. It was disappointing to have not had my high hopes realized with my second outing, but hope that it can be redeemed with a third. 
 The "drummer" (more like "The Anti-Drummer") on this is Johnny Cresci.  He is maddeningly lacking in even basic garage band ability, and literally has no idea what a 6/8 blues meter is.  How he landed on the same stage with these legends may be the musical mystery of all time.  For me, Mr. "Clueless" Cresci makes it nearly impossible to enjoy the brilliant performances going on despite his anti-rhythmic upchucking.....kinda like driving an Aston Martin with a flat tire!  I have tried to get beyond Cresci's chops for over a year of listening now, and I simply can't do it.  If you're a musician, his playing will make you extremely agitated.  I'm gonna have to trade this in, and go on listening to Live Adventures like I have for the past 37 years.  This would have been much better with the drum tracks totally muted on the 6/8 numbers.    Granted, this is an historically significant release, but I think it should have stayed in the vault, or released with Johnny Cresci having been digitally removed or replaced 
 I bought one for my daughter and advised a friend to buy one.  The one I bought failed after 4 uses.  My daughter, after contacting customer support, was told to await a new power cord.  They send the wrong cord, and after another week they sent a proper cord. She has not extensively used it but has reported no problems.  However, my friend is so disgusted with his, he will not use it until I visit him and work out the usage protocol.  The handbook and help screen are pratically useless.  The scanner assumes that photos are the prime usage purpose.  I have spend over 5 hours of time in getting it to work sporadically.  On the other hand my old HP scanner had no handbook but a good help screen.  Maybe my 2o years of computer knowledge is insufficient.  Therefore, I recommend a no buy. 
 This novel is absolute dreck, at the best. I don't think I could ever pick up another Grisham novel without vomiting. Pelican Brief was Okay. But, I honestly cannot read him again, because of this.    The reason for this one star rating is this.  First, the protaganist is a stupid punk kid, who by the end of the novel you are actually hoping gets shot or SOMETHING!  Second, 496 pages filled with "blah blah blah" There wasn't enough content to constitute a five hundred page novel. Maybe one hundred, and then it would have been decent.    Third, When reading about a murder mystery with the mob involved, you would at least expect more blood-shed, or more death. Especially since this is targeted at a group that enjoys those kinds of things.   Fourth, although written at a fourth grade level no fourth grader should be allowed within three hundred feet for all the swearing that takes place. Speech and the written word, are signs of intelligence, Vulgarity is something people use when they don't know how to convey something accurately. Honestly every page has at least some.   Now you know,that unless you want your socks bored off, you shouldn't even look in the section that has Grisham in it. If you want to read something light, that's believable, not Fantasy and not Romance, read Crichton. 
 I wouldn't recommend this book at all for one your better off going to see the movie because the book tells a whole bunch of different stories which leads you in different storis instead of just talking about the same thing the whole movie. I would just recommed seeing the movie over the book 
 I received this as an XMas gift and can't get through it.  The book feels forced and manufactured.  There are points that are relatable but are painfully obvious, if you are a fantasy football player you are better off reading your league message board.  Everyone can relate to the overzealous owner in their league, most overzealous owners don't try to write a book 
 The best animated comedies are funny on two levels;  funny on the surface, for children, and funny at a deeper layer, for adults. "Shrek", for example,  was hilarious on both levels; fully for the littles, and hilarious even for us grownups.   Alas, "Robots" has nothing for anyone over the age of, oh, eight. (Not having a young child handy, mine being away at college, I am unable to say how funny it might be for the littles.)   DO NOT purchase this video expecting to be entertained yourself;  if you must, purchase this video and a book.  Your child can watch the movie, and you can read. 
 I bought this box set thinking it'd be as great as the first two and I was extremely disappointed... I would have preferred that Rhino just continued with the time period and genre that made up Nuggets 2... I've since sold Children of Nuggets on ebay just to get some of my money back... Don't even bother... Stay with Nuggets 2.. 
 The plot of this book is potentially good/interesting.  The writing and execution of Clarke's plot/ideas is, however, abysmal.  There are scenes where Clarke literally duplicates phrasing.  Honestly, a high schooler should have better writing skills.  His lexicon seems forced and his style is a watered down version of a Dan Brown/Michael Chriton/Daniel Silva.  His characters perfectly define cliché - Jimmy an NYPD cop who's smarter than he appears with boyish charm...come on.  To his credit, though, he has interesting ideas and a fairly solid understanding of how the technology he describes works (though it is certainly flawed at times). All in all, if Hollywood took this novel, rewrote it (made it flow/sound better and less cheesy) it would make for a great action/tech thriller movie...in fact, you'd be much better off reading something else and just waiting for the film to come out on this one 
 I loved the concept of the book. I hated the presentation.  The book had too many characters, was wordy, and not even entertaining.   Jill Nelson should have hung out with some 40-something sistas to get the lingo right. She tried to hard to make them hype and they came off fake.  Fiction is not real but dang at least make it interesting.  I think Ms. Nelson should  stay with non-fiction and/or write about her generation and what they really are going through.  Lord have mercy this book gave me a headache.  
 This book is about a man named Ray Atlee whose father has just died, leaving $3 million in unexplained cash.  Someone else knows about the money.  The three major questions for the book to answer are:  1) Where did the money come from? 2) Who is the mystery person (or people) trying to get it? 3) What will Ray do with it?  I have reached page 261 in this book, and NONE of these questions have been answered.  Ray has moved the money around, been vaguely threatened by person or persons unknown and had many conversations with side characters that all led nowhere.  261 pages in, all I know is where the money DIDN'T come from.  This is a legal thriller that does not thrill.  The pacing is deadly dull and I keep waiting, waiting, WAITING for something to happen and nothing does.  Finally I threw the book down in frustration an hour or so ago when I realized how close to 300 pages I'd gotten with nothing happening.  I don't know why I even gave the book this much of a chance.  Nothing bad has happened to him, and even though three million is at stake, none of the bad guys have taken any but the most harmless ways of trying to get it.  If they were really following him as much as it's alluded to in the book, they could have easily put a bullet in his head any time and taken the cash.  He spends half the book carrying it around in the trunk of his car, for God's sake!  I may finish it one day, but as of now I just don't care about the money or the characters who are after it.  Not Grisham's best, by a long shot 
 The hyperbole won't seem appropriate to most people, but for me this was the single most un-enjoyable movie I've ever seen, ever. Every aspect of it was painful.   First, the production values: this movie is just ugly. I guess the biological computers are supposed to be a novel or deep concept, but it's just disgusting and really very poor looking. At times I thought they just rooted through the medical examiner's dumpster to gather props. I understand that you can't really have nice props in a low-budget movie, but with the setting and technology so central to the plot you think they could've paid for a decent production designer. Everyone says this is not a "special effects" movie and that the ideas behind it are what counts, but plenty of low budget movies didn't look this bad and were able to convey something new.  The acting: just one thing in a sea of annoyances here was Jude Law's accent. It's terrible, and he lets his native one slip several times. It's distracting and sloppy. The dialogue was just bad overall, so I blame the writer for most of this.  This movie is not "misunderstood." It's an objectively bad movie. It's unentertaining, boring, and scrabbling for a significance that only scraggly-bearded philosophy majors will care about and dogmatize. A lot of reviews said it was better to see it as a black comedy, but this movie is only unintentionally funny, if at all. I'd give it zero stars if I could, as I'm trying to warn people away from this turd 
 This was required reading for my 15 year old son and he said: It was boring 
 For the most part, the author seems to have pretty  good information for the time of the book's printing, but for anyone who wants to read this book on purely scientific terms, be warned; there are several places where the  book goes awry, for example: the author states that tracks of tyrranosaurus  indicate that it was a solitary animal, occasionally hunting in pairs.  Problem: no  tracks of a t. rex have been discovered to date, a decade and  a half after the writing. Aside from that and a few other points, though,  the book is good reading 
 First, I just want to say that Asma does an admirable job of explaining complex ideas in accessible language.  I just want to amplify the concerns of a previous reviewer who noted Asma's mischaracterizations of the later evolutions of Buddhism. Asma subscribes to a view that is no longer prevalent among Buddhist scholars that Mahayana Buddhism is a perversion of the Buddha's intent, and that the doctrine of emptiness is mystical mumbo jumbo about the ineffable nature of the absolute.   While there may be some Buddhists out there who teach emptiness in this way, it is not representative of traditional Mahayana teachings. In fact, the reliance on reason and investigation are essential to the Mahayana path, and emptiness is a doctrine that expresses Buddhist selflessness in a more systematic and far-reaching way.  The portrayal of the Buddha as a kind of transhistorical figure, with mystical elements in his life story, is also not unique to the Mahayana. The Pali scriptures that Asma primarily relies on are full of such references. Thus, his description of the Buddha's teachings, while intelligent and fun to read, is nonetheless partial and biased.  For a more complete picture of the teachings of the Buddha in the Pali scriptures, you should check out "In the Buddha's Words," edited by Bhikkhu Bodhi 
 For starters, if you want to start saving money then don't buy this book or waste the gas to get you to the library!  By far the WORST wedding book I have ever read (and I've read lots of them).  This book has hideous reception suggestions such as using your parish CAFETERIA to host your event.  Using olives as an "appetizer", having a fake foam cake, having an amatuer dj who plays "for free to get experience" and many other bad ideas. Words cannot express how bad I thought this book was.  I actually called another woman and read her a few quotes to get her opinion and she laughed so hard she actually cried.  The fact that the author kept plugging her other stupid wedding planning books was almost as tacky as some of her suggestions. Right up there with the tackiness of a cash bar.   
 This unit is not compatible with the Sprint PPC 6700 as posted above! Make sure you call Pioneer with your telephone model number for compatibility. I tried the PPC 6700 and my wife's phone (another sprint phone, not sure on the model number). Both have issue and Pioneer's customer service agent was horrible and would not help solve this issue, only to blame me for not calling Pioneer first!   This unit is the first device that was not compatible with my phone that I ran into 
 This was a howler... Brown is so ignorant about intelligence gathering, computers, and NSA that there was no way to suspend disbelief and just go for the ride. Brown needs to learn to research his storylines, and then he needs to learn to write a lot better (even DaVinci Code suffered from bad writing), and he needs a better editor who will guide him on his way 
 Uncut magazine from England  rated this 5 stars and DVD of the month. They also claimed the Coen Brothers paid tribute to it Big Lebowski. This was enough to make me shell out the bucks and buy it.   Imagine my dissapointment. The picture and sound quality were dire. Too much contrast in the video and the sound had to be turned up super loud to follow the dialogue.   The movie came across as just another viet vet/counter culture exploitation movie with a trite plot that hardly went anywhere and never engaged me or made me feel any suspense. Dialogue was dated and cliched.   I'll never trust an Uncut Reviewer again. Don't waste your money on this one 
 I was horrified by how this story dwells on the terrifying separation of mother & baby rather than the amazing friendship of Owen & Mzee.  I would never read this story to a young child 
 This out of all the many versions of Jane Eyre has to be my least favorite...   Granted Samantha Morton has  a very  adorable fairy/ Elfin like face like Mr Rochesters Description of her, but her acting has  no highs and lows. She stands up to Mr Edwards a little too much giving really snappy answers, seemingly no respect to her employer, which is not fault of  hers, the writing of the script is bad.... and so the direction. Ciaran Hinds  is totally over the top. He is so angry with no understanding, his eyes are  very lustful and at times  crazed.  He is not at all like the character  described in Brontes epic book of a very sad and  tortured man who falls hopelessly in love with the  innocence and singular personality of earnest, honest and yet strong sweet  Jane Eyre that Charlotte Bronte brought so vividly to life with her classic words.    The over acting of both during the proposal scene is almost comical.To me there is no love, feeling  or chemistry here between the two actors just lust.... He seems to be going through a middle age crises just eyeing up this young girl, and she though supposedy a virgin...  she dosn't act like one.  Plus this movie  seems very rushed you can never get a good foot hold of the story Especially during Janes childhood. I do also miss the Gypsy scene that is omitted in many of these movies and was expertly done in the Dalton /Clarke mini series, which brought some brief light heartednes to an otherwise very dark story.   If you want to see great versions. I  highly rate the 1944 movie with Orson Wells though it is another abreviatd version, that movie truly captured the spirit and feel. It is moody dark and mysterious. Another is the fantastic Timothy Dalton version which is most accurate to the book of all the movies taking actual lines right from the  Brontes story.  Dalton's and Clarkes acting is simply superbly sublime!   However if you are like me, see them all and make your own decision. They all have something to offer and most are entertaining... 
 please, editors, tell the new writer that a given plot must be cohesive.  A friend of Qwill's is killed in an accident, a friend who is the significant other of a fellow whom Qwill has known since he, the fellow, was a youngster, and Qwill does----NOTHING!!???  Get out of town!  Also, why was that hunting accident/murder thrown in?  Where did it go?  Nowhere!  Get the new author, or authors, up to speed 
     A literary cottage industry was spawned nearly twenty years ago with the publication of  "Holy Blood, Holy Grail" by Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh. The outstanding example of its output is "The DaVinci Code," in which the story has been even further dumbed down for popular consumption. While Tracy Twyman's "The Merovingian Mythos" is not quite as abysmally bad, it is representative of the genre. It takes a handful of historical facts (some of which are quite fascinating), relates them to literature and legend (again, often having considerable interest) and leavens them with a great deal of speculation, myth, and, one suspects, wishful thinking. It is entirely typical of the attitude that permeates so much of our society, whereby facts (whether they be intelligence reports from the middle east, economic data, or whatever) are selected to fit their consumer's desires and prejudices. Sad to say, there are many people who would rather believe in fairy tales than in humdrum realities.      The failing of all the "Merovingian mythos" books is that they do not face genealogical facts. As we trace our ancestry back from the present generation, each generation of ancestors doubles in number. Thus, every person has two parents, four grandparents, eight great-grandparents, and so on. There are today about sixty generations separating us from the time of the semi-legendary Merovingian progenitor who is variously called Meroveus, Merovech, or Merovée. Accordingly, the typical middle-aged adult of the early twenty-first century has ancestors at that period numbering approximately two to the sixtieth power. This number is, of course, many times the number of people actually living in Europe during the fifth century A.D., so there is much repetition of ancestral lines. Accordingly all people of European descent have many ancestors in common.      In such works on genealogy as Roderick Stuart's "Royalty for Commoners," Frederick Lewis Weis's "Ancestral Roots of Certain American Colonists," and Gary Boyd Roberts's "The Royal Descents of 600 Immigrants to the American Colonies," documented lineages having living representatives may be followed all the way back to the Merovingians. For example, in Stuart's book one may find lineages back to Merovech through Charlemagne, through Charlemagne's wife Hildegarde of Swabia, through Hugh "le Méfiant," and through Regnier "Longhals." The last-named of these goes through Adela, the daughter of the doomed Dagobert II, thus encompassing virtually the complete Merovingian line.   A relatively large number of people exist who can prove they descend through at least one of these lines, some through all four, and often with much duplication. This number is dwarfed by that of the descendants who are completely unaware of their ancestry.       Even if the fanciful theories advanced in "Holy Blood, Holy Grail" and elaborated in "The Merovingian Mythos" were all true, just what would it mean? That perhaps more than half of all people of north European descent were descended from a) Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalen; b) Jews of ancient Palestine; c) Sumerian god-kings? And what would any of these prove?       The study of genealogy is rewarding because it yields a personalized acquaintance with history. For example, the revolutionary battle of King's Mountain, or the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, somehow have more significance to me because ancestors of mine were there. Shortly after I was able to prove a line to Charlemagne, I was able to pick up Ariosto's "Orlando furioso" with a bit more interest than I had in it three decades ago in college. It adds a certain dimension to know that one is descended from the saintly Margaret, queen of Scotland, or from Fredegonde, whom Stuart identifies as one of the most bloodthirsty women in history.       We are a mixed-up race, descended from saints and sinners, heroes and villains, and none of these facts changes in the least who we are or what we do in life, unless we are inspired (or repelled) by their examples. I would far rather study a well-documented work of genealogy, with the literary classics and a good historical reference like the eleventh edition of the Encylopædia Britannica close at hand, than any number of pseudo-histories such as "The Merovingian Mythos."   
 I bought this book as I have been asked to start using PERL at work.  All I can say is what a waste of money. It has a tiny index (9 pages).  In a programming book, the index is the most important part of the book.  I get programming books and look-up things when I need help.  If I can even find anything in the book, it points me to the PERL documentation.  I offered it to a fellow co-worker who has been using PERL for a while now and he says it doesn't have anything that a beginner can't pick up using a free online tutorial.  So, don't bother with this book 
 While I hardly consider myself a scholar on the life of St. Pio, I've read enough about him to recognize the excessive amount of fiction presented in this film.  Why?  Here we have a man considered by many the greatest person of the 20th century - living a long life of love, devotion, sacrifice, wonders, hardships and generosity - a life so incredible and divinely inspired, why would anyone need to add fiction to it?  Yet, fiction it is, and plenty of it.  This movie touches on several things that were indeed important in St. Pio's life:  his long hours in the confessional, his establishment of a modern hospital, and his devotion to his spiritual children.  Padre Pio had many spiritual children, some he saw regularly through mass and confession, and many others he corresponded with.  Yet, the filmmakers here decided that better drama could be achieved by focusing almost exclusively on one spiritual child - Cleonice Morcaldi.  This is a real name of a real person who knew St. Pio, but in most ways she is fictionalized here.  In this film, she is a young, attractive, restless "wild child," who has just missed her train, upon which he invites her to stay and settle in his parish.  Cleonice soon settles, reforms, commits to her faith, attends mass daily, and then starts appearing in nearly every incident of Padre Pio's life.  Their relationship, as depicted in this movie, becomes so close that at times it seems almost sensual.  This is not only fiction, but offensive fiction as well.  It's especially offensive because there were times in which many of St. Pio's peers became so resentful of the friar's popularity that they spread false and hurtful gossip through vatican channels, claiming that he was having secret relationships with women.  These stories then led to periods in which the vatican took away many of Padre Pio's priestly duties, which were very devastating experiences for him.  Watching this film's scenes between St. Pio and Cleonice, an uninformed viewer MAY actually start to wonder if these stories were true, and there are no words to accurately express the blasphemy I felt while watching them.  What's even more shocking about the emphasis on Cleonice Morcaldi is that, here, she is REPLACING the presence and role of Mary Pyle - the REAL person who constantly accompanied and aided Padre Pio, devoting many years of her life to his work and charities.  Here, Mary's name is only referenced when St. Pio discusses her fundraising efforts for his hospital.  Again, more unnecessary fiction about a life that's far more interesting than fiction.  This movie also uses a fictional narrative device - like many Hollywood films do - where the lead character is visited by someone who sits down to question him about his whole life (which conveniently sets up flashbacks).  Here, Jurgen Prochnow appears as a priest who has been a longtime detractor of Padre Pio.  He hears that the friar is dying, so he pays him a visit, demanding that he "confess" to all the past accusations.  Predictably, by films' end, the priest "sees the light" and then other "revelations" about the priest himself are presented for added drama (as if the loss of Padre Pio in itself wasn't "dramatic" enough).  These scenes between Prochnow and Sergio Castellitto (as Padre Pio) fill in some biographical holes, but they're too frequent, and one soon tires of the closeups of Prochnow's icy blue eyes and their cartoonish, devil-like stares.  Castellitto's acting is fine here; he gives viewers a feel for Padre Pio as a real, complex human being.  There are also plenty of beautiful shots of the Italian countryside and the interiors of some very old churches.  However, as nice as these points are, they're not enough to justify watching this movie.  It's simply incomprehensible that such a fictionalized account of this incredible, holy man could have originated in his homeland - where Padre Pio is almost as revered as Jesus and Mary.  Please honor the memory and dignity of the great St. Pio by not buying or watching this film.  There are many fine biographies available of the saint, about Mary Pyle, and about the many, many letters Padre Pio wrote to his REAL spiritual children.  READ THEM, and you'll quickly realize what a travesty this movie is 
 A weak story line and a confusing plot ensured that I was complete lost somewhere in the middle of Jamica in the first few chapters.Was disappointing to read this work of Ludlum, who otherwise has had an untarnished reputation so far 
 I ordered the Chocolate & Mint variety. Amazon had them for a great price and shipped them quickly. However, I ordered the cookies in early November, and they arrived with a "Best When Used By" date of December 4, 2006. They will expire less than a month after they arrived!  I'm not sure if this is Amazon's fault or not. The cookies are shipped in the manufacturer's Back to Nature box, so it could be the company is unloading older cases of merchandise on Amazon.com 
 In her section about Lakewood, the author tries to create a connection between Lakewood, the spur posse, and the military-industrial complex that does not exist.  She regards Lakewood as a breeder town, built to supply human labor for the aerospace industry.  Here are the facts:  1.  Lakewood was created in 1948 by real estate investors to provide housing for returning WW2 veterans.  2.  The LB Naval Shipyard, Douglas Aircraft, Lockheed, Northrop, and North American Aviation were all in operation long before Lakewood was built.  3.  The spur posse was given way too much publicity by the tabloid TV vultures to a National audience.  I emphasize the word National.  The market for those kind of unhealty tv shows goes beyond southern Calif.  Lakewood home values are very good, and the neighborhood infrasturcture is a lot more organized than most southern Calif housing projects built in the same era.  If she wants to bash a southern Calif. neighborhood, Long Beach would be an easier target.  There, you have many nice one-home lots that were destroyed by investors who built 8-unit apartments on a one-home lot.  Anyone who has not actually lived in Lakewood might believe her essay...but it is not reality.  In the end, she thinks So. Calif is headed over the cliff.  I would say the idyllic "Calif. Golden Fantasy" is no more...but whatever changes that occur here will have to be dealt with in a positive manner, instead of just being given an obituary 
 First of all, I didn't think the book was very well written - it needed much tighter editing.  Many points are repeated over and over again, and I found several typos.  It is also heavily aimed at Americans with poor diets.  However, I did it, although I had to go to 3 doctors to find someone who would prescribe the necessary drugs, and then only reluctantly.  I have just finished 6 months on it and am going to stop now.  It has helped none of my health problems, and I have in fact had new fungal rashes develop while I was doing it.  The food restrictions make it very hard to lead a normal social life.  According to his questionnaires, I am a prime candidate for candidiasis, but this treatment did not make any difference.  No harm in trying it, but don't put too much hope into it 
 I liked the slicer okay...but the wire just snapped and I haven't had it but a few months 
 I bought this camera 3 months ago and have used it a few times. Last week all of a sudden the pictures look out of focus and over-exposed. I haven't changed anything or done anything. I have no idea what's wrong with the camera, but given the price I'm pretty annoyed and Amazon.com will not refund my money because it has been over 30 days 
 Simply put, this book is the drivel of a man who thinks very highly of himself. It's like being forced to have dinner with your egotistical, drunken uncle. "Blah blah blah... And then  I saved the world and looked good doing it.... Blah blah blah... AREN'T I GREAT?!?! 
 This is the kind of film I get stuck watching on long plane rides and would NEVER seek myself. It is such silly schlock that I marvel at how the Hollywood mill can churn these things out and make money - it's really an industrial production process, geared to superficial viewers.    This is one of the basic plots.  THe others include crippled boy, whose love of a dog or pony allows him to walk, love, or talk.  Why do we keep watching this junk?  A video game at least offers some chance of a variation in outcome.  OK, here goes:  beautiful girl with a dream, seeking big break, gets gig in a bar, handles it, meets boy who doesn't fit into plans, shakes it, shakes it more, shakes it a lot more, flirts with corruption, stays course, makes real friends, gets to know real self, grows.  Oh, and then succeeds on her own terms.  Not recommended.  Admittedly, the acting in not abysmal, but what a waste of time about lives that could never exist 
 Bill, when will you just die?  if you read this feel free to email me evan.fett@gmail.co 
 Starting out, it was OK until he started doing the mantra. Yikes! The most annoying sound I've ever heard. Better just to do your own mantra and skip this CD. 
 While this container holds nipples in place nicely and the basket is good for the standard infant goodies, the unit made by Munchkin I always use first.  The lower portion of the basket is awkward to open, and the placement of caps above the nipples means leftover water always gets dumped on the nipples.  Flipping the unit upside down does help both these issues, but then the nipples don't drain the right way 
 This book was terrible, and I would not recommend it for anyone, especially young teens. Although I do understand the author's intentions, the grammar and punctuation were incorrect. Issues such as an eating disorder and incest were present and were never really dealt with or handled properly. Overall, the story was very unrealistic. I had to make myself finish reading it, despite wanting to quit many times. It was not exciting and didn't keep my interest. Not recommended at all 
 I agree with the rest of the reviews.  I've read this series since its' inception, and enjoyed almost all of the books.  The sex has gotten stanger and more prevelant, but even through the last book it was still an adjunct to the plot.  This one however has nothing BUT sex.  No plot, no action.  If you took out all pages which contain sex you wouldn't have 5% of the book left 
 The John Carter of Mars series of books, by my favorite author of all time,   Edgar Rice Burroughs,  is his best series. I was so excited to receive the audio version of this book, but when I listened to it, I was hoorified !    John Carter sounded like a wimp.  A girly Southerner, not at all the swashbuckling hero I envisioned.   Now, maybe I'm spoiled by the narrators of other books, but even the weakest, most boring readings have not turned me off in the way that John Bolen has.   Please Tantor audio,  get some one else to read this, and make sure it is a Manly-Man ! 
 Maybe i'm not as cultured as some of the people who rated this book, but i have read the likes of Jane Austen and Louisa May Alcott and i think it is safe for this to be a true review. Please, please don't put yourself through the torment of reading this book, it is probably the worst book i have ever read. It goes on and on about the littlest of details which don't have anything to do with the book. I read this when i was 11 and it is safe to say i wasn't too immature to read it. Everyone in my class read it and i'm pretty sure we all had the same opinions, it really sucked. I would tell you the worst part of the book, but that would ruin the story. But let me just tell you a little tip, don't read it. Don't read it, don't read it, don't read it. I tried to read it again last year and i couldn't put myself through the pain and torment of reading the worlds worst book. Don't waste your money or waste a part of your life reading a book about nothing 
 I am sorry to have to say these things but I feel it necessary to be honest. I am a avid reader and I picked this book up to try this author. This book was very slow and the characters  are very shallow.I felt no attachment or pull to any of them. I kept waiting for something to happen but to my dissapointment it never came. You as a reader can tell from the first few chapters exactly what will take place in this book. There was nothing in this book of interest to me as a reader and I will think twice next time before reading anything from this author 
 I was going to buy this book because it was so highly recommended by Dr. Phil among others. When I checked the reviews at amazon books I decided it would be safer to check it out at my local library and I have to say THANKS FOR THE WARNING. This book was so bad I wanted to throw up. Who would raise their kids like this. Why would you want to make food a control issue and teach your kids animals are disposable. Whats up with the spanking. Why would you beat your own kids! Honestly, it might work but so would hitting them over the head with a 2X4. We are their parents, surely we can do better than that! 
 I, too kicked myself for falling for the marketing hype that surrounds this mediocre book. As others have noted, the text is uneven, hints a multiple authors, and is based on little more than repetitions of various ideas from pop psychology and the current interest in law of attraction systems. Feel-good platitudes abound, but little else of any depth. The book has, unfortunately, about the same level of subject depth as an average website.  On a related topic, this book is an example of a very damaging trend in the publishing industry. Publishers can be wooed into printing a book entirely on the strength of the author's "platform" rather than any qualitative judgement of quality. If you have a big enough mailing list, and you can get a bunch of friends to write good Amazon reviews (see the early reviews of this book), you can get a book published no matter how poorly written.   The bright side of this is that I now recognize the techniques used to activate this so-called platform. In the future I will not fall for it 
 I have purchased 3 I thought its feather bed pad something as the description but its end up to be only a cover so its just not good to buy online " on Amazon"because you can't really expect what you are gonna get. please becareful 
 After listening, with some frequency, to the "Shaman" album, I noticed this song popping up on the radio-waves.  Instead of the growling, slightly-angsty version sung by Nickelback's frontman, we get this smoothed-over, watery version that is much more radio-friendly, and is much less appealing 
 Since I have received this piece of s**t I have had to call twice because parts were either damaged or not working.  You have to call several times to get through to a customer service rep and they never answer when you leave a message 
 I have not heard the entire album, but three songs that have gotten a lot of airplay in metro-NYC: Charlie last name wilson, I can do magic, and Don't say a word. From what I gather this is a R. Kelly produced and written album. Let's begin with "Charlie, last name wilson". Is this a song or a calling card? I guess R. Kellys' got plenty in the bank because this is tune won't get any future covers!! " I Can do Magic" is just plain tragic bereft of melody and I've heard better lyrical structure on Seasame Street Tunes. As for "Don't say a word" there is a section with the phrase "word,word,word". Somebody definitely stole the melody to this one.  As for the production, it seems that for the most part a producer in what's currently called R&B has been reduced to a person who can adequatley operate a keyboard based sequencer. Lastly I am certain that if you listen to bulk of R. KELLYS' songwriting from his first radio hit (Honey Love) to the present Charlie Wilson, and Ronald Isley garbage, you too will agree that the title of his next big hit should be "I Believe I Can Write A Song" 
 This is not meant to serve as a useful review but as a warning that the positive reviews here at amazon are not reflective of the actual quality of the book. This book, in my opinion, is unreadable and listlessly and discursively meanders. A complete waste of time that lacks depth and resonance. Take time researching this book before you buy it because it's the worst book I've ever purchased. 
 Sixth Sense & Unbreakable are so much better than Signs, and I'm sorry to say whatever M. Night Shyamalan originally had, he's lost. When Sixth Sense came out, he was tipped as the next big thing, but I'm sorry to say, it's no longer there. In my mind, he cannot match any films up to the success and sheer uniqueness of Sixth Sense.  Signs just fails miserably. The concept was a good idea, but the execution was terrible. It reminded me very much of Blair Witch Project, as in what little action there was happens off screen, and the torches as well. It's also definitely not Mel Gibson's best film. Even the actors appear to struggle with the dialogue-heavy script, and not really much happens. Apart from one brief glimpse of an alien. Oooh. Fascinating.  The problem I think that Signs has, is that it's already following many other, far superior, alien movies. Aliens attacking the earth has been done, and lots more memorable than this. There's also the overly religious theme, which the film probably would have done better either toning down, or scrapping altogether. It was really just thrown in to try and justify what was happening in the film. The scenes between Gibson and his kids and his brother are way too sentimental and really cringeworthy.  The finale doesn't really make the film better. The discovery that the naked aliens find water like acid to their skin is atrocious! Why come to earth, the surface of is mostly covered in water, and the atmosphere is full of water droplets and vapour?! And then they travel millions of light years with far advanced technology - and then can't break into a wooden house?! Are you kidding me? But the most ridiculous thing is not only do the characters not pay attention to the dogs, who sensed something was not right (time to get myself a dog), but the fact that all the sophisticated radar equipment cannot detect the aliens entering our atmosphere - but a BABY MONITOR can?! Huh?!  A film to stay well away from. Thankfully, I didn't spend my hard earned (ha!) money on it, but borrowed it from a friend. I shall approach M. Night Shyamalan's films with trepidation from now. Oh, and when a director decides to give himself a speaking role in his own film, make it a SHORT one 
 I'm about 35 pages into this book, and while some of the information it has presented has been useful (IE, more and more Argentinians were falling into poverty in 2000 or so), mostly the author has made the kind of broad, context-less statements you'd find on a protestor's sign.  Additionally, there are many factual-sounding statements which I don't know the meaning of, and I suspect many others won't know the meaning of either. For example, "51 of the hundred biggest economies in the world are corporations". I'm sure this is important, but I'm not told why. Instead, I'm left with the impression that it's supposed to be ominous, which I don't think is a legitimate way to inform people.  Finally, the example which the author gives as somehow epitomizing how global capitalism leaves people behind is absolutely ridiculous.  She describes some guy who was born to a wealthy family, went to school with prince Charles and later attended top education institutions. He later had a successful career. Then tragedy struck and he became an alcoholic, squandering all his money and becoming homeless.  How in the world is this related to global capitalism? It's not in any way that I can discern. I've concluded, then, that the story was included to link some sensational and moving tidbit to her cause.  That's the tone and content of her book so far. She sensationalizes material which, if treated properly, wouldn't need it, and the same time glosses over facts and statistics 
 I'm afraid this book just doesn't provide a lot of original insight or guidance on the IEEE specs related to WiMAX. There's way too much anecdotal  discussion here. If you're looking for a wireless 101 book this might work, but for a WiMAX book, there's plenty of other sources that do a better job of explaining WiMAX. 
 This product simply does not produce accurate results. It skips entire lines, words on the same line, and misreads even the most legible characters. It came bundled with my scanner, so at least I did not waste my money on it. Don't waste yours 
 Damn Bizzy, wtf is goin on? the production wasnt the best but thats not an excuse to f**k up songs lke that. The best song on the cd is i understand. That is somewhat Bizzy's old style and thats what he needs 2 bring back. Plus u gotta understand im not dissin Bizzy i got all his solo cds and all the Bone cds. Its just that i know that Bizzy can do MUCH bette 
 I work for a book summary company.  One of the books selected for summary is this book.  When you have the world famous author who made the startling expose on the Watergate scandal and Assistant Managing Editor of Washington Post, write about the eventful hours following the 9/11 attack at the World Trade Center, your expectations are naturally very high.  But Woodward lets you down, as this book leans heavily on transcripts of National Security Council meetings and extended interviews including over 4 hours of interview with George Bush, to reveal the layers of decision making process that followed the cataclysmic incident.  By providing the details of the close-door meetings amongst the key central players, we do get to size up partially on the personality of those involved.  We are privy to the arguments and ideological differences amongst the principal leaders as President Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, Donald Rumsfeld, CIA Director George Tenet, and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, forcefully put their weight and power behind their viewpoints and decisions.  We are treated to how the CIA successfully waged an intelligence war against Afghanistan leading to the fall of the Taliban.  Beyond that we get precious little in terms of clear opinion on the dynamics of the decision making or the wisdom behind it.  A mere reportage of the collection of meetings and interviews are best served in a newspaper, and thus could ideally have found its way into Washington Post.  In the publication of a book, we expect a renowned media investigator as Woodward to undertake a more serious study such as on policy matters or the depth of leadership involved or an incisive analysis of personalities and so forth.  This is a rather tame book and hardly adds anything of great value, and much less so to the trailblazing work that Woodward is capable of.  
 I'm a big player of PC games, but I also love reading and thinking about my favorite hobby. For the past few years I've been living in the UK, but when I come to the US (and now that I live here again) I would pick up the American version of PC Gamer.  I have to say, and I hope some of you take my word on this, the U.K. publication is light-years ahead of this one. The humour is grown-up (not to mention actually funny) and doesn't drown the magazine. It's bigger, the cover and pages are of much better quality paper and ink, the articles are neatly laid out... added to this, the demo disc is a jam-packed dual sided DVD, with archives of patches, movies, free games, demoes, hardware guides....  Not to mention the fact that there are many highly intelligent articles every month.   In case you're still feeling sceptical: the UK version of PC Gamer was the original. It came to the US after it was set up in the UK.   Having lavished the UK PC Gamer with praise, I think you can read between the lines and figure out where the US version falls short 
 I oppose property politically and found this book completely unhelpful. Its arguments are, without exception, specious, Proudhon's style is verbose and graceless, and his answer to the question of the book's title a verbal  wrangling which reduces the work to an attack a highly specific type of  ownership in favour of another. Proudhon is no anarchist and no anarchist  should look to this book for inspiration. It is of hitorical interest as a  stage in the development of radical philosophy, nothing more 
 I would like to go to the trouble of explaining why, in detail, this is not a good movie; however, since amazon habitually goes to the trouble of deleting my other one star reviews, I will go to no such trouble 
 This "game" is so disappointing. My nephew loves Spiderman. He needs fun and subtle cues to stay engaged. He was so excited to get this his first LMAX cartridge we could barely get the box open fast enough. We popped it in and had to wait until the commercials or very long intro completed. Then we had to blindly navigate through the screens to get to games. They were NOT intuitive and then THUD. He lost interest and has not returned to the LMax since. What an absolute waste of money. 
 Deaver's skill at weaving a crafty and intriguing suspense story is sound.  He has the bare bones of the work down to a science, and when it comes to most of his tales, the bones themselves are strong, hearty, and glistening white.  In this case, however, those bones have virtually no muscle.  This tale is about Tate Collier, his ex, Bett, and their kidnapped child, Megan.  The villian for this tale, a slick-tongued psychiatrist named Aaron Matthews, is a man of such skill that he can talk virtually anyone into anything, a talent that rivals that of our protagonist, Tate, a lawyer who once wielded the same verbal weapons in the courtroom.  As I said, the story itself has some intriguing twists and turns, as all suspense tales should, and it offers up satisfying obstacles and the usual mysteries, but they fall flat for a number of reasons.  1.  When the crux of your tale lies on creating characters of uncanny persuasive abilities, the heart of your novel must lie within the dialogue those characters utilize.  In this case, neither Matthews or Collier ever speak convincingly enough, in my opinion, to warrant their being labelled as men who "speak in tongues."  And although a lot of interpretation must be allowed for the written medium, it still doesn't seem like Matthews' talent for conniving others is as plausible as the novel would like it to be.  2.  The book falls prey to a pretty major pitfall for literature of this type, and that is over-elaborate explanations for key motives and behavoirs.  We even get treated to a cliched moment of having the bad guy reveal his whole plot to the good guys before actually going through with the plot.  3.  Implausibility.  There are some areas of the book that are downright laughable, aside from the already mentioned superhuman talent at persuasiveness some of the characters possess.  4.  My biggest pet peeve: Deaver cannot write dialogue for teenagers.  In an attempt at creating authenticity, Deaver peppers their dialogue with an abundance of "like"s and "way lame"s so that they sound like rejects from some B-grade rip-off of a Dazed and Confused remake.  I understand that kids still occasionally talk like this, but Deaver's use of these trite bits of characterization is so liberal it becomes intrusive and annoying and ludicrous.  If you want to try Deaver, check out The Devil's Teardrop or the Bone Collector.  This is not worth the effort 
 I only enjoyed one song.  The one they always play on the radio.  How disappointed I was to pay a high price to just enjoy ONE song.  
 While reading this I realized that Blood Games holds the dubious distinction of being the worst book I have ever read. Forget for a moment that it is not scary and is in fact BORING-Laymon wrote this book as if from the point of view of a hormonal 13 year- old boy in the 1950s who wants to be a writer when he grows up but doesn't know yet that he has no talent! These grown women (college graduates) do and say things I've never seen or heard any other woman do. They talk like men (or perhaps 13 year old boys) and use language I haven't heard in atleast 25 years. I was bored to tears by all the talk about their bare body parts (no-these were not sexual situations.) No, women do not frequently hang out naked together for no reason, No, we do not walk naked in the woods because it's TOO HOT to wear a tank top, No, I did not finish this book and No I will not try another Laymon 
 I recently read "I", "K", and "L" in succession.  Compared to "Innocent" and "Killer", I found Lawless to be slow paced (even though this edition finds Kinsey spontaneously traveling across the country) and the plot twists less surprising.  With others I've read in the series, I am usually hooked relatively early in the story line.  I was 1/3 of the way through this iteration before becoming mildly interested in the outcome.  Even the subplots were not overly attention grabbing (Kinsey has little contact with immediate family, ergo she substitutes others in her life--Henry, Rosie, Pitt family, the criminal elements in this book--as her family...).  I also found it hard to believe that some of the characters that appear in "L" could be so dim-witted on one page, and great possessors of vast knowledge with incredible powers of deduction on the next.  Anyway, there are others in this series I would recommend more highly ("M" being one of them) 
 sadly i feel tricked....yes michael buble can sing but the cd is short and the songs are not so good. reading other critisims posted  i see my feelings are shared 
 Warning only read this book if you are brain dead, wearing rose colored glasses, and will believe anything you are told by the Peterson legal camp both former and current as well as his supporters...if this description fit's you will love this book 
 I could get the aircraft to pickup and eventually hover but there is no such thing as getting that thing to go in the direction you want it to. I put the aluminum weights on the nose to get it to move forward that way all I had to do was turn it in the direction I wanted it to go. It is very difficult and is no way as easy as it looks on TV. And I've practiced a lot 
 Each time you replace the battery you have to reload all of your data.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 I worked in an independent outpatient facility in the early 1970's, when Al Lowen was publishing, which ought to give you some idea of the focus involved.  Bioenergetics had something to commend it, especially in the 70's, and still does, for people who are experiencing day-to-day stress (so what's new?).  But I do not see where the long-term benefit can be had for someone who is really ill: anorexic, paranoid, or psychotic.  As with a volcano, venting helps yet doesn't solve the underlying turmoil.  As a daily anger (or other) management tool it may be a bandaid but I do not believe it helps in the long run. I can personally testify that bioenergetics did nothing for me, although admittedly my exposure was not consistent. 35 years after the fact, I'm in conventional therapy as well as pharmaceutical treatment for issues that arose while I was working at the facility, aa was my tormentor 
 When an outsider Darwinian evolutionist embraces this book as agreeing with his metaphorical spin on God's non-metaphorical Genesis 1-11, the endorsement is telling! Matter of Days mongrelizes the Lord's documentation of what He did and when/how He did it. Whatever a Darwinianist thinks of Day 4 - long or short - Genesis clearly documents that's when sun, moon and stars were MADE, not just appeared as the clouds cleared. However, bigbangers like the author can't accept that version, so have sun, moon,stars evolving over billions of years along the standard evolutionary cosmythological scenario of Carl Sagan and cohorts. Secular astrophysics dictates, defines and determines how God intended to communicate His documentary! God Himself in His Own plaintext recording of events is dismissed or subject to secular revisionism to cater to scientific rationale. How best to handle the Bible? NOT 'God said it, I believe I know what He meant and that settles my slant on it' as Darwinianism or metaphorianism choose to spin it. Rather, 'God documented it in plain Hebrew through Moses the Prophet, that settles it for those taking God at His Word unvarnished and unredefined for modern consumption, I choose to believe the Original Literal Version over the metaphorical perversion.'  That this farce would appeal to Bible-alterers,however sincere, held intellectually captive to modern science philosophism is tantamount to disendorsement for the serious Bible-accepter-at-face-value. 
 Conclusions that Richard Lynn draws from the data should be valid if and only if he could explain the historical facts and not only the extant situation.  His ahistorical approach is exemplary. While he explicitely conducts evolutionary analysis of the humankind he surprisingly forgets to connect his IQ data with historical facts such as:  that the first great civilisations emerged in the Near East and Northern Africa not in Northern, Central or Eastern Europe; the first European civilizations connected with metalurgy (the Asia Minor and the Balkan Complex), rational thought (elaborate philosophy and mathematical theoremes) emerged in Asia Minor and SouthEast Europe, not in Northern or Central Europe. Northern and Central Europe started to emerge in the history of civilisation only at the end of the middle ages and was enlightened by the Arab translations of the ancient Greek thought. This explanatory paradox substantially weakens Lynn's general conclusions on the direct connection between geography and general cognitive abilities. This is also valid for the conclusions in his book on IQ and the wealth of the countries. His ahistorical explanations are astonishing in negative sense.  For example, the higher IQ scores of Northern Europeans compared to the Southeast Europeans could be a result of the very well documented South to North migratory flow during the last 5-6 centuries of Turkish Ottoman suppression in Southeast Europe. Many highly intelligent people even today leave Southeast Europe and migrate to USA or Western Europe for better life. This is an every day fact. Thus, it is not only the cold winters that concentrate clever people in some geographical regions in some periods of time. The real high resolution picture of the IQ-Race-Geography dynamics is probably much more complex and intricate than Lynn is ready to admit. His explanations, thus, can be treated only as zero (or at most) first approximation acceptable on the general geographic scale. Much more subtle historical analyses are needed on lower geographic scales to make his explanations meaningful 
 I bought 20 stocks with Greenblatt's list.  Two quarters later i have lost 25 percent of my capital.  Of the 20 stocks i picked from his list, only 8 are now on his list 5 months later!!!  Wow!! What changed with his numbers SO quickly?  Watch out for the Hussler!!  You would think that Greenblatt already has enough money and wouldn't need to milk the consumer anymore with yet another book 
 The cover says "Presence is an intimate look at the development of a new theory about change and learning." If there's a new theory in there, I couldn't find it. The do describe something called the Theory of the U. It would be more accurate to call it a model. And I'm not certain why they think it's news.   They seem to suggest, though the connection is not explained in any detail,  that the U model is an application of Goethean scientific methodology to the decision making process. There are at least some surface similarities. It's a pity they don't actually explore that connection.  What they do instead is tell several feel good group growth stories, one or two stories of personal enlightenment experiences (primarily of the nature mysticism variety), and transcribe a series of uneventful conversations the authors had among themselves.   There's actually a two-way tie for most dissappointing. The discussion of synchronicity was hard to read it was so stereotypical. At least as bad was the oh-so-spooky examples of pre/trans fallacies and primitive magic belief episodes. At one point they actually said that during a particularly moving outdoor oration about presencing a friend in a nearby cabin noted 11 lightening strikes starting east of them and moving around them in a clockwise direction. Of course, we learn, this relates to a tribal eleven directions ceremony.  My apologies to the authors. I think this subject is absolutely critical from both an individual and collective growth perspective. I just think your treatment of it does more harm than good. Do understand, I wish I had the discipline, and the courage, to write a book myself. Perhaps one day I will and you'll have the opportunity to comment upon it as you see fit. 
 "A long way out in the deep blue sea there lived a fish. Not just an ordinary fish, but the most beautiful fish in the entire ocean."  This is a book I have some trouble with.  It is beautifully illustrated, and the glittery silver scales make it very appealing to children. However, I am not entirely sure it is sending the right message. I like to give the author the benefit of the doubt that he meant well, that the overall message is that vanity and posessions will not make you happy.   But ultimately the solution to the Rainbow fish's problems give unclear messages, and can possibly be interpretated that to make friends you need to buy them.  Other interpretations have been covered comprehensively in other reviews and include possible biass towards communist values and a want for sameness 
 Reba's music is interesting to listen to but I wouldn't pay full price for any of her music (except her real traditional country stuff).  This CD contains some tunes that would have best been left for the pop singers of the day.  They aren't for Reba.  Tunes like "Heart is the Lonely Hunter", "Everythat that You Want" (That's so awful) "Why Haven't I Heard From You" (a stupid song).  Even most of the ballads lack the credibility needed to sustain the listener's interest.  I'm glad I got this from Amazon used sellers for just a few nickels and dimes.  
 I first read The Passover Plot shortly after it was first published and while I was in college. The years have done little to change my thoughts about it. I think that it is commendable that Hugh Schonfield has attempted to get to the basics of the story of Christ and to study it from an evidential and historical perspective. If Jesus was God (with a capital "G"), he should have been able to accomplish all that is attributed to him in the scriptures as we have them today. Thus we should invite rather than fear a thorough and scholarly investigation of the life of Jesus and the related facts. Such an objective analysis should shed much light on the subject. Let the chips fall where they may. Let the truth and/or Truth prevail.   Fortunately, numerous other scholars, both before and after the publishing of TPP, have also taken such an approach to the life of Jesus and the related material. The area of expertise for these scholars ranges from the forensic sciences to philosophy, Quantum physics to medieval literature.... Some are Nobel laureates. Others are respected leaders in their chosen field. C. S. Lewis was a Cambridge don and author of the Chronicles of Narnia. J.R.R. Tolkien was a professor at Oxford and author of The Lord of the Rings series. Simon Greenleaf, an authority on jurisprudence and the laws of evidence held the Royall Professorship of Law in Harvard Law School. Dr. Cyril E.M. Joad was head of the philosophy department at the University of London. Dr. William Lyon Phelps was a professor at Yale for forty years and one of the most distinguished educators in U.S. history. This list could go on almost endlessly. However, all predate the publication of TPP and all totally disagree with Schonfield's conclusions.   The list of post-TPP scholars that thoroughly disagree with Schonfield's conclusions is even more impressive. It includes: Dr. N. T. Wright, Bishop of Durham and former don at Cambridge and Oxford; Dr. Henry Schafer III, Director of the Center for Computational Quantum Chemistry at the University of Georgia; Dr. Alvin Plantiga, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame..... ad infinitum...  The point is not that you line up scholars on either side of an issue so that they cancel one another out and you end up with a "zero-sum" game. Rather, one has to thoroughly analyze the documentation / evidence that history and all of the disciplines provide us and then arrive at a conclusion that best considers all of the pertinent data. Schonfield simply hasn't done this. I think that it is fair to say that no legitimate current published scholar, whether Christian or non-Christian, religious or secular, agrees with Schonfield and his conclusions.    Consider Schonfield's basic admonition, "...If it can be shown that to follow Jesus means to imbibe his spirit and seek his ends for mankind then these pages may have made a timely and constructive contribution to one of the most vital dialogues of this generation." If Jesus was as Schonfield portrays him, he was at best delusional. He may have had some quaint sayings and "good-ship-lollypop" ideas but most of what he said was deception. Whether he believed it or not is inconsequential. Who would want to follow such a "whack job"? Apparently, some do.  C.S. Lewis stated it well. "I am trying to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: `I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept His claim to be God.'... A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic--on a level with the man who says he is a poached egg--or else he would be the Devil of Hell."  Taken at face value, Schonfield had good intentions but he got it all wrong. He created a Jesus in his own image. His Jesus also had good intentions but he also got it all wrong. Fortunately, there's a better and historically more accurate alternative.    
 We struggled through this - luckily we didn't pay to see it. (My stepdaughter owns it, and lent it to me.) A waste of time 
 The story of these two characters reminds me of two worms vainly swimming against the current of a flushed toilet. If a film presents a story with no redeeming qualities is that film worth watching? I think not. Fine cinematography in the Texas opening scene and the classic Nilsson performance of Everybodys Talking cannot salvage a film that is nothing more than an early appearance of big budget decadence. Skip the film and go sit in a gutter for ten minutes. Same effect 
 This book rates a one only because negative numbers aren't available.  To its credit, it has a wonderful promotional blurb and authors who exhibit a Herculean audacity in foisting literary rubbish on the unsuspecting public.  Beyond these "positives", the book represents a collection of government documents readily available to anyone with web access.  The only addition comes in the tortured syntax, misspelling, and incomprehensible rants that comprise the authors' original material before and after these documents.  To be honest, this is the first book I have ever regretted buying.  The incisive argumentation and helpful structure promised by the promo blurb do not exist apart from the internal structure of the government documents that comprise more than 90 percent of the book.  What the "producers" of this text add fails to make even their own points let alone elucidate any nuanced meanings in the documents they reproduce.    The first 24 pages of this book are a jumble of words and images that only seem to have order for the authors and perhaps their initiates. If you want to admire pictures of King Kamehameha I "the Black God of Hawaii" you're in for a treat.  This is the section for you.  There's also a nice Buddhist chant, some shout outs to friends, and an anti-war letter from a "Revered" (Reverend?) to the President.   The mental torture that awaits any foolish reader is clearly evident in what the "producers" call an abstract:   "I am bestowing upon the reader my premise (there will be a draft soon) in such a way that the reader will not ponder what I am trying to accomplish.  There has been provided a principal (sic), a basic truth or general law or doctrine (SSS) that is used as my basis for reasoning.  A position or (advantageous line) has been followed that has allowed me to arrange my point(s) in an orderly fashion.  A clear postulate (To assume or assert the truth, reality, or necessity of, especially as a basis of an argument) has been formed to give the reader a clear picture of what I am presenting.  Thus, the author shall have presented his perspective, (that art of drawing solid objects on a flat surface so as to give the reader an impression of the relative position, and size of the idea in such a way that the reader will have a clear-formed understanding of the Selective Service System after reading the manual (p. 24).  Where would we mere mortals be without such useful definitions? Note the haphazard address of the apparent thesis?  However, the introduction immediately follows on page 25 in order to help us further:  "This handbook is intended to assist you in understanding the SSS (Selective Service System) and the concept of a possible military draft.  I have researched and compiled this handbook because of the outrageous amount of misunderstanding and misinformation that I have heard possible draft dodgers, patriots, and cowards speaking of recently.  Furthermore, the alleged gangsters, blatant disrespectful (continuous use of the term n****r) 'punk bitches (guys) whom masquerade as members of gangster organizations.' These people cross all so called races, religions, and income levels and moved me to push the reinstatement of the draft.  I hear these large talking (Bi-Sexual Thug types) talking (sic) about how they will not fight in the advent of a draft.  These people do not say that they will not fight for religious or political beliefs.  These folk's cowards (and you know who I am talking about) say they will not fight because they are literally scared.  Do not be scared now.  You were not scared when you were talking about shooting unarmed citizens and all that you get from your programming.  Have not you geniuses who push the concept of being gangsters ever heard of the RICO Statutes? I can not believe the ignorance of you fools pushing the gangster images and even professing to be gangsters.  Have you not the understanding that the Federal Marshals and FBI watch you for years until you have been indicted and then you are arrested.  Think fool!  Ok, go and get your basic training when the day comes and go see the folks who the President wills you to see! You're quick to pull a gun on the streets (Nigger Hollering) New Klan Member!  Now take your ass to see whom the President has for you."  Note:  I double-checked my typing...the errors in punctuation, grammar, logic, and understanding are accurately reproduced.  With that clear outline of where the reader is headed, the book moves without further discussion into 162 pages of government documents to which few modifications have been made and to which virtually no explanation will be provided. This is followed by 17 pages excerpted from a term paper discussing language and conflict.  However, most of this section is bibliography.  These 179 pages offer virtually no explanation to explain their purpose or connection to one another.  Certainly, there is no obvious argument to support the view that the U.S. will soon reinstitute the draft.  In several of the reprints, it appears that the "producers" expect us to see hidden meanings thanks to their italicizing material.  However, the only message underscored is that the government needs people to accomplish its mission.  The section on language frequently employs "n*****s" and other derogatory terminology with little success in connecting the dots between language and conflict.    The big finale of the book follows with thanks to friends, and a reference from the "Cabalistic Encyclopedia" which presumably links the producers to God.  Their original material closes this section with a threat to "those whom for the last Eleven years have hounded me with false claims and wrong charges against me in the State of Washington you are now given a warning, (understand this is not a threat)! Should you not choose the righteous way of handling the dispute that I have made a gallant attempt to settle for some time now. I promise I will put each of you on blast" (p. 207).  As an added bonus for those who persevere in their reading, the book concludes with a "bonus" section with 15 more pages of lightly edited reprints from the Selective Service.  Suddenly, on page 225 appears a snippet of support for the idea of a new draft.  It is drawn from a neo-conservative website.  It's one page with no development, conclusion, or even apparent connection to the rest of the text.  Finally, the reader is treated to five pages of promotion for another book by the "producers." [... 
 inconsequential jargon  This pseudo-philosophical work is long, insubstantial and boring. The author tries to hide his sterility by avoiding the very basic and fundamental social and human problem, the problem of universal injustice. One wonders why on earth someone should attempt such a work! The title itself betrays the author's philosophical incompetence: "A Theory of Justice." Hasn't he read Plato? Doesn't he realize that justice is not a theory, but in fact practice? What on earth is a theory of justice, which cannot be put to practice? Right at the beginning of his book Rawls insists on a "veil of ignorance" in order to have fairness to start with.; that is plunging into a book, which has nothing give, which can do nothing to change the world we live in. We are not blind. We know too well that there can be no justice in a society whose members are not blind and deaf, and know too well that there are differences separating individuals. How can anyone insist on capitalism, annual growth and availability of goods for all when the world is limited and the earth with its limited natural resources cannot sustain unchecked human growth? And what is more, he can never define what good are, which must be available to everyone. Is raw materialism justice? Are we chickens in a coop, absolutely predictable? The author should have examined the history of philosophy a little more carefully, which is nothing other than a series of failures in putting the cart before the horse, that is theory before practice.  Haven't we learned the lesson from communism and its disastrous results? Marxism too was an elaborate theory, but in reality turned out to be a gross injustice to all. Is the unquestioned democracy the final truth? Before embarking on another long, empty and pretentious "theory" without foundation a thinker should make him/herself well acquainted with human nature. It is too bad that this jargon is often taught at colleges and universities, forcing nave students read this book, discuss it, and even worse, write term-papers on it. For those who wish to have a clear-cut understanding of social problems and a sound theory of justice I recommend Plato's Republic.  Academic jargon is not philosophy. 
 I'm not a hard core Dean Koontz fan but I have read a few of his novels and enjoyed most of them (at least enough to pick up another from time to time)   Until now.   I've always found Koontz to be heavy handed as an author and 'The Taking' is about as subtle as a hand grenade. We get it - people are selfish and have lost sight of what is important in life. They should pay more attention to their children and love their dogs.   The preachy tone to the novel reaches a crescendo with a corny 'Noah's Arc' ending. This the worst novel I've read in a long time - and may be the last Dean Koontz novel I'll ever read. 
 I'm usually a Clark's fan, and own several pairs, but for some reason these shoes are not as "true to fit" as Amazon claims. I could not get my size 9 feet into this 9 1/2 sized shoe. It's possible that I received a defective product, but you may want to consider this before making your size selection, or check other shoe sites for similar comments. Good Luck 
 I must confess that this has been one of the borest books I have ever read. Padded out with plenty of trivial ideas and lacking with something new. On the good side, its an overview over most of the topics in competitor analysis but really heavy going to go through 
 It's definitely true that this book has some very interesting and useful concepts embedded in it.  I've begun using some of "the stranger's" suggestions in my life since reading this book.  However... I must say that it is NOT a story, but a long dialogue on spiritual concepts, and not in the well-written, organized way that the Conversations with God series is presented.  This book never should have been presented in the form of a story (fiction), because the author does nothing more than move his characters from place to place while they talk nonstop.  Pages and pages of dialogue are bracketed by one or two sentences denoting that they are now moving to another location.  The dialogue itself is also quite repetative, such as things like:  "Would you like to discuss the concept of sin further?" "Yes. Let's discuss the concept of sin further."  The dialogue is not like any that people would really use, because nobody repeats back entire lines of dialogue like that in real life.  The character of Nathaniel (the main character) also overlooks every strange thing his travelling companion does, with only the barest mention to it.  He overlooks many instances of clairvoyance/mindreading on the part of the stranger...and honestly, people don't act like that.  I understand this is billed as a "Story and Spiritual Manual," but I expected an actual story in the book.  If you want to read it solely as a spiritual manual in the form of dialogue, then I imagine it may work for you--but even then, you should exercise caution.  There are so many better-written books on the truly loving nature of God, which is what this book mainly discusses.  I would recommend the Conversations with God series, or The Disappearance of the Universe in place of this book 
 The nib on this pen is far too broad.  Most fountain pen manufacturers would probably rate it "medium".  It does write a nice, smooth line, and it is conveniently disposable, but it also looks very disposable.  Its appearance is less elegant even than most rollerball pens.  If you are considering buying this pen because you like the elegance of fountain pens, or for its "fine" point, then this is not the pen for you.  These were both major considerations for me, and I was quite disappointed 
 This was a tough one for me. Hew knows his stuff, but this highly condensed presentation was something of a drudgery for me to wade through. Perhaps that's because that is the way the war actually was, he he. There was no time for much reflection, humor or innuendo. Hew had to get it all in one volume and he succeeded by taking the Jack Webb approach; The facts ma'am, just the facts.  I am not very familiar with the geography or the politics of central Europe and this is a huge handicap for readers of Hew's book. While he was going into much detail about troop movements or front locations I was usually kind of lost as I tried putting it all together in my mind. It is as if he assumes the reader is  intimate with the territory.  Well placed detailed maps would have been a great help; these however are lacking. Oh, there are maps all right but they seem to have been inserted as an after thought between the table of contents and the introduction. And they look like sketches hastily drawn up and submitted just in time to meet publishing deadline.  There is a fabulous collection of color photo images of the war. Did you know there was color photography that long ago? I never realized WW1 was so colorful! This was a world war and the color plates show army uniforms from countries outside Europe. They do compliment a decidedly dry text and give the war a very ethnic shine.  This is the first WW1 history I have read. I have read other topics about the war but never a complete overview of the entire war from beginning to end. I am going to try another one because the subject of WW1 has always fascinated me. I am especially interested in the wars aftermath and how it has shaped the world we see today 
 Politics Lost is a poorly thought out book.  It purports to be a stunning muckraking work, yet it is nothing more than a critigue of the aesthetics of power in Washington.  Critics such as Klein have long seen advertising as being a negative force in politics at least since the Eisenhower campaign hired an advertising agency in 1952.  Klein claims that since the Nixon campaign of 1968, politics have become nothing more than slickly packaged advertisements.    Klein's book is really nothing more than the same old, same old.  
 Having written one of the outstanding books in Christian studies, Misquoting Jesus, all of Bart Ehrman's future works will be compared to this exceptional piece. Unfortunately, the present book compares unfavorably. Very unfavorably.  The idea is brilliant. Let's learn about the early Christians by studying what they said about Peter, Paul, and Mary. Rather than hope to extract some historical kernals, Bart Ehrman seeks to learn how their tales, regardless of how wacky they are, tell us something about the needs of the era. Great idea. And in the first chapter, on Peter, he succeeds admirably. Then he appears to run out of steam, and Paul and Mary get short changed. For example, on page 223 he starts his final intro to the section on Mary by saying - "Were they [MM and the other women] really there to see these things happen, and if so, what role did they play in the events?" You can see he has completely forgotten his original premise of what the accounts tell us about the writers and listeners and is once more plowing the familiar field of "is it true or not?"  Worse still, there is a lack of precision throughout the book which makes it practically impossible to read through without stopping and thinking: "Now why does he say that?" Here's a partial list of the errors in this book:  "For Mark, Jesus was a suffering messiah..." (p. 17) Search as you will, you won't find the word "messiah" in the Gospel of Mark.   "...when Jesus declares that Simon will be called Petras...[and] will build his church." (p. 22)  Ehrman, more than anyone else, knows this is a later addition since Jesus had no intentions of building his own "church".   "After Jesus' death, his tiny band of followers..." (p. 23) Jesus' band consisted of thousands of people. It couldn't be described as "tiny"   "There's no archeological evidence to suggest any synagogue structure at all in Simon's day..." (p. 25)There is such evidence and scholars have debated whether or not this is a "public building" that was used as a synagogue or just a "public building". The issue is still debated, so it's misleading to offer Ehrman's blanket statement.   "...there really wasn't much choice for someone living in a poor village such as Capernaum. There weren't any condominiums for rent..." (p. 26). No, but there were many choices: houses, communal living, tents, caves, etc. The choice was not simply house or no house.    "...Jesus himself, a lower-class peasant from the hinterland" (p. 30). There is no reason whatsoever to assume Jesus is a "lower-class peasant" It is some people's theory, but there is little evidence that Jesus came from the lower classes. Indeed, his extensive religious training indicates otherwise, as does his familiarity with the issues confronting land owners and the wealthy. As does his presence at the wedding at Cana.  "By the time Jesus arrives at the house, the girl [Jairus' daughter in the Gospel of Mark] has already died..." (p. 31) What Gospel of Mark is Ehrman reading? Here's the actual quote - "And when he was entered in, he saith unto them, Why make ye a tumult, and weep? the child is not dead, but sleepeth." (Mark 5:39) Does that sound dead to you?   "...taking with him only Peter, James, and John, before whom he becomes greatly agnonized..." (p. 31) Again, Ehrman must be reading from the Secret Secret Gospel of Mark. If you read Mark (14:33-41), you'll find that the disciples are asleep when Jesus becomes "greatly agonized"   "Has there ever been a Christian figure as controversial as the apostle Paul?" (p. 89). Duh. How about Judas? How about Mary Magdalene? Surely they are as controversial as Paul, if not more so.  "...including those of Greek and Roman mythology, such as Zeus, Apollo, and Athena..." (p. 103) All 3 of these Gods are Greek, not Roman.   "We have only one surviving author...from among the Pharisees before...70 CE...it's the apostle Paul." (p. 105) Really? Did Ehrman ever hear of Josephus?   "...one woman is called Mary Magdalene (literally, Mary of Magdala)." (p. 188) No, not literally. Some authors believe that the name meant Mary "the Tower" (Starbird) or Mary "The Great" (Baigent). It's possible it did mean Mary of Magdala, but it's certainly not the literal meaning.   "...this sinful woman who anoints Jesus in Luke 7 is not Mary Magdalene, because Mary Magdalene is actually introduced by Luke in his very next story..." (p. 189). Ehrman knows as well as anyone that gospel pericopes were moved around, so there can be no valid argument that her "introduction" in one verse precludes her appearance in a prior verse. Take Mark 3:21, for example. Here the translation reads that the family is upset with Jesus and then the family shows up a few verses later. Yet if 3:21 is correct, they are already there and can't possibly show up later (Mark 3:31). Pericopes do not offer chronological order, and Ehrman should know better.  "Mary was a Galilean Jewish woman..." (p. 195). There is no evidence that Mary came from Galilee. She is mentioned as having traveled with Jesus along with other woman from Galilee (Mark 15:41), meaning only that she had been in Galilee (although, strictly speaking, one can interpret Mark as meaning that only Salome was from Galilee). There is absolutely nothing that implies Galilee is her home, only that she travelled from there.   "Jesus, of course, abandoned his livelihood as a carpenter/woodworker..." (p. 198).  Of course NOT. There are many definitions of tekton, only one of which is carpenter. He could have been a builder, a general contractor, a scholar, a stone mason, etc.   "...it's virtually impossible to explain the rather troubling circumstance that he chose 12 male disciples to be his closest followers." (p. 200) Ehrman mistakes what the gospels say with what Jesus did. The gospels say he had 12 disciples but no gospel ever lists all 12 names. Some gospels list as few as 7 names and the most names are 10. That leaves plenty of room for women to have been named as disciples and for their names to have been edited out of the gospels, a practice which Ehrman, as much as any other scholar, is aware of.   "Jesus established a solid...reputation for attracting... prostitutes..." (p. 201) Search as you will, all 4 gospels, you won't find the word "prostitute" in any of them. Sinners, yes. Prostitutes, no.   "In Mark's account of the passion..while being nailed to the cross..." (p. 219). Jesus is never nailed to the cross in any version, much less Mark. There is a reference to the hands in Luke (24:39) and in John (20:25) they mention nails, but not in Mark. Mark's version says nothing about being nailed to the cross.  "...all our accounts agree that Jesus was crucified..." (p. 222). Actually that's not true. There are several accounts that indicate that Jesus was hung from a tree (e.g., Acts 5:30, 10:39, and 13:29; Galatians 3:13; 1 Peter 2:24; Polycarp's letter to the Phillipians, etc). I'm not saying that's what happened, but it's simply not true that "all our accounts" say he was crucified.   I could go on, but you get the point. And I've only selected the obvious errors here.  Bottom line - this book was an excellent idea, but the execution was flawed and the enormous number of errors precludes me from recommending it. 
 I was waiting to get into ths book...then I realized I was halfway thru it.  I always stick with Berg...you never know when you'll get hooked.  But this one did not have it...I was relieved when it ended 
 I guess I missed the point. I can see how this film could be considered a horror "classic". I'm sure the violence was ground breaking in 1972... in fact, one of the comments in the "making of" on this dvd was that teenagers were actually throwing up in the theatres. I don't think it's a well done film overall... it's lacking in story, music, direction, and suspense. The acting is not too bad, but could have been more intense and believable in some scenes. If I was craving some good 1970's horror, I'd rather watch "I Spit on Your Grave" or "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" 
 This has to be one of the worst productions in the history of music.  There comes a time when a person should really take a long, hard look to see if it is time to hang it up. For Babs, that time has come.  The good thing is that I have the answer to her introspective undertaking - STOP SINGING NOW!!  
 I'm working in the quality group of a small company to introduce CMMI and to get assessed.  We were very happy when we saw the title "practical insight" and bought the book. But we were all very disspointed. Lots of chapters are directly copied, or slightly changed from the CMMI Model, with no more explanation. There is no benefit! We did not find any practical insight in this book.  As we are developing our processes we always have the CMMI book open and read the practices. If it happens that we want more information we sometimes check the book from tim, but in most cases the content is exactly the same.  It's really not worth the price 
 The `new' edition of Sociobiology could not be more of a disappointment. The original version (1975) remains a landmark work and it's importance both to biology and to social science can hardly be exaggerated. The theoretical framework and the masterful scholarship contained in the  original are nothing short of astonishing. Which makes the silver edition  all the more a travesty. For a literary work it would be permissible to  republish a work in its original form. This is not the case for a work of  science. The original work touches on practically every subject of  relevance to biology. And since it's publication advances have been made on  every single front. And yet the work has not been updated. The last chapter  on humans and their role in the world of sociobiology was at once the most  controversial and least well supported of the entire book. Since 1975 the  work on human sociobiology has been proceeding at a brisk pace, generating,  not only books, research articles and edited tomes but whole journals  dedicated to the topic. The inclusion of such research would greatly  enhance not only the work itself but also the standing of sociobiology as a  viable framework for understanding human behavior. Lamentably, all new  research has been wantonly excluded. It is simply scandalous to republish  the work, essentially unaltered from the original under the misguided  denotation of `new'. In science 25 years is an eternity. Republishing this  work is not like releasing a second edition of The Selfish Gene or The  Descent of Man unaltered. It is more like releasing an encyclopedia 25  years later without making any updates whatsoever.  What was once a  splendid work, now re-released turns out looking, cliched, trite and  unforgivably out-dated. As far as I can see, the only reason to publish a  work on science is to promote new knowledge and this edition can make no  such claim.  Interested readers would do just as well to save their money  and buy an old edition of Sociobiology for a quarter of the price 
 I could barely get through this book.  Everything was padded to novel length when the content deserved little more than short story treatment.  Even with the provided character glossary the political hierarchy and  relationship was still confusing.  There was little tension and drive.   Steven Saylor and Lindsey Davis have no competition here 
 This is a very famous and a very influential book. This was not the first time I checked the book out of the library but I now know much more about antidepressants and the related issues than I did when I first became familiar with Kramer's book. What I found on my quick survey of the book this time amazed me. This is not a book supported by research. It is a book of stories. The stories, one after the other, are about Kramer's patients (Kramer is a psychiatrist) and how taking Prozac dramatically transformed lives overnight. Consider these four examples. 1. Sam: "Sam not only recovered from his depression, he declared himself better than well. He felt unencumbered, more vitally alive, less pessimistic. Now he could complete projects in one draft, whereas before he sketched and sketched again. His memory was more reliable, his concentration keener. His memory was more reliable, his concentration keener. Every aspect of his work went more smoothly. He appeared more poised, more thoughtful, less distracted. He was able to speak at professional gatherings without notes.(Page x.) 2. Sally: After four months on Prozac, she looked brighter, calmer, self-assured, in control of herself. The most important effect of the medication, Sally felt was that it cleared her head...After ten months...she negotiated a small promotion and pay raise at a time when the bank was cutting back staff...More remarkable was the change to her private life. She started going to dances...(Page 147.) 3. William M: The patient's low self-esteem, which had been present since his earliest childhood, began to disappear...On medication William M. experienced a sense of self-worth superior to any he had felt before. (Page 203.) 4. Ms. B: For the first time in her memory she felt perfectly relaxed and happy sitting at home reading books or listening to music and felt less of the free-floating anxiety that was previously quelled by going out...Off Prozac, Ms. B. bar-hopped in search of men. Prozac moderated her sense of aloneness and allowed her to enjoy a variety of social settings. Dozens of other examples could be cited. The point is, this is essentially the book. It is a book which convinces the reader of the almost magic power of Prozac by sharing stories like these. What is disturbing is that I now know the truth. Research investigations have found that the power of antidepressants has increased dramatically. They are now more effective because our belief in the power of a pill to cure social shyness, anxiety, depression, and a bad temper has increased dramatically. We have come to believe, as Kramer puts it, "biology is destiny" (page xiv). No where does Kramer explain that the longest of the clinical trial used to get approval of Prozac to market was only 8 weeks long. No where does he share that a tranquilizer was given to study subjects and the other tricks used to make the effectiveness of the drug appear greater than it really is. The dangers of long-term use (diabetes, Parkinson's disease, permanent muscle jerking, etc.) are never discussed. (Of course, these problems were still unknown when Kramer wrote.) See Timothy Scott's wonderful, and unlike Kramer's book, carefully documented book America Fooled: The Truth About Antidepressants, Antipsychotics, and How We've Been Fooled to find the dangers as well as what does bring good mental health. Yes, this book has been influential. Thus, Kramer bears some of the responsibilty for the myth surrounding antidepressants. (They do not work as well as exercise even--numerous studies.) It's funny how, as our knowledge grows, a great book beomes a harmful book, but it is just that.    
 Red Dirt Road was a huge disappointment to me.  I'm a relatively new Brooks & Dunn fan, and I thought Steers & Stripes and If You See Her were fantastic, both loaded with great songs.  This CD, however, had a couple of OK songs, a handful of mediocre ones, and several - Good Cowboy, for example - that I couldn't even stand to listen to all the way through, although I tried several times. Luckily I got it from the library before I bought it, and I didn't even keep it the full 2 weeks.  I can't understand the good reviews that this CD has received.  If you're new to Brooks & Dunn, don't start with this album 
 On the positive side this book was sometimes amusing. The story idea of two thirteen-year-old's experimentation with sex and resulting in a pregnant seventh grader was promising though poorly executed. None of the main characters are believable, not the narrator, Sam, not his girlfriend Maurey, and not his mother Lydia. The motivations and thought patterns of the adolescents especially lacked any power to convey belief. This novel should probably have stayed in the form of Mr. Sandlin's puerile fantasies, from which it sprung 
 McMurry's text is a very friendly, gentle intro to  organic. It's a thoroughly enjoyable read, but it doesn't teach you what you need to  know.  Explanations for important mechanisms are usually very brief, and the  problems included are usually very basic and general (the spectroscopy and  synthesis problems, in particular).  If you're looking to become a chemist,  this is not the book to learn from. I'd recommend  Vollhardt and Schore's  textbook, or any number of sophomore-level texts that will give you the  skills you need to approach complicated problems more successfully (i.e.,  on exams or out in the industry) 
 This book offers a comprehensive information package that guides the reader through  pertinent facts that make it clear yet simple to  understand the principles of metal forming and working.The book is packed  with formulas that simplify complicated tooling problems that occur when  melal is formed. This book was written by a  group of acomplished highly  respected Tool & Die Journeymen who pooled their years of experiance of  the trade togeather into one compact, resource, handbook 
 I was looking for more information.  Thought it was over priced for what I got 
 Inticing beginning, but quickly drops off into the most DULL details of useless information.  Even the ending was dull and in my opinion, and unfinished 
 Product OK condition, but took a while for delivery.  Just arrived today, March 13. 
 Still waiting....? Another failed post-cold war attempt at 'Mr X' (or Mr and Mrs X??) status...  
 The author who is Jewish spent far too much time on Koufax being Jewish.  As a biography it was poor.  Jews may appreciate the book, but gentiles probably won't.  The book didn't take you through enough of Sandy's life or his career as it seems to emphasize 1965.  I usually like to read biographies rather than auto biographies, but I've read many auto bios which are better.  The author may have been hampered by the fact that Sandy is so quiet and reserved that he makes a poor subject for a biography.  There's a caption under a picture about Sandy being twice divorced, but only a few sentences about his first marriage.  Don't waste your money on this book 
 There are no new concepts put forth in this book, and worse, it's filled with painful stabs at humor, practically worthless information (most of which seemingly to get the reader from one picture to the next).  I just don't think many people realize that Meadows has rewritten existing ideas as little "revelations" he has had himself, and so, I advise any prospective shoppers to move on, look toward online journals or monthly magazines in this field (like Speculative Reviews of Narrative, etc).  There's nothing to see here 
 Wow. The book was so illustrated and so colourful, I got distracted. And, boy, do they like to write...I guess it also combats illiteracy!   I foresee a crucial change in forthcoming editions: the style of the guy's pants in the elevator will go out of fashion and they will have to issue a new edition (it will cost more, however, because printing technology will allow you to see the guy in 3D).   I personally find the "features" in these American-style textbooks to be nothing but distractions. Besides, the level of physics students went down, not up, as physicists will tell you. So how are the pedagogical "features" helping? Accordingly, in truth, the level of the books went down. The reality is that they're targeting a certain niche market here, keep that in mind. Granted, this book has been around. But, for real, it's overpriced and if that is what they made you buy, well, I'm sorry. On the bright side, you could be using Halliday's, in which case you'd be even worse off. Seriously though, this book is representative of a slew of books that are full of fluff and overpriced.   If you feel adventurous, get yourself something with less colour and more math, straight out of the 70s, like Alonso and Finn, or McKelvey and Grotch. I garantee you will get to calculate the apparent weight of fishes in elevators. Besides, come to think of it, hey, all the good math and physics books from Springer and Kluwer are in black-and-white 
 I purchased both this book and the Alkalesi book and found the Alkalesi book to be much more straightforward and accessible.  This book is good for doing lots of drills, but it is not an easy way to learn the basics of Iraqi Arabic 
 I love jazz, and I love almost all Coltrane, but I'll be honest. I find these shows a bit difficult to listen to.  There's just too much wheezing and squeeling here for my ear.  I find myself whincing at times. Other times it's not seeming to go anywhere. There's something pathological about Coltrane's playing.  He sounds a bit like a dying cat.  He must have been heavy into the Heroin by this point. 
 i thought that this book is definately written in the age of ignorance. the idea of a race of people that is so isolated at the time hits home for me. my family is one of the "MAYLE" clan, so to speak, and this book was appauling. granted it gave some of the factual events and information but at the same time the author did not give accounts of the people themselves. it was treated as if this was an experiment. he should have gotten ALL of the facts before he wrote. some of the people that the author wrote about are actually native american (cheroke and pittsburg blackfoot). they were neither white or black and never really claimed to be either. as being a mayle myself, this book is a real dishonor to our family and all of our ancestors that delt with the same ignorance. 
 The language in this movie was very inappropriate for family viewing and I would not recommend it to anyone.  I did not watch the entire movie because it never seemed to get any better 
 I'm not Christian. I'm Agnostic and I picked up the book because I thought it looked interesting and I wanted to learn something about Christianity.  This is perhaps one of the worst books I've ever read. Let me be clear that I am saying nothing against religion in this review. I cant judge that, but I can review this terrible writing. LaHaye and Jenkins seem to have no concept of motivation, logic, or storytelling. It's as if when writing the book they had ideas of where the characters should end up, but then used the first idea that popped into their heads about how that should happen with no critical thought at all.   As stated before, the names of the characters should have given me pause, the most egregous being Chang Wong, a name so stereotyped that I cant believe the authors have ever met an Asian. At this book in the series the world has devolved into a right wing nutjob survivalist fantasy, where the TribForce(...) is living literally underground, in rebellion against the New World Order(who call themselves, wait for it: the New World Order).   The final battle of the Apocalypse is fought on ATV's and horses.  Jesus. 
 Disappointing:- very bad quality reproductions of Wllies drawings and photographs,they are blured and lose much of the detail. Many amateur drawings clearly not by Willie.Only good pics. are on the cover 
 I didn't find this reference any good UNTIL I knew vi well. It is OK for a quick look up to remember a command; but to learn something new or more than you already know forget it. I have a coffee mug with vi commands on it that is far more helpful. Because of this experience, I am reluctant to buy others in this series (e.g. Python Pocket Reference) 
 Although the food quality is decent - and the packages should last for a while, it's a bit deceptive to say that a TOTAL of about 2500 calories is adequate for a person for three days.  Unless you're on a really tight diet.  For a short term like 72 hours simply keep some canned food around (or some MRE's) and you'd do much better.  If you insist on camping (dehydrated) food - simply buy a few of the real meals from this company.  At least you'll be eating enough to keep the stomach rumbles down 
 I have been reading Cornwell for about a decade now and in the 1990's I thought of her as one of the very best of the best writers out there. Her first 5 or 6 novels were tremendous but since then she has slowly tapered off into mediocrity and this book - Trace - represents an all-time low.  The thing that got me was the level of the writing, it just seemed so flat and lifeless. I found it repetitive in the first chapter when Scarpetta is saying to herself that "she should have been told....". It just seemed so ordinary, almost as if someone else was writing this book and not a talented novelist like Cornwell. 
 To begin with, I was extremely disappointed after reading this book. I didn't expect something akin to Said's profound work, Orientalism; but this book turned out to be a total joke. It has a little bit of everything (Bahbah's post-colonialism, Marxism, Religious Fundamentalism, Lacan's psycho-analysis, etc.), but does not offer any insightful ideas why non-westerners have built hatred toward Western culture.   Somehow, it gives interesting discussion that the origin of Occidentalism is actually stemmed from Germany and Russia; but that's it. Extremely obsolete arguments regarding religion, god, sex, and "City of Greed;" with the absence of profound discussion about this aged, entangled gap between Western and non-Western world --to be honest, I would say this is total waste of time.  Occidentalism is not about "isms." It has to be carefully examined within the past and current historical context regarding what American and European governments did to the rest of the world in terms colonization and foreign policy.     
 i love terry pratchett's work; i've read plenty of great discworld books, and even a few that i thought were just mediocre (by pratchett standards) but this book is crap. just a sorry pitiful excuse for bringing back rincewind from the nether regions. if you've never read terry pratchett, do NOT start with this. and if you're just dying to know how Rincewind got back into the discworld... well, save yourself the 5 bucks and dream up your own story, its bound to be better than this. i don't feel that pratchett put his best efforts into this, rather, i get the impression someone begged him to bring back rincewind, maybe shoved some money in his face until finally, the author said, "yeah, fine, i'll write it tonight while i'm on the toilet" i just wished he'd flushed 
 I bought this DVD on the basis that Shania Twain performed the half time show. Even when i did a search for Shania Twain this DVD was listed - INCORRECTLY - as there is NO Shania performance on the DVD. As far as the football goes i really can not comment as i am from the UK and know nothing about American Footbal - sorry!! 
 This book comes across as severely dated and lame.  All the people who love this book are either nerds who think they're in on Pynchon's "joke" or they are nerds who havent read a good book like Catch-22. 
 Hofstede's work was and is not really helpful; perhaps fascinating for those who deal with the issues from the comfortable space of their warm home of office in a western country. For all who want to get a fundamental insight to understanding espec. Asian behavior and cultural differences, I highly recommend to start with: "The Geography of Thought : How Asians and Westerners Think Differently...and Why -- by Richard Nisbett". That's the stuff that will bring you where Hofstede could never dream to be 
 A daring young atomic scientist teams up with three high school seniors to attempt the first-ever rocket trip to the moon -- that's the premise of Heinlein's Rocket Ship Galileo.  Readers who aren't immediately turned off by the story's wild improbabilities and dated subject matter may find this book an entertaining adventure.  To begin with, Heinlein's story is well paced and solidly constructed for once, a pleasant change from the episodic hodgepodges he created in his later years.  He skillfully introduces elements of conflict at an early stage of the story, (as sinister forces seem to be trying to prevent the voyage from taking place) and he even manages to build some suspense, an effect Heinlein is not usually noted for.  His descriptions of the mechanics of the moon rocket and its voyage are both convincing and interesting, despite being badly dated.  One real letdown is the characters, who are curiously undeveloped, even for science fiction.  The three boys themselves are virtually interchangeable, and Doctor Cargraves isn't much more distinctive.  If some attempt had been made to give these young men their own individual personalities, the readers might find them easier to identify with.  As it is, it's hard to really care about these characters, even when something horrible happens to them.  The really big problem, though, is that this book really hasn't aged very well. For example, Heinlein tries to show us how a moon rocket was outfitted and launched privately, by one scientist and his youthful helpers, working on a shoestring budget, after a few months of labor; when after all, any schoolchild knows that it took NASA and the U.S. government billions of dollars, working with hundreds of the finest minds on the planet for nearly a decade, to accomplish the real thing.  Once our heroes reach the moon, the story gets even more improbable, as they find that the moon is already inhabited.  Naturally, Heinlein wrote this novel for younger readers, and it was published at a time when space travel seemed utterly impossible.  As such, it was written for the tastes of the times, and times have changed dramatically.  For instance, the only women in this book are the boys' mothers, who have very little to say about anything important.  The villains are cartoonish stereotypes, who are summarily dispatched without any show of remorse.  Although the book is reasonably well-written overall, and older readers may take some nostalgic pleasure in its simplicity and naivet, today's young readers may want something more wildly speculative than a moon landing.  On average, if you're old enough to remember Sputnik, you can be forgiven for loving this book; but if Neil Armstrong is just another boring guy you heard about in school, you probably won't be too impressed by Rocket Ship Galileo 
 Unlike most reviewers here, I really disliked this book.  The main reason is that the entire novel is a gimmick without any real substance.  There is no reason to tell such a dull story except for the fact that there is some mysterious story-within-a-story complexity.  The characters, especially the protagonist Iris, are bores.  Iris is like a 300 page wet blanket.  Most of the other characters are 1-dimensional cut outs.  Her sister Laura is the exception, but she got on my nerves too with her one-note quirkiness.  The story-within-a-story is more a gimmick than anything else.  The science-fiction meta-story within that story I thought was the most interesting part of the book, but it goes nowhere and its purpose is even more tenuous than its parent.  Finally, this is my second Atwood book, and I really dislike her writing style.  It reads as if she is trying too hard, and even the simplest situations feel forced.  I don't understand why everyone seems to like this book, but I would just suggest not to believe all the hype. 
 "A Facsimile of the original edition" ? My mother has an original copy (7th edition) which was handed down to her & it is now held together with tape & love. Borrowing that book from my mom made me a bit nervous so I wanted to get one for myself. I did a lot of reading of reviews & finally decided on this one. Yes it does have all recipes that the original had but without ANY cooking temperature (electric, gas or internal temps). Even the time tables on page 32 & 33 with cooking times didn't have the temperatures that they needed to be cooked at. My mother's does except the charts are in a different area of her book. I am sorry but I am not going to sit down with a brand new cook book & take my mother's book & write down what temperature every single recipe needs to be cooked at. There was one recipe that state "cook for 20 mins. at a very high temp" & my mothers book said " cook for 20 mins. at 450 F". It almost looks like the temperatures were purposely left out because everything else appeared to be the same. Copyrights problems?  I am returning this book because it didn't meet my expectations & felt it was misrepresented 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 This book was full of stories of women who struggled with common friendship troubles and hints about how to help yourself if you are in a position in which you don't have enough friends due to a life change.  However, if you are reading it because you don't have very many friends and hope to learn ways to change that, a few hints aren't really going to be too terribly helpful.   If you recently became a stay at home mom and hadn't thought of trying to meet your neighbors, this book will be useful to you.  If you don't have friends because you are shy, don't know how to be friends with women, or one of the other multitudes of reasons why you might not have enough friends, this book won't help much, but you will be armed with new reasons why it is bad to not have friends.  
 I ordered this stylus to replace the one I lost that came with my new Cingular 8125 phone. I was so happy to see the package to arrive since using my finger or a pen is not an optimal way to work with this device.   Sadly these replacement parts do not match the factory specifications. These styluses do not fit into their slot properly leaving the head sticking out further than the manufacturer designed. This makes it easy for the stylus to fall out and does not create a smooth and clean design / look for the phone with the replacement installed.  If you are particular about these things you will not be satisfied with this purchase. The Stylus that I received does not match the picture that was advertised.  I am disappointed with this purchase and am looking for a better replacement stylus.   If you are particular about these things you will not be satisfied with this purchase. The Stylus that I received does not match the picture that was advertised.  I am disapointed with this purchase and am looking for a better replacement stylus 
 Of Rick Moody's books, I've read "The Ice Storm" and "Garden State."  I liked both of them, although I prefer the film version of "The Ice Storm" to the novel.  So I picked up a paperback copy of "Demonology," thinking that it would be equally engaging.  I was wrong.  I couldn't make it past the first few stories, they were all very thin and flat, and as I was reading, I couldn't help but think, "Who cares?"  The first story, "The Mansion on the Hill," was unbelievably slow and tedious to get through, the same was true as I gave him another chance and started reading the subsequent stories, hoping in vain that things would get better.  A real disappointment.  I would drift off as I was reading, and could have skipped pages and still known what was going on in the plot.  A very empty, unsatisfying read.  Like expecting a steak dinner and only getting a rice cake 
 Why does Hollywood concentrate on people who use their freedom and advantages (more than any country has enjoyed in history)to feel sorry for themselves and destructive behavior The second tale Non Fiction..is about a family who is physically healthy, have financial freedom and every advantage 90% of the people in the world would cherish..and have no desire to make contributions to a society that has given them so much..Thankfully most Americans are not like these losers, otherwise our republic would not have survived wars, depressions, and constant changes for 230 years. This is supposed to be an accurate picture of Suburbia..I taught in suburbian America for 35 years..I met parents who cared and did all they could to understand and encourage their children and I had countless students who loved their parents, appreciated their schools and wanted to make the world better.. THESE are the families whose stories deserve to be told..but they run counter to Hollywood's cynical, atheistic view of humanity... If you don't mind spending your time with self pitying, unappreciating, unambitous, dull people, this film is your cup of tea....(with every bitter herbs.. 
 I have to agree with the many who did not like this book. I got it from the library and tried to read it, but couldn't get past the self-indulgent writing style. It almost seems like someone was too lazy to edit this book or make it readable for the reader. Any writer can put down stream-of-consciousness thoughts, but it takes hard work and effort to edit and revise with the reader in mind. A writer should want the reader to enjoy the process of reading a book. A book is written to express oneself, but also for the reader. Without the reader, the book is nothing.  
 Benford is one of those writers who wax hot and cold.  He is acclaimed to be a science fiction writer's "scientist" in that he deals with a lot of "hard" science.  In this case, the result is pedantic and - the ultimate sin - boring.  The main character was not exciting nor interesting - just smart.  The great experiment and the result were so-so.  I kept waiting for something - ANYTHING - to happen but soon realized that this was it..a globe that was tested, studied and explored. I am reminded of the poem..."this is how the world ends - not with a bang but with a whimper.&quot 
 Florida's Hand To Hand may be exactly what fans of melodic hardcore with emo-style vocals have been waiting for. Yes, A Perfect Way to Say Goodbye is highly melodic; it's filled with hook-laden guitar riffs, always placed neatly under the semi-screamed and semi-clean emo vocals of Brock Berryhill and Robert Kellom respectively. Berryhill also plays guitars and pretty much every song is opened with his and second guitarist Jay Vilardi's melodic guitar lines, as Berryhill also displays his angst-ridden side spewing out screechy vocal lines before the clean singer takes over and lays down his poppier, more accessible harmonies. While this may sound new and groundbreaking to the emocore audience, I still can't help but think it's just a less intricate and obviously less metallic approach taken from the Swedish Gothenburg scene.  The main difference between this type of music and Swedish melodic death metal is that, on albums like this, the guitars are no longer the lead instrument in the music. Rather, they are often watery and utilised to fills the gaps between the vocals and incessant double bass drum work. The are no lead riffs, let alone solos apparently. Everything is supposed to serve the vocals and make them more accessible. Judging by that, Hand To Hand does a great job, as all their songs are marked by fierce screams and contrasting melodic voices, and a suitable rhythmic awareness. Drummer Zach Swain actually stands out in some of the pieces, like the rhythmically challenging "Reused Decision", where he lays down the groove with great timing and variation. Even the guitar work is more ambitious on this track, alternating between electric leads and acoustic breaks. Most of the track is sung in clean vocals, except the chorus which is meant to sound evil. Not the best song you'll hear in this genre, but it works a lot better than the bass-ridden opening track, where the track is formulated by shifting vocal passages and a repetitive chord progression on the guitars. "The Arson" is another melodic number, featuring a healthy dose of acoustic guitars, a small bass solo, shimmering cymbal work, and riffs with a great catchiness to them.  With all that said, Hand To Hand is basically just another hardcore band that will leave little to no mark on metalheads, but might find lots of appeal from the American emocore crowd. To be honest, I feel most of the American bands on Lifeforce Records pale in comparison to their European peers, with the exception of the amazing Withered. Then again, I'm still questioning why Withered are on Lifeforce, considering they play a great style of old-school death metal that bears no similarities to the other bands on their roster 
 i hated this book with a paaion. i had to read it in english class last year ansd it was the worst book i have every read in my entire life. dont read it!! 
 This is basically a 1/8" male to RCA cable for $73; you could get the same exact cable for $5.99 at Radio Shack.  Yeah you get a dock and power brick too but price it out; not worth it.  Buy the cable at RS; it'll work EXACTLY the same.. don't be fooled.  If you want the dock and power brick buy them seperately; you'll save major $$$.. 
 I guess I was hoping for more about the company and people. This book has lots of pictures and ads with some discriptions of the guns. It's not what I thought I was getting, the title should be changed to a "Pictorial of The First 100 yeras of Daisy Guns" 
 I LOVE Suzanne Brockmann's writing. If she were any other author, I'd give it 1 star. This one just didn't do it for me. I didn't like the heroine Jane (who seemed irritating & immature) and I didn't care about Cosmo (i guess the character development was lacking). I couldn't identify with the gay FBI agent and the intern chasing the in-the-closet actor storyline was a flat out bore. I read romance for escape - one of the last things I want to do is escape into a homosexual love story. I never finished her last book (an extremely disappointing read - the one abt the CIA agents). I don't know if i'm going to finish this one. I certainly hope Max & Gina's story doesn't follow this pattern of poorly developed characters. 
 Bill Maher personifies the reason why I, a life-long democrat and a teacher, am moving away from the current "Democratic" party and leaning more toward independent.  I am sure he has wonderful ideas but couching them in a constant barrage of foul language and hate-filled rantings makes me realize that the party has left me, I haven't left the party.  JFK would, today, be considered a right-wing wacko using the Maher standards.  I was so excited to get this book, hoping to hear (I had the CD) wit and humor with far thinking ideas.  Instead it was the same nonsense spouted by the likes of Michael Moore and Cynthia McKinney. Sad really. I disagree with most of what Ann Coulter says, but at least she's intelligently funny.  
 I listen to my music on my computer through iTunes.  I bought this CD assuming I would be able to import it to iTunes like the others I have purchased in the past.  That is impossible with this "ENHANCED" CD.  In fact it includes a warning that you must uninstall it immediately to protect the security of your computer.  The music may be good, I wouldn't know.  The only thing I have been able to listen to is the samples on Amazon.  I guess I will be buying my music through iTunes in the future.  Amazon should be more persistent in posting warnings about SONY CD's 
 The Covenant of the Wild is an example of anti-animal rights propaganda masquerading as science. For readers with an interest in this genre, it is worth reading.   Readers with a limited knowledge of natural history or who are unused to careful critical thinking will likely come away with a gross misunderstanding of the history of domestication and a biased view of the animal rights and the environmental movements. It is unclear whether Budiansky sets out to deceive his audience or is just poorly informed.   There is good evidence in the psychology literature that one's early childhood experiences can have a lasting effect on one's outlook. Budiansky explains that he was raised without exposure to animals. This might explain his bias and his projection that no one knows the source of meat or how animals behave other than farmers or hunters. He now feels, after moving to a farm and raising sheep, that he is an expert on animal behavior and animals' desires. Udder nonsense.  In the preface to the 1999 paperback edition, Budiansky writes:  "...we are the only species capable of conceiving of the pain and suffering of another; ... we are the only species capable of understanding the consequences of our actions or our inaction."  Writers in this genre uniformly struggle to name the characteristics that somehow set us apart from other animals and give us a right to hurt them. Budiansky's claim is illustrative of the scientific illiteracy, or selective consideration of evidence that afflicts writers in this area. The premier example of members of other species being aware of, being concerned with, and acting to protect others may the 1964 paper published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, "`Altruistic' Behavior in Rhesus Monkeys." Budiansky must be unaware of the research in this area.  Budiansky sprinkles similar ignorant claims throughout his text. He revisits the claim that monkeys were necessary to the development of the polio vaccine but doesn't mention the fact that in 1984, Albert Sabin, who developed the oral polio vaccine, swore under oath to the U.S. House of Representatives' Subcommittee on Hospitals and Health Care of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs that "the work on [polio] prevention was long delayed by an erroneous conception of the nature of the human disease based on misleading experimental models of the disease in monkeys."  Overall, even if one discounts his factual errors as simple ignorance, his argument that domestic animals were, in some twisted sense, willing participants in our early domestication of them is poorly argued and fraught with internal inconsistency and contradiction. I'm amazed that such gibberish came from the pen of a past editor at the journal Nature, but maybe this helps explain the journal's unwillingness to examine the ethical implications of our discoveries about other animals' minds and emotions.  For anyone other than a student of the anti-animal propaganda, or someone seeking to salve his or her own dislike of progressive views, this book will largely be a waste of time.  
 On the advertisement, these sandals were shown in green.  If they were available in green, I would be interested.  Please advise.  Thank 
 While I much rather prefer to read about the U.S. Civil War and The Second World War, it seems that I have read this book in bits and pieces elsewhere. None of the information presented by Mr. Fromkin came through as especially enlightening to me and the majority of his main thesis - A localized dispute between the Hapsburg Empire with Serbia being used as a pretext for the German Military to incite a continent wide war - was not all that shocking. That coupled with the redundancy with which the author presented his argument would have me advise you to check elsewhere for another book on this topic 
 I don't want to hear any more of their music on the radio. It is all just nonsense, and none of it should have ever been made. They are one of the worst hip hop acts in recent memory 
 The title 'A Practical Guide to Enterprise Architecture' led me to expect a book that dealt with the processes, challenges and techniques for creating an ENTERPRISE architecture. It does not. The book is about various technology frameworks. The Contents lists Systems Architectures, Solution Architectures and Service Oriented Architectures but not Enterprise Architecture. Enterprise Architecture is skimmed over in the Preface. The book barely touches on Zachman and Spewak and Hill. It ignores FEAF, TEAF, TOGAF, PERA, C4ISR, the Clinger-Cohen Act and other ENTERPRISE stuff completely. Enough said. Whatever this book is, is it is NOT a practical guide to ENTERPRISE Architecture. The book may be of use to technical architects designing solution-frameworks to support an Enterprise Architecture 
 While containing a number of intersting plans for small homes, this book falls short on several accounds.  First, there is almost no text save what is on the inside of the jacket.  That's right: no introduction, no methodology.  There is no explanation of which competitions the plans were taken from or what awards they won. (Amusingly, I went to show my neighbor one of the plans that I liked.  He said he liked it too but that it was an old plan from a competition in the early 90's. And would you believe that he happened to have a copy of the competition from which the plan was taken!)     Secondly, as to the plans themselves, dimensions are rarely marked and often unclearly.  In the case of two or three of the plans this makes them nearly unintelligable.   The lack of wall sections or descriptions of materials used for the majority of the plans makes it impossible to understand the particulars of what makes the houses energy effecient.   In short, the book far from lives up to its description and isn't worth spending the money for a handful of plans since a person can look at plans all day long for free online.   
 If my eleventh grade son had written this book, I would have given it a D-.  When Rashid Khalidi write it, it gets a triple F.  The logic is not there, the facts are wrong.  Can't Palestinians do more than hate Israelis? 
 Chargers work great and are a great bargain.  However, the generic "LG" driver software that comes with the USB cable to transfer music from computer to phone doesn't have an authenticity signature.  I don't know about other computers, but mine with Windows XP (SP2) won't accept it 
 this is quite possibly one of the worst books i've ever read - i couldn't even finish it.  hardly funny, it's a conglomeration of stupid cliches that began in Bridget Jones' Diary and will, at least with me, end here - I can't read any more books by women talking about "girlfriends, men, and why i'm not married yet".  what a complete and utter disappointment.  so glad i didn't buy this book myself 
 I became aware of how important grids are when I was at art college and came across the first issue of a new design magazine, 'New Graphic Design' in 1958.  Published in Switzerland in English, German and French and containing dozens of pictures,  without a strict grid all the issues of this stunning publication would look a mess.  The grid, put simply is a framework which allows several elements (photos, graphics, text, display type etc) to be placed in a rectangle and all work towards one aim, clarity of presentation.  Virtually all publications use a grid (in its simplest form it could be called the type area) check out the page number position in a magazine, always in the same place defined by the grid.  Having used grids for years I'm surprised that there is so much confusion but that was before I read through Kimberley Elam's book.  The straightforward becomes the obscure despite the good intentions.  The most useful parts are the pages that use a see-through overlay, revealing the essence of the grid and nicely some disasters, too.  What could be simpler than the two examples shown on page thirty-eight and nine, Christof Gassner's 1960 redesign of one page of a theater program, from the dull and confusing to something so elegant and simple. What is really interesting about the page is that it is all done with type only.  Page forty-five uses another overlay for the contents spread of a book (designed by Drenttel Doyle Partners in 1988) the see-through reveals a simple grid but the actual spread is a complete mess with type everywhere, even the three words 'Table of contents' is letterspaced in two typefaces, roman and sans.  The two examples of the grid I've mentioned perhaps sum up the problems that a reader of this book might have, most of the European grid examples shown use the grid to simplify the placing of all the elements on a page, especially the typography. The American examples show basic grid versions that are virtually ignored when it comes to placing the page elements.  This becomes evident in the last pages of the book where thirty-four design thumbnails are shown, one would not know they conform to any grid at all as each example shows a mixture of display type, text setting and graphics in no coherent order, in fact the very opposite of what a grid is supposed to do with these same elements. Perhaps the key element in any publication grid is the size of the text and headline types, because these (especially the text size) remain the same on every page and other elements, photos and graphics, need to be positioned within the grid defined by the typography.  I think 'Grid Systems' is pretty hopeless in explaining the virtues of this essential design format and strangely there is a real dearth of titles about the subject, perhaps it's just a bit too narrow or technical for most graphic art publishers.  The great Swiss designer Josef Muller-Brockmann  had a go at explaining it in his excellent 'Grid Systems in Graphic Design' (ISBN 3721201450) though it's not mentioned in the bibliography of 'Grid Systems' but two of his other books are.  
 While it looks like a great toy, this never installed on my XP home system.  After 3 hours with Logictech support (that is phone time, not the many hours of waiting time!) and many attempts at setting privledges in the Registry, it still never installed.  Logitech blames Microsoft, and it may well be true, but they should have a manual way of starting services instead of relying on automation.  I am very disappointed that I never got a chance to even try the pen.  If you do take the chance on it, be prepared to ship it back because it may never even install on your system.  
 After having read Baldacci's "Camel Club" this one came as an utter disapointment.... the book starts off describing the assasination of a US senator and how the lead secret service agent in charge of his protection ended up out of the service and discredited for having lost his charge.... sounds like an interseting way to start the book; the main problem is Baldacci never takes the time to introduce any of the characters.... after a while i couldnt keep reading the book because i felt i didnt care for the characters enough... i didnt really care to know what happened next to them since i didnt really "know" any of them... it was like reading a newspaper article.... a way too long newspaper article.. 
 I LOVE her cake mix dr books but hate this one. Every recipe I have tried has been awful. I don't cook with many prepared/boxed foods so maybe it is not a fair judgement. I love the idea of the book for when things are crazy and you want to make something fast and easy but the flavor of the dishes are really bad 
 I bought this book because of my interest in minimalism and Asian decor. I was looking forward to this book, and delayed my order for this to be released. Ultimately, I was disappointed by what I saw.  I was hoping, based on the title of the book, that this would be a folio of very small spaces, <1000 sq ft., such as the space I live in now. Turns out I was wrong. I personally would hate living in the spaces portrayed in this book. They're sterile, they're ugly, they're unnaturally clean, and worst of all, they're large! Some of these homes have three levels. Also, nothing about page after page of white walls, white sofas, and bare floors communicates "home" to me.   I suppose I have a very different idea of what a very small home is supposed to be.  My idea of a very small space would be that of a cabin, condo, or cottage.  Maybe it's a cultural thing. All the houses are Japanese, to say, actually in Japan, and I guess everybody there lives in white cubes. But, I'm American, and I love color! So while I was hoping to get ideas to how I might redecorate my own very small living space, I was disappointed. I suppose this is what comes from buying a brand new book that I haven't been able to go to a bookstore and thumb through yet 
 "To trick the eye"  if that is your intention be objective ... this people do not" fool the eye"... they fool themselves, and you 
 The range of story and poetry selections is so limited, the materials bore students to death. The issues the texts are obsessed with--morbid existential guilt, death of a spouse or a parent ala Joyce, O'Connor, Cather, etc.,--no longer have the spell-binding effect they once had on the adult sensibility. We now live in an age where more dramatic problems occur. There has got to be some good literature that covers issues of our day, such as mass murder, rape, school-shootings, hysteria, incest, money problems, weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, religious intolerance, etc. This textbook is totally out of touch with the current realities of our lives in the 21st century. 
 I dragged myself through every novel in this series with soap-opera like compulsion, always looking forward to the climatic appearance of our Lord.  Therefore, I anticipated this final novel to be glorious, as the title indicates, but I was woefully wrong.  Are my expectations too lofty for the day of our coming King and His Kingdom?  Certainly not!    I support Christian fiction with many 5 star reviews,--just look at my other reviews--but I can not recommend this series 
 Am I the only person on the planet that thinks Rent is garbage? Saw it at the National Theater and had a hard time sitting through it. The music is pop bubble gum nonsense. I think it never would have become a hit had Larson not died the week of it's opening. 
 I like a few other readers was excited to start this book after reading so many great reviews... what were they all thinking?? This book was so boring and the back and forth between then and now was painstakingly slow. The main character was so unlikable, as a child and as an adult. Her fascination with her brother Matt, was not fully explained, and really all the characters could have been written better. The layout of the book I also felt was badly edited. I literally had to force myself to finish it because I figured I'd already spent so much of my time I figured I had to know the end. What a let down.... I found it way to corny and anti-climatic. Seriously, if you're on the fence about this one, keep on searching. Leave this book alone, you'll be doing yourself a favor 
 Except for two cuties: William Zabka and Dana Ashbrook! Especially Dana who constantly having a hard-on 
 I knew the ending within the first 10 minutes.  M. Night Shamalamadingdong disappointed me and should go back to his job at Denny's 
 This is the worst of the Xanth novel, that I have read. I was greatly disappointed in the emphasis on sex. This book seemed to be written for the politically correct, morally lost society member. Piers Anthony did his Xanth fan's a disservce with this novel. Also take note of the cover picture, a small peite "white girl" and a zombie, well part of that is in the story. Why was the cover misleading, possibly to sell this trashy novel. Save your money, don't buy this book 
 I wish this book was written better. You could tell that it was her very first time trying to write a story. I kept waiting for something to happen yet I feel like she was whining the whole tme 
 I bought this product for my husband for christmas because he talks on the phone a lot with work. The instructions say 8 hours of talk time. However, it only has 3 hours of talk time before it needs to be recharged. So, its a good product if you don't need more than 3 hours of talk time. But, bad if you need it all day. 
 I witnessed the rise of this man and his designs over the years and I must say it is very hard not to be appealed and seduced by him. He is what he is and he knows this quite well, and is not afraid to share his existence with the rest of the world.  This man was the biggest groundbreaker since Gianni. He became one with the company Gucci, and made his identity mold and cover the company's personality and stance from top to the finest detail in image, production, design, PR and most importantly, in business. It is hard to resist his presence and power.  As a design student, I must say he is also quite inspiring. He is creative alright, has a sense of style and business, ever so perfect, walks the walk, talks the talk, and refines and redefines design according to what he knows best. And it seems he has an answer for everything, because he is basically the 'it' - the tastemaker, the designer, the Oscar Wilde of this era.  I love him for that and he will forever be the story of perfection and power to me.   But the book... for a hard cover block heavier than my fridge, it is just sooo empty. More empty pages than the ones with words on them, more celebrity oriented and focused images than the actual designs and his vision, much less compelling and a lot more reduced -correct word is 'dry'- explanations of his mind and vision...  It is just empty. Why putting images of the likes of Lil Kim, or Eve, and whatever seemed more important than a few more shots from the runways, his sketches, his houses, office space, mag covers etc., I do not know.  It is very hard to find the images or prints of his designs, ad campaigns included wonderful parfume ads, accessories from watches to the infamous bamboo heel stillettos etc, but he would not put any of these that made him who he is internationally, instead we have to see the same dress on a gorgeous model, and on the facing page, we had to see it again on Lil Kim in a very bad tabloid shot.   I dont know how much of his creative ddecisions went into editing the book, but still, it is unacceptable. This is not an art book. This is a book titled as TOM FORD in capital letters, but you do not get the sense of his presence at all. When you title a book with your name, you promise a lot to the audience, and this book just seemed unfinished or very badly edited. I did not expect a biography obviously, and I am happy that it is a visual book, because I always thought that the guy is more of a 2D person than a one dimensional one, but still for a man that has a lot to say and show, there was so much lacking and missing for a huge book of over 400 glossy pages.  Still, I think any price is cheap for this man and his gorgeous book, but still... This is closest the came near imperfection (literally, by my first copy was printed incorrectly-had two inroductions and no interview-changed it later), and I believe this book does not represent a celebration of him, but almost him trying to show what and how much Gucci will lose when he is gone including his celebrity fans etc.    PS: it is funny that he only has one face expression, at least in these photos. 
 I purchased this item per other recommendations and that of Stereophile magazine, thinking that this would be useful for broadcasting iTunes and internet radio programming to other parts of my home.  First, reception was terrible even with the reciever placed only a few feet away from the Transmitter. Second, I tried the tweak (turning up the volume pot)suggested in other ratings.  This didn't help matters from a reception standpoint, in addition, the unit is so poorly constructed that the mere act of opening it dislodges the volume potentiometer.  Third, the volume pot itself is of very poor construction.    In short, it doesn't work, you won't be happy--even if you attempt to "fix" it yourself-- don't buy this product 
 De Soto's work was viewed by economists, historians, and politicians alike as breakthrough.  He gives us an in-depth look at the Lima's informal sector and postulates, much to the satisfaction of his Washington, D.C.  bankroll, that Peruvians are bursting to embrace democracy and market  capitalism.  Unfortunately, he has twisted Peru's real scenario to reflect  what Washington wants to hear.  In reality, Lima's informal sector is  merely a way for a depraved population to survive, not a radical shift  toward capitalism.  De Soto's Institue for Liberty and Democracy was funded  almost in full by Washington, and the man himself has spent more time in  the U.S. than in Peru.  This book leans more toward American propaganda  than objective analysis.  An interesting read, but only with abundant  grains of salt 
 After Norm Finkelstein exposed this guy as the complete fraud he is, who would waste their time with this junk 
 So lame.  I was disgusted by his insensitive female protagonist.  His narrator says she'll end a conversation, like a first trimester pregnancy, if the guy she's talking to doesn't make six figures.  Yuck.  Totally unbelievable.  
 This book didn't ring my chimes.... the examples were not fully explained and there seemed to be gaps in the theory. Big thumbs down 
 This book is absurd. I found a few historical flaws in the little history it had in it. This book is one of the reasons romance will never be respected. It tries to be humorous where it is inappropriate. It is obvious  she couldn't be bothered to do any historical research, and the hero was  one dimensional and in no way seemed realistic. I am supposed to believe  that gentle man was once a ruthless pirate? I don't think so. Now that I  think of it, this book wouldn't work as a fantasy either because fantasy  books have more depth than this shallow romance 
 I bought it from another store, turned it on to toast it did nothing. Changed setting to bake and soon after it started to smoke. I smell a recall 
 It was done in 1905.  Was once called "THE JUNGLE" by Upton Sinclair.  Done far better then too.  Avoid this remake.  Much like Hollywood remake of classics, it does a true disservice rather than anything else 
 .      Written before the nomination of Justices Roberts and Alito, Seeking Justices is an unabashed apologetic for the Schumer-Kennedy etc approach of confirmation based on political grounds.  As the author points out, one may judge a nominee by legal skill and qualifications or by political leanings.  From Comiskey's standpoint, only the latter is legitimate, a view he says is shared by political scientists across the country, I infer those on campuses.  The other school--the legalists--are in his view unsupported by history or good sense. Because many nominees in the past have been evalauted on raw politics, means they should be in the future.  From this standpoint, he evaluates nominees according to where they land on the political spectrum-based on newspapers' evaluations (!)-from liberal (good) to conservative (very, very bad).   His attitude toward Judge Bork is all but apoplectic; Bork did not agree with the legal underpinnings of several 1960s-70s decisions, which to Comiskey is anathema.  This is not the place to evaluate Judge Bork, other than to say even if you disagree with him legally-as do I-no one can dismiss his analysis as anything other than serious. But for Comiskey, Bork's opinions do not match the liberal political agenda, and that is both necessary and sufficient for Bork's rejection.  I gave up on Comiskey when he termed Justice Black as a consensus Great Justice.  I suppose that is the case if you ask the left wing of the Democratic party and if you evaluate judges on the basis of how ends-above-means politicians they are.  Give me dispassionate legal scholars any day for unelected positions.  Give me politicians for elected positions.   But, in his view, I'm an unredeemable legalist. .        Because the book was written before Justices Roberts and Alito's nominations, it would be safe to say that Comiskey would applaud the approach taken by Sens. Schumer and Kennedy, and even the frankly embarrassing performances by Sens. Biden and Feinstein (ones who made me feel ashamed to be a Democrat).  .         All in all, the book is politically biased, and not all that scholarly.  But at least Comiskey makes no bones about it 
 I myself is a Proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services. I also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase. (Mine in three months.) The strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself. (In one occasion, they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it's good.)These back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months, and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you, even though it's still within one year. I believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise, not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying: "this is our policy. 
 What can you say about CD cases? These would be adequate....if they hadn't arrived damaged. Whoever does the packing for Amazon should learn that a single sheet of brown paper will NOT prevent shipping damage. A little bubble wrap may be more expensive, but it would have prevented my returning this order for a refund 
 OK, I deserved it!  After suffering through the first Hilda Johansson mystery, I should have learned my lesson.  This main character is so wooden, so unlovable, so contrary...and the plot is so thin and undeveloped...it's not a rewarding read!  Stick with the author's Dorothy Martin series...that's where she apparently puts her best efforts 
 Perhaps it's a little bit refreshing for a normal album to significantly overshadow a greatest hits compilation, but that doesn't mean it should happen.  Simply put, Relationship of Command is a far better, and far more listenable, cd than this greatest hits compilation.  There's just something missing from most of the songs on this cd (save the ones from Relationship of Command); that edge and distinctive sound that's so prevalent with the mars volta and (to a significantly lesser degree) sparta just isn't there with most of these "hits."    Do yourself a favor if you're just getting into these guys: Pick up relationship of command, then forget this hits compilation ever existed.  Repeat if neccesary 
 Life is too short to be spent reading drivel.  Stuart Woods was really off the mark with this book.  You shouldn't rest on your laurels Mr. Woods, your audience deserves better.  I've enjoyed your past books very much, but this one left a lot to be desired.  I was very put off by Stone Barrington's bed-hopping activities in this story.  With Arrington (mother of his son) one night, then with Holly the next, I don't recall him being quite that indescriminate in other books.  The plot was relly silly and contrived, it must have been that the publisher was pressing for a story, never mind quality.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 I have previously enjoyed all of Suzanne Brockmann's books but this one is a departure from her usual interesting fiction. I have struggled to finish it but it is so tedious with stupid situations and circumstances, I really hate it. What a yawner and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they like to be bored and frustrated 
 Our family has the original LeapPad, and recently purchased a LeapPad Plus Writing.  I must say that there is no comparison between the two products, and the original LeapPad system is by far superior.  My kid love playing LeapPad, however the addition of a graphite pencil is a mess!  Once the pages are written on, you can never get them completely clean, and also younger kids have a hard time erasing it all together.  If we were to do it all over again, we would have purchased a second LeapPad system, and not bothered with the "Plus Writing" 
 A book full of heartwarming stories from country stars, singers, writers,  and listeners, or so the back of the book said.  As I read some sentimental  stories, and some down right boring stories I questioned how more than half  of these stories got into the `Country1 edition of the Chicken Soup series.   I loved about three stories, liked about ten, and was puzzled by all the  other entries 
 The ones that are posted twice do not work. If they are posted once, you can try to download it, but it might not work. The video only worked for about a minute. Shame, since I really like this show and I wanted Amazon Unbox to be cool. The one cent CSI works, go download tha 
 I love Bruce Campbell's work; even have the whole Brisco County, Jr. set, but this movie was a big disappointment . .  
 While Tim Burton is a fascinating subject, Ken Hanke has produced a truly stupid book about him. Most of his information is gathered from previously published interviews (few of which were conducted by the author) and when  he has nothing of substance to say (which is most of the time) Hanke simply  provides a synopsis of the particular film in question.  Also, his attempt  to analyze Burton's films in light of what sketchy biographical information  Hanke has constructed is at best simplistic and at worst, inept.  It is  pop-psychoanalysis at its worst, on the level of a freshman class paper,  instead of what one would expect from a professional journalist.  This book  should be considered to be on par with the other hastily-compiled  unauthorized biographies of celebrities, fun for gossip, but not much else.   Read "Burton on Burton" if you want to learn anything of  substance  
 It's not a book that makes you want to read it, I find myself just skimming through it. The author can barely go a page without mentioning "the dot-com global workplace", I find that very annoying. There are some interesting case studies but she doesn't give any suggested outcomes so the reader is left wondering what is the best course of action 
 I am sorry, but I have to add a discordant note to all the glowing five star ratings everyone is giving this album.  When you're ready to sit down with a glass of wine and some cheese to listen to some pleasant jazz, you flop in Bill Frisell's  Unspeakable and get a bunch of inharmonious ca ca.  Especially on tracks 13 and 14.  There's tons of better stuff out there.  Go buy something else 
 I've loved this movie ever since I saw it on CBS years ago so I was really excited to own it on DVD. Unfortunately the experience was ruined when I discovered that there are big sound problems on the second disc. Loud popping sounds completely cover up the dialogue in an entire scene. I was very dissapointed.   The movie is great but the sound problems aren't worth the purchase. Stay away 
 I bought the book thinking that I'd be getting detailed information about homeowners insurance but the author merely glosses over the subject matter.  I think he's an agent and, as such, doesn't have that much experience when it comes to the information I need, such as claims (particularly mold since I was just cancelled as a result of filing a mold claim), how to interpret specific policy language, etc 
 Just a reminder that this guy cheated on his wife around the same time Clinton was being pounded for his indiscretions.   Sean Hannity, early in his book "Let Freedom Ring" reminded us of how Bill Clinton tainted the office of the presidency and then not two paragraphs later noted how Morris was a good friend of his (Hannity's) and then led into negative opinions on Morris of Clinton.  Didn't bother to mention anything about Morris doing the exact same thing- and this little worm woulda lied with his palm on the Ark of the Covenant so don't give me (...) about the lame@ss lying under oath Republican punk.  (...) hyprocrite!   
 Read Code Complete by Steve McConnell. You don't need this book. It contradicts itself on several occasions and is totally wrong on others. It's unfortunate and sad how many organizations want to adopt texts like this as their "coding standard". A pamplet-sized book of bullet-points can't make developers competent, but a comprehensive manual of the best in software engineering practices like Code Complete can 
 'The Only Guide To A Winning Bond Strategy' and 'The Only Guide To A Winning Investment Stragegy You'll Ever Need' make some good and invaluable points. HOWEVER, you can't help but wonder if the information contained in both the books could have been condensed to a lengthy article. The basic point of both books is that the market is efficient and it is a waste of money to buy actively traded mutual funds or to try and actively trade securities yourself. I found it more than a little irritating that the same examples and quotes were used OVER and OVER again in 'Investment Strategy', so imagine my dismay when I bought 'Bond Strategy' and discovered that a good third of the book explains the same things as 'Investment Strategy' did (e.g., Efficient Market Theory) and uses the same quotes and examples. Seriously, I could have done without the antedotes regarding Copernicus and Galileo again. Similarly, each chapter is prefaced with half a page of quotes. Remember those kids in grade school (and University!) that tried to beef up their scanty reports with long quotes, appendixes, title pages and a nice looking report cover? Unfortunately, some of that is going on here. It is really obvious the publishers and authors of these books stretched their information so that it reached 'book length'. In 'Investment Strategy' you are paying for 85 pages of appendices and indexes, and probably another 100 of quotes and antedotes. That is over half fluff and filler. Don't get me wrong. There some valid points in this book. But maybe you should just go to your local library or Borders and take notes from Chapters 7 and 8 in 'Investment Strategy' and kind of skim the rest. I don't mind paying for books, but I feel a little duped by all the fluff in these books. Good points, but low bit rate. 
 Sean Hannity's rise to fame proves that an ignorant illiterate can rise well beyond the level of incompetence in this country, especially when their audience consists of like-minded organ banks.  Hannity is stupid, hypocritical and loud.  His sole redeeming quality is as a mechanism for carbon-oxygen exchange.  Hannity is well-coiffed, well dressed  and well short of thorazine on his overhyped comedy duo called the Hannity and Combs report.  This bozo is so uptight he must wear a chastity belt 2 sizes too small.  Get a real job, you poser 
 received above book; correct cover, but inside is another book by name of 'the glass key' by dashiell hammett. tried to contact you by various means, to no avail.original packaging long gone. how do i go about getting the book i ordered?? 
 I bought this CD about a year ago, since I was curious about the nature sound CD craze, and it was cheap.(cheep? sorry...) For the price, it's probably worth it. However, some of the birds sound suspiciously like  sounds I've heard coming out of my computer...Hence the title of this  review. ; 
 This book is quite mediocore. The book although not horrible was somewhat dissapointing. Some of the stories are definately better than others.  This is surely not McCullough's best novel 
 As a rule, I enjoy Dan Abnett's work. Progressing from the initial Gaunt's Ghosts - I observed a real development of character and the stories became more intricate and developed as the series developed.   And - I felt that with Traitors General, Dan could find a novel way to finish the Gaunt's Ghosts saga; and thereby find time to more fully develop Ravenor, perhaps have a sequel to the story of Milo and Sanian; and who knows - maybe even link up with the excellent Graham McNeill (Storm of Iron) to develop another good ripping yarn - which is what Dan usually delivers.  This tale however started off really well - and then the pace, the style and the imagery just fizzled into - well, nothing quite of the quality I'd come to expect from Dan.  C'mon Dan - you are one of the few really great writers in this genre; I read Warhammer related tales all the time, and most are rushed into production because the fan base is there, but those stories are so predicatable and the quality usually as awful. You are different - finally a writer I enjoy reading. Please - 'feth it' - dont start rushing into production yourself ....  If this is your first introduction to Dan Abnett - please reconsider and start the Gaunt Ghost series (be patient - by the end you will have been well entertained!). Otherwise, Traitors General is a better read for you - and you will understand more as this book builds on an intimate knowledge of Gaunts men and their story. 
 "Lysistrata" is truly a revolting play that pokes fun at women.  They say Aristophanes thought women to be more than toys for their men, but I see the opposite.  I think Aristophanes made a satire out of women and the only thing they are good at: sex and reproducing male babies.  This is no compliment. To think that the only way women can change their husband's minds would be by withholding intercourse.  This is preposterous! I found this play derogatory with ill humor.  I do not recommend 
 In his classic 1954 work _Witchcraft Today_, Gerald Gardner constructed an intricate theory for the origin of the ancient witch-cult whose rituals, he claimed, he had been invited to witness and report on. According to Gardner, these British witches were carrying on a tradition handed down to them by their parents and grandparents, practices originating far back in the mists of time. Since he did not disclose identifying details about who or where these witches were, meaning that nothing of them can be verified, it is impossible to tell if he had truly penetrated an ancient, secretive cult, or if the story he told was nothing more than an elaborate fantasy. Claiming that the witches themselves did not know their origins, Gardner weaves together a rather incredible explanation on their behalf: Witches, he said, were the descendants of an aboriginal British race driven into hiding for their continuing practice of their indigenous religion, magic. What's more, this aboriginal race was actually a pygmy race which, when driven into hiding, gave rise to legends of "little people," faeries, pixies, elves, and other magical folk, who even though eventually intermarrying with the larger population, still retained their magical ways.  There are a number of problems with this explanation. First, there is the historical problem. Gardner identifies the Picts, a non-Celtic people of Britain inhabiting the northern area of Britain (modern Scotland) from pre-Roman times, and which by 900 A.D. had disappeared, as the aboriginal pygymy race from which the witches derive their traditions. According to him, "they were much the same as the present-day pygmies of Africa, small people bullied by their bigger neighbours and driven out of the best lands into the hills and woods and other inaccessible places. They raid cultivated fields and play pranks, but if their thefts are forgiven and food is sometimes left out for them, they will, in return, leave gifts of their hunting spoils, meat, ivory and skins" (p. 56). Additionally, he finds a linguistic link in the English word pixie and the Roman name for these peoples, the Picti.   It all sounds good at first, but it doesn't hold water. First off, none of the sources contemporary to the Picts describe them as being pygmies! Roman accounts of the invasion and conquest of Britain and her native peoples make no mention of the Picts' unusual size, nor do the Anglo-Saxons some five hundred years later. Bede, historian of the English people, writing in the seventh century, when the Picts were still known, does not describe them thus; in fact, it is not until the fifteenth century, five hundred years after they had ceased to be known as a separate people, that anyone describes them as being little: the Bishop of the Orkneys says of them that they "were only a little exceeding pygmies on stature and worked wonderfully in the construction of their cities evening and morning, but at midday they hid themselves in little underground houses, fearing light."  Further, there is a lack of archeological evidence to support the idea that the Picts were little people. No skeletons, no systematic ruins, nothing. The totality of Gardner's archeological evidence for the Picts' pygmy nature rests on a handful of inexplicably cramped cells. Given the fevered pitch of the medieval imagination, it's likely that it was just this sort of random cell which gave rise to the original suspicion of the ancient peoples' being pygmies.   But what happened to the Picts? The same thing that happened to every other native population: They intermarried with the invaders and formed a new stock of people. It isn't as interesting as the theory that they hid themselves for a few hundred years, but it is, unfortunately for romantics, standard operating procedure in the world of conquest and invasion. Another cultural habit kicks in here too: The memory of the "savage Picts" slowly transformed into folklore about an unnatural people to be feared, folklore with which to frighten children into being good and which bonded its tellers together against an unknown "other." And it is this folklore which Gardner relies on as proof of the continued existence of the Picts as mysterious, magical "little people" feared by "civilized society." All societies participate in this demonization of the other; its processes are too familiar to be taken seriously as a record of actual events.   So, if not the survival of the practices of an ancient pixie-folk, what was Gardner's witch-cult? Probably not what he made it out to be. Did countryfolk of Gardner's day practice folk magic? Certainly, and one hopes customs of the sort will not be lost to modernization. Did they learn the custom from their parents and grandparents? Certainly. Was it the watered-down memory of ancient pagan practices? Absolutely. Were its practitioners voluble about the sorts of folk magic they knew? Most likely not, but not out of fear of Christian persecution--it is more likely that it was the magic itself they feared. But none of this adds up to the sort of cult Gardner describes, a more or less organized group practicing an elaborate ritual which reenacts a central myth remembered from pre-Christian times.   The cult he describes, in fact, sounds suspiciously like the product of the theories current in Gardner's Victorian/Edwardian youth. Remember that science, particularly the perfidious theories of Darwin, and archaeology, particularly the recent discovery of the Epic of Gilgamesh, with a Flood account which predated the account in Genesis, had effectively made belief in the Bible as a literal account of history difficult for educated people. Add to this the Romantic movement of the nineteenth century, with its concepts of the noble savage and the divinity of nature, and Gardner's proffered witch-cult becomes less plausible and more obviously the fruit of common nineteenth-century fancies. His witch-cult was a "purer" religion, one bequeathed to us by nobler ancestors, carried on in secret, and tuned in to nature, one to replace the discarded Christian religion. It was, in short, the perfect religion for its time. 
 I wish Mr. Gore had imbibed more of a biblical foundation during his growing up years in the Bible belt.  He uses the thesis, that the only thing which creates familial bonds is luvvvvv, to then say that families come in all shapes and forms....2 daddies, or 2 mommies...ughhhhh!  It is no accident that in the book of Genesis, the creation of the familial bond is linked to the sexual act between a man and a woman. "A man shall be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh." In the New Testament, Paul interprets this sexually, arguing that for this reason one should not sleep with a prostitute inasmuch as you would be becoming "one flesh" with her.  So, the Gores need to repent, return to the biblical foundation, and realize that luvvvvvvvvv is not the sole nexus where familial bonds are released. It is equally in the coming together sexually of male and female.  But then, if he were to say that, he would make certain "families" feel bad. Then he would lose part of his political support. Then he would be called "bigoted" "racist" "homophobe" and "dumb."  
 Terence Howard stars as a pimp that's looking to "better" his life by making in big in rap music.  A mediocre film that further pushes the stereotype of black people and it's a poor attempt to draw pity toward people that spend their lives making excuses for the dirty deeds they do. NOBODY is forced to be a pimp. Sorry. Go get a job even if it's at the store. Atleast you would have some dignity then.  Pimps have NO DIGNITY. What's shocking is there's women that condone this movie and what it contains. But hey, we live in a sick world now so who can be surprised.  2/ 
 Achebe was correct when he described this book as a sick book. It is. Just disgusting and trying to hard to be sophisticated, ie, "European". The description by Achebe that Armah's book reminds him of the Jean Paul Sartre novel where two characters sit around looking bored in a cafe in Paris and then in a burst of nihilistic energy decide to stab themselves to make some obscure point to each other. He's on the money. Unfortunately Armah came on the scene when publishing in Africa was not more discriminating 
 Full of hatred as the first one, just the sources of this last one tell us everything about how the writer of that biography has written it : using tabloids and people magazines.... That's all, so no doubt about the poor accuracy of the content. Better buy other books on Mr Gibson 
 Being an avid enthusiast of the drum n' bass "scene," as pretentious as it occasionally sometimes is, in listening to this Cd I feel this is not a strong representation of the genre. This could very well be  personal, (so you headz chill) but this type of jazzy, tech-step like, a  cappella jam seems occasionally cheesy and filled  with..well..."filler."  I realize that during 1998 this was where  it was at for Grooverider. He was hardly setting off bombs in the d n b  fabric with other producers overshadowing his less-than-fresh efforts.   This album has a few choice cuts, and his production skills are  commendable, but combining so-called jazz harmonies with this type of genre  is definately an abuse of power.  The loungy progressions are worn thick,  and lacking any true creativity deep down.  This album comes nowhere near  stuff on the "Prototype Years" ep which was showcasing the fine  talents of heavy hitters Dillinja, Ed Rush, Fierce, Lemon D, Optical, and  Boymerang, to name a few.  It goes without saying that Grooverider has been  one of the most respected and talented DJ's, probably getting all of these  afforementioned producers their starts.  A big name gets alot of support   and can get away unscathed by negativity due to that stardom.  No one would  dare defy that Grooverider's attempt at making d n b is off key, but let's  not give in to someone's production skills because they are graciously  empowered in the scene like a king.  Purveyor's of fine drum n' bass can  find sanctuary elsewhere.  Stick with your records for the best 
  	The author of A Northern Light is Jennifer Donnelly.  She resides in Brooklyn, N.Y, with her husband and daughter as well as two greyhounds.  Other works by  the author  include Humble Pie and The Tea Rose.  A Northern Light was the winner of The Carnegie Medal, The Los Angeles Times Prize and A Michael L. Printz Award Honor Book.   	The intended purpose of this book was to address many issues that young people face growing up.  The main character, Mattie Gokey, has to go through many hardships and make many adult decisions in this novel.  Mattie lives with her Pa and younger sisters.  Other characters that play a large role in this book are Weaver, Royal, Minnie, Miss Wilcox and Grace Brown.  A murder takes place in this book that was based upon real events.  Even though the murder was an actual event, the characters are made up to help it come clearer to readers.  Grace Brown's body is found in the lake after she takes a boat ride.   She gives Mattie a bundle of letters to burn but when she is found dead, instead of burning them, Mattie begins to read them and discovers many important aspects of the murder.  Donnelly skips back and forth from past to present and takes us through part of Mattie's life.  She also adds alot of advanced vocabulary for Mattie's words of the day.  She also uses language of the time period to make the story  come to life better.   	Although this novel received many awards of excellence and I'm sure alot of people would greatly enjoy  reading it, I was not one of them.  At the beginning, I thought it was going to be a very exciting murder mystery, but was disappointed to discover that the murder played only a small part in the whole novel.  I did find it very interesting though that it was actually based on a real murder.  I would probably not recommend this book for someone who is looking for a murder mystery because the murder only plays a small part in the novel.  Also, I think the author could have labeled the chapters a little more clearly because it got a little confusing with all the switching back and forth between past and present.   	I would say the intended audience would be young adults and most likely just females.  It contained some adult content, such as some profanity, as well as some sexual content.  Boys would probably not enjoy this novel because it is, in some aspects, a love story.  There's "sparking" and affairs and dirty older men at the hotel.  A younger person would not understand or want to read something that involves such material.   	In conclusion, A Northern Light was not one of my  favorite books that I've ever read.  The audience range is very  small and also based upon gender.  It is a well written novel, it just doesn't spark alot of interest in many people.  It went into to much detail at some parts and not enough for other parts.  I think she should have made the murder a more important part of the novel because it would have made it much more exciting.  
 I loved Steel's early works.  I read them all and they were great but have stopped reading her because her books are repetitive now.  I decided to try once again just to see and this book was maddening!!  It was 178 pages long and could have been all been said in 100 pages.  It was obvious that she was stretching it to make it a hardback "novel" length to sale.  Skip it.  
 I generally hate writing a bad review since I believe in every effort being praised, however this book was an absolute waste of time. The book is a compilation of clichés and myths about the Balkans, having worked there for three years after I read this book, I can with full confidence congratulate the publisher on the selection of a catchy title for the book - aside from the title there is nothing of value in it. I wanted to find out more about other works of this author since I was shocked with the amount of ignorance he had of the Balkans and yet embarked on writing a book on the region - there must be something to it! Well, I noticed that Mr. Kaplan seems to have set a similar pattern in writing for other places of the world without knowing them! Like in Balkan Ghosts so in other works of Mr. Kaplan, the reader always comes across a mysterious personage that the author has met quite by chance and has had a conversation with on a subject that oddly fits the plot of his book, be it the Serbian lady or the African monk in his later works - there's a work of this, is called fiction! And this is where Balkan Ghosts should be, in the novella section, for it makes a nice fiction.  
 I love the Amelia Peabody novels by Elizabeth Peters, but I'm finding it hard to believe this book was written by the same person. The dialogue is lame, the characters are cliches, the humor falls flat, there is a lot of filler, the characters are constantly explaining things to each other (for the reader's benefit) that all of them should know already, and the plot goes nowhere fast. To be fair, the Amelia Peabody novels aren't terribly plot-focused either, but they are funny. This one just doesn't work.  On the positive side, I continue to be astonished by the virtuosity of the audiobook reader, Barbara Rosenblatt. I'd listen to just about anything if she was reading it 
 During the time I was considering buying this model, I happen to see the same thing at a local department store; so I bought it. I couldn't wait to take it back. I wasn't impressed with the cheap plastic. The pump came with the adapter pre set for a Schrader valve; my tires are Presta. The blister pack says it can be used for both and indicates all one has to do is to take off the "round end", remove and reverse the plastic adapter, re insert and then screw on the cap [tight as per the label]. Seemed simple enough, so, I took off the cap, took out the plastic insert [I noticed it is in 2 parts], reversed and re inserted and then replaced the cap. When I put the end on the Presta valve and then pressed down on the "thumb part", I couldn't help but notice that the plastic would not grab the valve, but was loose. So I decided to change back to the Schrader type [and use my adapter valve]; maybe this would be a tighter fit. So, I took off the cap, and tried to remove the insert, but only one part of it came out; the parts separated; I could not remove the "bottom" half. I was not going to force it out. I put the parts back together, re inserted them into the blister pack and returned it. No thanks !!! I gave this product 1 star only because of the way this review process is set up; it doesn't deserve any star or any consideration for purchase 
 While this book is OK for a popular account of the problems with the UN.  The finest criticque and analysis of the UN is by Michael J. Glennon, professor of international law at the Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy, Tufts University.  He wrote "Limits of Law, Prerogatives of Power: Interventionism After Kosovo" (Palgrave, 2001).  Limits of Law is, hands down, the most thorough, effective and devestating analysis of the UN ever published and the problems under international law.  It is not an easy read because the author's thought process is acute and razor sharp.  However, if you truly want to understand the UN and its problems this is THE boo 
 These cards were supposed to be tournament quality.  They weren't.  My $5 Rook cards purchased at Walmart are higher quality!  I was also dissappointed by the fact that the deck I purchased was missing the Red One.  Returned the set I purchased for myself as well as one that I had purchased as a gift for my Rook-loving brother 
 "Broadway Bound" marks the end of Simon's trilogy, and it's very dark and sad - not how I had hoped the trilogy would end. I found the characters different, but of course, you can say they matured, but Stanley was much more frantic than I remembered him to be.  Eugene was much more level headed - not the sex-crazed teenage boy we knew and loved.  Blanche lost her quirkiness, and the outcome of Jack and Kate disappointed me. The addition of Ben was what saved the play; the way Eugene played off of him was like "old times."  I didn't feel the Jerome's were the Jerome's anymore.  I do not recommend 
 you may be tempted to buy these because of the 'sony' name...but be warned, DO NOT buy sony cd-r's off of amazon....I bought this same 50 pack, and had to throw half, yes half as in 25 of the discs, out because they had read errors and God knows what else.  I find this strange though, because I've  bought (and still do) these same sony cd-r's from best buy, and at target, and at staples...and they've always worked fine.  I thought I would give it a go buying the online and I'm sorry I did.  If you want the sony cd's, just go to your local target and pick em up there...at least I can tell, based off my experience, they'll work.  Can't say the same for the ones coming from amazon 
 Though most of Ballard's work contains unvarying plots, motifs, characters, etc., I was quite stunned to find that `Super Cannes' and `Cocaine Nights' are - albeit with minor tweaks and variations - actually one and the same book.  From the backdrops to the manic idiosyncrasies of the characters, the key components in each enjoy such thorough correspondences and identity that a synopsis of one book effectively adumbrates the other.  It seems Ballard's technique of thematic reiteration and repetition has achieved such perfection as to suggest that an author has finally (and remarkably) cloned his own work and slipped it over the transom.  Read both books if you wish to scrutinize the sublime homogeneity of Ballard's imagination. Or pick one or the other, and feel satisfied that you've economized on money and time 
 This palm is dated.  You should spend the extra $100 and get something a little more up to date 
 After my older brother suddenly died of coronary artery disease at age 40 due to genetically high cholesterol, I needed to learn everything possible on the subject so that I could avoid suffering the same fate.  I read all the books on the shelf, among them Dr. Ornish's.  I disliked this book because it is rather narcissistic and is focused more on Dr. Ornish himself than on educating us about how to avoid heart disease.  Take a look at chapter 1 and you'll see what I mean: "I was trained to treat hypertension..."; "I first became interested in conducting research on heart disease in 1975..."; "I began to wonder..."; "I went to the medical library and began reading extensively"; "It seemed like an exciting opportunity, so in 1977 I decided to take a year off..."; "I hadn't had enough clinical experience to be jaded..."; "I was unwittingly giving many of them hope for the first time since their illness had been diagnosed"; "I went back to medical school and graduated in 1980"; "From 1981 to 1984, I completed my internship and medical residency in Boston."; "In July 1984, I moved to San Francisco..."  This is just the tedious first six pages.  Trust me, it goes on and on like this.  Do you want to learn about how the heart works?  You'll finally get a few sentences on that subject when you get to page 42, squeezed in between more "I did this and I did that."  You'll get a little info on LDL and HDL when you get to page 51.  Sure, there is useful information within the 672 pages of this book, but you'll be forced to become an expert on Dr. Ornish and his life story to find it.  And remember, this book is more than 15 years old.  Perhaps back in 1990 he needed to devote 300 pages to convincing people that he was correct in believing that diet, exercise, and stress affect your risk of heart disease, but that that is common knowledge and not controversial now.  The research is far more advanced in today's world.  If you are interested in Dr. Ornish personally and the history of the study of heart disease in the 1970s and 1980s, you'll probably enjoy this book.  But if you are serious about educating yourself on heart disease and how best to avoid it, I would recommend Dr. Robert Superko's "Before the Heart Attacks : A Revolutionary Approach to Detecting, Preventing, and Even Reversing Heart Disease" (2003) or Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz's "The Expert Guide to Beating Heart Disease: What You Absolutely Must Know" (2005).  These books are more up to date and provide far more useful information. 
 Cheng Man-Ch'ing is a cult figure in taiji, with a fiercely loyal group of followers.  Certainly he was a master, and this book provides excellent photos of him doing the form.  But taiji is all about movement and feeling, and still photos can't convey the quality of movement or hint at the internal mechanics of the art.  So if you want to use the book to learn the form, forget it.  If you have a good teacher, and want the book as a source of inspiration, by all means, buy it.  If you're a Cheng Man-Ching fan, keep in mind that he talked and wrote about taiji, but much of his power was derived from nei gong, including the small and great heavenly circulations, that he kept a closely held secret, for reasons that remain unclear.  Temper what he says with the understanding that he held back as much as he offered, and you won't be frustrated by doing the form over and over without getting anywhere near the benefits Cheng derived.  Bottom line is that the book is an artifact and a good one, and it was one of the first books in English on taiji.  As a learning tool, it is limited.  
 Laminated maps such as this one of DC (where I live) are insufficient.  Get the big-sized paper map in a book store or you will wish you had.  The one here lacks details north of Adams Morgan's central district, for example 
 I am now at page 590 in a 720 page book.  Absolutely nothing of relevance has happened.  Similar to the 2nd book, I'm guessing the last 50 pages will be a crazy and implausible 'wrap up'.  Instead of focusing on how verity regains his throne, how they thwart the red ships or how they dispose of regal, the only thing that happens is we get to read about how fitz travels literally from buck to past the mountains.  Nothing really happens along the way either.  Fitz travels on a road little more than a trail, he gets tired, goes to sleep, starts skilling toward molly and burrich although he doesn't want to and then wakes up again to drink some elfbark tea.  Rinse and repeat for 600 pages, literally.  I see no adequate way for Hobb to 'finish' up this book in the next 130 pages considering her rambling writing style.  I find myself thinking "oh no he's going to sleep again" and shaking my head almost every other chapter. Fitz gets captured like three times and three times he 'manages' to escape.  I felt like i was watching an episode of the original Batman on television!  It's amazing how one can write 600 pages and have nothing happen at all.  I understand character development but this is beyond reasonable when it's 99% that and 1% story/plot.  I also found myself thinking aloud "i don't want to read this anymore" many times throughout the meanderings in this book.  I'm not exaggerating, nothing happens in the 600 pages I've read.    Not to mention the number of plot holes I've encountered.  It's baffling. I really regret reading this series.  For example, Molly encounters old men who recognize her as the bastard's woman, yet Regal can still not find her!  Okay!     It started off decent with the first book.  It was a good intro and I was excited to start the 2nd book.  After 500 pages in that book with nothing happening, i started to get an idea of about the 3rd.  But by then it was too late to stop reading the series.  Hobb's writing style is at times rather annoying too.  Whenever the characters ask a question with a negative particle, she insists on switching the subject with the negative ala "Can not you.." or "Should not you.."  Then she switches back to regular American dialogue.  She isnt' consistent with it either.  It's awkward at best.  Each and every single female character has to be sassy and always try to take charge.  God forbid she portrays a female that's not 'equal' to men or appears weak!  Her villains are laughable.    We know nothing of more of the red ships or Regal, or the forged ones by 500 pages into the third book than we did 50 pages into book one.  It's astounding how she can concentrate so much on Fitz, who never really grows anyway, and leave all the other characters to a single dimensional fate.  Regal is the embodiment of evil and that's good enough for you!  I really want to stop reading this book even now at 600 pages into it because I know the ending is going to be terrible, yet I am compelled to finish it because I've invested so much time into it...  Read this book at your own risk 
 This book is not meant for self study. This book is too theoretical, and it does not give enough basic examples. It is too abstract. I do not recommend this book to anyone 
 This book and its author's audacious writing style are so intriguing it draws one in despite three warning signs: 1) it's billed as 'post-modernist' which too often means a poor work which is defended on the basis of its detractors being too dull and simple to understand it in all its glory 2) it's historical fiction, which too often means the author is neither creative enough to make up his own story nor skilled enough to make accuracy rewarding and 3) it was recognized by the national book award which too often lately means the public is right for once, the reason only 200 people have read this book is that it's not good.  These telltales notwithstanding the book has the power to fascinate, and readers who hate to give up, or love a challenge, or whose curiosity is powerful will likely press on to see where this careening narrative is headed and be unable to stop - for a while.  Vollmann writes long, confusing, and through varied narrators but in the end this is not Dostoyevsky, Pynchon, or Faulkner.  Vollmann DOES have ability.  It's been pointed out by (just about all) reviewers that the book desperately needed aggressive editing, but reading it makes one think this author's ego would never permit that, so there's probably little hope of him realizing his true potential as a writer.  He certainly didn't with this one. Behind the awards and condescension of its champions this is just a mediocre book that's so so sooooooo long even a sucker for clumsily sprinkled erotica such as myself simply can't stand it 
 Image, a book about a famous artist, will all kinds of information, but ZERO pictures of either him or his paintings. Other Pollock books are better.  If you must have every book about this artist, ok, get it, but put it at the bottom of your wish list 
 My purchase of this book was based on Dave Ramsey's recommendation. While I thought the book was somewhat motivational and gave some useful ideas, it did not really deliver what perhaps I was expecting. My job search took a little over 48 days and I cannot say that I referred to the ook everyday during the search.  I believe that while it may be good for some who are geared to some occupations and have some particular skill sets, it is not for all. So, while I am sure it has sold many books, partially due to Mr. Ramsey's recommendation, it is clearly not the panacea that one might be searching for. You still must find a job based on what you have done in the past and convince a new employer that you can make him money. Or you must start your own business based on your abilities and desires. Mr. Miller's book may or may not be of assistance to you 
 This book was required for the DE classes at UTexas for a first/second year student, encountering DE's for the first time.  The book is very comprehensive in teaching all aspects of DE's.  However, the book is very dry and difficult to get through.  The worst thing is that is impossible to get through this book without some supplemental material.  For examples, the book uses proofs instead of examples that can be applied to the homework several times.  In addition the examples on countless occassions are like it can be shown through some simple calculations(which they won't show you)(it skips steps) that you can get to some other formula and you're like how did they do that?  In addition the notation/symbols they use are not defined all the time, and this leads to extra confusion when trying to learn something new.  Overall the examples are vague 
 Having enjoyed LOST IN TRANSLATION, I thought I might like this one, which seems to have some sort of cult reputation-- why I can't fathom. The entire plot is self-serving, shallow, and unrealistic. I guess it's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values, and while I don't condone those, the film lacks clear characters or any motivation. A lot of people have buttoned up parents who don't get it, and it doesn't mean they kill themselves-- because they were grounded!?  Since the writer-director gerw up in Hollywood, she may not be aware that you can't keep your kid home from school without a very good reason-- social workers and what not come after you. So the entire premise is false.  Romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it-- after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers-- could actually encourage the act. It's not caring, not real, and not responsible.  But I guess that wouldn't bother the rich, overfunded daughter of a Hollywood genius out to make a name for herself. 
 He even does examples with the crucifix!Don`t buy this book unless you go to martees church which is the pig farm 
 I thought this book was all over the place, but maybe that was because I only read it before I went to bed. There were flashbacks and flash forwards and I thought the author was trying to be overly clever.  None of the characters were really that interesting to me.  It was sad that Jean didn't really have any friends and to be so old and know practically no one.  Wow!  I hope I don't end up like that when I am her age.  How could a married couple go on for 30 or 40 years and never tell each other such basic things.  What a miserable life!  I am glad this book was short or I would have put it down sooner.  I am not sure if I would read any of her other books.  I do like the fact that it is set in North Carolina, which takes me back home.  I thought this was a boring book with little moral value for me.  It is probably because I couldn't relate to the characters because I just don't live my life in total isolation.  Others might get more out of it that have life experiences that mirror these characters 
 This book is very basic and very very standard stuff it makes me wish I could go back and change my review of Paul Vunaks "Anatomy of a Streetfight" and give him a higher score because he puts alot more useful info in his book. I really wasn't impressed by this book you would be better off buying Paul Vunak's book or even Diallo Frazier's "Revelations of a Warrior 
 This is a terrible book.  The translation juxtaposes English words that are presumably equivalents of the original Chinese ideograms.  The result is incomprehensible.  The English words appear to flow in gramatically  correct sentences but they make no sense.  The translator appears to have  no idea of what the I Ching is about or how it was used in Chinese culture.  Unfortunately, I bought this book and wasted my money 
 Why would a publisher ever agree to publish a book 40 years after other authors have published the same material? This book, 40 years after other writers on the subject, contains no new information, adds nothing to the history of historical events, and discloses nothing that hasn't already been known or already described in the same detail in other books! Save your time and read something else 
 I have never actually thrown a book across the room in frustration - and I love books, so this is drastic!  Spoilers ahead - please don't read on if you haven't read the book.  I managed to (somehow) get through the first book, 'Wideacre', which I disliked - whilst I adore the rest of Gregory's novels, so this was hard for me - and grit my teeth and tried to read this book, the sequel as I'd bought it and it looked more promising.  It was 'marginally better' as one reader put it, than the first, but a very depressing and frustrating book indeed.  I was getting very angry and frustrated after the second half of the book - as many other readers have highlighted, Julia's consistent inability to stand up to Richard made it impossible for me to like her anymore.  I quite honestly wanted to slap her to wake her up from that dreamy state she was in!  Because I wanted so much for Julia to be with James - who I liked a great deal.  I was so depressed after everything went wrong and she didn't marry him... ah, because I was expecting the usually very clever Ms Gregory to surprise me and have a twist at the end and say, aha!  She does get her true love in the end and she and Ralph get rid of Richard and although it's not happily ever after she learns to grow a backbone and be the very first female heir to Wideacre.  The rape scene with Julia and Richard was very violent and far too detailed and I think it may be difficult to stomach for anyone who has ever been in an abusive situation like that, in fact, for anyone at all.  I don't want to get into the tricky area of abortion too much, but I really did feel strongly that Julia should have gone to Ralph for help when she concieved the child with Richard.  This was a child of incest and rape - and she knew in her heart there should be no heir for Wideacre - they were all simply too inbred and it needed to end somewhere for nothing was going right.  Clean slate, so to speak.  Yet she gives the child away - then in her final letter asks James to find the child?!  What?!  And I was expecting perhaps a deformed child, after all this inbreeding (I mean this child is the product of parents who are brother and sister AND grandparents who are brother and sister!!!) but she was perfect and beautiful.  I was hoping the gypsies would keep her and she'd never be found again.. but alas, the Lacey madness will live on...  The perfect end to this book would have been a nice twist.  Gregory could have made her very good point about inheritance rights and the lack of power women of Beatrice and Julia's era had by Richard being killed by Ralph, then Julia inheriting the land - baby Sarah is adopted out to the gypsies and never seen again and Julia either lives as a widow and runs the land or (this would have been lovely - I bet all the girls have sighed over James a little, didn't you?  he was a little like the handsome romantic leads in Austen's books) James forgave her - for they had both made mistakes and Julia's was not intentional nor her fault (I was practically screaming at her that it wasn't her fault - and she gets it in the end, when it's too late!) and they marry and have 'normal' children - or perhaps none, they just learn from their mistakes and respect each other, and make a fresh start for Wideacre.  There were so many allies that Julia had - she was a sweet girl and I liked her - I wish that I could have shaken her though, I got so mad.  So many people in the village offered their help - this trap she was caught in with Richard could have been avoided - ahhh... SO frustrating.  I will not be reading the third book in the series.  I shall go back to reading Gregory's more historic novels (A Constant Princess is one I haven't read yet and it sounds excellent).  I wouldn't recommend this one 
 We absolutely loved "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs" (I highly recommend it) but this is nowhere near as good.  Most of the story is just rehashing the original book, with a little politically-correct "let's ship the extra food to the hungry" thrown in.  Lame 
 Cellulose Gel, Lactic Acid, Sucralose, Titanium Dioxide, Salt, Xanthan Gum, and Potassium Sorbate.....yum can't wait to get me some more titanium dioxide in me...how great does that sound! 
 Transferring the first album to my PC took roughly 5 hours. The second took 3.5 hours, the third about 2 hours and the fourth about 1.5 hours.  Learning the software interface took an inordinate amount of time, even though I've been an interface programmer.  After learning the software, it appears every album will cost about an hour to record, mark the songs, name the songs and write the songs as MP3. If I want to edit out song parts or eliminate pops/clicks, it will take longer.  It's really time consuming and the software doesn't make it simple or intuitive.  The turntable is of reasonable quality. It's just a regular turntable with a built-in pre-amp. You turn the pre-amp `on' when recording to your PC, turn if `off' if you want to use the turntable with your regular stereo 
 Eugene O'Neill's play "Long Day's Journey Into Night" is a Pulitzer award winning, autobiographical play about his family. I must admit that though Eugene O'Neill is considered by some to be the father of American Theater, I did not enjoy reading this play. The Tyrone family's insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read. I also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension O'Neill offered no conclusion. The day in the life of the Tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends. No happy ending, no hope for the future, just despair. "Long Day's Journey Into Night" is a wholly depressing read that I really could have done without. However, after learning more about Eugene O'Neill's background, and the extent to which the play is based on his life, I began to have a greater appreciation for this play. O'Neill did lead a very hard life, therefore the frustration and despair I felt while reading this play demonstrates O'Neill's talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner. While O'Neill's depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending, it was appropriate for the play as Eugene's own family never got a happy ending. I did like the clever way O'Neill showed the Tyrone family's desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue. At the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal, loving family. The audience soon however, gets the suspicion that something isn't quite right, and that the family is tense. Slowly the family's skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members, but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up. Thus showing that no matter how hard the Tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well, their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth. Although I still believe "Long Day's Journey Into Night" to be thoroughly disheartening to read, the reader's emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to O'Neill's exceptional writing.  
 I am very disappointed with this book.  I wanted a book to help me keep track of my daily intake of calories. Not pages and pages full of the author's opinions and tips on weight loss. A lot of the items listed are commercial food that by law have to carry nutrition info anyway. I am prefectly capable of reading a nutrition lable for calories, I don't need the added step of finding it in this book, which doesn't have a very good order of listing items in my opinion. Instead I recommend "The Doctors Pocket Calorie, Fat & Carbohydrate Counter: 2002 Edition, Plus 101 Fast Food Chains and Restaurants" and "The Complete and Up-to-Date Fat Book: A Guide to the Fat, Calories and Fat Percentages in Your Food" - both of which are available from amazon 
 Once "Let's Get Free" came out, it lauched a revolutionary group that was powerful in their lyrics and made you feel their whole message.  After damn near burning another whole in this disk, I picked up their mixtape.  It was alright but I was waiting for that 2nd full length album continuing from the debut album.  I bought this on the 1st day it was released and was highly disappointed.  Most of the beats sound the same.  The album length is entirely TOO short.  I would have given this 3 stars because the album content is not awful.  But Dead Prez loses a lot of credibility when on the SAME ALBUM you say "turn off the radio" and 5 tracks later you collaberate on a song with Mr. Radio himself, Jay-Z.  That loses a star right there.  Was this an attempt to appeal to the very radio stations that you constantly blast for not playing real hip-hop?  Well, I live in the major city of Philadelphia and I haven't heard about this song burning up the airwaves nor did I hear about it topping the Billboard music charts.  Great job, guys 
 When my house painter couldn't figure out how to use the nozzle, he somehow took apart the hose and lost one of the parts.  I looked everywhere on-line for a replacement part, but could not find anything.  Finally, I called Hozelock in New York and they sent me a replacement part.  They charged me about $6 for shipping a part that cost about $3.  The system can't be used with a regular sprayer or a regular sprinkler.  Also, it is hard to reel the hose in.  Overall, I don't think this item is worth the cost.  If you need to call Hozelock their number is 1-800-297-7461 
 The manufacturer could have easily glued the seams outside the envelope but the way they designed these Burlington envelopes scratches the cds as you slide them in and out. A poorly conceived product 
 Other than the chapter on the Driods, this book is not worth your time.  Better to read Kip Thorne.  How the author could have taken such interesting subjects and made them some uninteresting is somewhat amazing.   Don't read this 
 Look...to be fair, one man's BOTE is another man's "Manos". What I mean by that is some people may love this ep, but I personally didn't find it very funny and the movie is so bad that the sub-average riffing doesn't save it. The best lines that Mike & the robots make are when they speak for a character and add a line to something a person says. Unfortunately, the feature's horrible pacing, slow dialogue scenes, and atrocious acting are not enough, and it seems like the writers took a break on this one. Of course, even weak MST3K is better than pretty much any other show, but I must say this is certainly my least favorite episode from season 5 and at times feels like a Season 1 episode (the riffing is sparse and not really funny). If you are a newcomer and would like to see this show at it's best, get either "Manos: Hands of Fate" or "Red Zone Cuba" 
 The idea behind these bags is great - you can pump straight into the bag and store them. The execution, however, is lousy. Using twisties to seal the bags is cumbersome and annoying.  I prefer the Lansinoh bags with the double seal. Even though you can't pump straight into them, sealing them is quick and easy 
 If you want to illustrate to the whole world just what a dullard and complete clutz you are then take heed of this book.  What on earth were the ghost writers thinking, were they trying to write in true "Bush House" style.  If they were they have suceeded beyond their wildest dreams making the dear man look as if he needs what poor old Ronnie needed in the end.  24 hour care.  Who is keeping who 
     Perhaps it is because I get extremely bored when I read "stream of conscious" types of books. This book simply bored me to death. The technique is written in prose form, I respect it, to some degrees, it is a type of art. However, the backcover of this book did a poor job of explaining what this book was supposed to convey. Maybe it is because there's nothing to review about! All said, this book showed the heart of evil as well as violence through the bleak characters of Popeye, Gowan and Red. They kidnapped the promiscous girl named Temple and took her to Memphis, where we meet a even more feared underground criminal gangs and bootleggars.       Overall, I'm really disappointed in this book because I thought that William Faulkner, one of the best writers in the last century, should've done better. A lot of has to do with the style that he writes in, but overall, a very boring book. 
 The set contains four discs. They are 2-sided discs, which means that stories are on both sides of each disc. But the stories are not very good. When watching any one of the stories, one wishes that the story would hurry up and end. A few of the stories are interesting or even clever, but something seems to be missing or wrong.   What is it that is wrong? Lack of plot development. In all of the stories, a significant portion of the script is arbitrary and could easily have been edited away. The stories flounder about due to lack of direction and focus. What we find in most of the stories is characters moving from one room to another, then back to the first room, then to another room, then rushing back to the first room. Or what we find is walking out to the garage, then to an automobile, then back to the garage, then back to the automobile. Or running away from a road and over a hill, then over another hill, then running back to the road. Most of the Outer Limits stories use great quantities of time where the characters move from here to there, and back again, with no purpose, and little relevance to supporting the plot. And then there are the rubber masks. The Outer Limits series should properly be re-named, "Rubber Mask of the Week Show."   The Outer Limits stories are, in a word, mediocre. I tossed my four Outer Limits discs in the trash. Is there anything good that I can say about the Outer Limits discs? Yes! It was somewhat fun cracking each of the discs in half, ripping up the plastic case, and chucking them out.   If you want some good stories to watch, I would recommend buying a dozen or so of the Twilight Zone discs (especially volumes 2, 3, 8, 9, 11, 26, and 39). For people who like color TV shows, I would also recommend buying a season of the X-Files. For these interested in some early black and white science fiction movies, I would recommend the set discs containing most of the early Ray Harryhausen films. And then, of course, there is the classic The Day The Earth Stood Still. 
 Tony Buzan is not an expert in brain science, nor is he an originator.  This is evident in the "facts" he gives to explain how the brain/mind works.  The info given is old pseudoscience about the mind, adapted from the extreme views of Sperry, amongst other speculative writers of the 1970s.  But I know why Tony Buzan hasn't updated the information to include all the studies that show; mind mapping does not work to any significant level, it is not adopted to any significant level by students, it does not balance the brain any more than other types of note making, and it certainly does not make you smarter.    The reason for this persistent adherence to old and debunked pseudoscience, is that it sells books.  Some common mind myths include; You use less than 1% of your brain, the brain is seperated into specific left/right skills, creativity can be increased easily using simple techniques, and just imagining something will bring it to pass in reality.  These have all been debunked in the latter part of the 1970s.    The techniques given in the book are extremely limited in comparison with the strategies given in other less glitzy study method/ learning books.  That is good enough reason not to buy the book.  But the principles given that dictate the use of techniques are so nonsensical compared to more recent science, that they can only be thought of as sales pitch, or an effort to sell other books by the same author.  Mind mapping is a very feable technique compared to other graphic organizers (eg the concept map).  Speed reading is so misleading that it tends to result in very successful deception litigation.  They have both been debunked on several occasions.  Find a study method book that doesn't just stroke the ego.  Probably any book on study techniques will give better methods without setting you up for anticlimax.  G.Gladstone 
 Downloading objects from fan sites can be hit or miss -- I have had many collections I've downloaded work incorrectly or not work at all in the next expansion pack, and items I really liked were suddenly unavailable.  So, I was looking forward to a "Stuff" pack from Maxis.  Bah.  Yes, there are several very nice items, but really, this is an underwhelming collection on the whole.  Items are very limited and the collections are small.  The pictures you see on the cover are a good portion of what is contained.  Like so many here remarked, the money spent is not equal to the value received.  Another reviewer pointed out what the title "Glamour Life" implies -- jewelry, house items, luxurious textures for floors and walls, and clothing for all ages, and most of all, excess and abundance.  There's no abundance here.  I've found items I like, but I am not impressed with the collection.  Maxis knows that its target audience is always hungry for new items, and I think it is taking advantage of the fact, fooling us into thinking we are getting much more than we actually recieve for our money.  I feel a little cheated.  If you must have this, wait until the price drops, or -- better yet -- find a good, reputable fan site  (there are some very good ones out there that have safe downloads) and download for a small fee or for free 
 This cd sounds nothing like the true style and down home, groovy,funk of James Brown. Hip Hop music is not his style. Killing is out School is in, is about the best cut on the cd. His band which is the best in all the land is not heard or reconized. I recently attended his New Years Eve concert in Atlantic City, NJ Trump Marina, He turned the house out! Performed from 10:30 pm until 1:50 am. The Soul Brother is Truly The Hardest Working Man In Show Business (even at 69 years young 
 A. S. Byatt's work can be excellent. Her short stories are really marvelous, and "Possession" was a wonder - full of life and characters and plot. In the series that is capped by this novel, I continue to find "The Virgin in the Garden" an outstanding work and "Still Life" quite remarkable. However, "A Whistling Woman" is too large, it covers too many topics, too much history and too much science (done without any spirit) and too many stories. The period explored by the novel certainly encompassed all these things, but why did the novel try to do the same. Should not the novelist sift through and bring forth something that crystallizes the period, rather than load the reader with details and leave us wondering at the end why we plowed through such a "big" book only to find a clueless, pregnant Frederica. The work loses focus, flattens characters and in the end finishes rather lamely - dead characters either we hardly knew or from whom we expected more; live characters who have disappeared into clichs, and romances that even the author seems reluctant to accept. I have to admit, the energy of the 60s does seem to have ended in pregnant 70s girls in Laura Ashley dresses, but I do think that Byatt should have left this novel to sit for awhile, and come back to it after a little reflection, crafting a finer piece, which her readers deserve. Let's hope now that Byatt has the series behind her, she will be freed to write a more wonderful work 
 Despite trying very hard to deny that this is just another fad management book - there is nothing new in this title.  Clueless managers will recite the core principals of this book and treat them as gospel as they try to improve their bottom line.  It is also worth noting that at least one of the "great" organizations in the book, Fannie May, has imploded in an accounting scandal.  Not the worst fad management book ever written, but that isn't saying much 
 Sure, the information in this book is current if your potential agent is doing a life term in Sing Sing. But of the five queries I sent out based on the information in this book, two were just unanswered and three came back addressee unknown. Maybe I picked the only five bad addresses in the book, or maybe current it isn't 
 It's not clear to me what some of the other reviewers saw in this movie, or whether we even saw the same movie. A contrived story of revenge with a convoluted storyline, sex scenes with actors that must have been cheap at the time, and (admittedly a lot) of poorly shot violence make a poor mix. It looks really dated and just doesn't come together. Its music score seems to come straight from a 'Shaft' film, but 'Sex and Fury' is not half as funny. With so many excellent Japanese movies to chose from there is need to go there. Two stars is generous 
 this backpack was very uncomfortable. the inserts are stiff. it doesn't represent canon quality (I hope) 
 This book offers little more to the reader than a collection of full color photos of various forms of body art.  It is nice to look at, but the content is very biased and non-scholarly.  The author oftens voices his  opinion about what is 'acceptable' or 'attractive', and questions people  who use body modification to "take things too far".  There IS a  wide variety of body modification discussed and shown in the book, however,  the author often repeats things he had previously stated in the book,  making for very little content of value.  Overall, not one of the better  books on the subject.  Check out Bodies of Subversion by Margot Mifflin, or  The Art of the Tattoo by Ferguson & Procter for better histories of  tattooing, as well as any Modern Primatives issues 
 I don't think that this is a CD that I need to buy. Okay, I will start off by saying that I have heard all the songs on here, and I still think that it is horrible. I am an openminded person, and will give any music a try, so when I heard several recommendations for this CD I borrowed it from a friend. I hated it the first time. The second time I despised it, and gave it a third try, but couldn't get half way through. I mean, the best part about metal bands like this are the good guitar playing and usually pretty good instrumentals. I heard nothing go right and everything go wrong when I heard this. It seemed like the organization of the music is terribly off, and the instrumentals are very poorly written. This is not a good band at all. I think that they have minimal talent and they should just stop. Wait, I forgot the vocals and the lyrics, didn't I? Well, in short, they are worse than the instrumentals. The singing is just terrible and I cannot stand that constant groaning and screaming gets really annoying. The lyrics are  "thoughtful" I have heard people say? Firstly I can't understand them, then I look them up and I read them and find I wasn't missing much. If you want some real metal, check out Metallica (older CDs), Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, and many others. 
 I have read this book through and through, and I have read the brief review pannning the book and the response by the author, Eugene Taylor. I had two reactions: First, I found the author's "rebuttal" rather  spooky. It was a mean-spirited response, not at all polite or -- dare I say  -- spiritually enlightened, although the author hints at his own ability to  see into the great beyond and to know more than the rest of us who are not  blessed with such . . . experiences. He is apparently thin-skinned, and  perhaps, after I read this book, I now see that he has reason to be. Which  brings me to my second point, my review of the book: I found myself in  total agreement with the reviewer from Lincoln, Mass. I'm sorry to say  this, but the book is boring. And repetitive. And offers a thesis that is  not very original at all. I have read many books on the history of New Age  spirituality, and this is just so-so 
 This is a Vocal Selections book, not the Vocal Score (as is clear from the large photo of the cover) 
 Nothing new, and no new information in this book. It's basically just common sense stuff that most women know already. There was nothing earth shattering - and it's also kind of disjointed on topics (ie- chapter is about "x" and then they bring in letters from women that are totally unrelated. It's a waste of money 
 About the only thing I wanted to do after seeing this was demand my money back. This has to be one of the most unimaginative plays I have ever seen. It reminded me of a really bad Saturday night live parody meets Friday part 2 but at the end the writer tried to make it poingnant by adding a death. I don't know why this was even printed. If I was a tree that lost my life to print this play I would come back as a ghost a haunt the publisher till his dying day 
 Reminds me of one of those baseball books with statistics but not much else.  The stories are short and typically discuss one or two hands at most.  If you want history it may have value but it will not improve your play 
 I love the idea behind this game and it's pretty impressively exectuted. I had three gripes though: 1) It's so fast paced that I found it really difficult to progress past the third procedure. 2)I couldn't get the magnify and reduce (with quick little circles) to work.  This caused me great frustration. 3)There's no way to skip through the seemingly endless pages of character dialogue if you have to repeat a procedure a couple of times. I quit playing it pretty quickly 
 This book is next to useless in helping students to understand fallacies and identify them.  It is probably the poorest instructional material I have encountered in all of my years in college. Humor was incorporated into this text in an effort to help students better understand the material, however, that effort is a big failure when it comes to this student, and probably also for many others.   Instead of helping, the humor detracts from the instructional value of the material and distracts the student rather than helping him or her to comprehend. Chapters 4, 5 and 6 deal with rhetoric and fallacies, however, I have found those three chapters to be the most incomprehensible and unhelpful chapters in the entire book.  I am glad I got a used copy of this book... it is certainly NOT worth the price tag placed on a new copy 
 I was very disappointed - there was no humor in any of these stories.  There was not one character that was balanced or that I could even like.  Italians are affectionate and they laugh at family gatherings - there was no warmth or laughter in this book 
 I'd have to say this is pretty tedious stuff. I searched and searched in vain for some spark of greatness, but it simply isn't there. Many of the comments from other reviewers about the twists and turns of the plot, and the depth of Eco's knowledge are probably accurate. However these alone do not make great writing.   If I am honest I'd have to say that this is fairly badly written. It is barely coherent in places and, at the end, I am not entirely sure what the point of the novel was. Unless the point was to peer inside the mindset of a provincial Italian from a few centuries ago. However is that kind of subject matter worth an entire novel?  As noted much of the fanfare seems to surround Eco's evident knowledge base, but this has not been put to good use in this attempt. The character seems very cartoonish at times, and the style of writing (jumping from past to present amongst other things) is clunky.  If this were not attached to a great name I reckon we'd see many more negative comments and, indeed, it is so bad I doubt it would have been considered worthy of publishing 
 Female artists used to make GOOD music, for proof get some Joni Mitchell, Pretenders (lead singer Chrissie Hynde is a woman), Aretha Franklin or Supremes. But these days, it's a joke, just an excuse for the woman in question to make her music "sexy". However, these pop stars fail miserably, because they exaggerate it so badly. Compare it to Chrissie Hynde. She was tough, independant, and respectable. Sex worked into her lyrics, sure, but it wasn't her entire persona, she didn't devote her music to selling her sexuality. Jessica Simpson, and most other female artists today, do. More proof that music has been dead since Kurt Cobain killed himself 
 After having read Baldacci's "Camel Club" this one came as an utter disapointment.... the book starts off describing the assasination of a US senator and how the lead secret service agent in charge of his protection ended up out of the service and discredited for having lost his charge.... sounds like an interseting way to start the book; the main problem is Baldacci never takes the time to introduce any of the characters.... after a while i couldnt keep reading the book because i felt i didnt care for the characters enough... i didnt really care to know what happened next to them since i didnt really "know" any of them... it was like reading a newspaper article.... a way too long newspaper article.. 
 This book provides no details to show you how to snare a millionaire.  It shows you how to get a man or how to keep a relationship going; but no suggestion as how to get a rich and good looking guy of your dreams.  The authour may have dated a lot of guys with money; but if she could not get a rich guy for herself then why you want to listen to her advise on this subject matter?  
 First let me say I'm a Steinbeck fan.  I love the majority of his work. Also, I'm writing this review before I do research on this book.  I have just finished reading it, so my opinion is fresh and mine only.  It has not been influenced by what others think.  I do plan on reading a great many summaries and opinions from great thinkers to try and find out why people generally think this is such a great book. I like Steinbecks ability to demonstrate the human spirit in this book.  What I do not like about this book is that it starts off with bad things happening to folks and it just goes downhill for these folks all the way, getting worse off the whole time, till the end when they are as bad off as they can get.  People dying left & right, thrown in jail, everyone who already lives in California are mean, pregnant woman can't get enough food, kids starve, no more work for three months, river floods, baby dies, etc.  This is the most depressing book I think I've ever read.  And where is the plot?  There isn't one.  This book could have been written in one chapter, but John drags us through this misery over and over again, round and round.  This book is a statement, that's for sure.  Maybe everyone thinks it's so great because it is a great statement.  I do believe that later in John's life he regretted writing this book, or at least wished that he had written it differently.  I have read online that this book is still banned in certain places of this country.  That is wrong.  I don't feel that way.  I don't like the book, but I think anyone that wants to read it should be able to read it (I warn you it's depressing and a waste of time!) It's not the politics of this book that I don't like. To me, there were no surprises.  None.  Not like "Of Mice And Men" or "East Of Eden" or other fine books I've read by Steinbeck.  Still, if your a Steinbeck fan, you must read this book.  If you've read his bio you must read "Grapes Of Wrath" to understand why Californians hated him so much.  In a way I feel I have to apologize for not liking this book.  One friend of mine who is an avid reader told me he didn't really care for Steinbeck novels, but he loved "Grapes Of Wrath".  Go figure 
 Anyone who's read this book, or is considering doing so, should consider what has come to light about Judith Miller's reporting in the build-up to the Iraq war (simply do a search on google for "Judith Miller" - see, in particular, the articles in Slate). Miller was regularly writing front page columns for the New York Times which contained sensational claims (now known to be wildly inaccurate) about Iraq's possession - or efforts to obtain - WMDs. One telling detail to the quality of Miller's reporting can be gleaned from her concession in May of 2003 that the now-discredited Ahmed Chalabi provided most of the scoops (aka lies) for her front page stories on WMDs.   Based on the sheer extent of errors in her pre-war reporting, I think readers of Miller's work need to utilize a heightened degree of skepticism when assessing her claims. 
 From the remarks at this site, people either love this novel or hate it. I hated it. I hated it for the reason that it represents all that is bad about MFA program writing in the last 30 years. The emphasis is entirely on STYLE. Forget story. Forget that your reader needs some reason to be reading the narrative. Just throw out and string together wonderful language and the reader will follow you anywhere. Some of this thinking goes back to Henry James, some of it goes back to Virginia Woolf who was so terrified of books with plots or dominating conceits (like H.G. Wells' THE TIME MACHINE). The first 100 pages of this novel are about a real estate deal and the people to whom Frank Bascombe is trying to sell a property. It's brilliantly written. In fact, it's so brilliantly written that I had a lot of problems seeing a former sportswriter being so introspective and articulate about his life, his loves, and the region of the country he inhabits. This book has no driving plot. In fact, it's an arbitrarily chosen conceit: what happens on July 4th in the life of one guy. It's not James Joyce's ULYSSES nor is it trying to be, but EVERY thought this man has is in this book. And none of it is related to a plot or story or any reason whatever why a person--any perso--should pick up the book.   Indeed, that seems to be the crux. I read this book because it was by Richard Ford, a man whom all of my colleagues in the mainstream fiction world revere. You must read this book, they said. So I did. And I consider it an extraordinary waste of my time. To be sure, this is a judgment call, but I'm allowed to make it. EVERY reader is allowed to make that call. But I know I'm in the minority in this. This book is supposed to be one of the greatest American novels of the last 25 years. But will it be so in another 25 years? Are novels now only to be interior monologues (which Virginia Woolf preferred and said so in her essay "Modern Fiction")?   Perhaps our values are changing. Perhaps the MFA programs in this country are correct in only cultivating style rather than story. But what it eventually evolves into is a form of narcissism, wherein the author writes at length, putting on the page all of his or her thoughts about whatever and we're supposed to . . . what? Applaud it?   I believe that the authors we'll remember will be the natural storytellers. I don't think Richard Ford is one of them. But, man, he sure can write 
 I thought the movie was alright, but I am sorry that I bought it.  I would rather have just rented it.  It seems like half of the movie is out of focus, I am sure it is on purpose but I just don't get it.  There are a few erotic scenes but they are not worth the price 
  Reading this book is like watching Iron Eagle or Top Gun, I think we are a little over the 80s, this book is intended for people that definitively likes that hollywood accuracy to depict stories.    I guess this wasn't what I was looking, maybe it's a good book for someone who doesn't know much about  the military.  For my part I was looking to track the path of the F-16 Pilot training and many other details. I'm a very avid fan of the viper and I have been fortunate to see vipers from 4 different countries.     All have to say that I am still looking for such book. I'm really not very interested in knowing too much about partying and rituals. And being myself in the military I know that it's a very small part of the whole picture.       
 I love the shows, but a favorites DVD with only three episodes?  I couldn't believe it.  The three shows would get 5 stars, but the great ones that are missing bring my review down to 2 stars 
 I slogged to the end of this book, hoping for some nugget of goodness to redeem it. It never came.  The most glaring problem, among many, is the fact that the South African villains are so cartoonishly evil. Other than delivering AK-47s, they serve only as a miraculous way to sway all the pro-slavery political leaders toward abolition. So the thing feels more like a fairly tale than a serious "what if?".  Many have commended the opening chapters' battle scenes, but it's not as though the world needed a novel to explore what war would be like if massed infantry charged automatic weapons.  There was obviously a lot of painstaking research done on various Civil War units and soldiers, but the silly plot and weak, weak characterizations detract too much 
 This mag is for people who think they are computer experts because they can change out a video card or follow directions on changing an OS setting.  Shallow coverage, and some of the lamest humor you will ever come across.  It is nothing more then a rehash of what is freely and easily available on the internet. There is nothing original in this mag, ever. Also it tends to copy and paste much of the issue from 12 months earlier. All the main articles are nearly the same every 12 months. Don't believe me? Take two magazines that are 12 months apart and compare them.  The reviews are also weak. nearly every month you will see: THE FASTEST SYSTEM WE EVER TESTED!!!!! YAAAAAWWWWWWNNNNN. Who cares? Anyone who knows even the slightest about computers knows that speed is not the most important attribute, even for gamers. Besides, does it really matter that system y is .00005% faster on their poor testing system then computer z?  The second star is for Mr Halfhills column. It is the only part that is consistantly interesting and the only person there with real technical know-how.  Read toms hardware and whatever tech news you want, learn how to use search engines, and skip this pointless mag 
 About 8 months ago, during a very bad "flu-experience", I had a great afternoon reading all the negative reviews on 'The Alchemist' and this little gem. And although I was warned, I just HAD to find out for myself (some stubborn people just never learn, do they): could this book really be as awful as these reviewers said it is? And the answer is YES.   The story is utterly predictable and boring. The characters and plotline are as thin as the paper this book is printed on. As a writer, Coelho totally lacks a sense of humour.   To top it all, Coelho has added a few 'exercises', to help the reader with his/her own spiritual development. Perhaps the most stupid one of them all was to pour some water on a non-water-absorbing flat surface (e.g. a table top), and to dabble about with your fingers in this self-created puddle. I can't even remember what Coelho claimed the effect would be, but it would be a very deep, spiritual and revealing experience. If this appeals to you, please buy as many of his books as you like. You will probably love them. If, like me, just the thought of doing this silly exercise makes you laugh (or cry, depending on your mood), please stay away from this author. His books are just as deep and spiritual and revealing as this puddle.      
 This is the second batch I ordered. I have had to contact representatives at BrucePac both times to complain about the quality of the product and they have kindly send me replacement jerky. I have enjoyed the same World Kitchen Jerky from other vendors so I cannot understand why the order from Amazon has been such a disappointment. 
 I was hoping for something much more layman in explaining the great quantum physics. It is not an easy read. I have found other books that were more easy to read on the subject 
 I really wanted to like this CD, but I found it to be nearly unplayable. Burke's vocals are fine - but the production! I don't know how it got out of the studio with that mix - it's muddy and the background singers and band sound as veiled and muted as though I were hearing them through a closed door. The first time I played it I felt the disc had to be defectve - I cleaned and replayed it all the way through and came to the conclusion it was just a lousy production.  I didn't play it for another 6 to 8 weeks thinking for some reason I would "come around" but, alas, I ended up trading it in on another CD at a local retailer.  Too bad 
 the neighbor has a yapping mutt that barks night and day...since the police won't do anything about it, i bought this bark free...hahaha...what a joke...the darn dog barked more...  anyway...it did zero for my problem and i consider it a waste of money...  
 We bought this at suggestion of our dentist.  However, it is difficult to use, extremely messy and the on/off button on handle is difficult to press.  We used it a couple of times but have not used it since because of messiness and inconvenience.  Our neighbors bought the same model, tried to use it a few times and have not tried to use it since for the same reasons we gave.  Save your money and go back to flossing! 
 If you're made to buy this book you have every right to hate the professor that makes you do so. This book is a punishment! Not only is it very expensive, but it also offers information that it is not relevant to the real world at all.  There are some positive sides in this book after all. There are quick references on almost every page to make it easier to follow the chapter; there are good graphs the explanations to the graphs as well as the general argument do fit (more or less). There are also case studies, a fairly solid web page, and self-assessment questions that are helpful to get through with this material.  However, the style is unnecessarily pompous, filled with theories that make no or only very little sense; the information presented is way to shallow to really understand what the authors are getting at, yet miraculously they manage to fill the book with more than 500 pages with endless waffle. In some places, the author's even contradict themselves, which is the most impressive thing about this book.  Generally only two stars are awarded for this book, as it really is a waste of money and time, however if you have to read this insult for any intellectual mind, you will find some help to make nonsense into a science. Good luck to you! 
 After less than 1 year, I bought an oven thermometer to find out why the oven was cooking so slowly.  After 45 minutes set at 450 degrees, it only reached 200 degrees.  Consumer service is a joke, unless you like listening to a computer.  I never could reach a human at Toastmaster/Salton. The elements come on, nice and red, but no heat 
 What kind of alternate Universe book takes you back to the regular Universe storyline?  The point of an alternate universe tale should be to tell a story outside of the regular series canon.  There is no point in reading this story because it doesn't change anything.  The plot reads like outtakes from the script sessions and the characters are badly drawn. A waste of time 
 The Lando Calrissian Adventures (1983.) A collection of three short Lando Calrissian stories, written by L. Neil Smith in 1983.   INTRODUCTION:  The Empire Strikes Back introduced a classic character into the Star Wars universe - Lando Calrissian. Although Lando got a bad rap from fans at first for selling out Han Solo in Empire, he redeemed himself in Return Of The Jedi, assisting in the destruction of the second Death Star. However, like many Star Wars characters, Lando's past remained a great deal mysterious. To try to clear up some details about Lando's past prior to his movie experiences, L. Neil Smith wrote three short stores in 1983. And in recent years, those stories were combined into a book entitled The Lando Calrissian Adventures. Are Lando's past exploits some of the finest Star Wars stories around, or are they the black sheep of the Star Wars Expanded Universe? To find out, continue reading.   OVERVIEW:  Essentially, these stories follow a young Lando Calrissian, back before he lost the Millennium Falcon to a younger Han Solo in that fateful Sabacc game. Through an odd twist of fate and the threats of outside authorities, Calrissian is forced to go on a quest to a distant world to retrieve an ancient artifact with incredible powers. Along the way, he encounters strange locales and even stranger natives. The latter two stories expand on the events told in the first.   REVIEW:  Ugh... This is, without question, THE WORST STAR WARS EXPANDED UNIVERSE NOVEL I HAVE EVER READ. You'll notice I rarely give less than three stars to Star Wars novels, so to get two stars, Smith really must have screwed up. Sure enough, he did. These stories are just plain WEIRD. They don't even feel like Star Wars stories, and in many cases, it seems that Lando has a totally different personality than the guy we knew and loved in the movies. The stories are bizzare and drag on for far too long. Usually I can't put down a Star Wars novel, but had to FORCE myself to read this one. Every Star Wars novel I have read that existed prior to 1991's Heir To The Empire that isn't a movie adaptation is NOT worthwhile. But even Splinter Of The Mind's Eye, Alan Dean Foster's awkward story from 1978, kills The Lando Calrissian Adventures dead. I can not recommend this novel to anyone, except for those trying to read every last Star Wars novel - and even THEY should consider avoiding this one.   EDITION NOTES:  This book has been reissued a few times over the years, and it is still readily available in nearly all bookstores. If you want to read it (not sure why you would, though), it shouldn't be too tough to find. And if you can't find it in stores, there are plenty of online stores that carry it.   OVERALL:  The Lando Calrissian Adventures fails like no other Star Wars novel before or after has failed. L. Neil Smith takes the galaxy far, far away to new lows with these pathetic excuses for adventures. Of course, I have to cut him some slack since this WAS 1983, and the Expanded Universe hadn't really taken off yet. That's why he gets a sympathy star in my rating. My final verdict is simple - avoid this book like the plague. Even die-hard Lando fans are bound to be disappointed. If you're interested in a young Lando, read A.C. Crispin's Han Solo trilogy. He appears in those stories, and in much better ways, too. So just buy them instead. 
 The reason for the low rating is the lack of any subtitles on the boxset and Amazon's mistake in the product description. Folks, all seasons of this series are shipped in DVDs with no subtitles and no closed-caption. 
 Of all the hateful self-centered characters and idiotic plot lines in this movie, the one I found most offensive was the one involving Emilio Estevez/Andie MacDowell.  Isn't stalking hilarious?  And isn't Kirby the cutest obsessed stalker you've ever seen?  I bet stalking victims everywhere wish their stalker was a lovable as little Kirby.  I also loved at the end when Ally Sheedy tells Andrew McCarthy and Judd Nelson that she just wants them "all to be friends".  To which they both reply the classic cinema line, "Ehhhh... ok."  Wow.  Now that's drama. 
 Koch is the author of one of the most interesting books of modern criticism, STARGAZER, one of the first books to take Andy Warhol seriously, so in my book he may be forgiven many sins, but THE BREAKING POINT is pretty bad.  As history, who knows?  I can't believe all the things he dishes out about the power of the Politburo to enforce the Popular Front and its supposed hegemony of US culture.  And his condemnation of the filmmakers who made THE SPANISH EARTH is just unpleasant.  Ivens was no Soviet agent, he was a committed documentarian.  (That's not to say that THE SPANISH EARTH isn't a boring piece of schlock.)  What sets Koch apart from other writers, however, is his incessant banality as a writer, as a stylist.  He is incapable of writing a single sentence without committing some go for broke solecism.  He will set your teeth on edge from page one, right from the moment you discover that he plans to refer to his two protagonists as "Hem" and "Dos" all through the text, thus stripping them even of the dignity of their names.  (Martha Gellhorn becomes "the Girl.")  His rib poking gets painful around page 9 or 10.  Yes, Dos Passos is great, but not for the reasons Koch cites.  And despite what Koch asserts, without argument, TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT and THE FIFTH COLUMN are not bad books.  They are indeed among the most interesting US novels and plays of the last century.  Koch is like a novelist attempting to enliven history with a novelist's little tricks, gleaned from the WRITERS DIGEST.  Get right in there, focus on your characters, make them quirky, show what they're drinking and wearing.  Imagine their thoughts.  Tell us what they're thinking.  Make one an angel, the other a devil, that way the reader will be able to distinguish them.  Well, I loved STARGAZER but this one's for the birds 
 The quality of the pictures need significant improvement. As an artist you need all possible details for the best results 
 I ordered this book but didn't notice that it was an E-Book. How can they charge the same price for an E-Book? Personally, I think the Acrobat Reader sucks when compared to a real paperback or regular old HTML. Anyway, I figured I'd try to download it since I'd placed the order. WOW, there is Adobe DRM and MS Passport to deal with. Way too much trouble, I just called Amazon and cancelled the order. Maybe the content of the book is OK, I don't know. If I were an author I don't think I'd let them offer my books in PDF form just yet 
 I have studied a number of languages and used a number of text books for this purpose. This book is almost certainly the worst. It is nearly useless to anyone who does not have a strong background in linguistics and comparative grammatical theory. Hogg somehow manages to obfuscate the explanations of even the simplest grammatical concepts 
 This book has some good design/engineering information but is both over priced and out of date.  I recommend you check it out of your public library to look at it before buying it 
 Gail's writing is again wonderful in this in book, but I found the book disappointing due to a lack of closure. I felt the book led you up to a particular point in the life of the character's and then left you wondering in the end what the message was meant to be. I almost felt as if the writer wasn't brave enough enough to tell you the ending to a tragic, yet hopeful story. I can only compare this book to the Samurai's Garden since I haven't read a third book by this author yet, and I loved the Samari's Garden! So I was surprised that this book lacked closure at the end. I am not sorry that I read this book due to the fact that I enjoy the author's style of writing 
 In a land where the cops have to run away from gun toting street gangs because the so-called law won't let them do anything about the problem, how can you consider the government anything but extraordinarily liberal (read socialist)?   If our nation's government today, or in the 1980s, had any hint of fascism in it, why does it, and why did it, encourage immigration from third world nations en masse?   And, of course, one must wonder how a nation whose foreign policy is so often determined...err...influenced by the State of Israel can be anything like a fascist dictatorship. Surely AIPAC, not to mention the SPLC/ADL/ACLU, haven't allowed us to stray from their chosen (socialist) path? 
 From the tone of Dr. Seger's book on web-thinking, one comes away with the humorous impression that she believes she personally invented the entire concept of networking.  What could have been a helpful text is written instead as a look-at-everything-I've-done account that falls short of enlightening or inspiring women professionals who are serious about making the right connections in the film industry or anywhere else. Much of this, unfortunately, is due to a voice that borders on condescension and implies her readers wouldn't recognize common sense if it jumped up and bit them.  This was a disappointment in light of her prior releases regarding women in the movie biz.  By comparison, there are just better business-oriented resources available out there if networking is something that readers want to hone in order to advance in their professions.  It is also essentially a rehash of some of her earlier books which were more persuasive and practical in their focus.  I came away from this one wondering what the point of all of it was 
 I love Holt McCallany, so anything he has done will naturally catch my attention. He is the lead in this movie, which is pleasant enough to watch, despite not being particularly extraordinary. The story is simple and a bit predictable, but the acting is decent and if you are a Holt McCallany fan like I am, you will love him in this one, especially the way he looks: absolutely sexy! 
 Spong refuses to realize that God doesn't change, Scripture doesn't change, and therefore the Church shouldn't change.  To call the Church "anachronistic" for its attitudes on sexuality is to punt away the truth.  Granted, there have been abuses fo power by the church in many instances in areas such as these, and these are to be addressed and fixed, but to completely reevaluate, as Spong endorses, the Church's approach to how it stands in the face of modernity is to bow down to modernity as to an idol.  I hope and pray that Spong comes to a saving knowlege of Jesus Christ someday, and abandons the liberal nonsense that he worships in the place of the God he claims to serve 
 Yea I agree, these are the artists that give hiphop a bad name, if you could even call these guys artists. This album is strictly made for clubs, and for BET and MTV watchers and mainstream listeners. This is radio music, and stuff you would hear in the clubs. Thats all this music is good for. It has no creativity. The production on this album isnt bad, but lyrics, come on, you cant call these lyrics. I suggest you pass this album up unless your a mainstream listener. No top 5 for this album 
 I was completely disappointed in the size of this book. The city guide of Possum Trot, Kentucky has to be bigger then this. Measuring in at a hefty 3&1/2" tall, its no Abe Lincoln. It was more like something you find in a CrackerJack box 
 I'm a thirteen year old cutter, yeah i admit it whatever. anyway i've taken to drinking too but for a teacher to let you off the hook because your a good student? gimme a break! teachers get fired and wouldn't cover for a student even if they did like them. I' ve never taken drugs but why were they the only ones doing it? I mean there are more potheads than just two per school. What i didn't like was how stoehr went about the cutting in her story. At one point she says " i could stop anytime i wanted to i just don't" or something like that. But cutting is just as bad as being addicted to pot you can't give it up easily. That's whats so bad about it. I've tried to stop so many times and i don't want professional help but see i try but i never completely get rid of it. That point in the book was what threw me off, That's what i didn't like about it. The book didn't seem like she had researched about what she was writting. I just didn't like it 
 I'm an MBA student in a top5 business school in the US, and we use this as our textbook for the basic stats course. I've only read the first 5 chapters so far, and I've found this book to be one of the worst textbooks I've seen since college. Some very simple concepts are explained in very confused (and confusing) language, the text is very arid and skips over most of the conceptual subtleties or fallacies that the unsuspecting user of statistical data may easily fall victim to. I strongly suggest leafing through it before deciding whether to buy it (you can start with chapter 2, which is pretty typical of the tone of the book and, being the 1st "substantial" chapter of the book, doesn't assume knowledge of concepts defined in previous chapters). 
 i felt as if this book was way below my reading leve 
 Any book that claims to fit real people has to address the issue of fitting pants, particularly for women since we are still stuck with designs based on men's pants.  While these authors have written a separate book in this series specifically for fitting pants, "Pants for Real People", this current book is sadly mis-titled and needs to clearly state that it does NOT address pants.  As 5'10" woman with a long lower torso and a sway back, fitting pants is difficult to say the least.  For an all-encompassing book that addresses fitting issue, see Singer Sewing's "Perfect Fit", which has lots of pictures, clear directions for both major and minor alterations, before and after shots, and deals with all subjects.  For a book specifically for fitting pants, I recommend Singers "Pants that Fit".  I own both and use both regularly 
 The talmudic writers are very clever in introducing their babylonian pagan beliefs and claiming they are Jewish.  Hashem gave Torah to Moshe and told him to write everything down.  Torah was to be read yearly to the congregation so they could understand G-d's law.  Now the rabbis are claiming that the people are too stupid to understand what G-d said they could understand.  This is the very same thing that goes on in the pagan catholic "church".  Read the Tanakh for yourself and ask HaShem to reveal HIS truth to you - unadulterated by the rabbis and their poisonous lies 
 The sweet taste was excessive and unpleasant.  I thought it was not fresh tasting.  The picture is deceiving because each fruit is cut in half and you get the top half only.  Other Marzipan is the entire round shape of the fruit. I am glad that I only bought the small size since I ended up throwing this purchase in the trash 
 This is not a satire of Candide, it's not a slice of pop culture. It's a dirty old man's idea of what sex should be like. A dirty old virgin man.   It's boring. The writing is atrocious. It has several rapes and incest scenes in it. It has no more than one instance of a woman enjoying sex (and I can't be sure about that one) with sex on nearly every page. It is racist and sexist and boring. If you want 80 variations on what to call a woman's sexual organs, this is the book for you (honey pot, lamb-pit, sugar scoop, ever-sweeting, etc). If you want a book indicitive of the culture of the time, or just plain full of sex, please look elsewhere 
 We were very disappointed with the musical quality of the CD.  The artist's command of pitch was lacking 
 Except for the beautiful reproductions of some of the finest Hollywood portraits, the book is a major disappointment.  The cover of the book clearly states "classic shots and how to take them," but the authors' feeble attempt at presenting the lighting setups, at least half of which are totally erroneous, is only remotely informative.  Christopher Nisperos, a portrait photographer, includes no recreations of any of the images in the book, which is suggestive in itself, and shares no technical information of any substance.  There is no discussion of types of lights used by the photographers in any of the discriptions which would have been fascinating and the lighting diagrams suggest working distances for various lights that are at best misleading.   All in all the book is a very superficial look at the creation of Hollywood "style" portrais and will prove of only very limited value to the aspiring portrait photographer 
 ...the bullet before compromising Michael Caine into this. But, what else could you expect from trash made for TV (sorry for the redundancy) 
 I must admit. I am not Kings biggest fan. I like the way he writes characters, but for years, I haven't been able to put my finger on why I don't like his books. After reading The Colorado Kid, I realized what it was. King is a lazy writer. He can tell a good story, but he doesn't follow through. His typical way out of a jamb is to make some inanimate object talk. Bleh. You can tell when he is done with a story. It just ends.  This book is no exception. The story rambles through the mouth of a clichï¿½d old time reporter teaching a young'un the ropes. King tells the story, he doesn't show it. I kept waiting for the narrative to stop and for the action to begin, but it never did.  And the ending! Someone, his editor, agent, family or friends, tell Mr. King that mysteries are supposed to be resolved. He doesn't resolve this mystery. That was the only reason, other than the fact that I had a 7 hour flight and nothing else to do, that kept me reading. I got to the end and I swear I almost tossed the book while on the plane. There is an after word trying to justify his ending. I didn't get past the first sentence. Authors don't write justifications for their books unless they know they are guilty of something.  If I could take away all the stars on this book, I would. Even one star is one too many. 
 Let's revamp this review.  This album sounds like Weezer with a little bit of a temper and a slightly hard edge.  It really does.  I don't see how this music is considered heavy or hard music really.  The singer is somewhat whiny and irritating while the music is as equally interesting.  The song diversity is rather absent through the whole album and everything has a monotone feel to it.  I wouldn't recommend this album for this band to anyone unless if they were looking for something slightly harder to listen to, and they were fans of emo looking for some darker emo.  There is better music out there, YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK FOR IT 
 The Body in Pain includes many interesting ideas and theories that could be made into engrossing analyses, yet Elaine Scarry manages to even make torture boring.  Her frankly very intelligent observations would be much better suited to a 20 page scholarly essay than a 300 plus page repetitive rant that seems to care more about displaying her verbal acuity than proving a point, let alone attracting readers.  I have counted the number of times she uses the word "sentient" and "sentience": some pages  include these terms more than 8 times.  One would think that an author so obviously bent on proving her intelligence would deign to consult a thesaurus.  Perhaps "feeling" is too plebeian a term  for her... 
 All the characters in this book were shallow, selfish and boring. The writing was good but I could not relate to nor sympathize with any of the characters 
 tis is teh bestband ever1111 im so turtuerd and in soooo much pain my parents wont let me have my bike for cristmas and my girlfeeriend broke up wit meh i hate myself and i wont to slit my rists and cry to sleep in my own self endurin g pain .

 As has already been mentioned --- the author makes numerous assumptions, but offers no proof, because he apparently feels that facts and figures are not required in a holocaust book. Mr. Dean should not set himself above truthful and honest approach to a touchy subject 
 I bought this item along with the bookcase and nightstand for my 8 year old.  It has made me rethink ever buying furniture that needs to be assembled again.  I spent my whole Sunday putting the thing together.  The knobs come apart very easily I have lost 4 so far.  I will just replace them they look cheap anyway.  You can see the metal casing through the glass.  You definately get what you pay for it is a cute dresser but its not worth the aggrevation.  The nightstand was a breeze and the bookshelf was better.  Plan about 4 hours for this project and expect to be disappointed.  
 Most first novels really are not that great but usually when an author produces a sequal there is a definate improvement but I found no such improvement when trying to read this one.  I figured I owed the author a second chance by reading his second novel.   What can I say, for all the hype, this book is typical of many published this day by members of the self styled 'Creative Class'. Politically Correct. As subtle as a Hammer. As narrow minded as the generation that the author condemns except far less productive and much less imaginative. Hardly any good.   Truth is I found it rather juvenile. In my my mind I found myself editing out the excess wordage. Perhaps half could be deleted without effecting the story. There really isn't much here.  Indeed It isn't a good story. No challenge to the reader at all. Blow away the baddies with modern super technology which to make it sporting the baddies are allowed to have some of.    It has all the defects of the first book compounded.   Toss it. 
 I bought this book online without seeing it based on the online reviews.  However, I was disappointed with the recipes, most of which did not seem very appealing.  
 This book has big fonts, many screenshots and not many pages. Yet it goes about its subject matter very slooowly. Verbose and lack of clear concept explanation is abundant. For example, the authors need about 7 lines to explain to us how to pronounce "tuple". And this in such a short book.   Simple but tricky issues like calculation of weighted averages are ignored. Because of the verbose, basic topics are only treated very late in the book. For example, calculated measures are only treated in page 72 and the book only has about 260 pages. Lengthy explanations that don't say more than what a few well-written sentences would convey is the rule. Worse: some of these explanations may be misleading to a novice. Much said but little done. This may be the reason why neither a preview nor an online search of the book are available in Amazon.com.   I know that MDX is hard to learn because it looks like SQL but yet it is so different and there are many new concepts behind. But this "fast" track will rather mislead a reader into thinking he/she is at all on track. 
 The Decalogue is one of several excellent TV series by European directors that puts US TV to shame. Like Bergman's "Scenes from a Marriage" & "Fanny & Alexander," von Trier's "The Kingdom," Fassbinder's "Berlin Alexanderplatz," Kusturica's "Underground," and Petersen's "Das Boot," The Decalogue was initially conceived as a series on television and eventually brought to US viewers' attention on the large screen via a limited art house run. Unlike these other series, Kieslowski's was conceived as ten separate stories that were only tied together by the fact that the stories all involved people in the same housing block (and characters from one episode may pop up in another).  The stories of The Dekalog are morality plays, but they are not re-enactments of The Ten Commandments, but rather inspired by them, and ultimately it is left to the viewer to decide the connection between the two.  Kieslowski & Piesiewicz wrote the ten screenplays and decided to do the 10 stories themselves (instead of contracting 10 of Poland's best up & coming director's to do each, as was initially planned), and instead hired a different cinematographer for each of the stories.  I won't comment on the content of the stories as many have already done so, and I feel that that would minimizes the impact of the experience of watching them, so I will comment on Kieslowski's style. Kieslowski has stated that his intent is to highlight personal consequences of a dramatic nature.  His films often tackle issues of political import, however he intentionally avoids making "issue films," but rather focuses on the personal consequences of those affected, as he feels that politics solves nothing & that films do not really change the political culture. His views on film stem from his experience as a director who stayed in Poland before, during & after the Solidarity movement. Initially he started as a documentary film maker, but as he saw that audiences were more interested in fiction and that documentary film-making has an impact on the lives of its subjects, he switched to his unique fictional style.   This Facets 3-disc set of The Dekalog is apparently an improvement over the 2-disc version previously available, in that the picture quality is a little better, however it is still a far cry from what it could have been if Criterion had released this series. First, Facets has a mandatory ad for itself that automatically plays when you insert a disc & you have to let it play out before you can get to the menu. To add to that, you also have to watch another ad each and every time you select an episode to watch & after the end of each episode, very annoying. Then the picture quality isn't as good as it could be. Not only is there evidence of flaws in the film (scratches and blotches), but the film isn't a true digital copy of the original series, but rather a copy of someone's PAL tape of the broadcast, so the image is no better than watching a VHS tape.  The picture is also cropped from the original, especially on the bottom. The picture at times jitters, especially during the ending credits. The English subtitles are minimal, at times missing dialogue, and can not be turned off. There are some nice extra features, particularly a broadcast from Polish television of an interview of Kieslowski with a number of Polish journalists. However the quality of the picture of this is worse than on The Dekalog, and the entire dialogue is spoken over by people in English with no option to turn of the English dub & use subtitles instead. Apparently all of the other (imported) editions of The Dekalog are of better quality & offer more extras than this edition, which is inexcusable given the price 
 While the cover boasts that this book is the Age of Uninnocence, conjuring up the idea that it is comparable to Edith Wharton's novel of manners, the book doesn't deliver.  It's a door mat on the floor of Edith Wharton's penthouse.  There's no real plot to this novel and the characters are one-dimentional and vacuous.  Edith Wharton, like her friend, Henry James, had a great ability to write scenes with witty dialogue, revealing character in subtle ways.  Wharton used symbolism and multi-layered textuality in a way that Bushnell seems incapable or at least does not attempt.  And if we are comparing Bushnell to a jouranlist writer like Hemingway or Tom Wolf, there again, she doesn't measure up.  There's not multidimension to these characters, to the text.  There's no interesting subplot within an over-arching story.  It's all subplot and no major premise.    It might be shocking to midwesterners, but it's not much more than that.  Once you've heard about one oral sex encounter, the other ten are simply boring.  The three-some sex chapter is an overkill and I left the chapter feeling a bit smarmy.  If that's what Busnell wants us to feel, pity and sorrow for her characters misadventures, then she succeeds.  I don't get that impression, however.  I honestly don't know how anyone can "enjoy" the book. It's not funny.  David Sadaris is funny. He can make you laugh at people you feel sorry for -- that's a talent.  I felt sad for the characters in Bushnell's book, none of whom I actually cared about.  I wanted to shake them and tell them that life isn't a series of three-somes, rails to snort, and cigarettes to smoke. I wanted to tell them to get a life.  Move to Nambia and work for the UN.    The only redeeming chapter was the Bicycle Boys, which was perhaps the best written chapter. It has some interesting and novel observations.    On the whole, women lack direction and look for men to rescue them.  There is no real self-reliance here.  Even the women who are financially independent, like Sam, are so needy that it defies imagination.  The stay-at-homes in suburbia are supposed to repel, but their desperate housewife syndrome is more attractive than the empty sex and drifting that Carrie and company must go through.  In the classic sense, the women in Bushnell's novel are as trapped as the women in Edith Wharton's novels, but they are not as interesting.  In the end, they all want to bag a man who will take care of them and settle for whomever they can get. This isn't about women's friendship or about relationships at all. It's about survival of the fittest. In the year 2006, it's really a very sad book and if this is life in Manhattan, I'm really glad that I decided not to live there.  I'd take my life a million times over.  
 Author of the famed & hilarious THE MARXIST MINSTRELS (1974)...Expose of all those commie & negroid pulsating evils destroying our youth & gene pool. Some of this stuff has to be read out loud. You can regal your friends & have them rolling on the floor with a good thumping fundamentalist delivery. Hey, this guy was serious! Usual extreme right racist garbage in the Jack Van Imp mode. This guy is bout as close to God as a pig in lipstick 
 I really enjoyed this book.  Cohen has a straightforward yet amusing way of presenting his family's story that made it all feel very familiar to me, as though I were reading my own history.  Other facts which are included and quite interesting: information about Brooklyn, the mafia, factory life and a vivid portrait of someone who may be agoraphobic.  I finished the book in one weekend and will quite likely reread it.   
 My 3-year-old loves this book, so I bought him a new copy to replace his tattered old one. I highly recommend this book, which is delightful, especially for train-loving little ones. This edition, however, was poorly edited, in my opinion. The illustrations don't match up with the words. The sentences break up in the middle of the page. Anyone who reads to children knows that they enjoy pointing at pictures and anticipating the next event. However, it's very confusing for them when the words and pictures aren't in synch. I bought him another version that had other little blue engine stories, and it was a big hit. 
 This is actually a translation from the 1820s so the translation is very archaic & the spelling of the Arabic names is very nonstandard compared to modern transliteration equivalents. Likewise the notes are very dated and not very helpful. There seem to be missing parts and the ordering does not reflect the true itinerary.  Not to mention the fact that for all but experts in the Muslim world, much of this book would be very difficult to understand and much would be missed.  To really get a good idea of Ibn's travels, read the 'Adventures of Ibn...' by Ross. It may not have every word of the work, but it more than makes up for it by providing tons of cultural and historical background and by being very readable. There's a new paperback version out. See my review on that page.  If you must read the real book as well, don't try this one. Unfortunately, most other versions aren't complete and only cover parts of the travels. Even if you try a version of the full text, I recommend reading Ross 1st to help make the text more comprehensible & meaningful 
 These diapers are the most awfulest things I think I ever bought for my baby. I received a lot of the "swaddler" size for my baby shower and I tried to use them for about 3 weeks before my pediatrician pinpointed it as the source of the relentless diaper rash my son had pretty much from birth. Stopped using them and lo and behold, diaper rash gone. Fast forward 3 months later when my son was hospitalized for a week and these were the only diapers the hospital supplied. Figuring that my son was older, maybe they wouldn't do as much harm. Wrong. The rash came back with a vengeance. I had to get diapers from home for the rest of the stay. I think it's because they are lightly scented with green dye inside. Definitely stay away if your child has sensitive skin 
 While there is much in this book that is creative and imaginative, all that for me was undermined by the fact that, when I closed the book, I had concluded that its author, though a woman herself, must be a misogynist.  There are two female characters whose narrative significance is comparable to that of the narrator himself, Doug, and Harry, the protagonist.  One is the teacher, who is presented very positively, but who is not a character the primary school readers of this book will specifically identify with.  The other is Doug and Harry's classmate Mary, and by the time I finished the book, I despised her.  She is assertive, but her assertiveness is distorted and made ugly, so that when she gets her come-uppance, as she does several times (e.g. when her overpriced cookies at the bake sale don't sell), the reader can't help feeling glad.  Harry is nicer and more clever, and gets the better of her every time.  Her one good moment in the book is when she conceives the idea of the bake sale, and of calling it a moon sale, and the teacher praises her.  Other than that she is obnoxious and arrogant.  Primary school readers are not likely to notice these things consciously, but the subliminal message is there: boys are smarter and more fun, girls should sit down and shut up, or leave it at coming up with clever ideas for bake sales, or at least just go along with the boys, as Song Lee does.  Compare this to the Jigsaw Jones series, where Jigsaw Jones's detective partner Mila "demands equal pay for equal work," and that is "worth every penny" to Jigsaw (Jigsaw Jones and the Case of the Missing Hamster, by James Preller--note that this author is a man, and he does a better job with gender equity).  I would not foist Horrible Harry Goes to the Moon on either girls (who are demeaned by it) OR boys, who don't need its message any more than the girls do 
 There is nothing worth seeing in this film. The acting is bad, the filming is bad, and the plot is bad. The women are pretty but you see very little of them. Erotica drama is about the women being undressed. In this film they almost never are. Do not waste your money. Instead pick up a film like Midnight Tease 
 Is this for real? It sounds like John Tesh or Harry Connick Jr. I just got this CD and it put me to sleep. It should be called Destination down the tube.I'm a diehard Bon Jovi fan from New Jersey and I cannot believe he released this tragedy.I love all the CD's from Bon Jovi but this solo by Jon sounds like elevator or nursing home music.And for Richie,Bryan and Tico, please don't let Jon out of your sight again 
 First, let me say that Fasttrack works perfectly for my needs -- i needed to get a mic signal through an XLR cable into my mac powerbook for demos, absent of my usual protools software and clunky hardware. the mac sees the fasttrack immediately. BUT you should also know that none of the bundled software works with the laptop.  and considering this is an input box AND software you and i are paying for -- if you're on a mac you should go elsewhere to buy the box alone instead of this package. i saw 2 new units at the amazon "new and used" link at the top of this page (sans sessions software) for a much lower price.   Not exactly fair dealing from M-Audio as they flat-out name Garage Band in their product description and then talk about how great the accompanying software is--for that reason alone this package only gets 2 stars from this mac/protools user 
 I have the third edition as published in 1997, at a much higher price than the current book. This book was useless even in 1997.   The author believes in accreting, not revising. So chapter 13 was entitled "New Developments 1995", and chapter 31 entitled "New Developments: 1996 and Early 1997". In between is a disorganized hodgepdge of articles about software, medical devices, foreign filings, and so on. The style of writing is discursive, with almost no diagrams (only one chapter out of 31 has any diagrams at all) and no summaries or bullet point lists to help a busy patent practitioner.   The material itself generally is (i) outdated, (ii) well-known to patent attorneys, and/or (iii) too disorganized and episodic to give a layperson any useful understanding of patent strategy.  I strongly suspect that the glowing reviews elsewhere on this page are written by the author's friends and family, if not the author himself. When I move to a new office a few weeks from now, this book will be heading off my bookshelf and deep into my garage -- if it's lucky.  
  The last time that I wrote up one of Martha Grimes books (Belle Ruin) I mentioned that I thought that her move to America and possibly her getting a new editor had greatly improved her books. I said that I was looking forward to future improvements to her style and plot development.  It is obvious that Martha has decided to fire the new editor and has gone back to her old ways of inserting meaningless chapters into her books for the purpose of enlarging their size. These inserts are supposed to be humorous I gather. They are not. She has also decided that she wants to court the people of Hollywood who are looking for books with little or no plot for them to convert into the pabulum of the mindless. There are no car chases in this book, however the main character and the gorgeous (naturally) police DI seem to jump into bed every time that they meet on the street or at a crime scene.  I am sorry that I gave Martha another chance.  It is my impression that Martha thinks that this is a mystery. I think my catagory of "Humor" is what she really attempted and failed.  It is really unfortunate because she has shown that she has the ability to put together a gripping mystery tale if she ever wants to. 
 Generally I like Deaver's novels - and the premise of this one sounded interesting. But he's in over his head this time. Anyone who has spent more than a few hours online can see that the writer doesn't really understand what he's talking about. By the end of the book I was just reading it to finish it - and the end wasn't worth doing that.  If you have to read a Deaver novel, do yourself a favor and go re-read "The Coffin Dancer" instead 
 For newcomers to Billie Holiday and for those who want one CD that  represents her work, this is not the CD to buy. Much of Billie's greatness  was her rapport with musicians, and on this CD, Billie is on one world and  the musicians on another. Aside from the atrocious arrangements, Billie can  be heard rushing through her tunes, clipping her phrases, not having any  musical space to breathe life into these songs. This CD is a total rip-off.  If I could only have one Billie Holiday collection, it would be the old one  on Columbia/Sony, "God Bless The Child." Good luck finding it, as  it seems to be out of print 
 I dont think there was a single program that didnt have bug in it.  Bugs in the programs.  Bugs in the deployment descriptors. Typos and wrong statements in the text.   You need to check each and every program, line-by-line, against the updated code which must be downloaded from SAM's website.  Your weblogic 30-day trial licence will expire before you finish slogging through this book 
 This is one of the most boring films I ever watched. There is nothing erotic in it. The whole story is perverted with a poor, innocent but very stupid woman submitting to the sadist fantasies of various "lovers" she is introduced. I put inverted comas in lovers because none of them have a single tender erotic moment with her, but instead they brutally beat her and rape her in the presence of others, who seem to be totally oblivious to the proceedings 
 *  Thanks, everybody! Due in large part to your reviews I have decided to heed your warnings and skip past this "turkey"! Because of your "common consensus," as it were, "curiousity" will by no means kill THIS particular "cat"!   Yes, I felt the very powerful urge to experience this version of "WotW," especially after (1)- hearing repeatedly how amazingly "faithful" this version was to Mr. Wells' original vision and (2)- having been SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED (to 'gag-reflex' levels) by Steven Spielberg's drippy-syrupy, happy-sappy, and completely illogical abomination of the same source material (replete with the otherwise lovely & talented Dakota Fanning's irritating "Screaming Mimi" performance).   So despite all of the "warnings" about the "bad acting," the "bad editing," the "bad cinematography," and the "bad special effects," I still played around with the idea that its faithfulness to the original story would more than make up for all of this film's many production faults -- or that I could at least overlook such faults, as I often am capable of doing when presented with an entriguing-enough story to involve myself in ("Sleepaway Camp," anyone?). But the more I read of your reviews, the more doubts I began to have, until it led me to do the ONE thing I had yet to do -- VIEW THE TRAILERS! Therefore allow me, please, to repeat EVERYTHING which has repeatedly been expressed throughout these reviews based solely on my observation of the three "theatrical" trailers I viewed of this movie:   * less-than-impressive cinematography  * stale/wooden (read: "awful") acting  * uninspiring & amateurish special effects  * incompetent editing   That this is the closest "by the book" film adaptation we have of the original story seems, to me, to be this film's only major (if not exclusive) selling point.   I have this uncanny ability to "look beyond" poorly produced/directed/acted films in favor of a "good story" (or, at least, a "decent" one), but I simply CANNOT bear to sit through such a high concentration  of these cinematic deficits all pressed neatly together into one complete package! If only a series of motion picture promotional "trailers" can cause me to utterly reject ANY AND EVERY interest in a film project I may have initially had & held onto quite so effectively, then I can only consider myself SPARED of even greater disappointment from something that was surely to be a much more horrendous experience 3-hours in length! From all that I have observed and read, I do not even believe (as many of you seem to do) that a "larger budget" would have made one bean of difference!   Thank you, my friends, from the very bottom of my heart! Thank you for your help in saving me from a fate not exactly "worse-than-death" but pretty damn close!    = = = = = = 
 Keynes was no doubt an influential economist.  His theories and 'expertise' on economics influenced the post-New Deal economic policies of the United States and the internationalist wealth redistribution schemes like IMF.  However, his ideas on economics failed miserably and it was application of Keynesian ideas that wrecked so much havoc on the U.S. particularly in the 1970s with the stagflation (an inflationary recession with unemployment which was theoretically impossible accordingly to Keynesism.)  We have Keynes to thank for budget deficits and the nebulous idea that we can spend ourselves into prosperity through the largesse of the federal government.  Read Planning for Freedom or Socialism by Ludwig von Mises instead 
 What is this garbage? I made the mistake of buying this c.d. after hearing the song 'Anymore' which to my liking wasn't a bad song. They could have released a c.d. with just that song on it and I would have been just as happy as with the whole c.d. All of the songs are weak. Weak Vocals. Weak guitar riffs. If you're looking for some better nu-metal go buy a c.d. from Ill Nino, Dope, or Spineshank. I hope Switched doesn't decide to put out anymore c.d.'s in the future unless they change the way the songs sound on this album, they'd be doing us all a huge favor 
 I picked up this book since it was in the 25 best american novels ever written according to the New-York Times.  Initially, I was interested since the story unfolds in Africa and I knew little about that continent, however, Norman Rush's prose feels really heavy, and, in the end, it wears you out.  I don't recommend this book, instead, pick up A fine balance by Rohinton Mistry. Much better story unfolding in another country 
 I had to use this book because it was required for the physiology course I took, and the test questions were taken from it.  However, it is the most sloppy textbook I have ever dealt with.  It is so cryptical and convoluted, it actually makes the material HARDER to learn.   (For example, bizarre acronyms are introduced in the answers to sample problems that are never even been discussed in the text itself.)  The different sections of the book refer you back and forth to one another without explaining anything in a basic way.  In addition, the index is terrible, so you can't even try to dope things out on your own.  I would advise you to not get this book if you can avoid it, especially if you are a student trying to learn this material for the first time 
 I'm not surprised that someone with very little exposure to philosophical thought would find the arguments of this book convincing. The authors do a great job of employing misleading statistics and frequently resort to logical fallacies (petitio principii, mainly) in their arguments. This book is great if you want an anti-capitalist screed, but it fails miserably as an impartial analysis of business ethics. Like ssaber, I was disappointed to find a three page "defense" of capitalism and a ten page attack of it in Chapter 4, "The Nature of Capitalism." The authors include the views of a wide range of notable experts in this section, including but not limited to Karl Marx, George Soros, and Bertold Brecht (yeah, now there's a real authority on the subject). Why not include Sean Penn while you're at it, guys? I wasn't surprised to find that they'd skipped over real economists like Keynes, Hayek, and Friedman. 
 Relevant material is buried underneath too much theory.  Not enough examples.  I bought this book to supplement another book to and I had to buy another one to supplement this one 
 This product was a waste of my money.  It was very difficult to put on and very difficult to use.  My husband tore it off the day after we got it.  I would rather use duck tape then this product :)  : 
 La chanson que Nicolas Cage demande qu'on fasse jouer, juste avant de commencer les vols des voitures...  Elle ne se trouve pas sur la soundtrack...  Je la cherche, je ne la trouve pas !!!  Quelqu'un saurait-il quelle est cette chanson et qui la chante ???  Peut-tre pourrez-vous m'aider !  Merci  
 I was waiting for something to happen in this book but nothing did. There is no plot, the characters described very poorly and the writing is definitely unimpressive (I would not mind the writing so much if the plot was there). Throughout the whole book all the main character does is answers the phone and gets coffee ... how exciting is that?   
 On the trail of stinky excrements such as The Foreigner and Out for a Kill, current reigning straight-to-video monarch Steven Seagal returns to again inflict upon his ever-dwindling fan base more of his patented scowls, unsubtle enviromental messages, and his ridiculous, past-prime brand of martial arts.   Steven Seagal half-heartedly (and even that might be giving him too much credit) portrays William Lansing, a former special ops agent turned wildlife refuge environmentalist, who travels to Poland to look into why his 13-year-old orphaned buddy Irina Morawska has stopped corresponding (maybe she found out Seagal's 77 years old and is a slug). Lansing unearths a slimy but lucrative slavery ring and comes face to face with malignant main baddie Faisal. It now only remains to see how grisly a fate Faisal will have at the chubby but deadly hands of Lansing.  Out of Reach is utter crapola. The amateurish production values, the corny, highly derivative script and the cringe-worthy acting "performances" cause this video release to plummet faster than an ugly prostitute's self-respect. Seagal's mumbled diction is at an all-time low. At certain points, a voice actor had to dub Seagal's voice because the Green Peace sensei couldn't be bothered to come back to the studio for post-production work (it's so obviously not him doing the voice-over, reading those letters to Irina). The action sequences are so preposterous and so clumsily-set up that even David Carradine is giggling.    I was such a big fan of Seagal when he first exploded on the scene in Above the Law (1988). Back then, he was the epitomy of the film action hero, more down to earth than Van Damme and more realistic than Ah-nold. His first five features were awesome, stripped-down virtuoso cinemas of abrupt, lethal, down-and-dirty ass-kicking. In the 1990s,  the fact that he was a man of monosyllabic tendencies only contributed to his cultivated silent but deadly image. He was well on his way to becoming a martial arts icon. Then, sadly, pfffft...    Obviously, Seagal found out that he could still make beaucoup money without putting in a 100 percent effort. Over the years, the man had just let himself go, and it's a damn shame. True, he never was much of an actor: he probably uses his Burger King cash card more often than his SAG card. But now, even the low-rent genre he toils in should be embarassed to have him as a member.  Is it a surprise anymore when we find, in whatever film he's in, that his character has had special super-duper combat training in his past? First of all, if Steven Seagal were to now play a role other than that of an ex-military name-taker and ass-kicker, his Jabba the Hut-sized noggin would probably explode from the unexpected dramaturgical exertion, and all we'll have left of Seagal is the desolate remnants of a ponytail. His acting is now as strained and forced as his trousers belt must be. This is not the worst movie I've ever seen (I once walked out of a Dolph Lundgren flick; The Red Scorpion, I think it was) but it's pretty bad. For the record, Seagal has almost officially surpassed the unlamented Michael Dudikoff in terms of film careers rapidly circling into the toilet. One and a half stars. The rating would be lower but I'm sentimental. 
 I can't believe some of the songs on this soundtrack...they are horrible pieces of S$#!?*&%#!#$!There are a couple good ones,but its not worth spending the money on for the c.d,not even at a used price.I can't believe they did'nt put "Low Rider" on the soundtrack,how cheap is that 
 Filmed in 1933, this movie is in black and white, and might be considered dull and slow-moving by today's standards.  An accurate chronology of the six wives of Henry VIII, the characters of the wives are rather  undeveloped, and the movie does not delve very deeply into the important  religious and political questions around which the marriages centered.  A  good introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the basic story, but  the serious scholar will want to conduct further research 
 Plain Truth, set in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, would be better entitled, Fancy Lies. An eighteen-year-old Plain woman wakes up with labor pains, gives birth in a calving pen, cuts the umbilical cord and prays, "Lord, please make this go away." When she awakens and the baby is no longer with her, she whispers, "Denke," and goes on with her day. Later, after the deceased body of an infant is found and the police are called to investigate, she tells them "I didn't have a baby," as blood trickles down her leg. Without providing spoilers, two (of many) implausible situations follow. First, two women, one old, one young, both separately become pregnant through one act of intercourse, defying the odds of fertility. Second, a criminal defense attorney who made a name for herself getting an acquittal for an elementary school principal who molested six students is actually very maternal and willingly leaves big city life with a boyfriend of eight years to live on an electricity-free farm out of the kindness of her heart. In summary, a two-page italicized section mid-book along with the first and last chapters provide enough details of the basic plot to save the reader from 400 implausible pages. Those interested in reading just one book by Jodi Picoult should choose My Sister's Keeper. Chris Bohjalian's Midwives is better. 
 listening to this you will not be able to stay awake more than five minutes. it should come with a warning label advising not to drive a car or lift heavy things. pop this in while cruising i-95 in joisey and you'll be plugging up that left lane with bruce inspired slowness for miles. and do not lift anything heavy if you value your toes. yet another snoozefest about depression, oppresion and poverty from rocks poorest billionaire. zzzzzzzz 
 If you grew up in a overly protected home, sheltered from the outdoors and the rest of life in general, this book is for you.  An example of what happens when a person who has no interest in biodiversity writes a book 
 This seemed like a pretty slick idea, and was a pretty clock.  All it needs to do is let us know that our stomachs aren't lying, that it really is near lunch.   I set it near our front (glass) door and it apparently found a signal as it had changed time by itself and was spot on.  So I hung it in our office (no window).  Two days latter we had a thunderstorm one night.  Apparently that can interfere with the signal.  Rather than sit tight and wait for a fresh signal, this thing was off by an odd amount of time, like an hour and 27 min by the next morning.    I set it manually, and today it's off again by about an hour.    The instructions to reset which I got from Tech Support were not less than 7 steps long and included a detailed disertation on what type of battery, and what it's expiration should be.    Man, that's a lot of work just to verify what my stomach knows is true.  For $25, and the packaging being gone, this is in the dumpster.  I'll get a regular clock that only keeps time to a couple of minutes a month....but takes a month to show the error 
 This book is an extremely long-winded road trip memoire dressed up in the conceit of a search for "The Perfect $100,000 House". If you are considering it for what it may yield in the fields of architecture or development, you will find it adds little insight and little originality with respect to $100,000 houses. If you are considering it as a memoire, I commend it only to insomniacs 
 My beagle (13 mo.) cocks her head showing that she hears something with a slight pause in the barking process but does not deter her from barking at a later time.  Does nothing for howling and will only go off for loud barks, not smaller barking or any form of whining (even if extremely loud) 
 I purchased this dvd recorder to go with the sony hdd camcorder.  They should have been perfectly compatible, but mine has been nothing but trouble. The first time I used it, it simply froze at 99% complete and I had to shut it down and start over after waiting 3 hours for it to finish.  After that, it recorded from the camera, but seemingly randomly, not in the order I videotaped on the camera, and incompletely burned video segments from the camera as well.  Plus, there is no editing capability whatsoever with this device.  I use very high quality Taiyo Yuden dvd's in it, so I know it is not the discs 
 As a big Disney Princess fan, I'm rather upset that for this CD, the vocal versions of the tracks are NOT performed by the original voice actresses who played each Princess. It's almost like buying a karaoke CD with tracks of people singing along to the karaoke provided! Either include the original vocals for the song, or don't include them at all, Disney. 
      If you are an intellectual idiot, you will love this book!  It waters down every important philosophical idea to the predjudicial opinions of one man who basically tries to use moral persuasion to "sell" his point of view but never backs up any of his "quotes" with footnotes of the "great philosphers" he is trying to "teach" us about!  NO DIRECT QUOTES!!  Yikes. Who can take this book seriously?       I don't think Plato would appreciate being watered-down in this way with neither footnotes to his brilliant, original work, nor any index. NO INDEX!!  Ask yourself this one question before wasting your money on this book:  "Why do I need a philosophy book written by an amateur who doesn't even consider me intelligent enough to make an index for me at the back of this book so I can look up topics as I want to?"  If, for example, you want to look up Plato, and what pages mentions his work in this "philosophy book" by Mr. Adler, you can't because there's no index.        As a classical homeschooler for the past nine years, I have to say I would NEVER ask my teenagers to read this book.  It's just not a serious enough philosophy book to waste their time with.  They are better off reading bits of Plato in the original than hearing the predjudicial opinions of Mr. Adler who's preaching, persuading, and glossing over details would make the money and time spent on it a total waste.  If you still want to read it, go to the library where it's free and decide then and there whether it's worth it.        It's simply unacceptable to have neither footnotes nor index in a book such as this 
 It is quite possible for this film to wash over you and leave absolutely no trace of passing.  There are about three or four lines in this effort which are funny however the tedium in-between does not make them worth the wait.  Part of the problem with this film was that I felt that I had seen it all before. Which, of course, I had in Four Weddings. Slightly pathetic, floppy-haired middle-class Englishman falls for glamorous American who rejects him them gets back together with him and has a group of friends suffering from various disabilities.  Not since "Intersection" have I spent a movie looking at my watch to see when it ended. I honestly don't know who was worse, Julia Roberts or Hugh Grant. They both became so grating on the nerves that I couldn't wait for the movie to end. The most enjoyable part of the film (aside from it being over) were the trailers they showed before it.  Not worth seeing or renting. Save the money for something better... it shouldn't be that hard 
 If anyone is new to the Dark series by Christine Feehan, you absolutely need to READ DARK PRINCE FIRST.  Feehan introduces a new race of paranormal humans, and you need to know what about their Carpathian/vampire universe.  Also, what happens in this book deals directly with what happened in Dark Prince.  Dark Desire is not standalone.  After Dark Prince you can almost pick up any of the other books.  Dark Desire has very little romance in it, so if you want to see some romance, don't bother.  It's just one big pool of blood and torture.  People are strangled, stabbed, staked, shot, mangled, manacled, healed and then injured again, bitten, bled...it just doesn't stop!  Oh, and they have a lot of sex even whey they are still bleeding.  Whatever.  And you almost need a scorecard and a handy family tree to piece together who did what and which people are being healed and by whom, and who else is near death at any particular moment.  Not that I want to be babied through a book, but everything happens awfully fast. and it seems that way too much goes unsaid with these people, as if Feehan didn't bother to organize the nebulous mass in her head.  There are too many characters and too many sideplots.  Think of it as a cross between a gorefest and a soap opera.  Suffice it to say that everyone is okay in the end.  So now you can get this from the library and skim to the sideplots that you're interested in. (for me that's the Gergori subplot).  On the whole it's not a disaster, but NOT great in terms of a romance 
 Got my Bowflex weeks ago and having trouble, lots of trouble putting it together. It's not the product's fault other than the fact that putting together is a real 'mutha. Seems the parts could've been marked better. Identification is pretty much visual. Instead, you have a "picture map" to compare what part is needed. I was doing fine until I inserted the wrong bolt, stripped the bolt trying to get it out, got the WD40 on it, finally had to use a crescent wrench. So, my confidence is blown and then I continued on to assemble the seat backwards. The assemblage directions could be better, believe me. I used the 800# once, but I finally found that no matter what was suggested, the picture was misleading and there's no way that could've been explained. Onward through the fog! 
 What garbage!  According to the liner notes the music was written while in a state of meditation.  Well the "composer" might as well have been asleep.  If I could take 10 minutes to write a simple computer program to generate this kind of fluff and market it properly, I could be a millionaire!  All that is done is hold a note or two down on the synth and occasional play a different note.  No form, melody, orchestration, etc.  It makes those Andes flute improvisation relaxation CDs seem like James Galway on acid 
 I purchased this remote control to make watching DVD's on the PS2 easier.  I had problems getting it to work consistantly right out of the box.  I had to press most of the buttons very hard to get them to work.  I hoped it would get better but it only got worse.  I am now back to using the game controler and threw the remote control away.  I would NEVER recommend this product.  
 This is a shorter, much simplified version of the original story that was published by Pantheon books in 1983.  I'm not sure what the point was in making a simplified version, since the complete story of Cornelius was my son's favorite when he was 3 years old.  I'd skip this version and go with the original 
 Coming into Spamassassin as a new user is very confusing, especially if you don't admin e-mail systems frequently. The spamassassin wiki and documentation are really confusing as well, it seems that nothing really explains the system as a whole very well.  Finally, a real book about Spamassassin (I thought). This book skipped over a lot of topics I want to know more about (logging spamassassin activity, how to install razor and pyzor, more information about the RBLs installation and configuration). I don't think so much time should have been spent on Baysean techniques, I find Baysean to be too labor intensive and not practical at all on a site-wide level (which I think the author mentions in the book). This book was good, but not as complete as I was expecting, but as a reference for Spamassassin I suppose it's ok, but not anything better than is online 
 Why such a book needs to be written in the first place? What is it's social redeeming feature and how does it benefit the racial problems we have in this country?  Of course the Roots of this book go much deeper, it's the USA version of the "Out of Africa "books. Those books insist that the Greeks, and others, stole the art, religion, philosophy, science and literature from Africa, apperently the Greeks were unable to come up with anything new without consulting with Africans first(of course we never find out which Africans).  Now we are told that White Americans are ripping of Black Culture, that we want everything that is black; and that, Heaven forbid) that white Churches have even stolen Gospel songs.  What this book reflects is cultural arrogance and gross ignorance. If anything, the Hip Hop, gang signs, sexualizing of black men or women and the worshipping of athletes show a distinct lack of culture. Of course the trend is to blame Whitey for both pushing and stealing from this culture; therefore absolving Black Americans from any responsibility for social degeneration.  It might be more historically correct that Afro-Americans have been using and misusing European culture for the past 400 yrs. Besides, where and from whom, did the slaves learn the religion, songs and music to develop the Gospel Songs; I doubt that they brought them over from Africa 
 Douglas as Van Gogh was a reincarnation of the artist himself. Van Gogh was an eccentric and tormented soul.  Douglas manifested all the elements needed to descibe and fullfill the artist's message.  Like all the great artists, Modiliani, Gauguin and Van Gogh were haunted by the demons of their past, which inevitably lead to their self destruction.  An excellent film to all, not just art historians 
 When I read the NYTimes review of this book I bought it with anxious anticipation.  After all, years ago I had absolutely loved Rene Dubos' "The Mirage of Health".  However, this book was like wading through knee deep mud.  So much for the book reviews in the papers.  I know it is a gargantuan task, but someone needs to write a really interesting, flowing, readable book (or a series of books) about this fascinating subject.  I also realize that much about this subject is unknown or speculation, but still.. 
 I have read and subscribed to Organic Gardening (and Farming)since mid-70's but dropped my subscription in and around 2000. I pick up an issue now and then in newstands, just to "check in" and hope for a return to the "good ole days". The publication used to be superior (find old issues in a library to see the what I mean - especially the 70's) and gave tons of information to all levels of gardeners (some issues used to have 100's of pages, almost all text - though in a smaller format). I still have old copies and to this day find inspiration in those articles. Now its just LARGE glossy pictures, sparse writing, reduced page counts, basic gardening info/lists and more than a dose of Maria Rodale's opinion/politics. I guess their surveys/advertisers tell them this is what "organic" gardeners want...but I would bet Robert Rodale (who edited the mag back in 70's and early 80's) would be upset to see how his daughter has screwed up the magazine. Save your subscription and read the old ones at a library. Yeah...the varieties will be out of date (that's what a seed catalog is good for and/or seedsavers.org) but the info is pure "organic gardening" 
 I was given a First Edition of this book by a friend who knows that I practice Vodou and Rootwork. It is a fascinating story, but sadly the author focuses on "wild orgies" and "blood drinking negros". It was written in the 30s and does indeed reflect the "taste" of this period as well as the prejudice attitude towards Voodoo and Vodou in that time. 
 I can't fathom why this book is beloved.  It's just awful.  Alright, that's a little strong.  The first third-to-half of the book is just awful:  tedious, depressing, tiresome, plotless.  Indeed, Lawrence put a sentence in that, amazingly, perfectly summarizes the first half of the book:    "The days seemed to grind by, with curious painfulness, yet nothing happened."  That really does say it all.  The protagonist plods through her dreary, depressing life, and nothing happens.  At times during this book, I got the feeling that Lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist, because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story.  For a while I had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant I'd never heard of, until I finally just gave up.  Eventually, in the last third or so of the book, it starts getting a little more interesting.  But sadly, while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing, in the end nothing very much comes of any of it.  But we DO get long, windy, insufferably self-righteous political nattering, of a Rousseau-ian nature:  all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed (in reality, life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short).  This is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken-little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in 100 years unless we give up industrialism/capitalism and all.  Well, the book came out in 1928, so he's still got some 20 years to not look like an utter nincompoop.  But I could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good.  It is not.  The biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it.  This stems largely from the fact that Lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people (so much so that I strongly suspect  that he was emotionally crippled himself).  Every character is decidely neurotic, each in their own special flavor.  The closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be Mrs. Bolton.  The central character Connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book, but it sure takes her long enough.  I just could not identify with these people one tiny iota.  Repeatedly I just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes.  To its credit, the book does advocate an unabashed, unashamed joyous love of sex, something with which I am totally on board.  But that's about the only good thing I could find to say 
 Hmmm. I'm struggling to give Agatha Christie such a low rating. She wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into. Not quick reads, but very methodical with lots of character development. I don't always feel very motivated to get through some of those slow-moving chapters, but I always do it knowing that I will be rewarded with a great ending. Christie was great at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the "who, where and why" were finally revealed in the end. I was shocked again at the end of this book - not because I didn't know who the killer was, but actually because I already knew who and how. I tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too obvious. Very disappointing. Christie books I would recommend instead - ABC murders, And Then There Were None and Murder of Roger Ackroyd 
 I really didn't like this book to say the least.  I didn't like the way it was written.  I didn't like the story line at all.  None of it made much of any sense and much of it seemed to contradict some basic Jedi guidelines.  I was looking forward to reading this I thought it would go more into the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin a few years after Episode 1.  I thought it might include some insight on Padawan training.  I couldn't have been more disappointed.  Overall it was a really stupid story that wasn't at all believable, even in the realm of the Star Wars universe.  Just bad.  It does have a couple relevant story lines that you might want to know if you plan on or do read all the Star Wars books published. I would only read this if you are one of those people, otherwise I would definitely recommend skipping this one 
 Gaggia used to be the cat's meow in espresso. They have lost the bubble in the last ten years. Many other machines do more, are easier to use, and produce better cups in an easier manner. i still have my old Gaggia, but now rely on a Saeko in my home. The difference is obvious 
 I agree with the negative comments - I eventually stopped watching it - unconvincing acting - (and a small point that I found irritating - in TV movies about war, some of them have a "too-clean look" that make a film seem unrealistic. There is no dirt anywhere, as far as I could see - everybody looks too clean, the settings look too clean, and not realistic. The acting level was what finally turned me off. Glad it was on TV 
 I, too, could just not finish this book. It felt like such a shame because the idea behind, and the title, and even the first pages had me really looking forward to the story. But three-quarters of the way though I'd just had enough. I found the writing style very ponderous. The switching tenses were confusing, the book is mostly written in the present tense which just doesn't work for this kind of writing.   My biggest criticism is of the cloying, sentimental prose that infused the whole piece (or, certainly, as far as I read). Moreover, as another reviewer mentioned, this author never gave her audience any reason to enjoy her characters. It is all "tell" and no "show". Everything is assumed. I never got any sense of why this Annie was so beloved, which is the entire premise for the book! And the five main characters were simply irritating. The author seemed to want her readers to fall in love with these women, to look to them as models to which they might mould their own lives. But there was no rational as to why these women were so fabulous, or why any self-respecting woman might consider their characters admirable or aspirational.   For me, this is the worst kind of "womens" writing: sentimental, superficial schlock. Ultimately it was just not worth the time or effort expended in reading. Don't bother 
 I would like to warn the reader that the five-stars "spotlight review" above doesn't come from a person, but from a company specialized in this kind of activity and called getAbstract. If you really want to know the opinion of readers, I advise you to read some of the reviews below. There are positive and negative ones, and you will certainly see which are the genuine ones. My opinion of the book may be seen by the rate I gave it.   
 Typical Feinstein ("A Season on the Brink" excepted).  Quick, gossipy, superficial, fawning, etc., etc.  This book is about the 2002 U.S. Open Golf Championship at the Bethpage Black Golf Course, a New York State Park course on Long Island.  The subtitle, "Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black," is used here as a figure of speech, meaning "behind the scenes."  ("Inside the ropes" is normally used in the context of a professional golf tournament to refer to the actual playing area itself -- spectators are separated from the golfers, caddies, officials, and other chosen few by thin ropes that tell the spectators how close they can get to the action.)  Feinstein's purpose is to give the reader a look at the unfolding of a golf tournament from its conception to its completion.  We see U.S Golf Association (the organization that conducts the tournament) leaders in action and learn something about the logistics of putting on a golf tournament (e.g., 4,850 people willing to volunteer their time so that the professional golfers and U.S.G.A. can have a huge payday), about random qualifiers and random competitors, and about the resurrection of the Black golf course.  Yet the book does not fulfill its promise.  My guess is that Feinstein's indebted to too many golf people for both his past and anticipated future lifestyle to offer the kind of critical insights and analysis I had hoped for 
 I had hoped to see a clear definition between mood and food.  My question to answer:  Is the food we're eating creating our mood/disposition?  With the assumption that "it's probable," I was interested to see which food may cause specific reactions.  For example, for some corn is a food-sensitivity and reactions to sinuses and allergies.    I didn't get that type of information out of this book.  Lot's of text, but not what I wanted.  If you're interested in a historical overview of psychology and other chemical disorders, this may be for you.  In my case, it wasn't 
 I wanted the home antenna system so I could bring my SkyFi2 receiver out of my vehicle and listen to it in the house too. I set up the antenna in a south facing window as per the instructions but soon discovered that this was unnecessary as the high gain antenna picked up the signal right through the roof with no visible or audible degradation of the signal.  Now it sits unobtrusively on top of my stereo cabinet obviating the need to route the lead wire through the house to the window. Great!  Good-bye commercial radio with all your annoying commercials and mindless, yapping, moronic DJs 
 You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.   I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time 
 This book was required for my intermediate macroeconomics course at Cornell University. I found the book to be very confusing, especially on the more technical topics such as the Solow growth model. I give Abel and Bernanke credit for trying to develop a unified, balanced approach to macro... which they do; unfortunately, the exposition is not clear and the book is extremely wordy and not concise. I highly recommend N. Gregory Mankiw's Macroeconomics text instead 
 i received this cookbook as a gift recently and was eager to test it out....i wasn't impressed really. there are very few directions as to the timing of each step in the recipes, and the recipes themselves aren't very fresh or mouthwatering...most are very "classic" items that seem quite dated, as well as heavy and unhealthful...some directions to recipes are overlooked completely, very confusing for a novice.. (which i am not....)  i use JOY OF COOKING all the time and will continue to do so, also MADELEINE KAMMAN'S MAKING OF A COOK (an absolute bible!) i do not recommend the NEW YORK TIMES COOKBOOK for any level of home cook. 
 I give it two stars for the Snorkel, the mask and the fins are just JUNK!!  The Mask: The mask is a purge mask...meaning it has a small disk that, in theory,lets you blow any excess water that enters the mask by just blowing. The problem is this, any speck of debris that gets caught between the disk or a simple malformation will cause water to constantly enter the mask. AND if you happen to suck in via your nose you'll definately get a mask full of water.  The Fins: The're a strap type fin which is good BUT they are so tight you can't wear any dive booties or dive socks which comes in quite handy if you're walking over coral, rocks or any other sharp objects. The biggest issue with the fins is the strap comes off while swimming. This set was for my wife and hers came off I didn't think to much of it until mine did too. You might say, buy smaller fins but they run in a Size x to Size X so you can't buy any smaller.   The Snorkel is ok, It's a little short but it works 
 I bought this book because I love making miniature foods.  My major problem with this book is that on the inside there are only a few color photos and the rest of the book is pretty dull to look at.  The recipes seem okay but just the dull look of the pages make it pretty hard to get inspired to try any of these recipes.  I recommend just finding it at a library and not spending any money on it.  I have a book called "Finger Food" by Katharine Gasparini.  It has more savory recipes but there is a section for sweets.  This book is also fully photographed 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 I wish I could give this zero stars.  Save your money and go get a spiral notebook at your local drug store, it would be just as useful.  I love the show Good Eats and had great expectations about anything with Alton's name on it.  I guess I should have read the reviews first. I am sending it back tomorrow for a refund 
 I wanted to give this book a good review, but I cannot recommend it for a beginner. Like many readers, I came to it because I wanted to learn about philosophy and it was the only book on subject that I had heard of. The good news is that after 800 pages, I still wanted to learn more. The bad news is that I still knew very little.   The first problem is that the book has way too much breadth for a beginner. You do not need to spend 100 pages on Greek philosophy before even coming to Plato. For those that are interested in purchasing the book, I would suggest trimming the list to: Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Descartes, Berkeley, Hume, Kant, Locke, Leibniz, Hegel, and then everything from Schopenhauer onwards.  The second problem is that the book is dated. Russell wrote it during World War II and there have been huge developments in philosophy since then. Some examples include the decline of the logicst program and logical positivism, the development of ordinary language philosophy, the later Wittgenstein, and a lot more on pragmatism beyond William James (such as Quine), and a rebirth of Christian philosophy from within the analytic and empirical traditions that Russell advanced (such as the works of Alvin Plantinga and William Lane Craig). It is standard for contemporary introductions to philosophy to cover most of these later developments.  A third problem has been well commented on by many other reviewers, which is Russell's bias and his dismissive treatment of philosophers that he does not agree with.   Finally, although histories have their place, they are not a good way to actually learn philosophy. Instead they are best used for becoming familiar with the major names and what they did. To actually learn philosophy you need an introductory book that directly focuses on the ideas.   My advice to someone new to philosophy is to buy 'An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis' by John Hospers. It is a gentle but rigorous textbook that is ideal for the first timer. It has a bias towards atheism, but theists should not pass up such a well-written book. Then follow it up with the even more rigorous and thorough 'Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview' by JP Moreland, even if you aren't a Christian. It has the best explanations of epistemology and metaphysics that I've seen. At that point you may want to get some logic under your belt, so if you are still ambitious, buy 'An Introduction to Logic' by Harry Gensler. The logicola software that accompanies the book is ideal for learning philosophical logic through self-study. 
 Janet Evanovich is my absolute all time favorite author, which is why I'm heartbroken over this book. I have never read an Evanovich book I didn't like until now. I literally finished the book only because Janet wrote it.   The book pretty much goes like this: steal a hauler, Beans is kidnapped, follow people around, get Beans back, follow more people around, Gobbles is kidnapped, follow some more people around, Hooker is kidnapped(my favorite part, who likes a cheater!), follow even more people around, etc, etc... Wish I had a nickel for every car they tailed in this book. I also agree with the other reviewers, Beans the dog got on my nerves pretty quick.   I'm still a huge fan of the Stephanie Plum series. I can't wait for the next Plum book in January. I just wish Janet would have spent her time working on the next Plum novel instead of wasting everyones time with Motor Mouth.  
 Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy. Discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient. Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow. I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable 
 I must be the lone voice in the wilderness and say I couldn't stand this book. It is absolutely awful. I could only make it halfway through. The author is not wise--she flails helplessly in her life. Reading this book is like watching someone drown. When her useless boyfriend upsets her, instead of dumping him or doing something constructive, she meditates "to gain the perspective of eternity." In other words, she does nothing positive to improve the situation and just goes back to him. It's tedious to read about.   Her prose is terrible, full of meaningless statements like "Sometimes a piece of knitting is simply itself," or 1950s cliches like "I've never understood the male animal." She gives a bizarre description of how she lay face to face with her drug-addicted boyfriend and "the bones in the center of my chest seemed to open" and they exchanged energy "in almost a figure eight pattern." When she meditates on her pain, she realizes that she "belongs to another reality, a larger conciousness, a vast and fruitful emptiness of luminous blackness and primal light." Say wha? If that kind of New Age babble sounds meaningful and special and insightful to you, you will probably like this book. I think it is nonsense. 
 *** stars - can't change the above!  Valio is a rearrangement of some of the songs of Amar sin Mentiras. And it definitely has the feeling of an afterthought.  While it is a pretty  decent salsa album (albeit brief), it is simply not in  the class of his other three salsa CD's, Todo a su Tiempo, Contra la Corriente, and especially, Libre. The arrangements are standard competent rather than thorougly innovative and unique  as were the older ones. 
 The great thing about this album is that it's Frankie's. The selection of songs is not particularly impressive, but Sinatra's voice and style could make any song sound credible and AMAZING. 
 I found this book very hard to navigate and it's a shame this is the only book about windows scripting. For instance, look up array/list in the index, what do you find? - how to create basic arrays but not how to edit or access them. Surely there should be a general section about how to use arrays somewhere? -- You search for file, what do you find? - 2 different file accessing modules at opposite ends of the book that really do the same, only 1 accesses basic information about the file.  In a way, it's a bad book for a bad scripting language. When you create files, you have modes 1,2,5,7. What ever happened to 'r' or 'rw'... For something advertised as a visual and easy to use scripting language it isn't visual at all, the syntax is inconsistent and you just end up memorising what appears to be randomised information in this book before you can do anything useful 
 This work is a mildly interesting collection of semi-familiar "tales." It is so poorly written that it reads like a first draft.  Where was the editor 
 I found any plot disrupted by the author's silly use of the term "mon". I believe he used it to give us an insight into Jamaican culture :=). Sam Tucker's use of the words "Boy" and "Son" are also very amateurish 
 My best friend advised me not to read this book. But, she's a bit of an elitist, so I figured, what the heck? I mean, I like plenty of things she finds annoying or stupid. I was wrong. Here is my honest impression of the book:  First chapter: This isn't so bad.. a bit melodramatic.. but not bad Quarter of the way through the book: He is not going there, is he? Third of the way through: OH GOD!!!! He went there!!! Halfway: Please, please stop this... oh no, he's borrowing from everything I hold dear! Three quarters: *Mouth open in disbelief* This is TERRIBLE!!! End of book: Why, why didn't I listen?   I recently saw the trailer and thought "Wow, that really reminds me of A New Hope.You know, the scene where Luke is looking off into the sunset.." It isn't the unoriginality that made me hate the book, or the bloody mess Young Sky - I mean, Paolini made of the archetypes in the book, it was the tone the author used. That smug, smug tone.   This fills me with sadness for all the good writers out there who don't have the rich, influential parents to push their work to the top of the stack 
 This movie is terribly boring. I fell asleep twice during it. The fight scenes are too short. The CG used in the film is very cheap looking. The "drama" will cause you to roll your eyes. It's a B-movie that thinks it's a masterpiece...  The 5.1 Japanese track is well done. The transfer for the R1 DVD is very good.   There are much better Asian films out there 
 At first I didn't realize that you have to use Amazon's software to load onto the Zen.  Once I figured that out (actually my husband figured that out) the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do.  I wasn't able to edit the stars.  If I could I would give this 5 stars.  If you have tried some other sites for the Zen, they are much more difficult to use. Amazon's Unbox is great for the Zen 
 All of the songs except for ONE are TRASH on this one. Not worth forking over even $.01 for this one!!! 
 I hate this book. It is extremely boring and it is way too long.  There are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar. Do not read this unless forced to. I like to read, but this nearly put me to sleep.  avoid at all cost 
 I bought the book because I thought it would be about 'Trends' and might give guidance into products and services that could be marketed. After 10 pages I realized it was nothing of the sort. It seems to be a soap box designed to show the superiority of females in all things. I am not a chauvenist by any means, but I was offended by Martha Barletta's portrayal of men. And often her take on men vs women was just not accurate. That men care what people think of them more than women? Come on now..all her information is anecdotal - no statistics. Just ranting and denigrating men. WASTE of $$$. This booklet wouldn't have sold 100 copies if Tom Peters' - who happens to be a man -name wasn't on it. 
 I love this show!  That said, I do not care for this version of it.  The inclusion of the word "concept" in the title means it is just that.  This was, thankfully, not the final version of the show that would later spawn the hit song, "One Night In Bangkok".  With most Broadway musicals, the musical numbers tell the basic story of the show.  If you listen to the recordings of Phantom, Mama Mia, Beauty and the Beast, you can discern the basic storyline of the show.  Listening to this particular recording of Chess, though, will leave you wondering "What was that?"  The Broadway arrival of Chess saw a much needed reworking of the storyline and arrangement of the musical numbers.  This recording seems too much like a mish-mash of songs that don't really relate to each other.  For musical fanatics (like myself), I say "yes, you should have this recording in your collection", if only to understand how much work went into the show before it opened on Broadway.  If you are only buying the album because of "One Night In Bangkok", purchase the Broadway recording instead; you'll be much happier with the performance by Phillip Casnoff rather than Murray Head 
 It seems only to have occurred to a few of these reviewers that whatever Foucault intended as the poltical upshot of Discipline and Punish (and are we even 'allowed' to ask such a question?) its practical political effect has been to allow senior academics a face-saving way to warn graduate students not to rock the boat while denying any authoritarian tendencies.  Perhpas Foucault's work has somehow had more positive political effects in gay rights work, and I would be interested in hearing that argument, but I doubt it.  I think his celebrity has done that 
 I have a Marantz CD recorder DR 6000. A previous generation of Memorex Music CD-R worked fine (White with purple lettering and blue recording surface) This new generation will not be read by this recorder. The recorder could not initialize and gave an disc error with several I tried.  It Worked fine with some new SONY CDRs. 
 The first several books were great, but about half way through, it just turned into porn. I have never minded a little sex in books, but this one is nothing but sex. There's supposed to be a big important vampire meeting/party after the ballet, but Hamilton doesn't even bother to write it, having Anita passed out from too much sex and magic. I lost count of the new people introduced in this book so that Anita could have sex with them. and not just sex, but multiple partner, kinky sex with an audience. This book finally crossed the line where I can't stand it anymore and will be selling the entire series as soon as I go back to selling books.  Anita has collected a harem of who know how many men that only have sex with her, and do whatever she tells them to.   She has created a triumvirate of her, Nathaniel and Damien, but she doesn't take care of them and Damien is forever on the edge of dying because Anita doesn't have enough sex to keep him alive, even though she needs a waiting room and a take-a-number machine for the people she is having sex with.  The preview of the next book features Edward, who's been missing for a long time with a personality transplant. As I read the preview, I just could not see this new Edward. I'm not about to read a new book and see Edward as a different person. Stick a fork in her she's done.   This book should not be sold to minors. The review should come with a warning. I gave it one star, because they won't let you not give it any 
 I bought this book thinking that the "secrets" therein would enlighten me as to things we might be missing in our planning for retirement.  The other reviewers on this site made it sound like the book would have advice on little-known health care deals, finding a good place to live, etc.  Instead, it is filled with common sense tips, such as "enjoy sex" and "learn to forgive."  Gee, thanks.  This might be a good book if you're retired and bored, but don't buy this looking for much more. 
 If you want to read one of THE dullest, stuffiest, not to mention stylistically ghastly books in all of art history, please read this one. These writers confuse ambiguity and meanlingless hodgepodge for intelligence 
 This book, this so called scientific social book, is a tower constructed by lies and half truths based upon the author's (and the liberal media's) hatred toward Christians.  There is no such thing as a war against science by Republicans and the Christians.  There IS such a thing as a war against God, very easily  seen in such "I hate Christians" books like this one, but that is to be considered later on.  Basically, this book is a 342 page book founded upon Christianphobia.  It is a witch hunter's book that tries to demean and belittle and lie about Christians.  I will make this brief, but specific on two examples.  1) Darwinism and 2) Abortion and Stem-Cell Research.    Why do I feel the need to stand up against the idea of teaching children about Evolution?  Why do I want to stand up against the humanistic agenda of destroying the minds and souls of our children?  Why do I feel the need to push for the consideration of Intelligent Design to be offered toward these same children?  Because evolution is false.  Evolution is not true.  Evolution holds no solid ground.  Have I studied evolution?  Yes.  Before becoming a Christian I was an outspoken apostle of Evolution until I was shown the facts and the facts are this...evolution is a fallacy and the only reason why Evolution is being so championed in the class rooms is because the humanist/liberal hate Christians.  They call us anti-intellectuals, strangely enough, and  yet the driving force of the liberal party is a paranoid dilution driven hatred toward Christians.  Here are some authors and their titles that I challenge you with:  Ralph Muncaster's Dismantling Evolution; Phillip Johnson's Darwin on Trial; David Snoke's A Biblical Case for an Old Earth; and finally, Fazale Rana and Hugh Ross' Who was Adam.    Then there is abortion.  What is so scientific about abortion?  You kill a child.  Simple.  Why should the scientific community care so much about abortion?  Because they do not understand the concept of human rights (their human rights are rights that go along with whatever the PC pop culture has to say this week).  Stem-Cell research is a tag along on the abortion supporting train because these so called scientists want you the reader to think that if the two do not go together then all these people will die a painful death if Stem-Cell research is not provided.  Abortion in itself is murder.  Simple as that.  You murder a child.  A child with a mind, a child with a heart, and a child with a soul.  That is not emotional blackmail toward women, that is just the simple truth.  And Stem-Cell research?  You do not have to harvest embryos like some scientist and politician out of Brave New World.  There are far better ways, far safer way, to study Stem-Cell and how it may or may not help those who are in need.  I suggest you read works such as ProLife Answers to ProChoice Arguments by Randy Alcorn    There is no Republican war against science.  There are many scientists like David Snoke and Hugh Ross that stand up and support the truth that comes, from the very heart of the matter, from the Bible.  Republicans and Christians do not long for some "Dark Age" of society.  They, we, I, want the truth to be shown in society away from the liberal bewitching Christianphobic fanaticism that comes from those like Sam Harris and Chris Mooney 
 I picked this book up because I was intrigued by the title.  Unfortunately, it only took me seconds to see that the author had a very specific ideology that was ignoring other psychological and historical viewpoints.   For example, the author points out that "adults are on time" and that being late is an "act of passive aggressiveness."  While this can be true many times, it is certainly not true all the time.  Anyone who knows the Jungian based Myers-Briggs personality test will know that "perceivers" are notoriously late because they get easily distracted while "judgers" are frequently early for every appointment.  But in the author's world, only the "J" personality type is "mature."  Another statement the author makes, on the very same page, is that being adult means "raising your own children."  Sounds fair on its face.  However, it ignores historical and economic facts.  The nuclear family of two parents and children is a 20th century creation.  In the past, societies had extended families that were heavily involved in the rearing of the children while parents worked.  This is still true in many societies even today.  So how does this become a definition of maturity across the board?  I don't get it.  Obviously, people shouldn't just have children willy-nilly and ignore their needs.  But the author's perspective is pretty much B&W.  Their is no gray.  (IMO, this is in itself a statement of immaturity.)  The whole thing just smacks of a certain political mindset.  My advice: Take the Myers-Briggs test, find out what you are, figure out what parts of your personality need some work.  This is a far better solution than having this author spoon feed you her personal views 
 The book is chock full of examples and anecdotes but really has no new worthwhile conceptualizations or insights to make it worth reading.  If you don't know anything about database marketing, then you will get something out of this book.  If you are familiar with the basic concepts of customer database analysis, loyalty programs and relationship marketing, there is nothing new here.  In fact a much better introduction to all those concepts is The Loyalty Effect by Reichenheld or Customer Connections by Wayland and Cole.  The subtitle mentions the dot com world, but the book has little to say about the Internet.  The book really does not cover CRMs (as oppsed to database marketing) in that it fails describe how CRM systems work and what database, modeling and communications platforms are required to implement them 
 I am a nursing student and former editor with a Master's degree in English.  This may sound extreme, but I think this book is dangerous. The problem with this book goes beyond wordiness, poor organization and contradictory information. It involves a process.  The student dedicates an hour or two reading a chapter, puts the book down and says, Boy, I've worked hard; I must have learned something.  And, yes, the student has worked hard. Very hard. The student has waded thigh-high in verbiage for nearly two hours. So, he's right to think he's worked hard to understand the material.  But that doesn't mean the student has learned a commensurate amount. He hasn't.   In other words, this book is deceptive. You work hard, so you think that translates into knowledge, but what you're working hard to do is to understand what in the heck the authors are saying.  This book needs a no-nonsense editor. Someone who understands that more words doesn't mean greater clarity.   The school I attend uses this book. I suffered the first year; the second year, I never touched this book. I bought a different one.  If you're a student, don't waste your time, like I did. Your hours will be better spent with other texts. 
 in the picture it shows the jacket plain black with orange inside. when i got it it patches all over it saying the name brand, that were velcro so when i pulled them off i had velcro patches all over the outside of the jacket. i had to take it to a seamstress to have them removed. the kind of material would have been easy to damage if i had tried to remove them myself. i was very disapointed and will never order from them again 
 This is not very good book for D50.  The reason that author tries to explain two things at once.  Fist how to take great photographs and second how to use array of custom functions on D50.  He doesn't successes in either.  Writer doesn't explain fully complexities of multiple functions of the camera.  As for "how to take great picture" there are tens of books on that topic which explains art of photography in many details.  Recommend instead to get truly technical book on all D50 functions "Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon D50" by Simon Stafford.  I promise you will get more information from this book as to how use technical abilities of D50 to full potential.  Do you for instance know that D50 doesn't lock simultaneously Exposure and Focus while you half-press release button (It locks only focus), because it's D50's default setting.  You would think AF-AE are locked when you press release button halfway, because it works so in many and many cameras even point and shoot digital, but not for Nikon D50 (though you can make it so, explained in a book).  
 As I was perusing the reviews to decide whether or not I wanted to purchase this book, one thing has struck me as strange. Has anyone noticed that all the five star reviews are from "a reader" and are written in basically the same style? All of them are very well-written, complete with proper grammar---the kind of correct grammar that only a professional writer uses. It's making me skeptical about the good reviews this book has recieved. 
 I don't find the exploits of a low-life thief with no morals to be entertaining.  Poorly written and a complete waste of money.  
 Thing was in Borders, read part - embarrassed to buy.  Ramblings of a nitwit;  absolute crud.   
 Objective?  The reviewer that called this book 'objective and factual' wasn't reading the same book I read.  Factual perhaps, but objective...no way.  There are so many good points in this book, but they get lost amid the nasty digs and political slant.    The insinuation that the misery and insecurity that women's magazines shovel is part of some large liberal conspiracy is laughable.  The author is guilty of what she accuses her liberal media colleagues of doing.  The message is a mixed one; you are woman therefore you are strong and powerful yet blame the liberals for all the bad messages you've been fed over the years.  Where's the empowerment in pointing fingers and assigning blame?    The driving force behind what goes into magazines is whatever sells.  You could easily argue that no one forced women to buy those magazines and read those articles.  If there's anyone to blame, we should be pointing the finger back at ourselves.  Our empowerment lies in our ability to vote using the dollars we spend or, as the case may be, refuse to spend 
 The only good thing about this movie was the special effects involved in the parting of the sea of reeds.  Indeed, this was well done.  The acting, direction, and the script was an absolute abomination from the reference point of any reasonable level of inspection.  Now, I know that artistic license is usually taken in the production of such a movie, but if one wants to make a movie that involves some made-up items added to the actual story, then he should at least make it interesting and meaningful.  You want to see a good movie?  Then see 'Moses' starring Ben Kingsley 
 I like the design of the headset.  It is lightweight.  The way the headset hangs to your ear might feel a little weird from time to time, but if you are playing a game in your pc and using this device for voice comm you would probably ignore the awkward feeling in your ear after you get sucked into the game.  Unfortunately, for me, this device did not deliver what it promised:  1.- when you connect the device Windows will use it as the preferred sound device.  So when if you are trying to play a game and you are using other comm software to chat with your teammates, instead of using your primary sound device for the game and the LifeChat sound device for the voice, windows will switch to the LifeChat sound device for all sounds, which, in my view defeats the purpose of the headset.  You can get around this by selecting your primary sound driver from the windows settings menu, but this is a pain.  2.- The sound is VERY low and muffled.  The mike has a buzzing background noise, a lot of feedback and echo.  I have had problems trying to understand what my team mates say and they can barely understand me.  The POOR sound quality renders this device useless.  I wished it was different... generally speaking, I like MS products, but this one really disappointed me, specially since I was looking forward to get it for so long. 
 This book did not keep my son's interest at all. He is 2. I was quite disappointed at this book. 
 the box it came in looked like it had been torn apart by a pack of wild dogs when i received it.  fur was falling off of the coat as i pulled it out of the box.  i tried it on just to see if i'd like a replacement since it was not in perfect condition, and it was NOT cute on.  i immediately returned it 
 Amos Oz, is in my judgment, one of the greatest contemporary writers. His memoir " A Tale of Love and Darkness" is a  literary classic of tremendous power. However Oz is also a 'political prophet'. And often holds forth in a way as if to suggest he feels himself taking upon himself the mantle of his Biblical namesake. Here he should perhaps have been a bit more cautious and remembered the Jewish teaching that in our time 'prophecy' is given to 'children' and ' fools'. In this small gathering of small works Oz reiterates his well- known analysis of the Israeli- Arab conflict. It is as he understands it a 'dispute over land' between two peoples each of whom has a legitimate claim. The fanatics on one side( A fanatic in Oz's term is one for whom every means even the most bloody justifies the end) are those who say ' all is mine, and nothing is the others'. The reasonable people of which Oz is as he understands it preeminently one( though he makes it clear he too was raised as a little fanatic in pre- Jewish state 'Palestine') understand that there has to be a painful, reasonable compromise. The end of fanaticism is as he understands it the end of the Arab- Israeli conflict. A divided Holy Land, two states, one predominantly Jewish, and one Arab.  This analysis is of course not simply Oz's but has been the analysis of the moderate left in Israel, a good share of Western European Governments, and successive U.S. administrations.It now is the 'dream' of the vast majority of Israelis. It is on the basis of this analysis that US diplomatic initiatives in the Middle East has been conducted for more than half - a - century.  The problem however is that the analysis is drawn along too broad, too symmetrical and at the same time too limited lines. It is not right to say that the conflict is 'primarily' about land. Such a position was more credible three decades ago, but today given the rise of a worldwide pan-Islamic movement , it  misses the mark.  The truth is that what Oz calls 'fanatics' are the great majority on the Islamic Palestinian side. ( He denies this, but the recent 'Hamas' victory in the Palestinian elections suggests he is once again ' sweeting' Palestinian positions) . The fact is that there is no symmetry between the ' fanaticism' of the Islamic world and the alleged 'fanaticism' of the Jews even those Oz calls ' settlers'. There is no Jewish Literature no settler Literature calling for the extermination of Palestinians, as there is daily Palestinian and Arab propaganda calling for the murder and elimination of Jews.There has never been deliberate Israeli effort at murdering Palestinian civilians, while murdering of Israeli civilians is a generally accepted Palestinian tactic.  Oz misleads and presents a false picture in harping on an alleged an unreal symmetry between Israelis and Palestinians. One question of course is why he would want to do this? One answer is very simply that the kind of answer he gives makes a reasonable solution possible. Another answer is that it of course puts him above , makes him the good guy with the Europeans the Americans the Nobel Prize Committee , everyone else who would like to see the conflict resolved in this way.  Perhaps what I have just said is unfair, though Oz's tendency to preach his own views becomes increasingly irritating as they diverge with the years from the 'reality on the ground'. Had Oz' had a bit more honesty he would have given up certain familiar 'socialist egalitarian 'mantras of his  youth- and understood that there is a tremendous assymetry between the Jewish Israeli position and the Islamic Palestinian one. He would have had the honesty to understand that one very vast civilization, the Islamic, has a set of problems , which are endangering other human beings throughout the world. One such leader of that civilization , a leader who considers himself the great protector of the Palestinians, Mohammed Ahmadinejad has been continually threatening to wipe 'Israel ' from the map.  Perhaps Oz's analysis on ' fanaticism' would have been more convincing had it focused on  Mr.Ahmadinejad and his ilk.  i.e. Willy- nilly whether it likes it or not , Oz's country Israel is involved in the conflict of those who champion freedom and democracy against those Totalitarian- Terrorist- Islamic Regimes which would make the 'Koran' our sole bed-time reading.    
 I dont take neither stance on Religion nor Science with these comments.  I have read the book and I have to admit that it was marketed and was presented brilliantly. It has one goal... Sell, sell, sell.  If you are after useful, quality, informative, knowledge to gain... well you wont find it here. Im so shocked to even see that when you check the back cover of the book it actually says "non-fiction".  The author is a talented story teller...... add a few statistics here and there, a dash of scientific key figures, mix it with life's controversial unsolved mysteries, a few more dash of historic events and famous people, add and link a few references here and there, and WALA!!!! you have a best seller.  Isnt that ironic! it is a "New York Times number 1 best seller"  It was an interesting read though. 
 I read this book for school, my sister said it would get better, but it turned out to be the worst book I've ever read. I rest my case. 
 YO THIS JOINT IS WACK. ITS A WASTE OF TIME I DON'T WHY I BROUGHT IT. YOUR BEST BET IS TO WAIT FOR LIL WEEZEE TO DROP HIS NEXT ALBUM. HE IS CASH MONEY NOW. SINCE JUVE HAS LEFT MAYBE THE REST OF THE HOT BOYS SHOULD CONSIDER IT TOO MICKEY AND LAC ARE JUST PLAIN WACK. MANNIE FRESH HAS BEEN SURPASSED BY THE LIKES OF TIMBERLAND, NEPTUNES,TRACK MASTERS HIS BEATS JUST CAN'T COMPETE ANYMORE. CASH MONEY SHOULD LOOK INTO LETTING SOMEONE ELSE DO THEIR TRACKS INSTEAD OF MANNIE DOING THE WHOLE ALBUM BECAUSE HE HAS LOST HIS TOUCH 
 I was very disappointed in this movie ~ it was a definite "sleeper" 
 This book was assigned school reading.  I found it rather boring and the language used in the story became annoying after a while.  Not recommended 
 Oasis arrogance is way out of proportion to their actual talent which is miniscule. If you want something real buy any album from The Beatles or the Beach Boys.  This is music for people that get excited about strip malls 
 This book will be a lovely addition to my compost heap.  I couldn't find any sense in the character's motivations so the whole mess became a simple, predictable voyage through a hamlet that any five-year-old could have dreamt up.  When coming across this one on the shelf, my advice is to keep on browsing 
 Davis's treatment repeatedly tells us how boring other histories are until we are bored with the repetition.  Then he gives us the thinnest liberal telling.  White men were all bad, indians were good.  Women were brave.  Conservatives are anti-semites.  Republicans are bad and pro business.  Anti-communism was silly. And all history is filtered through the vietnam protestor's filter. Mr. Davis is boring and totally predictable and has sacrificed accuracy for liberal orthodoxy.  This is offensive when it neglects Margaret Sanger's racism, and communist depredations 
 I ordered this book after reading the rave reviews and the who's who of public school using this format.  Nowhere is it advertised or even mentioned that this is a Christian book, espousing Christian dogma and assumptions.  I'm surprised this is acceptable for use by Government funded public schools.  Furthermore, there is a lot of non-scientific rhetoric in the book that eschews logical debate and exposition.  I'm very disappointed and consider this to be false advertising.   Some of the parenting tips are common sense that I didn't think needed to be reiterated.  A person already interested enough in buying a book would already have the basics down.  I was looking for more than that.  The advertising led me to believe that the book would be about language manipulation, how to speak more effectively with children to ease the learning process. There is false logic in some of the parental mistakes.  An example is always attributing "hovering parents" to ego issues, that a parent "needs to be needed".  Some hovering parents are survivors of abuse and can't see the lines between normal risks and when a child is in real danger.  False assumptions leads to false conclusions.   I gave this  2 stars with the thought that someone who is so out of the loop and a danger to their child may read this book-at least could adopt some common sense.  But it isn't helping my family.  
 This book consists of theses, written by researchers in various fields, on various themes such as hyperreality, fashion, capitalism, postmodernism, and feminism. Therefore, I think that there are some theses in which  Baudrillardfs thoughts are not understood at all. The constitution of this  book is not so good because each researcher mention freely to various  notions without big theme that combines each thesis. It is disappointing  that discussions on Baudrillard do not develop between each thesis. If each  thesis were complementary to each other, this book would be more  interesting and more controversial 
 I purchased this for my eight year old niece. We were both disappointed when it broke after only two weeks.  Be prepared to have limited options for fun without downloading it on your computer. The program takes up a lot of memory on your computer's hard drive 
 i just finished reading the book.  there is nothing in it about velocity... It's boring, predictable and has lots of "filler text 
 I had to watch this movie for my english class it was a typical Spike Lee Film- meant to be funny, but leading astray until his point was to make a political statement.  The film went from racial satire to blatant racism.  Yet another great Spike Lee film 
 When I saw so-so actioner 'Belly of the Beast,' I thought Steven Seagal was well on the way to his 'comeback,' finally realizing that authentic-looking martial arts actions are what gave him the stardom, which is however fading away very fast.  Now I saw this film, and know I was terribly wrong.  His next film 'Out of Reach' is a huge letdown, probably the final nail in the coffin.  Don't get me wrong, I really like his films made in the 90s, like 'Under Siege' action-packed escapism entertainment.  In 'Out of Reach' Steven Seagal plays one Billy Ray Lancing, an ex-agent living in the wilds of Canada, where he finds injured animals and bring them to health.  Yet another embironmentally conscious hero from Seagal, but ... doesn't he see that these social messages have nothing to do with making good action films?   Add to that, Billy Ray exchanges letters with a little girl Irena living in an orphanage in Poland.  When it is reported that she is missing, and a nasty businee of 'human traffic' is suspected, he travels there incognito, secures a help from the local policewoman (while he has no ID), speaks a bit of French, and hits a PC keyboard like a pro, better than a Polish technichian, to restore a secretly recorded image.  We meet a hissable baddie (Matt Schultz), but anyway we are sure Seagal will win, because he has taught the little girl how to decode the 'cyphers' (and check out how she uses it, a scene which makes unexpectedly hilarious 'you-gotta-be-kiddin' 0moment).   So, how about the fact-moving kicking and chopping, once Seagal's trademark?  No, these thrilling martial arts actions are gone forever in this new film.  You just don't have actions in 'Out of Reach.'  As I counted them, well, in the first 40 minutes of 'Out Of Reach' you can see only two action set-pieces: in one, Seagal's hero Billy breaks a few arms and legs of the unkind government agents (about 30 seconds), and much later Billy smashes the glass of hotel bathroom and drops an assassin onto a parked car (another 30 seconds).  That's it, that's all.  There are more actions to come, obligatory shoot-outs and sword fights, but not enough to call 'Out of Reach' an action film.  The pace is terribly tedious, the images (when at night) are too dark, and worst of all, not only Seagal but slmost all the Polish cast sleepwalk in the pedestrian story.  Little girl looks bored while she is supposed to be in danger.   Finally, about director Po-Chih Leong (fairly good in Jude Law's brooding thriller with a vampire theme 'The Immortal') who is the least likely choice in Seagal's entire filmography to succeed in staging exciting actions, and the results turned out as we feared.  The slow-paced story is sleep-inducing, and what little action bits in the film are amateurish at best, with poorly-constructed shots in which fast editing attempts to conceal Seagal is no longer moving his bodies like he used to do.                
 There are so many good Crawford titles yet to be released on DVD that you have to wonder why they are releasing this trash which Crawford herself hated. She said that if she was ever to suffer for her past sins, this is the movie that would be shown to her over and over again. She also found John Wayne to be miscast.    Also to be released on DVD around the same time as "Reunion in France" is another of Crawford's worst films "Trog".  Seriously, who decides these releases?  What fans want most of all are the unreleased Crawford classics such as "Story of Esther Costello", "A Woman's Face', "Strange Cargo" and "Susan and God".  Besides the DVD releases of "Baby Jane", "Grand Hotel" and "Mildred Pierce" some years back, the DVD releases for Crawford so far have been dismal and look set to continue.  Warner Bros and MGM take note:  please release the better films from Crawford's catalogue and stop wasting time with films like "Reunion in France" and "Trog". 
  I find it hard to believe this is the same band that created Cruelty And The Beast.  I liked all COF up to this release right here. Cradle hasn't been a Black Metal band since Cruelty, and after that they still at least had some good tunes. I can't believe they released this with a straight face. If they keep up down this road, they'll be seen on Jay Leno before you know it. It's bad enough they were on Viva La Bam on MTV, a show that pushes Billy Idol and other posers not worth mentioning here. The good thing about this? There's still great Black Metal bands around that aren't playing to 'the teenage crowd." If this has you down listen to these Gods: Mayhem, Tsjuder, Gorgoroth, Darkthrone, Blood Ritual, even Dimmu Borgir hasn't strayed this far into teen/mtv land.   
 This is a book that could (should?) have faded into history without being a great loss to the world. Yes, there are a few interesting bits of political philosophy, but they're far and few between, and mainly either just thrown out as Montesquieu's personal opinions with little to no evidence or examination, or flimsily based on historical examples. As a reader, I didn't find most of his arguments (where he didn't seem to be contradicting himself, which happens frequently) very convincing. This was obviously written with the 18th century French salon crowd in mind, and reads as such. I'm sure it provided a lot of aristocrats with conversation fodder to make them appear intelligent and educated at the time, but these days it just seems like an antiquated bit of history.  He claims the book has to be read as a whole to see the structure and his overall goal; well, I did read the whole book and at the end couldn't see an overarching structure at all. The work just seemed like a long, rambling, unorganized mess. The only people I might really recommend this to are people interested in Greek, Roman, and French history (especially legal history), but not to people interested in political science or philosophy.  Bump this one to the bottom of your list of classics on historical thought, there are much more interesting reads out there 
 Gideon's Spies is packed full of exhilarating and outlandish tales of the Mossad's exploits.  It is, however, notably short on accuracy and journalistic integrity.  Some of its claims are obviously false and many others cannot be substantiated and hinge of the testimony of mysterious unidentified sources. The book reads like fiction and many of its stories likely are just that 
 I loved the idea behind the python, and set it up easily enough. I think its a total rip off to charge $50 for a piece of plastic tubing with some plastic attached to it.  The hose adapter that attaches to the faucet broke so easily when i screwed it in. It takes ALOT of water pressure to make this work correctly. The replacement piece of plastic cost me $10 bucks more than the already rip off Python. Good concept but made of cheap stuff, get a metal/iron one or make your own!! 
 This CD is NOT Flamenco! I'm not sure exactly what to call it, but it is not Flamenco. And half the time the guy hits some really off-key notes. I would not recommend this CD to anyone. If you want to hear some great guitar music by someone who knows how to play the guitar, try music by the guitarist known as Pavlo 
 This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I enjoy all types of books and was looking for something light and entertaining as a break from heavier reading. The characters were totally unbelievable and shallow. The book was supposed to be a mix of sci-fi, suspense, and romance. The sci-fi part was fun, I'll admit. The suspense consisted of a mediocre crime plot, that was very graphic and disturbing in its description. The romance was nonexistent, unless you consider gratuitous sex scenes romantic. I know that Nora Roberts is known for the "steamy sex scenes" in her books, but these scenes were just stuck in there for the sake of their steaminess. They had no connection to the story whatsoever. The relationship between the protagonist and her husband was based solely on sex. What made this especially unbelievable was the fact that the main character was a survivor of abuse/incest. I'm no expert, but you'd think somebody with this type of background would have a few issues regarding sex/intimacy. I just thought the book was awful. Flat characters, silly predictable mystery. I left it on the train and feel sorry for the poor soul who picks it up 
 AAAhh, another wonderful book from old Abbie Hoffman, with his endless critique of American society and how other people live their lives, plus Hoffman's sage advice for rising up to his exalted level. I heard near the end of his life Hoffman was working on a book tentatively entitled How To Successfully Deal With Manic Depression. I'm sure it would've been another great book from ole' Ab, filled with his usual stellar advice for successful living, except Hoffman committed suicide half way through writing it.  (P.S.: Hey Real Patriot, you really are a real dunce.  I never criticized Alan Watts for being an "alcholic."  I criticized him for being an utter phony who presented himself as the exact opposite of what he really was.  Listen, dude, why don't you do me a little favor:  Take the time to actually READ what I'm saying before you check in with your dim-witted rebuttal.  And speaking of which, why don't you actually READ my book ("Surviving on the Streets") before you start putting words in my mouth.  I say right in print that I don't blame anybody but myself for ending up on the streets.  We're all responsible for our own karma.    (P.P.S.  As for heroic anti-war demonstrators like Abbie Hoffman, Vietnam was in fact the LONGEST war in U.S. history.  So one might argue the '60s anti-war protesters were the LEAST effective in U.S. history.  Abbie Hoffman is typical of that ineffectual ilk.  Hoffman was supposedly working to end the Vietnam war, but as soon as it ended, Hoffman was the first to admit how much he actually missed that war because, he no longer had a soapbox from which to parade his bloated, fatuous ego to the world.  Which is all Abbie Hoffman ever really cared about.  And your comments about Hoffman's mental sickness are well taken. But before you put words in my mouth (like you did with your comments about Alan Watts' "alcoholism") let me point out, I am NOT criticizing Abbie Hoffman for being mentally imbalanced.  I'm just pointing out what happens when a person who is a sickness advertises himself as a cure.)  
 So-so movie. It has it's good parts along with some boring parts but overall, good special effects with the ghosts. There were bloody parts in this movie making it more enjoyable to watch. When a very rich man dies and leaves his state of the art home to his nephew, he moves in with his family only to find out that there are things in the house that he was not aware of............. many ghosts. Just a OK movie. 
 This Bobber Cooler is definitely a conversation piece.  I have had so many comments about it. I used it when floating down a small river near home (No Rapids, just calm water), it doesn't hold its weight, literally. The first thing is that the opening is in the center of the cooler, making it impossible to get drinks out with out pulling the whole cooler out of the water.  The opening seam rides just barely about the water, and since it is round the weight shifts a little and the seam will dip into the water. The cooler then fills up with water, which almost immediatly melts the ice, and as it fills up it will sink to the bottom.  maybe if there was a rubber gasket to seal it better, it might be ok.  The 2 plastic clasps on each side used to close the cooler are really easy to break off, plus they are facing the wrong direction. If you bump something like a rock or a log, it will push the clasp back and then unlatch the cooler.  This cooler might be good to use in bodys of water that do not have current, like a pool, but I don't suggest towing it behind anything.  I suggest using one of the many inflateble coolers on the market 
 they have no talent and are extremely bland to listen t 
 My book group chose this book by the interesting description here and review.  The idea of a spinster leaving her family to become a witch intrigued us all, but we were disappointed in the book.  We found the character not very interesting, and the lack of action calmed us all into slumber while trying to read it.  It wasn't a terrible book, it had some interesting things to say, but we could not understand all the immensely positive reviews here 
 I think the only UB40 tracks on this album are, I got you babe,Don't break my heart,Hip hop lyrical robot and my fav Mi spliff.I don't know why but these songs were then released on the LP Little baggariddim.This is still a  good album if you like the mix of the two sound 
 When our book club selected this novel, I was enthusiastic ~ the premise appeared to leave so much room for the development of great characters and a great story.  However, after the first chapter or so, I kept waiting for the big "wow" factor...and it never came.  I found most of the characters unsympathetic and not very well-developed.  Like other readers, I finished it out of obligation, but never gleaned any enjoyment from reading it.  
 Yes, unfortunately, this is just Central Eastern Europe Historical Atlas. The real Historical Atlas of Eastern Europe should include history of such countries as Russia and Ukraine as well as a lot of small countries (Belarus, Moldova, Baltic States, etc.). History of the mentioned countries are very interesting. For example, if we take a part of Ukraine - Crimea. History of Crimea is very rich: from Scythians and Greeks through Byzantines, Tatars and Osmans to Russians and Ukrainians. The authors have cut biggest part of Eastern Europe and I am affraid it is too much.. 
 I would like to reiterate a few points that I've seen in other reviews but I don't think were stressed enough. You should know this before you consider buying the dvd: 1. The acting is horrible.  horrible. 2. The film was obviously low budget. 3. It is over thirty years old, and it feels dated. 4. The story (which was amazing as a novel) did not translate well to film. Don't waste your time on the movie 
 Since the reviews about broken wires were both written well over 1-2 years ago, I thought surely the problem had been corrected.  Why would a company continue to sell a broken product?  Well, apparently this company is perfectly fine doing just that!  Like previous posters, the wire on my board arrived broken. There is no damage to the packing, so it is not a shipping issue.  I ordered this product for a Superbowl party in a few days.  Obviously I cannot use it.  I haven't been able to find a number, just an address, so I can't even complain about it today.  DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!  Amazon...wake up and quit allowing your customers to buy this item.  It reflects poorly on you 
 Talk about a waste of time!  I was wondering if it was just me so I asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it.  It is boring, tells you instead of shows you, hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all.  I also found the protrayal of the grandmother's flirtation with Islam to be shallow, un-informed, unbelievable and ultimately dismissive. Don't waste your time on this or your money. Luckily I had picked it up at a book sale for $0.25, about what it was worth 
 I haven't read this book, although I expect that it is probably very good since J.A. Jance wrote it.  I have buying all her books for some years. However, I have been buying paperback books for a lot longer, probably longer than Jance has been writing.  But NOW, book publishers, not satisfied with an average increase of more than 30% in the retail price, have come up with a "new" size for more comfortable reading.  BALONEY!! It's for greed! I do not intend to buy this new size.  Having carried paperbacks in my briefcase for more than 50 years.  I doubt that the publishers will even notice.  After all, I am 80+ years of age and the volume of my book buys are of little interest to the new breed of publishers. I will miss my many favorite authors but not for long. Goodbye, Adios, Adieu, and vaya con DIOS.  J. Dwayne Taylor - jdlet@tstar.ne 
 This book was suggested to me by one of my co-workers with whom I frequently debated different topics.  I picked it up with slight hesistation because of differences of opinion between the two of us. While Harris addresses several issues within this book, I often felt that he moved between cause's too quickly.  Instead of addressing one cause and demonstrating it's impact on the myth completly, he tends to introduce the point, and then just as quickly move on to the next point with out finalizing his point. I think I may have enjoyed the point a bit more had he followed through on his points a bit more. The other issue I had with this book boiled down to Harris' writing style.  While reading the book, I felt as though every other sentence was "I believe", "I will demonstrate", "I propose", etc.  It should be understood that these are the authors points, that is why his name is on the cover.  The inclusion of these phrases detracted from the reading of this book while adding nothing to the subject at hand.  The book also seemed to be written as a teaching aid to a college class in the regards that at the end of the chapters, it felt as if there was no conclusion reached....almost that the book was written to introduce thoughts and to promote speculation by the readers, without taking a stance on the issues at hand. Overall, this book had the potential to be a real page turner, but the authors questionable writing style made it almost unreadable, at least for this reader 
 This book is a joke.  I believe there is a sentence in the book referring to cows having to eat special feed to produce good milk.  That feed most likely includes BGH (bovine growth hormone), antibiotics, and animal protein (chickens, pigs, dogs, cats, etc.).  The dairy industry has done a great job at sugar-coating the truth about what goes on.  The truth is that 1) milk is NOT necessary for children, 2) milk has been linked with various autoimmune diseases including Type 1 diabetes and rhematoid arthritis, and 3) milk is NOT a necessary source for calcium.  In fact, leafy greens offer enough calcium.  Please do your research before taunting the benefits of milk.  And for goodness sakes, don't teach children a sugar-coated recount of what goes on in processing milk.  Tell them that milk can contain feces of the cows.  Tell them that antibiotics are necessary for the dairy cows because farmers have given them hormones to increase their milk production and their utters are infected, oozing puss and blood.    I don't know if this review will even get published; I just hope it does 
 Tells you what you should be doing but doesn't tell you how to do it. He explains what the quadrants are and goes in WAY too much detail describing the different types of people in these quadrants and does not tell you how to get from the employee quadrant to the investor quadrant. Makes suggestions like start a business or develop a business system. No mention on how to do that.   I just finished reading his Yahoo Finance article "A Taste for Debt" from 10/31/06 about upcoming tough financial times and he ends the article in typical Kioysaki (no explanation or in depth advice) fashion by saying "So what do I recommend? For now, enjoy the party, don't drink too much, and stay close to the exits".  Thanks for that Robert. I can't wait to not recommend and never buy one of your books again 
 Actually, I have to say this is not something worth buying, even if you are a die-hard fan, which I can say without any doubt in my mind, I am. proof? i have drumsticks and picks from countless shows, shirts, cds, posters etc signed by all the ladies, and of course every ladies room cd and ep/demo/yellow tape/itunes recording they have ever put out... and i was truly dissapointed by this DVD, it is advertized as a live show with interviews, and that part is fine, but the only extra feature is you get to watch the interview uncut... no 'maroon foot cream' or DVD-rom features. if you know someone that has it, watch it so that you can say you have seen it. But I wouldn't recomend spending more than five dollars on this BNL item 
 This more I think about this book, the more thought provoking it becomes.  First, I find it amazing that anyone could take a belief that's widely known (practically a cliche), add nothing of substance to it, and actually write a book about it.  Second, I find it even more amazing that it took 134 pages to make the Golden Rule applicable to business.  Third, and perhaps the most amazing of all, is the fact that I actually spent my own hard earned money on this book.  What amazing insights did I think would be uncovered?  I'll save you $9.72 (+s/h) and the 45 minutes it'll take you to read this.  Here goes... Unless you were raised by wolves, it's pretty likely you've heard of the Golden Rule.  Ok, now think about how this rule can be applied to all of your business dealings.  That's it - you got it!    Whew!  Now that you have an extra $9.72 in your pocket and 45 minutes of free time, go practice that Golden Rule by treating your kids/grandkids/neighbors to some ice cream 
 I should have done extensive research prior to buying this book, it lacks a very important feature in my opinion, the sample pictures have no information on how it was taken, no shutter speed, ISO lens or F-stop guides. I later found such a book, but I will allow you to do your own research 
 I purchased the F69204 for $150 on sale. Used once that year with good results. It was another year before I tried to use again. Shortly after starting the motor, it froze up and quit. On disassembly I found that roller bearings are not used in the motor, instead an oil soaked felt type bearing that failed. The parts book said you could order the motor alone,but when I attempted this I was told you had to order the complete motorizing unit for a cost of $90 plus shipping. In the future I will stick with the cheaper middle grade units that I have had excellent results with and are cheap enough to discard and buy an new one if they fail 
 Like a drag queen,this movie is melodramatic,wears too much make-up&is over-the-top.Watching this movie before going to work at 4 in the morning,I found this a hoot.(If this movie were in theaters,people would be in tears---from laughing so hard!!)  One of the gems is when Dolly's controlling boyfriend drawls,"A man is supposed to go after the younger ones,not the woooman!" Put on a fake Texas accent&it works.  There's the Sappy Sequence in which Dolly meets with her mother,looks at photographs of herself,then gets a heart-to-heart with her pastor.Awwwwww...Did Thomas Kinkade ever get directing credits?  Of course,one must suspend disbelief when the Handsome Young Guitarist falls for Dolly.For someone somewhere,they're an archetypal couple.I haven't found that someone.The movie has a hilarious love triange,enough melodrama for 10 Lifetime films--and songs to tie in with the plot,no less!It's country-fried soap opera!Come 'an get it 
 i love terry pratchett's work; i've read plenty of great discworld books, and even a few that i thought were just mediocre (by pratchett standards) but this book is crap. just a sorry pitiful excuse for bringing back rincewind from the nether regions. if you've never read terry pratchett, do NOT start with this. and if you're just dying to know how Rincewind got back into the discworld... well, save yourself the 5 bucks and dream up your own story, its bound to be better than this. i don't feel that pratchett put his best efforts into this, rather, i get the impression someone begged him to bring back rincewind, maybe shoved some money in his face until finally, the author said, "yeah, fine, i'll write it tonight while i'm on the toilet" i just wished he'd flushed 
 i finally decided to purchase this movie considering i was told by one person it was symbolic and by another it was truely disgusting.  however i found it to be very slow and boring which made want to go to sleep, making it difficult for me to actually catch any of this great symbolism i heard about.  as far as the digusting goes....i didn't find it that disgusting compared to some movies i have seen.  it isn't very explicit in the violence so there is not any gore to it and they aren't very innovative with the torture compared to some movies i have seen. the movie consists of alot of monotonous sodomy and an old lady telling stories of her sexual exploits while her friend plays the piano (these parts were rather torturous to sit through because they were the most boring in the film and she told quite a few stories).  if you want to see something shocking i would not look here and if you are looking for symbolism i wouldn't look here because it is difficult to stay awake unless you like watching a bunch of naked people walking around groping one another 
 Did not do what it says it does.  Only thing this does is remove large scratches.  No matter how many times you put this stuff on the small scratches are still.  Plus it leaves crusty white stuff on the disc and smears.  Not sure if discs are better before or after the application of this stuff.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Wait no you don't.  All I got was a jewel case, two pads, and two tiny packets of solution.  What a rip off.  Didn't even get a manual.  What kind of advertisement is this?  I know, the black market kind 
 I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.  But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books 
 Being familiar with some Adobe products, we opted to try this at work as a cheaper alternative than some other packages for simple web graphics work.  Boy, were we disappointed.  Simply put, this tool is not so much a tool, but a hindrance.  Utilities such as transparencies, are not only difficult to make work properly, but hidden in non-intuititve locations.  Dialogs are non-standard, which requires getting used to strange layouts in design.  While seeminly small for just a couple items I've mentioned, multiply this by the supposed feature set of the product and you start to get an idea of how cumbersome the tool really is.  As has been mentioned by plenty of other people, it is also slow.  If you want a simple image viewer, find anything else - even freeware, as I have never come across an image utility that takes so long to load, regardless of it is the first time or the umpteenth time.  While I could go on about the unsatisfactory qualities of this product, I will simple reiterate what others had also said; it is cumbersome to use, slow to use and load, un-intuitive with poor layout and design, and lacks many basic features one would expect in this form of utility. 
 The other books in this series were OK. I found this book too slow paced to stay interested for long. It was very easy to put the book aside in favor of other books. I think the reason Fleur Monley desired the 'white marriage' was a weak excuse considering the extent of her fear. When her reason was revealed I thought,"That's all?" As for Dante, I didn't care for him much. He seemed too juvenile to me. He was very irresponsible. While this book isn't awful, the others in the series are better. The only real reason I can see to read this book is that the reader would want to finish up the entire series, not leaving a book unread 
 This is one of those books that's so bad you can use it to judge critics -- because if *anybody* says it's well written, or well plotted, or has good characterizations, THEY'RE NUTS.  The fact is, there's NO characterization, the sentence constructions are painful, and at least one major plot point is impossible.  (If you're paying even a minimum of attention, you'll put the book down and go, "HUH?")  This book is good for exactly one thing:  it shows you don't have to spend a lot of time writing a book -- or even be a competent writer -- to have a best seller.  I don't mind mindless escapism -- heck, I'll give Janet Evanovitch two thumbs WAY up -- but when it's a trash heap like this it gives reading a bad name 
 I was disappointed like many of the previous readers, mostly having to do with non-existent character development (all clones of each other), insipid dialogue and no real suspense because the mission was done by superhumans (all of whom seemed to be "ruggedly handsome"). However, I was also irked by some of the technical inconsistencies. For example, if one can actually believe that non-musicians can air-guitar their way through a live performance, it doesn't explain how the drummer managed to fool everyone. Also, I find it hard to believe that their GPS was working in the depths of the sewers. Also, the cops' plan to pour dye into the sewers didn't seem like it should have worried the corporation; with a couple of hours head start, wouldn't their raft pop out into the harbour long before the dye? Also, the CIA head was 33 years old in 1959, and supposedly was some kind of intelligence officer in WWII; pretty responsible job for someone who was 19-years old at the end of the war 
 I like John Grisham, but THE KING OF TORTS was a slow-moving disappointment.  Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel, which is fine, but he ends up putting the message above the story.     Grisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs' lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits.  This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain, in agonizing detail, how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees.  Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers, and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients.     In the end, none of this adds up to an engaging storyline.  It doesn't help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall.  Since I didn't care for this character, I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely uninvolving.  This novel is also rather preachy and heavy-handed in tone.   I personally dislike class action lawsuits, but I read novels for entertainment, not to validate my own political beliefs.   Although this book was decently written, I just didn't find the story interesting enough to recommend.  For a better version of this story, I would suggest A CIVIL ACTION by Jonathan Harr. 
 When it comes to looking for titles on catching and stringing along men one of the phrases women probably will not type into the search engine is 'The Satanic Witch' or a variation thereof. The phrase evokes images of Lucifer, hell and brimstone and is a good bit confusing for common folk. Looked at this way - and given the inverted pentagram and the runes on the cover how else would the untrained eye perceive this book? - the title is confusing or misleading. Those familiar with Anton LaVey's Satanism and the concepts put forth in The Satanic Bible may be more understanding. In spite of the protestations of the author and his cohorts the book indeed is about formula women ought to employ in their pursuit of men. In a book sure to incense traditional feminists everywhere LaVey advances the feminine look and form as legitimate means to beguiling men and advises on how to enchant, or bewitch if you wish, men with natural and unnatural assets. Central to the theme and the book are The LaVey Personality Synthesizer, with the majority and minority self, as well as The Law Of Forbidden. Political correctness is out of the door as LaVey uses his background in the circus, photography and Satanism to lecture on seduction and manipulation and in the process slag feminists, decorum, society, innocence and virtue. As dandy as all that is and as entertaining as the subject matter could be The Satanic Witch (originally published in 1970 as The Compleat Witch and also as What To Do When Virtue Fails) is really little more than LaVey's opinion and personal observations culled from a personal set of experiences. There are not any empirical data to back the book's conjectures. Much of the theorizations only make sense because they are a synthesis of the author's experiences mixed with the writings of others. The new edition of the book comes with a foreword by Peggy Nadrama the High Priestess Of The Church Of Satan and an Afterword by Blanche Barton, the mother of LaVey's daughter, which add value to the book by personalizing the tome and adding historical information and context regarding the deceased founder of The Church Of Satan 
 These are a huge waste of money -- don't buy them!  I used them on one three mile run, and they must have fallen out of my ears 20 times.  I came home and tossed them in the trash. Save your $$ 
 Loosely connected to the first HM of '81, this sequel has a single tale of lust and immortality in place of the anthology of the older movie.  While mining an asteroid, one of the miners finds a crystal shard - the key to a fountain of immortality.  The fountain itself is on another planet thousands of light years away.  Unfortunately, the miner is played (okay, "voiced") by Michael Ironside and, faster than you can say "Oh No, General Katana is approaching!!" the key consumes the miner's soul and sends him off on a quest of conquest to find the well.  First off, he must ravage a remote planet whose few human inhabitants contain traces of an element that staves off death.  While successfully carting away most of the population of this distant planet, he misses Julie - a six-foot hottie with a big gun and a bottomless reservoir of rage.  The two battle across the galaxy - first to satisfy her thirst for revenge, but then for the sake of immortality itself.  Even having been warned, this flick is still a big disappointment.  The first movie was guilty fun - catering and yet lampooning the rock-fan in each of us.  The animation was crude, yet in a charming way that today's assembly-line animation or CGI will never know.  (Imagine a story built on all those way-out 1970's album covers, and you get the idea.)  With animation reflecting an era that predated Japanimation, "Heavy Metal" grew better with age - a time capsule of bad music and laughably bad humor.  The new movie offers none of that - no memorable lines, images or characters.  Though patterned largely on "Taarna, the Terakien" from the first movie, HM2 has none of the spirit or wit of the earlier story, and Julie emotes less character (which is bad when you remember that Taarna was mute).  In short, the movie offers less than a fraction of the entertainment value of a single episode of "Heavy Metal" the magazine 
 This movie tries way too hard to the point that it becomes a painful melodrama filled with gratuitous dialogue and over-acting.  I found this movie to be thoroughly unsatisfying 
 The book WAS good in its time but EVERYTHING related to traveling in this area of SE Asia, especially Laos, has changed drastically in the past three years. Frankly, a 1996 edition should be sold as remainders at about $2,  then someone who wanted only info about the people or the temples could get  ethnographic info only! I was in Laos this past August 1998 and most  published info, except the Internet updates by an Australian in Nong  Khai,Thailand, who does visas to Laos, was wrong and very  outdated--especially the most important things like availability of visas  and safety of bus/road travel. Real traveling info from books like this  that are so old could be very misleading 
 Probably have bashed this product enough, but it is insulting to still see "Sturdy lid and side handles for improved grip" advertised.  In no time at all, the handles broke off like peanut brittle; glad I wasn't carrying it around the kitchen. No wonder no one carries replacement handles. Don't know what's better, but sure won't try Rival again 
 With the understanding of "hard work and talent aren't enough", I opened this book and quickly I was bored.   The title "it's all politics" is actually quite accurate in summarizing what the author writes--she attaches everything to the politics and doesn't go deeper in any.   Well, this is a strong indictment so I'd better share some advice the author presents in this book to convince you, especially when other people here give it quite good feedbacks.    The author highlights all her important points under the "Political Advantage" and this 237-page book lists fifteen such advantages. So let's start with"Political advantage #1" in Page12.   #1-"Political intuition is not uncanny clairvoyance but rather uncanny attentiveness to what others say and how they act". I agree 120%. So what? Pardon me.  Are we trying to write a term paper on office politics or just wanting to get some tips? I want learn that uncanny whatever. Tell me how!  #2--"developing empathy... start with an interest in people" (Page 33)Again, I know any book related interpersonal relationship will cover empathy. So what? Have you learned something new from these two "advantages" so far? I haven't.   Someone may whisper that I just present a portion of the #2. OK. Here is the whole advantage #4.   #4--"Of all the skills important to the development of political intelligence or ingenuity, the ability to see things as others do is paramount"(Page 58) Does this remind you "empathy" again? I actually looked up the word in dictionary. Empathy means "Identification with and understanding of another's situation, feelings, and motives.". So the #4 is really just a part of #2!  You may say "OK, I got your point but why other people like this book?" I don't know. What I can do is to share with you another advantage.   In Page 115--"Political advantage #7: Becoming a skilled interpreter of meanings at a number of levels is hard work. Yet that is exactly what it take to move up from benchwarmer to star".   I have no more to say.   
 The copy I have is full of quotes praising the novel. After reading and enjoying Dog Soldiers and Outerbridge Reach, I thought I was in for a treat.  What a boring novel! Maybe it would have made a great short story, but it goes on far too long to keep the reader interested. Perhaps it was "shocking" or "insightful" in its day, but now it very common place. There is one well written scene early in the book where the actress's husband encounters a weird Hollywood threesome; but the scene ends and the story goes no where 
 I don't know about the other songs but they have no right to make a Marilyn Manson song sound so bad, how dare they!!!! I am out raged! I love his version, wait, I love him too!! He he he!! He is gorgeous and very very sexy!! Now where was I? Oh yes, this album sucks big time, don't buy it other wise I will come after you and eat you, only kidding!!! Ha Ha Ha. Now you are probably going to buy it just to see if I will come after you because you think I am insane. Well I am telling you it is a mistake! It's your choice. Bye for now 
 this books chapter titles were random as hell and so was the book. its so weird.  there is no plot whatsoever. i hated it, don't buy it cuz it sucks major balls 
 The only two songs here I recognize are "Sweet City Woman" and "Signs", a couple of completely mediocre 70s hits 
 This book is actually good for the beginners. This book clearly shows where the major and the minor lines are and also the exact location of the mounts. But if you are looking for a book which will help you become an accurate palm reader, then this book is not for you. I noticed that many things written in this book are not true and unscientific. People who bought this book will realize this once they studied their palms and that of others. I recommend "The Benham Book of Palmistry" for serious students 
 With such an ambitious title, I expected a more lively and fulfilling  work.  Instead, I was left waiting for Moore to take ideas to a greater  spiritual and intellectual level; unfortunately, this never happened.  For  those who want more substance, I suggest looking elsewhere 
 Now that fine arts photography seems to be permanently entrenched in a rut, it seems as though the only way for photographers to get noticed is to become celebrity photographers. It is quite an easy formula: To become a celebrity photographer, one must immerse themselves in the mindless world of celebrities, and, thus through hyperbole and self-insertion into this world of celebrity, one becomes a celebrity him- or her- self. David LaChapelle is no exception to this sappy, self-serving, trend which began the moment Annie Leibovitz ran out of ideas.     It is no coincidence that LaChapelle is so often compared to Herb Ritts. Both of them produce technically strong work that, alas, has no soul. Both their work screams the triumph of style (and such schlocky, narcissistic and ultimately vapid style at that) over substance.    Ultimately, LaChapelle is an empty suit, now that the game in fine arts photography is not about achieving a unique vision -- wrought by years of mastering the craft of photography -- but in being seen as clever and trendy. The whole post-modern fraud -- in which LaChapelle is a routineer fellow traveller, posing as some sort of master of photography -- is predicated on the aesthetic equivalent of a hispter's sneer.    Strangely, though, LaChapelle's work is neither clever, nor hip. If you want clever, check out Weegee. For real hip photos daddy-o, peruse Phil Stern's pix of the Rat Pack. If you need to ride Madonna's coattails to notoriety, then hip is way over your head.    In Hotel LaChapelle, we are left bereft of inspiration and style. Certainly, the overly self-aware artiste gives a passable imitation of same, rather much as saccharine compares to honey. Strip this book of the glitz and the glam and we are left with a young photographer who has quite a store of technical know-how without the foggiest idea as to how he can put it to honest use.    To those comparing the ostentatious affectations of this posuer who fancies himself a photographer to Man Ray or Andy Warhol, pulllllleeeaase! Albeit, Warhol was oftentimes just as pretentious; however, Warhol did have some pretty striking ideas, and some of his graphic (re)creations were brimming over with the stark sensibilities of Roy Lichtenstein or Paul Rand. As for Man Ray, LaChapelle is way out of his league. Man Ray belongs up there with Magritte, Dali and Luis Bunuel; LaChapelle fits in a little better with other trendoids such as the photography staff of Us Magazine.    I find LaChapelle's work more akin to another hanger-oner of the celebrity scene, Yoko Ono. That's my story and I am sticking to it 
 This movie was a weak effort by Capra, who directed it, and the star, Gary Cooper. It's a good story, just poorly directed (Capra can't hit a home run every time). I found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on. And no extra features on the dvd, at least none to speak of 
 This is the stupidest game I ever saw for sale- my kids laughed at how poorly the graphics and story were. What a complete waste 
 I was surprised that the authors used such a significant amount of material from Atul Nerkar.  He has been widely discredited given his unorthodox teachings at Columbia, and few if any of his peers have bought into his lines of reasoning.  While some of the material in the book was thoughtfully presented, one must question the author's judgment in drawing upon sources such as Nerkar 
 If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "... forgive God" and that we must love God "... even if He isnt perfect". Kusher even has the will to say that "...God would not be God..." without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution.    Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that "... God so loved the world" and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place. " for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question "WHY" 
 I was shocked by the poor quality of the writing from such a well-known author.  Though published in 1995, the reader is expected to ignore the then-well-known realities of DNA testing -- for instance, that shared parentage can be proved by comparing the DNA of siblings, not just from putative sibling to parent.  We're also asked to ignore the realities of fingerprint identification when it would have been immediately helpful in revealing an imposter's criminal record and actual identity.    Adding insult to injury, after ignoring the technique when it logically would have come into play, Sheldon brings in fingerprinting at the very tail of the book, in a complicated scenario involving latent prints to identify not the missing heiress, but rather, a private detective!    Every plot development was telegraphed in advance, and the decedent went from being rather interesting in the first few pages to a one-dimensional (and repetitive) demon throughout the rest of the too-long tome.  Even the vocabulary and sentence structure were overly simplistic.  If you want to read the identical plot but done WELL, try "Amanda" by Kay Hooper, also published in 1995.  Hooper has her character do some marvelously stupid things (again, failing to exploit DNA to the fullest in a timely way), but Hooper's vocabulary, syntax, character development and settings are vastly better than the careless work Sheldon provides in "Morning, Noon, & Night."  I read the books only a week apart.  Hooper's work was engaging, though somewhat predictable; Sheldon's was irritating, and ENTIRELY predictable. 
 The oral history approach by Ambrose & Co offers certainly has its attraction. And if this book would have consisted of personal accounts of D-Day veterans only, I think it would have made a valuable, insightful, and memorable account of this landmark battle.   Unfortunately, the author did not leave it at that but felt the need to present his own, highly biased and overly patriottic views on the various aspects of the battle. The message that is spelled out again and again, in capitals, is that only the American troops and their commanders showed excellence in planning and carrying out the battle. Their allies, in particular the British, receive considerably less credit or even scorn. For example, the book ridicules the supposed British craze for "gadgets", such as their mini-submarines and special tanks, which they nonetheless used very effectively on D-day.   But what really annoys me is the personal "battle" that Ambrose seems to be fighting with the long-beaten German foe: all the decisions they took on D-day were wrong in his opinion, they responded way too late or not at all, they failed to foresee the invasion, their command structure was inadequate, their navy did not intercept the fleet "which nobody could understand", etc. etc. The truth is that by june 1944 the Germans simply did not have the resources to fight an agressive and intelligent counter-battle on the Western front anymore. I find it disappointing, a little cheap and certainly inappropriate for a scholarly historian to keep on criticizing the past performance of an enemy with the comforts of hindsight and imaginary resources. (Even more so as the included number of German combattants' accounts in this book is less than a handful.)   By the end of this book, I was thoroughly fed up with the hollow rhetorics and "easy" truths like "The Wehrmacht's many mistakes [on D-day] were exceeded by those of the Luftwaffe, which was quite simply just not there" (ch 32). Perhaps this style is what it takes to write a bestseller, but "D Day: June 6, 1944" fails as a military history book. 
 I was a little dissappointed.  This is a funny book, and these are obviously funny guys.  The live show must be outrageous...but then, the live show probably has props.   That's what this book needs.    It's a lot of words....  a lot of funny words, but all crammed in together with no real break.   After about 30 pages, you start to anticipate how each subject will be addressed.  Kind of like this review, after the first part, you know what the rest will be like.  Imagine how much more interesting it would be if Amazon would let me illustrate my review....   imagine what a great book this would have been if they had chosen to use some ILLUSTRATIONS!!!  (If the cover say's "Funny book" when you see it... look at the cover again, and imagine it with just the words and no pictures.. that's the book.  p.s. Yes I often enjoy books without pictures.... but this wasn't one of them 
 I was actually anticipating something better. There are, of course, some minor flaws and discrepancies, I'm sure they'll all be rectified in the next edition. But there are also many great flops and extremely biased historical expositions, mostly about 20th century issues -whitewashing U.S. and the West, denigrating Cold War opponents, partiality about certain southeastern Europe factions, omitting some of the most important historical carnages(namely, the Armenian genocide and other many atrocious events which took place around world. Prepared by a majorty English team and a general editor, this book will fall short of your expectations and not satisfy you, especially about the the European history part of which I consider the number of maps insufficient and not too detailed as it should be.   Rue the day I bought this atlas. They used to do better than this. Don't spend your precious money on this one if you're really searching out for something good. 
 We wish we had not wasted our money on this juvenile, violent, lousily acted series. How this survived as many seasons as it did is beyond our comprehension! Our eyes glazed over right from the first segment. We couldn't believe how bad it was. The second segment never made it into the DVD player. What a waste of time 
 The good news is that the money went to an excellent cause. The bad news is that the choice of artists and songs were not, in my opinion, worth listening to 
 Mr Bowie should stick to acting - I thought he was excellent in Labyrinth but this spin off album which cynically tries to cash in on that success is unimpressive to say the least. Mr Bowie could learn a thing or two from Will Smith who can both sing and act. For shame 
 You loved Ender's Game, right?  And even though the next couple of Ender-related books were more confusing and not of the same quality as Ender's Game, at last came Ender's Shadow, the parallel story of Bean.  Terrific.  Then came Shadow of the Hegemon.  It is, literally, a shadow of the original talent and quality of the first five books.  The dialogue is tedious, the story line pencil thin, and the plot has a huge Achilles' heel (pun intended).  This is another example of a book out by an author (in this case Orson Scott Card) who must have been pressured to produce, because this baby needs more cooking.  It will make no sense if you haven't read Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow.  It hardly makes any sense at all.  Beware 
 I've read this book with my third graders for the past several years.  They love it.  They enjoy having a candy corn contest of their own while reading the book 
 Let's see. Ken Starr wastes the public money attacking Bill Clinton with false accusations while at the same time siding with KON-servative Mitch Mcconnel of KY to allow for more corrupt campaigns as if there aren't any already !!! This book is a perfect tool for neconservative NAZIS to enjoy and drool over but is otherwise useless trash for the rest of us who are already facing mass destruction by Bush/Cheney/Rove/Delay and GOP with of course a spineless opposition that barely got together to defend Clinton but easily caved into and defended Bush the liar-in-chief ! 
 i do enjoy the first ep's and the albums from these guys, however, this cd kinda landed way off the mark. The greatness of the past cds were the energy along with the catchy street punk sing-a-long songs. On this album the unseend didnt seem to give it much time and effort. Even a new version of one of there old songs couldnt save this from being a flop. sorry guy 
 I found this book to be offensively un-American.  The characters accuse our country and our government of all sorts of nefarious acts.  The best spy thriller fiction is based on fictional characters and actions in a world not totally removed from reality not an agenda of false premises.  I think the author is the real conspiracy theorist not the characters. 
 Chomsky main failing in this work and it appears to be a recurring theme in his 40 year career as a propagandist, is he begins with a typical theory: America is bad and all that it does is bad, finds information to corroborate this through a creative process of distorting sources or failing to mention them all together, and ignoring anything that might deconstruct his theme. Despite Chomsky's belief that Bin Laden's attacks were driven by US foreign policy, all one has to do is go to the source, whom Chomsky believes can be taken at his word, to realize the goals of Bin Laden.   All actions taken by Bin Laden and his organization have this specific and narrow goal: to re-create the Islamic Caliphate that existed centuries ago and basing it on Shari'a. It is driven by a chauvinistic belief that "Dar es Harb" does not deserve its prosperity and "Dar es Salam" deserves to take its rightful place of power on the world stage. Realistically, the only thing standing in the way of the recreation of the Caliphate is the United States and the force it can project to prevent this, and that's why Bin Laden believes it needs to be destroyed. One does not even have to stoop to Chomsky's level of vile intellectual dishonesty to make this point, Bin Laden's own words are very clear on this.   "the pious Caliphate will start from Afghanistan"  This is Bin Laden's reason for 9/11, everything else from the Palestinian issue to Iraq, to Saudi Arabia is a pile on to garner him mainstream support, but his core ideology a, Shari'a governed Islamic Caliphate, is what motivates his backers, allies. and foot soldiers.   Chomsky confidence that he understands everything that motivated Bin Laden, is more a projection of his own beliefs, ideology and motivations for wanting to see America destroyed than Bin Laden's motivations. Chomsky on September 11th is like someone who, upon hearing that Reagan was shot, immediately launches into a ten-minute tirade  about the Contras, Cuba, Palestine, Vietnam (etcetera), only to be told that was all about Jodie Foster.  His analysis, if that's what one could call this tripe, about Bin Laden also repeats the often told lie that Bin Laden was involved with the US during the 80's in Afghanistan. The Mujahideen were split into 6 different factions , three of which were hardliner Islamists : Islamic Party , Islamic society , Islamic Unity and three moderate factions : Islamic Revolutionary Movement , National Islamic Front , and National Liberation Front . None of these factions were led by Bin Laden and not all them were supplied by America, the hardliners were supplied by Pakistan , Egypt and Saudi Arabia . Don't believe it, look up Rober Fisk's interview with Bin Laden in 1988 where Bin Laden categorically denies that he took any assistance from the US during the Afghan Jihad.   If you want to know who Bin Laden is read Michael Scheuer, if you want to know what drives him, read Daniel Pipes, and if you want a poor alternative for toilet paper read Chomsky.  
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 I found this on the bargain rack, but I think I paid way too much! I dutifully plowed through it, but Natalie Miller, the main character, besides being totally unlikable, is also totally unfathomable. The book jumps from sub-plot to sub-plot, with no analysis or warning.     It could have been good, if some editor had taken the time to read it, and not just cash in on the success of the author's other book (which I confess to not reading, and now have very little desire to!) 
 Lindskold has written a very good airplane book: easy to read, moderately entertaining, and quickly forgotten.  What could have been a very deep and engrossing book turns out to be a puff of cotton candy, a sweetish treacle that satisfies for the immediate moment and yet leaves no lasting warmth in the literary tummy.  The story, as told above, is centered around two main characters:  Sir Neville and Jenny Benet.  Sir Neville had been to Egypt before as a soldier and fancies himself an archaeologist first and foremost and Jenny Benet is his cousin who was raised in America.  The most important things to remember from these two characters is that Sir Neville has connections through an old acquaintance, Eddie, whenever he needs them and Jenny 's upbringing in America was SO well-rounded that she can basically produce any skill on demand to fill gaps in the storyline.  Add an Egyptologist that knows every facet of history and you have a team that cannot fail.  And herein lies the problem with this story.  Since Sir Neville and Eddie can basically do whatever they want in Egypt thanks to connections or Eddie's conversion to Islam and since any challenge is conquered by the genius skills of Jenny (who not only is a frontier doctor, but also a tough fighter, an excellent shot and a well-mannered, boarding school-trained solver of complex puzzles) there is no real challenge in any of the situations they face.  A cursory 60's Batman-style association string figures out the puzzles ("Hmmm...sausage...television....soda pop.....THE JOKER!") and Stephen the Egyptologist can read any heiroglyphic and knows any fact about ancient history; where is the thrill of danger and clever action/quick wit that saves the day?  There is none.  You can easily skip pages whenever the intrepid group encounters a tiny difficulty, since it will definitely be solved in record time.  Each character is a static, video game character that has a special skill or five and can be called on and develops in much the same manner.  There is no real development of closeness or maturity in Jenny: she is a tough-as-nails fighter genius doctor when she arrives and is one when the story is over.  Even when a character dies, he is forgotten about by everyone (and even the subcharacter that spends the previous 2/3rds of the book FAWNING over him) within a few pages as if he had never existed.  All the plots look contrived to be as easy to solve as possible or at least a diversion from the team's goal.  It's like going on the Safari boat at Disney World and seeing the "dangerous" animatronic hippo come out of the fake river so the tour guide can shoot it with the toy gun to save the day.  And then we get to the last third of the book and its deus ex machina ending.  1.  heroes are trapped in an INESCAPABLE room by the bad guys. 2.  Heroes find a way out of the INESCAPABLE room.  3.  Heroes find RA THE SUN GOD AND GUIDE HIS BOAT FOR HIM BECAUSE HIS FRIENDS THOTH AND ISIS ARE SOMEHOW MYSTERIOUSLY NOT THERE.  4.  Shenanigans ensue!  5.  Judgement by Osiris and a useless interlude that is easily won.  6.  VICTORY!!!   The book itself is an easy and quick read because there is no substance to it.  It's calorie-free and the characters never develop beyond their introductory profiles.  The first parts of the book paint such a mysterious picture and promise so much possible intrigue and interpersonal development in the relationships between Neville and Jenny and also Neville and Eddie, who could be struggling with his total conversion to Islam and reconcile his native Englishness with his chosen path.  But this never happens.  Neville is enchanted with the "villain" when he needs to be and is helpless whenever she needs to manipulate him.  Huzzah.   Read this book if you're trapped on a 7-hour flight, but skip it if you're looking for something with bite and substance 
 "The Case for Israel" is written by the Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz. Politically, he could be described as a Cold War liberal. He supports gay rights, affirmative action and OJ Simpson, while opposing Cuba and Communism. And he supports Israel. Ironically, his support for Israel is as uncritical as the attitude of the CPUSA towards the Soviet Union. Dershowitz even defends house demolitions, and have proposed that entire Palestinian villages be destroyed in retaliation for suicide bombings. Despite protestations to the contrary, he also supports torture. Yet, Dershowitz is a member of Amnesty International!   "The Case for Israel" is a piece of badly edited and completely fanaticized pro-Israeli propaganda. It was obviously written in great haste, since it contains a number of factual errors and misspellings. For instance, the author seems to think that the Philippines are a Muslim nation, and calls the notorious Spartacist League "Spartacus League". In an earlier edition, he even claimed that the phrase "Turnspeak" comes from George Orwell. (Its Newspeak, of course.) While sloppy editing like this is amusing, the main theses of the book certainly are not. Here, I will concentrate on just two of them.   First, the question of collective punishment. Dershowitz argues that all, or most, Palestinians are guilty, since they sympathize with terrorist groups or actions. Thus, even punishment of civilians is justified. There is a "continuum of civilianity", says the author, since its not always easy to distinguish civilians from combatants among the Palestinians. They are all in on it, after all.   Of course, this bizzare line of argument works both ways. Most American Jews aid and abet Israel. Would that justify a bomb in a Brooklyn shopping mold? Most Israelis support the on-going attack on Lebanon. Does that justify bombing Haifa? And what about kibbutzniks at the Syrian border or settlers at the West Bank? They are heavily armed, and some of them are illegal, making the distinction between civilians and combatants on the Jewish side hard to draw. Indeed, Osama bin-Laden justified 9/11 in exactly the same way. The American people elected the politicians responsible for attacking Iraq and supporting Israel. Therefore, they must take collective responsibility for the death of Arab civilians. (See "Messages to the World" by Osama bin-Laden, available here at Amazon.com.)   Alan Dershowitz attempts to circumvent this by claiming that the Jews who are killed by Palestinian suicide bombings are "perfectly innocent" and are killed "regardless of their political views". But most Israelis dont vote for parties demanding immidiate withdrawal from the Occupied Territories, and today most support the attack on Lebanon. By Dershowitzian logic, they are therefore not "perfectly innocent". But the opposite is true as well: Dershowitz demagogically points out that some Israelis killed by suicide bombers were teenagers. Yet, he supports the massive ethnic cleansing of Germans by the Soviet Army during the last phase of World War Two, seeing this as suitable collective punishment. Of course, these actions affected teenagers as well, including teenage girls gang raped by Soviet soldiers... By implication, Dershowitz even seems to support the nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where many teenagers and kids died as well! (For the record: I support the Allies and my grandfather was a Communist partisan during the war. But that doesnt mean I have to accept Allied atrocities.)   The author of "The Case for Israel" also claims that there is a difference between intentionally killing civilians (like Hamas) and unintentionally killing them while bombing military targets (like the IDF). He also points out that Israel gives advance warning before it bombs civilian areas. Are there no bounds to the cynicism of this man? Perhaps Israel doesnt "want" to kill civilians (its bad PR, after all) but their two invasions of Lebanon clearly prove that they couldnt care less if civilians do get killed. They are, after all, all guilty, right? As for giving advance warning, the IRA gave advance warning before its attacks against civilian targets in Britain. Logically, Dershowitz should claim that the IRA and the British were morally equivalent, but of course he doesnt. Besides, there may be many reasons why civilians cant leave a targeted area even if given advance warning. Witness the hurricane Katrina in the US. Besides, why SHOULD they leave? Would American Jews "just leave" New York if given advance warning about another al-Qaeda attack? I guess so, but they would surely demand swift counter-action by Ms. Rice. And Im not talking UN resolutions.   So why do Alan Dershowitz have one standard for the Jews and a quite different one for the Arabs? This bring me to my second point. The reason, of course, is that he believes Palestine to be rightfully Jewish. And not just Palestine, but apparently Transjordan as well!   On what grounds? That Jews have an automatic right to Palestine, no matter what, is an idea that can only be "justified" religiously. But the author is a secularist. With the risk of drawing some fire, I dont belive there are any secular grounds for automatically granting the Jews Palestine, save one: the "right" or might of conquest. Before the Zionist colonization, Palestine was predominantly Arab, and had been Arab for around 1200 years. No amount of sophistry can change this fact, and Dershowitz tries some! That Jews had an independent kingdom in Palestine over 2000 years ago is irrelevant. By that logic, New York City should be given over to the Manahata Indians. Ironically, that would force its Jewish community to re-settle in Israel, something they havent been very keen on doing for the past 60 years. Presumably, Egypt should be given over to some descendant of Cleopatra, provided such could be found.   The case for Transjordan being Jewish is non-existent on secular grounds, pace Dershowitz, and flimsy even on religious grounds. Some Biblical passages suggest that everything from the Stream of Egypt to the Euphrates is rightfully Jewish. That would include both Transjordan and half of Iraq! Other Biblical passages suggest that "only" the northwestern part of Transjordan should be Jewish. But most limit the Promised Land to Palestine proper, leaving out the areas east of Jordan. The rabbinical commentary "Tevuos Haaretz" exclude both the Negev and Transjordan from Eretz Israel, but include Lebanon. "Kaftor VaFerach" also include the coast of Syria, but again, no Transjordan. The relevant maps can be found in the Stone edition of the Jewish Bible, available from this site.   So what is the real case for Israel? Frankly, the only case that could be made for it, is that Israel exists, have a powerful army, and simply wont go away. In a perfect world, Palestine would either be Arab, with the Jews forming their own state some place else, or Jews and Arabs would love each other, and hence create a bi-national state. But the Jews created their own state in Palestine, and they dont like Arabs. Welcome to the dog-eat-dog imperfect world. For pragmatic reasons of Realpolitik, compromises are called for. What the compromise must be is obvious: a two-state solution, with Israel withdrawing from the West Bank and Gaza strip, where a Palestinian state should be set up. The Palestinian refugees, unfortunately, cannot return, except perhaps to the Palestinian state. I agree with Prof. Alan Dershowitz on one point only: It was indeed a mistake for Arafat not to continue the negotiations at Camp David in 2000. However, I suspect that the road to Palestinian statehood would have been a rocky one even had he done so, since Israel would surely have demanded all kinds of "security guarantees" from such a state. Arafat isnt the only culprit here...   When I was more pro-Israeli, I wrote a more even-handed review of this book. Since then, I changed my mind. Mr. Dershowitz, I have read your book VERY CAREFULLY and only give it one star out of five!  
 This book was soooo bad! It was very boring..I did not like any of the characters..they were so bland. The plot was not exciting at all..This book does not even deserve one star! For all of the people that thought this book was great..what did I miss? 
 This book is based off of a complete misconception of the truth, it has no founding nor fact in our Fathers word and just goes to show how far people using their own imagination can go.  If you like fiction read this book. But remember its just that fiction.  If you would like truth, read and understand our Fathers word.   To get you on your way. Take any King James version of the Bible and read Mark 13. You will see the two tribulations that Christ defines there. Notice verse 14 defines the fake Christ and verse 24 defines the return of the true Christ. Also note how Christ defines the deception of the fake Christ in verse 19.  Also read 2Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 2-4 , you will see Satan must be worshipped as if he were Christ, right there in Our Fathers temple, before the True Christ returns.  Read revelation chapter 12 verses 7-9, you will see Satan is kicked out of heaven to Earth where he will war with the saints. Note he was kick out with his angles, he's not going to let some man be part of his show. No united nations chief will play the role of the fake christ...thats just complete stupidity.  Read Daniel chapter 7, Revelation chapter 7, Revelation chapter 13, and Revelation 17, You will find the truth in these verses about Satans beast (one world) system that he will use to deceive 99.8% of mankind with.  Heck ... Revelation 12:3 tells you he did it to us before. Further Revelation 13:11 tells us he will look just like Christ (the lamb of God) but he speaks like satan (the dragon).   Revelation 13:13-14 tells us he does great miracles and can make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men, and he uses this power to deceive most of the people...Now I don't know about you but I have never seen anyone leading the united nations that has this type of supernatural power...Have you?    Don't be deceived its Christs #1 warning in Mark 13. The very first warning he gives "Take heed lest any MAN deceive you"  So don't be deceived by this book...its not the word of our Father...its just fiction from the minds of men, not truth from the word of God 
 She ransacked her music, turning it into kitsch more adroitly than most hack cover-artists could have done.  Wasn't anyone around to tell Joni that less is more?  The best thing are her paintings, reproduced in the insert.  They are spare.  The musical arrangements are unbelievably pretentious and self-indulgent.  The lapse of her characteristic taste is astonishing.  For that reason, the CD has some interest, perverse interest.  This is a side of Joni that maybe we really didn't want to know about. Unlike what some people say about her music in her early singer-songwriter days, this recording really is embarrasing to listen to.  Graceful retirement, please 
 This book can be written by any person on the streets who only have the most basic medical knowledge. I have the feeling that this was not even written as a medical thriller as the relavance to medicine was at a minimal level. Boring and stale at most parts of the story and the ending was fairly predictable. Please, read this book only if you have too much time to spare and too much money to waste on a tasteless book 
 I couldn't get past all of her horrible contractions.  If these are blue-blood Englishmen, then their vocabulary is horrible!  The story line was confusing because she felt it necessary to bring in every character she ever wrote about.  A horrible attempt to garner money for the holiday season 
 I thought the below review from 'an amazonian' was a bit negative and bought it anyway.  After reading it however I have to agree with everything they stated.  My advice is only get this book if you really, really struggle with lyric form and structure because otherwise you might find that you've wasted your money.  I did 
 The only thing perhaps more moronic than this tripe is those who have let themselves be bamboozled into thinking that there is something of deep thought and/or substance here.  I can only assume that those who found this entertaining are extremely insecure and think that if they like something that others who are perceived to be "important" like that they too will be "important".  The part of this I truly find mind-numbing is her "deep" and "thoughtful" insight into the solution to the violence/terrorism in the world;  all we need is "vagina warriors" working at the "grass-roots level".  You know what, let me reconsider my first observation; to call this moronic is an insult to morons everywhere.  It's sub-moronic 
 Worst toy ever purchased... scratches, screws that cannot be tightened, terrible quality in every way 
 As opposed to many of the other reviewers we tried to use this process in a strategic marketing session with four teams in our company. THis was a frustrating and disappointing process!  First, the book is a trite misrepresentation of an ex post facto process that has been dismissed by professional researchers and analysts. You do NOT prove your theory by fitting the past into your "model of the future". They did NOT work with Southwest Airlines to make them successful. They looked for examples that fit their thesis and applied it to ones they knew were succssful. This is not academically honest nor is it a good way to predict the future. It is like using Neural Networks to make predictions - they are 100% accurate in predicting the past. Second, our team got to the point that we "believe" we found an underserved market area and we have three options and a full list of targeted areas for discussion. Now, how in the world can this book or anyone else on my team or in our company give me any insight into which one of these will be accepted by a prospect? This book promotes the worst form of pedantic navel gazing and raises self-reference to an absurd level. If we held the answer we would not need the strategic marketing exercise. Continuing this charade does us all a disservice. I worked with and managed product marketers for years in high tech companies who had companies like IBM and Intel as our customers. They did not do pencil whipping exercises. They went out and talked to prospects and asked them what they needed. This is not a novel approach but this Blue Ocean strategy seems to think that validation comes at the end after lots of silly charting and analysis.  This book will send you on a fools' errand. Buy it for your competition and hope that they follow it 
 This was a definite let down.  It is too bad that Pablo's first DVD since Bits & Pieces cannot nearly hold a candle.  Bits & Pieces was far more funny, enjoyable, and original.  I have seen him live once and am going to see him again in a couple of weeks.  Hopefully it won't be the same garbage.  If you are looking to laugh your butt off, don't purchase this DVD, purchase Bits & Pieces 
 This could be the dumbest movie ever made (and that's a bold statement to make when one considers that "Underworld" also exists).  Sadly, unlike "Underworld" there is no leather clad Kate Beckinsale to drool over. Instead, we are treated to a movie that could easily be confused for a map of the human DNA (but a human with an extra chromosome).  Jason Statham, so likable in "Snatch", "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "The Italian Job" is thoroughly wasted in this flick.  When he's not busy escaping from his tricked out house, driving fast whilst looking cool and beating up on clichéd Euro trash delivers lines such as "Rule #1. Never change the deal" and is expected to act with a straight face when he's the recipient of this type of drivel - "You're always complaining, except when we make love. Then you say nothing.".  Thankfully, the one thing Stetham is great at is keeping a straight face. But you won't.  Not if you have a brain, that is 
 Only three songs were on this CD. What a rip-off 
 I viewed this film the other night when I had nothing better to do. The film is passable but it is too graphic, particularly the scenes depicting the scourging of Christ. I think this worst than third degree torture is purely cinematic and has no relevance at all in the punitive sentence accorded to Christ Himself.  Reviewing the sourging scenes in more leisure time, I think Jesus would have died than and there with such  cruel method that was used on him.  This coupled with lack of sleep, drinking water and eating, he would not be able to even walk straight up and much less carry the heavy wooden cross at all! I think the picture is rather an exaggeration and too graphic to convince me  as a Christian. Well...who am I to urge the commercial techniques used by Hollywood. On the whole, the film is better than the fabrication and untruth betrayal of our Lord Jesus Christ in other later films about him by Hollywood which are tantamount to insult of Christianity and a great affront to the truth of Jesus Christ - saviour of mankind 
 Let's get one thing straight - Radiohead may be the greatest thing to happen to music since the Beatles.  That said, this is not the album for that reason.  Do not let this album turn you off from Radiohead...beacause it is truly not what they are about.  There is one hint though in where Radiohead will go.  In the song "Creep", which is not a fantastic song, there is a brilliant "CHU-CHUNK" made by Johnny Greenwood.   SO PLEASE - IF YOU ARE TRYING TO GET INTO RADIOHEAD...GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  For the "rockers" - get THE BENDS, for people trying to expand their musical mind - get OK COMPUTER, and if you like that you may become obsessed with KID A.  There are some unbelievable songs on AMNESIAC, but it is not their most cohesive album, and HAIL TO THE THEIF is very solid.  Thank you for your time 
 Let me get myself straigh here first. I have always been a fan of the Artemis Fowl series even though its started to fall into ruins. I loved the first one, and it was a wicked twist to the standard fairy tale stuff i ussually have to plow through, with the protangonist antoagonizing the fairies, instead of saving them from some kind of "evil" foe. Also the fairies were pretty cool, and had all of the problems of normal people such as sexism. They were high tech and armed with laser guns. Unfortunately the author put Artemis on the helping side of the fairies which took out some of the pizzaz.  Now let me rewiew this particular book. ITs a horrible read. who in their right mind would read something about a twelwe year old kid who investigates mysteries with no new innovative concepts? no me. now add the fact that this mystery is completely absurd, i mean seriously a "barbie" doll girl who gets kids expelled from school just because they're boys. How old is the author anyways? two years old? well obviously he's not married thats for sure. I always thought that these books were aimed at 13 and 14 year olds, not four year olds. Anyways enough of that, the author also proceeds to put in someothing about a talent show and other garbage abouta possesive father. I read Colfer because he writes futuristic books, that are predominetely fantasy not preschool level books about an obssesed teen ager who doesn't even solve robberies, instead he investigates some dumb boys vs girls war.  All of the wicked humor is lost, there is no action whatsoever, the main charecter isn't a genius with wicked humor, and the book reeks of drawn of bits from the others. Heavily downgraded, adn obviously the worst parts. DO NOT EVEN READ THIS THING. get some other artemis fowl books, or read Alex Rider,. thats a very good read. 
 24-Hour Party People is a mocumentary at the lowest rung (if Best In Show was not enough) that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste. The British scene in the 1980's was influential and at the height of the 2nd Brit wave, and Michael Winterbottom could have exposed the goings-on in a much better way.   My main issue with this film was it's attempts at being funny in a hip-Britster fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious. The dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway, and the film never really follows it's premise as much as it should: the rise of Factory. I did really enjoy the Joy Division segments, though, even if exploiting Ian Curtis's death was slightly in poor taste.   Unless you're a fan of the Brit explosion of the post-punk era, and an extreme fan at that, I could not recommend this film. It's not even greatly educational for music lovers and at times very difficult to get into. 
 When I order this book I hope a very good Bond book with great pictures. But it was very disappointing. The all black and white pictures look old and some have bad quality. You may think that of course a picture form the movie Goldfinger must look old because it's a movie from the early sixties but, you know what I mean. I have seen pictures from Thunderball and other movies in full color and look spectacular but not in this book. And much of the info seems like "I don't care at all about this fact" Anyway, if you are a very big Bond fan, you should try this one, but if you don't, forget it immediately. 
 I purchashed this CD remix single thinking it was a medley of the original songs, but it turns out it is just Prince remaking his old hits and blending them together.  It's a little deceitful that it doesn't say on the CD that these are re-recorded versions.  Very disappointing 
 "Tribulation Force" picks up where "Left Behind" ended, and like that book, this one's slow. After the first one, I thought maybe things would start to happen in this one, but they don't. There are a few plot elements that are connected with endless filler. And none of the things that do happen in are completely devoid of suspense. There's one major event that we're told after the fact via a TV newscast. You might think that a book about the end of days would be interesting, but these authors obviously don't know how to write a thriller. It's just endless soap opera. This book and "Left Behind" should have been one volume. If all the books are the same pace, the whole series should have been a trilogy, but of course, then they would make less money.   Don't waste your time on it and don't encourage these talentless hacks by buying their books 
 Do you love to hear spoiled women talk about how hard they have it with thier maids, nannies and how you should dress like them, eat like them, and reform your style of thinking to be exactly like them...THEN THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU! Super annoying Darla Shine spends 90% of the book telling us how fab she is!!! She tells you how other people repulse her because of the way they shop, eat, act, and dress then goes on to give such handy tips as you can wear sweat pants as long as they are tight?!? She also seems to have some pent up agression towards the television show, desperate housewives, taking the title as a personal insult. Darla is most definitly desperate but a housewife...no not really... SAVE YOUR MONEY and call the meanest most shallow woman you know instead. 
 Painting the plates is a fun activity because you can be creative. The only problem is that you have to be careful or they could crack or break 
 I purchased this item for my granddaughter who is 13 for use with her Nintendo DS Lite. The case does not fit at all and I have had to search for a different type of case to fit her game 
 This publication has no business calling itself a "magazine"; published by San Diego book distributor American Marketing Servies, this is nothing more than a fluffy info-mercial for its clients and publishers they want to woo. Don't waste your money 
 I couldn't get into the stories or the characters....  I like short stories and novellas, and was hoping for something in the vein of Ray Bradbury or Stephen King...or Robert Heinlein...  ...I found none of that in Gibson's "Burning Chrome".. 
 It's a good text for Precalculus as long as you have someone along to check your work, the CD is basically useless.  The first two chapters don't load some of the animations due to Java errors on Windows, and there are no practice tests on the CD.  The answers in the back are fine, as long as you know how to get them.  This version DESPERATELY needs the study guide 
 This series may be good for a laugh. Some of the writing is engaging.   But the premise is absurd.   WHY, in this day and age, should anyone accept the world-view of the Bible? A book that tells us to buy and sell slaves, stone our wives to death if they accept some other tribe's beliefs, and subordinate our minds to an absolute despot up in the clouds of Mt. Sinai?   In a sense, Bible believers have been "left behind" since the 1700s Enlightenment. Tom Paine's "The Age of Reason" showed the God of the Bible to be a cruel, vindictive monster. And what did Thomas Jefferson call the book of Revelations? "The ravings of a madman."   Read this series, if you like. Enjoy parts of it. But make no mistake: to take any of this seriously, you have to regress to a prehistoric world-view, before men learned to think, to ask questions; before logic or science -- a time when dazed, superstitious primitives believed stars could fall to the earth, if they didn't grovel humbly enough to their supposed god.   Do the absurdities and contradictions bother no one? When the "sheep" are raptured up to heaven, their clothes are left behind. So heaven is a nudist colony?   The basic contradiction, of course, lies in using worldly action (some of it exciting) to proselytize for the unworldly, the supernatural.   But why should we care whether any of the "good" guys gets killed? And why should THEY mind -- won't they go straight up to heaven? That's what they WANT, isn't it? Why even lift a finger against the "bad" guys -- didn't Christ say, "Resist not evil"?   Worried about who will win? "God" is infinitely powerful. So Jesus (who is 1/3 of God -- or something like that) is sure to win when Armageddon rolls around, in book 12 of the series. And the "sheep" -- the believers -- will happily worship him, looking just like the pictures of dim-witted, bovine people you see in the tracts Jehovah's Witnesses leave at your door.   The going price for a used copy of "Tribulation Force" is one cent. Does that tell you something?   Actually, the story-telling is worth more. The basic premise is worth less. Perhaps it averages out 
 Uncomfortable and heavy for bar ends and useless as mirrors. As mentioned, the mirrors are of a terrible quality. To top that, they do not stay in place when adjusted 
 It is not easy to fathom what exactly is wrong with this novel.  Some reviewers complained about the constant pop culture references, unintelligible unless you have watched a lot of TV, but this is just a minor point: people who do not watch television often may miss the full edge of the puns, but they will still understand that they are faced with a pun. Other reviewers seem to be complaining about the explicit slash content, the main character, Tony, being explicitly gay. To those I can only say:"Grow up!" Nobody has to agree perforce to homosexuality in the fiction one reads, but if one does not, it would be best to simply say so, not making excuses. After all gay readers, up to a couple of years ago, had to relate perforce to straight characters only. I make a point of always saying if a book I read has gay content so that those unwilling to face it can skip it.  Back to the book.  Characters are likeable, a little sketchy, but this being an entertainment series one supposes they will get more depth along the way. One supposes, but still a little more depth... more attention to Tony's heartaches for example, to Henry's scruples?  The TV setting is allright, full of possibilities and potential.  In my opinion it is the script which sucks (hey, read a couple of Tony's lines and you will slang yourself silly before you realise it). Whole paragraphs at a time are unfinished, clumsy. This makes the reading more difficult, less enjoyable, slow. You do not want slow when reading fantasy, unless it is gorgeous writing. There being many other paragraphs perfectly good one has to suppose a lack of concentration, hurry or both.  Ms Huff is a successful writer. How many children -if any of course- does she have to send to college that she cannot take more time to spend on reviewing? 
 I had hoped there would be some good ideas in this book. But dutifully reading along produced nothing more than page after page of "this is going to be good, and we're going to start, and it's really going to be good, and we're really going to start, and it's really really going to be good and we're really really going to start..." with pointless "examples" along the way.  Then I realized that if I'm really going to do something with my life, I don't need a book to tell me how. And certainly not this complete waste of time 
 As an expectant mother of bi-cultural, bi-racial, and hopefuly bi-lingual child, I am reading any kind of books which might help me. On the contrary to many praises, this book was a big dissapointment for me. The authors keep repeating the same thing chapter after chapter, and failed to give any concrete evidence to explain why. If you just want to read many bits and pieces opinions from bilingual children's parents, this may be the right book for you. I rather recommend "The Bilingual Family. 
 why doesn't anyone write good fiction anymore? why is everything I read pushing an anti-Catholic/anti-Christian,pro-socialist ,leftist agenda?? I would like to escape from all the politics for awhile,okay?? I can get the same rants from Washington Post/N.Y.Times/New Yorker,etc.ad nauseum..I just want to read a good book! I know we're supposed to hate Nixon & Ken Starr;I know we're supposed to think Christianity is stupid..I get enough of that from the mainstream press. Bausch is preaching to his own secular,Trotsky-rules, choir..of course all the characters have money..helps,doesn't it?even tho'capitalism is so evil..would've enjoyed this book,without it's blatant political messag 
 This is a fun read, but much is opinion, rather than fact...... OK for a laugh, see bicycle science for a more serious, and objective study 
 "Greatest film ever made" it may be. True, the restoration was lovingly done. However, for whatever reason, the subtitles are in white on a black and white film. When the background is black, you as viewer are in luck. But when the background id white... Sufice it to say that unless you speak French you are going to have a very frustrating time watching this Criterion edition of the film. A word of warning 
 While not quite as bad as some of the stinkers which were to follow, this is another terrible effort by the so-called fab four. Yesterday is instantly forgettable, Dizzy Miss Lizzy sounds like it could have been written in the 50's and Ticket to Ride is an insult to my ears quite frankly. As usual, I did enjoy Ringo's excellent drumming and I liked the song Act Naturally. For shame!  
 Like several other reviewers in this forum, I found this to be one of the most annoying, inspid, flakey books I've ever read.  I too picked it up as it came much too highly recommended by a good friend.  I loved Jonathon Livingston Seagull when I was just a kid but alas, it seems as though Richard Bach still hasn't grown up while the rest of us have.  The character of Leslie Parrish nailed it with the long letter she wrote him and he would have done well to heed her words of warning.  He has to be one of the most self-absorbed, confused, cloying lotharios in literature.  I too found myself skimming through entire sections combing for the meat of the story, which is simply about the relationship he was constantly threatening to undermine with the much more enlightened Ms. Parrish.  Underneath it all I kept thinking that while on the surface Mr. Bach was talking about silly astral projection and such, he must have been going to sleep at night thinking what a real ladies man he was.  There was this sense of him feeling very sanctimonious and superior about himself and his views.  Awful stuff.  The story doesn't actually begin until Chapter 30 with Leslie's poignant letter to him, skip all the pseudo-spirituality and overly-long airplane tangents at the beginning of the book if you can.  All along the way, Mr. Bach consistantly breaks one of the cardinal rules of writing over and over again: "show, don't tell".  In any case, Richard Bach never got out of playing house and make-believe with the much more realistic, giving and pragmatic Leslie, what a loss.  I've never in my life not finished a book but with three more chapters to go I finally had to pitch the book in the trash lest it  somehow jump off on me like an unwanted strain of intellectual bacteria.  I want to believe that soulmates are out there but Bach's book didn't do it for me.  Is it any wonder his marriage to the woman ended in divorce?  This is not the kind of destiny I welcome.  I hope this man will someday mature and write another book that will convince us.  Eventually I found my solace in the love story of Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises, which was like spending time with a dear, old friend 
 What this book fails to mention is that David Icke himself has claimed to be the son of god on national television (in the UK) among other things. He has also prophesied the destruction of New Zealand which was going to take place in 1991, along with massive tidal waves sweeping the Brittish coastline. That he has said these things are as well known in the UK as Clinton saying "I did not have sex with woman." David Icke is a first case nut trying to weave all the conspiracy theories of the world into one great mega consiracy (bottoming in ridiculous claims of extra terrestrials), never taking into account that human nature causes alliances to be broken as quickly as they are formed. I own this book, and can honestly say it was the worst money spent in my life, not to mention the time spent reading the presposterous claims in it. Take my advice: Don't waste yours 
 Since the reviews printed on the inside cover of the book all are blurbs, here are my blurbs:  "Really hard to get into ... tough to follow who's who ..."  "Opens strong, but fizzles out early ..."  "I literally feel asleep while reading this book one night ..."  "You'll finally give up without really wondering who did it ... 
 If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.  This book is worse than bad.  It is an abomination 
 I found the layout and presentation  of the book difficult to follow and could not easily see the principles behind the so called technique. It really didn't seem any different than talk therapy to me 
 Like many of the other reviewers, I found this book frought with recipe mistakes (or are they just sloppily written?).  However, many of the recipes, with adaptation, become quite nice.... the problem being that you must have enough cooking knowledge to know how to adapt recipes.  What's great about this book, though, is the plethora of information about food itself, mini-articles about things like mushrooms, green tea and how to grow your own herbs make for some great and informative reading.    Interesting and a great idea, but very poorly executed.  A good and thorough revision would make this book wonderful, but this edition is just not that great 
 First let's talk about the positives: It talks about male-bashing, which I don't agree with either she encourages mmore affection on the woman's part....those who are inconsiderate of their husband's feelings It has some "romantic" (on first glance) views of husbands...how sweet  Now let's get down to why you should buy this book:  Buy this book if you don't mind having sex with your husband even though you're "not in the mood" Look, maybe there are times when BOTH of you guys can work stuff out and make things more enticing for both of you when one is not "in the mood"...but HELLO....she's encouraging all WOMEN to deny their feelings no matter what to please 'her man'  buy this book if you think most men are heros, willing to do anything for their wives, and wives should understand this...and cater to their men because it's their "duty"  Buy this book if you think the feminist movement screwed women over...why? Because it encouraged them to be more independent, free to do whatever the you-know-what they really want to do (i.e. careers, etc.), make money, and to not give in to all gender stereotypes imposed on females by society.   Buy this book if you think woman have a certain "status" to be lady-like: while it's acceptable for men, Dr. Laura thinks woman should not display rudeness (hmm, I suppose it's never ok for a female to be "rude"? I can think of a few situations where speaking up for something can be construed as "being rude"), smoke, act vulgar, or be promiscuous. Of course, it's the women that will encourage their men to be the same way.   Buy this book if you agree that you can either have a family and be a "homemaker" or have a career...not both, no compromise.  Buy this book if you're gay and have decided to become straight and live a good, wholesome married life   
 This book is not very informative. I would recomend Zumdohl 6e or something else 
 While I enjoyed this little light weight gizmo while it lasted, it didn't last very long.  Within the span of a month it was pushing up daisies, not playing, not responding, not acessable through any computer (pc or mac.)  I used it mostly during my mile walks to and from work and trips to the grocery store, neither could be considered extream environments 
 So, being a fan of all forms of literature, more specifically challenging[faulkner], pretentious[d.h. lawrence] and original[kafka] works, I was surprised at how long it took me to get around to reading what's considered Pynchon's most imporant work.  Important 40 years ago, perhaps, but the test of time has totally obliterated the supposed wit in this one.  Oh man, the radio station is KCUF, boy, that's incredibly clever, I bet it's, like, something spelled backwards.  I fully understand what Pynchon was trying to accomplish with this work, to skewer extreme right wing nut jobs, among other things, all while giving us a story with no particular plot, no moral, no message.  I can understand it, but it doesn't mean it's worth my time, I didn't even finish it.  I read about half and then just dropped it to the floor.  I've read in numerous reviews of Haruki Murakami's work that he's a latter day, Japanese, Pynchon.  I don't agree, Murakami's ability to create a surreal dream-like atmosphere is amazing, Pynchon is a hack 
 I could barely keep my eyes open through this one. It's so theoretical and dry. There's nothing practical in this for parents. Maybe more so for the professionals. And I HATE the clumsy and awkward "he/she" all the time and all over the place. It's very distracting and highly unprofessional 
 This boot looked so much better online. For this boot to be by Nine West it looked very cheap. I was very disappointed with this product that I returned it but I'm still waiting for my refund!! 
 I was just before ordering as I had not read this one, only to find out that it was two old novels in same cover.  It pays to check Amazon reviews.  I would have been miffed if I had bought it.  I usually read them just as soon as they are published.   Beware of strange marketing practices. 
 The author contradict himself by considering himself a Christian and then criticize some passage from the bible, this a mean less book, what he was trying to say that the bible has been deviated from its original text, as a Christian I have a difficulty to accept that because it show God disability to keep his words as intended to be, and make God  loss his creditability and honestly dealing with human, please God forgive me for saying that, it will better to proclaim himself as atheist, this is mean less book and show the author foolishness and idiocy 
 Peter Lance is just another sensationalist who spouts misinformation at every opportunity ...hoping to lead you the reader, or perhaps an American seeking truth, down the path of distraction and outright fantasy.  Maybe he took lessons from his previous employer, a CIA controlled TV network ...or maybe Karl Rove of the Bush administration.  Either way, if you really want to know the truth about 911, read some David Ray Griffin, or get one of Eric Huschmid's DVD/videos.  As for Peter Lance, well ...if you have time for fiction and more government spin, then by all means, please help yourself to an extra big serving of the same 
 The book came as described in excellent shape and arrived quickly.  I hate the book though. The rhymes are not very good. Just a few variations of words but nothing to really jump rump for a long period of time to. I was hoping for some of the playground rhymes I can't remember from childhood. It seemed like somebody just wrote down some words that sorta rhymed but had no reason. 
 My son and I had a great time building this beautiful ship, but shame on Lego for not putting a dislaimer on the box, "Not for Play, Only for Show!"  You can't breath on this thing without the hull falling apart.  You expect small pieces to fall off, but the backbone structure?.  I will start tomorrow on some modifications (glue anyone) to make this thing an actual toy for a 7 year old with a great imagination.  By the way, whatever happened to making your own designs with generic bricks 
 This is the last book written by George that I will buy.  I bought, read and enjoyed all her earlier titles. Her choice for whom to kill off and the effects on Lynley and Havers indicate to me that she is trying to end/kill off the series. Otherwise, why would she make such a cruel decision?  Her rightful choices as a writer for this title prompt me to use my rightful choice as reader to write her off 
 Is this the same Kool Keith that created Dr. Octagon, Dr. Dooom, and Black Elvis?  "Spankmaster" represents a regression of creative energy.  It sounds like Keith decided he wanted to make a record one morning and whimsically threw together some tracks.  It contains little of the genius of his earlier CDs.  With the exception of a couple songs ("jewelry shine" and "Blackula"), this album stinks 
 I enjoyed "Temple" but this book was just awful.  Reilly's books are full of amazing, improbable but fun action scenes.  You spend a few hours suspending common sense but having a good time.  In this book however there were two elements that were just so bad that they ruined the rest of the adventure.  1) The career Marine captain has a romance with an NCO who reports to him.    and 2)There was a bear family that played a key role in the story - mama bear, baby bear and papa bear.  Right.  The only place you will fine a papa bear in a bear family is in Goldylocks.  Read "Temple" instead 
 this is pitts worst performance to date. thats all i have to say about tha 
 I am a huge fan of Linda Howard's books. I have purchased each and every one of them. I live in Israel so getting her books in English from the U.S.A. isn't cheap Cover of Night was the most disappointing book of Linda Howard's I have ever read. It was boring and I foung myself turning the pages and looking for something interesting to read in that particular book. I hope the next one is more interesting. I will keep looking forward to her books since I have enjoyed and re-read many of the ones I have 
 This book is extremely basic.  I would only recommend it for those who have very little knowledge of baseball.  It spends a lot of time covering basic rules of tee ball and does not cover the fundamentals in enough detail to be of any use.  If you have ever played baseball then this book is not for you 
 Old fan as I am, this one (and quite a few of the later ones) was a huge disappointment. Badly written, obvious plot, even more cartoonish characters than usual. Time for Cussler to retire methinks.... 
 WTF.  This guy should be shot or at least locked away forever for attempting to make money off of this travesty.  And someone should beat some sense into letterman, too.  Then I read that he was the frontman of Talking Heads; that explains alot.  There isn't one redeeming quality to this drivel.  Lyrics, music, voice are all pretty sorry.  If you listen to this you'd be better off converting to (c)rap 
 I DONT WONT TO DOWNLOAD IT I WONT IT ALL ON DVD THIS IS WASTE MONE 
 A huge disappointment. First, there is only a documentary of 50 something minutes... just talk and talk and snapshots of people and the events... Then, a 10 min montage, more interviews and... where is the music?? Aweful.. 
 As a student I was excited to find so many new ideas in one place.  However, when faced with writing a review of the ideas in this book, I needed to review my finance and accounting texts.  If you want to be up on  the popular terminology read this book.  If you want to reinvent your  financial office look somewhere else 
 The contempt the author has for writers and the contempt so many of the agents have for writers is the real theme of this book. If you want names and addresses, use the internet. If you want a book that can actually help you get published, read The Square Guide to Publishing Your Non-fiction Book by Rudy Shur 
 Crying of Lot 49 Flat - Senseless - One dead accumulation of words - In,fact this book is, at times, so porely constructed all reviewers who herald it should be lead directly to the meat grinders. A book worthy of burning.  Has writing become a whim of the well read, a process of linking obsure facts only to then be skewed by prolix innanities as simple segways to streams of consciousness Poor Plot Poor Writing  Read - Umberto Eco's Foucaults Pendulum. If you are looking for conspiracy. Do not read this book (unless you have time to waste or have by some possibility exhausted every other option on earth)   
 This book has been recommended in Catholic circles for some time, so I finally purchased it.  I shouldn't have.  I was very disappointed.  I didn't even crack a smile, until the chapter on trying to pray the rosary with children.  That one was hysterical!  Still, it is only a few pages out of the book.  I think the reason it falls flat is because it is so impersonal.  You never feel involved with the family.  Most stories are too vague (the children don't even have names) and focus on the setting more than the people.  I know there are a lot of glowing reviews here, but you'll probably be happier with another book.   
 Bill O'Reilly stole his idea for burying his enemies in the sand from Twilight Zone. His vision reminds me of "Manhunter"-- the Michael Mann film not the lame book he based it on. O'Reilly, tall and deformed, is the Tooth-Fairy. O'Reilly is gutter-trash 
 [the two stars here are for the audiobook only. I give the book six stars.  I loved the book. Best book I've read in years. Couldn't put it down.  But the audiobook is dismal. The voice artists are amateurish, their speech clumsy and unnatural. It's as though they're reading from a script that they haven't rehearsed and they don't know how to get "in character". The attempts at foreign accents are overdone and painful to listen to.  (I love listening to audiobooks and radioplays. I listen to many hours of BBC World Service every day. I know what foreign accents sound like. Not like these).  I strongly recommend that you find a preview of this audiobook before buying it, to see if you'll dislike it as much as I do. Or buy the book instead. Heck, buy five copies of the book like I did and give them to your friends. Awesome book 
 I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the "extremely difficult themes" and "brilliant artistry" of the play 
 This book expects a lot out of students, thereby requiring instructors to work even harder at presenting the material in a meaningful and understandable way.  Unless students have previously had precalculus (including trigonometry), or had a thorough preparation in algebra, this text will be highly confusing and discouraging to most of them.  It is an inadequate preparation for calculus at best, as it completely omits many key concepts that will be necessary for the study of calculus.  This is a well written book for mathematicians, but not for students just grappling to learn this material.  Unfortunately, there are those who are involved with the "Calculus Reform" that believe this "Applied Approach" is the best approach.  If people really wants to learn about applied mathematics, they need not look any further than physics 
 I'm sorry that I bought this book.  The grammar is terrible, and the author (or his editor) doesn't even know the difference between principal and principle.  The author cannot settle on one word or phrase for a concept, but generally, and repeatedly uses three.  Save your money 
 I love to read about Hollywood, and I know I would enjoy this book if the "Eff-word" wasn't used so much. It proves to me that to get anywhere in Hollywood you have be very low-class and profane. Any really  educated person would have a stronger command of the language. The eff-word is a stupid substitution for any word at all, and I just can't get interested in the book because of it. If you don't mind eff this and eff that you might enjoy the book. Too bad. It could have been a good read 
 If, like me, you mostly read at night in bed, don't choose this book. No-one should go to sleep in an irritable mood, having painfully re-read pages to ascertain what the author is trying to say, disentangling the contorted lines of thought and timelines. Although crammed with information, much of it seems contrived, anecdotal and you have to expend too  much energy digging deep to get to the core of the history of the spud. When you do, it is indeed interesting. But don't labour over this book - read COD instead for easy-read insight into how single food sources make and break entire populations. 
 What's wrong with all you Amamzon reviewers?  I actually quite liked Shutter Island but this was total garbage. The morose tone is totally overdone throughout, and the end is pathetic. The interesting situtation setup in the first chapter is never satisfyingly integrated with the rest of the story.  Avoid 
 The answer is:  he didn't accomplish anything.  This book is a desparate attempt to make Reagan look like an "intellectual".  In one essay, Reagan bemoans the constraints on DDT and other pesticides, insisting there's "no threat to animal, bird or marine life".  Really?  Since when did Reagan have any scientific background to evaluate scientific studies about pesticides?  Of course, Reagan had no scientific basis for this statement--it was just another thing he made up.  Ronald Reagan often cited a Chicago "Welfare Queen" who had ripped off $150,000 from the government, using 80 aliases, 30 addresses, a dozen social security cards, and four fictional dead husbands.   The only trouble is--this Welfare Queen never actually existed.  Reagan made it up.  The followers of Reagan turn him into a fetish.  He was actually a stupid man who said many stupid things which are not true (commonly called "lies").  Conservatives apparently think that someone who lies is a "great" man--but only if the liar is a Republican.  Reagan was a Republican Liar, who lied hundreds of times.  This book does very little to establish Reagan as a "thinker", rather than a senile, stupid man with hate-based ideology 
 The addresses and phone numbers in this book are handy, but this is not the way to find an agent or publisher. Instead, visit the largest bookstore in your area and take a look at the books they sell that are in your genre. Look in the "Acknowledgments" section of each book and you are almost certain to find the names of the author's agent and the book's editor. Those are the agents and editors who are most likely to know about your subject and its chances of being published. Find those people using an online white pages or yellow pages site (anywho.com, dogpile.com, etc.) and give them a call. If they are receptive to your idea, send them a formal proposal.  I have to agree with those who have suggested that publication of a book like this by someone in the business smacks of exploitation. As one other reviewer noted, the author is an agent - call him up and see how receptive he is to you. You might as well try looking for Elvis in the supermarket. 
 This percolator would be great except the lid was too tight and extremely difficult to remove. After only about a week the gasket around the glass window in the top cracked from having to pull the handle so hard to get the lid off, and coffee leaked out through the break as it perked. I called customer service and they said they'd replace the lid but it is on backorder...I have been waiting for over two months now. I don't know how you are supposed to get the lid off without using the handle, though, so what's the point 
 This books seemed to be based on two assumptions about history writing that are outdated and superficial.  The two problems come up right at the begining with Farber's description of new year's eve in 1959 and what the  three famous people (Ike, head of catholic church in USA, and MLK) were  doing that evening.  This book falls into the trap of looking at the  sixties independent of its context as well as taking a top down perspective  that ignores the local political movements that really move history.  He  redeems himself slightly with a nod to the fifties and the local activists  in the 60's that really led the way to social change but it is too little  too late.   I have not seen a synthetic view of the 60's that is able to  adequately show this overall context as well as give due credit to the  underlying social movements.  (John Dittmer does do a great job of this for  the civil right movement in Mississippi in his book "Local  People" 
 This has always been a favorite film of mine.  The story is old-fashioned yet fun and the cast is divine.  Despite having the VHS, I wanted more and ordered the DVD.  Beware!  This DVD claims on its packaging to have Closed Captioning, but it does NOT!!  No subtitles in any language,  no line 21 captioning.  Nor does it have anything else.  "Interactive Menus" means scene selections.  This plain vanilla release doesn't even have a trailer. This film and cast deserves better and I see no reason Lion's Gate reissued this DVD with nothing added.    Since I bought it online, I can't return it and neither Lion's Gate nor Artisan will take it back despite the error in labeling and false advertising which is not the fault of the people I bought it from 
 The sub-header to this book could very well be: "All Work & no Play makes Jack a Dull Boy".   Basically, Tom Stanley's scholarly treatise on American wealth comes down to this mind-ripping, continent-blasting conclusion:   Millionaires, you see:   1) Save more than they spend;   2) Don't spend anything.   That's it. Page after page, chart after chart, graph after graph, anecdote piling up on anecdote, all of it boiling down to the same conclusion: don't spend more than you save. Clip coupons. Hang on to your wife `til Death you do Part. Buy a rambler for 80 grand, and cling to it like a rat clutching a Big Mac in a hurricane.   To wit: if you're a good little Bob Cratchit, and burrow down in your suburban Dacha, drive the Civic, eat Top Ramen, and take your vacations at the State Museum of Knitting & the Fine Arts, you'll die loaded!Sound like fun?   Didn't think so. Look: you've got one life, and after death all bets are off. Sure, you could be hauled up by the angels to Paradise, or it could just be one plate of linguini too many, a nasty flatline and one vast inky void of non-consciousness. Either way, you're looking at one single trip on this not-so-flat Earth, so you might as well live large.   It's true, now: you can haul in major bank in whatever profession you choose: eremetic horror-writer, Wall Street tycoon, Railroad baron, small-town librarian, legal eagle defender of the Criminally Insane, whatever. And you can always outspend it. That is the source of endless tragedy and Dickensian woe throughout the ages, without a doubt.  But there pitfalls at the other extreme. Listen: I live next door to one of these McMillionaires. The guy is this enfeebled little wizened gnome of a critter, used to be a bank Vice President and got bought out because he was a dingus. Total skinflint. Miser. Goes on his own hunting trips and brings back venison, deer meat, which he forces his family of---jesus, I think 12---to eat for months. Lives in a shacky little rambler, buys used Crown Vics from the local police department and bargain basement prices.   The guy, no doubt, is high net worth. But he's also a loser.   This is a guy who didn't want to cough up a few hundred bucks to help build a joint fence between our properties---so there's a fence, even a fence that abuts his property---but beyond my house and demesne, he elected not to build a fence. Instead, he got a plastic Jersey Barricade (orange and white) and went with that. Is that any way to live? Is that really what it means to be a `millionaire'?  I think not. Half the glory of the Age of Great American Consumption is buying stuff you don't need, but want. Desire. Demand. What else is work for?  Find a way to creative bliss, work at something you're good at, that you have a real passion for, and the money will follow.   But for the Love of God, it's only Money: spend it! What is money for, if not to indulge yourself?   Sure, get a pace---plan to the end---set a budget. But how many of you want to be that newspaper column on page A3, the 95 year old dowager pauper who begged for alms on the streetcorner, ate catfood out of a tin, and scrounged for quarters by the bus stop, then was found rigid and cold in the urine-stiff sheets of her dirty bed, sprawled atop a fortune estimated at 20 million bucks? Sound like a plan? I think not. Money may not buy happiness, but it sure as hell can get you a Rolls-Royce Phantom.   "Millionaire Next Door" might have it right in its sociology---and for what it is, Stanley's thesis is meticulously researched, mustered like a well-trained army, and capable of marshalling its teeming forest of facts like a well-drilled martinet---but it's off the map when it comes down to the point of the whole thing: if you've got it, flaunt it.   "Millionaire Next Door" isn't a bad book: it's scholarly, and plods along its own hand-me-down lodestar towards its prophesied conclusion (be cheap! Die loaded!), and perhaps some folks will be astounded to discover there are some real richies down the block who in another day would have been called skinflints.   But as a map to your stars, this one is a little cramped, cribbed, dank, and stinks of mothballs. I think I'll take first class---scratch that, how much did you say that Learjet was going for, again?   JS 
 There are plenty of obvious factual errors in the book, such as the author's statements that the Yankees have had streaks of 7 & 8 consecutive World Championships. On the other hand, Yankee fans will enjoy  the author's anguish about the Redsox fate 
 I am very dissapointed with the poor spiral binding on this book, (4th edition)! As a dietetic student, I don't have much money to spend on books as it is. As much as this one is priced, the publishers could have put a higher quality binding on it, (or made it a paperback, like previous editions). Pages are falling out constantly, especially since it the type of book you refer to all the time 
 I actually bought one of these in the store and was browsing Amazon for a replacement. The fact that most of the ones in the store display were broken should have been a tipoff. The wires that do the slicing were all broken. These were all the had, so I thought I'd give it a shot. It didn't even make it home. Several of the wires came unattached from the ends. I'm hoping maybe they just had a bad batch. Though I usually like KitchenAid products, I certainly wouldn't recommend this item to anyone 
 Do you have expensive tastes?  Are you rich?  Childless?  If so, then this cookbook is for you!  I've never even heard of some of these ingredients and the ones that weren't too expensive are nothing that my kids would eat.  In fact, I couldn't find a single thing that my kids would eat, and I don't think the average kid would either.  I think most of these recipes are something only an adult would appreciate.  Well, I guess I can't say that my kids wouldn't like ANYTHING out of this book.  They'd probably like a couple of the dessert recipes.  Check this out from your local library first.  I'm glad I did 
 Did Hunter really write this book? I've read Lady of Sin & Lord of Sin and it just doesn't seem like the same author. There is barely any emotion in this book. Daniel does not love Diane, he lusts after her and Diane has got cotton in her brain. She is so naive its ridiculous like going to her friends house, who by-the-way is a mistress. And is she ruined? NO! Huh?? Oh and yeah, she sleeps (begs him is more like it) with Daniel in exchange for a promise! WHAT!? She apparently has no idea what behavior is not proper for an innocent. What exactly were they teaching her in that french school?   Daniels revenge thing is totally out of hand too. I seriously didn't believe he would choose Diane over revenge. And his 'friends' from the dueling society? Well their just blah too, not very likeable or dislikeable. No interesting characters in this book at all. Maybe his sister Jeanette and Paul could have used some more pages.   I think I'm going to stick to Hunters lastest works and forget about these older ones. Good I didn't read them first.  If you want to read a fantastic historical that will keep you enthralled and pull your heart strings read Kingdom of Dreams or Almost Heaven by McNought. Kleypas, Quinn, Garwood and D'Allessandro are excellent writers too 
 I was wanting something to make cleaning the kitchen floor a bit easier.  This "broom" needs to be held at a particular angle for it even to suction anything.  Very frustrating...must be why it is on sale!!!!! 
 I received this book on audio cassette as a gift.  Apparantely I am in the minority but I found this book very difficult to follow without becoming distracted.  I felt like it was written for the psychology profession instead of the general population.  It was repetative and lacked intrigue which made it difficult to keep listening 
 This book should have been 2-3 chapters long.  The content didn't move me to make life changes like some other things I've read.  I wouldn't recommend it 
 Elaine definitely cut the fat.  She also, however, cut the taste a huge way. There are definitely some books out there...especially a couple published in the last year or 2 that are great.  They really cut fat and keep flavor.  This one, unfortunately, is not one of them 
 While this is an excellent and well written story, the Blackstone Audio version is horribly read. It is painful to listen to. The reader is very "nasal" and the attempts at accents and characterizations are just simply horrific. Find another version, or read the book if you can. I can't, and had to endure this version of the audiobook. I listen to a LOT of audiobooks and this experience was a nightmare 
 Mr. Lozowick, along with all the hundreds (if not thousands) of other pundits, pols, propagandists, spinmeisters, and other assorted demagogues, can slice his particular form of baloney as thick or as thin as he wants, but after all the countless millions of words on the topic of modern Israel and Zionism have been poured forth, three simple facts remain:  1. The original Zionist Jews came from (mostly) Europe to Palestine with the stated aim of dispossessing the people who were already living there and establishing a Jewish state on the land.  2. The people who were already there refused to quietly go away and let the Zionist Jews have what they wanted without a fight.  3. The British, French and Americans have all been heavily complicit in furthering the aims of the Zionist Jews. For almost a century, major Western nations have helped to sell the Palestinian Arabs down the river - and we still expect the Arabs to LOVE us for doing it!  All else is mere commentary and window dressing.  Mr. Lozowick fails to convince me that Israel has any more right to exist than does any other artificially constructed modern nation such as Yugoslavia or Czechoslovakia or Taiwan. And two of these three are already gone from the Atlas in the forms in which they were created.  Just as I refuse to shed any tears over the Spanish Conquistadores or American settlers who came to the New World to dispossess and oppress the natives and who got themselves seriously dead for their temerity, so, too, do I refuse to shed any tears over any of the Zionist Jews who have become defunct while squatting on lands they have wrested from others by force and/or legalistic mumbo-jumbo.  And I equally refuse to demonize the Palestinians for fighting the foreign invaders with whatever means they have at their disposal. Wars for home and hearth are never pretty things.  There is NO moral high ground to be found under either side in this conflict 
 The book is basic, and not badly written; friendly and clear advice and instruction for the would-be surfer, but it's a slim volume-and here's the rub (and the reason for only 2 stars):  the binding of this trade paperback was the worst I've seen in quite a while-it fell apart after one read-through, with whole handfuls of the sewn-in pages cascading to the floor.  Most defintely NOT what you'd want in any how-to book 
 My 6 year old daughter wanted this pegasus so badly and was thrilled when she received it for Christmas.  I had read about the wings falling off, so I wasn't surprised when one of them was a constant problem.  I didn't want to glue the wings on because then she would only be a pegasus, not a horse as well.    Now, my daughter is in tears because she brushed the mane and it has turned into a big purple afro.  My daughter is not very rough on toys, but she wanted to brush the hair and you'd think since there was a brush and hair accessories included that the hair was brushable.  NOT SO!  I've tried to fix the hair but it seems to be permanently frizzed out a la finger in a light socket.  I played with Barbies and Barbie horses as a child and never had one whose hair just turned into a rats nest.  I'm disappointed and so is my daughter!     
 If you are interested in a diatribe against Wal-mart and how it's ruining all the small towns in the country then this book is for you. Their is very little suspense ,if any, and apparently the only way the author could keep his own interest level up was to throw in a fair amount of vulgar, gratuitous sexual content. Poor effort, the "story" could've been told in less than 100 pages and was predictable from beginning to end with little character development.  
 This book was required reading for a class on children's literature.  So, naturally, I was expecting the very best samplings of what was out there.  The beginning was quite exceptional.  I even invited my husband to read it with me since we share good finds to read together in the evening.  We were about 75% of the way through before its magic halted and it turned to various detailed descriptions of the main character's female body parts.  Due to this we feel it falls short as an example of wholesome children's literature.  We set the book down and did not finish it.  If you are looking for good children's literature that COMPLETELY steers clear of naked images instead of turning to them to keep the pace of the book going, then this book will be a let down.  Sad, because up until that point, the writing was quite good.  
 I was so disappointed in this product.  I bought the ad hook, line, and sinker, thinking that the memory foam was a great idea, that it would give me bilateral-plantar-fascitis-suffering feet some long-awaited relief.  After about 2 hrs of wear, the foam is completely flat, which leaves the formerly snuggly slippers sloshing around on your feet and you flapping about as if walking on cardboard. SAVE YOUR MONEY!  These are awful 
 I bought this Mp3 player about 5 months ago and it just stopped working. I did nothing to it to provoke it to break. It has a 1 year warranty by iaudio, so I have spent the last 3 days trying to get a hold of the company, but quess what! they don't exist! A phone number leads you to a website that dosen't work, how convienant for cowon to be ripping off consumers with thier crappy products. STAY AWAY FROM ALL COWON PRODUCTS. i just lost 100 dollars 
 From the notion that slaveholders "were the worst victims of slavery" to the far-right myth that Carter's ending our LEASE on the Panama Canal was unconstituional and immoral, this book is right-wing  babble passing off as mainstream history.  Any distortion you could think  of is here - I guarantee it 
 The Professional Edition appears to be missing any information on at least 2 new Photoshop CS2 features; Smart Sharpening and Reduce Noise. It has sections on Sharpening and Noise BUT does not cover the new CS2 commands. I have not been through the whole book but this situation took me by surprise 
 The Comendium contains introducing desciptions of Hunter's antagonists. It's not bad but definitely too little for an own book, even a compendium. It should rather be a chapter in a bigger publication. If you have knowledge about Vampire, Werewolf or Mage you don't need it 
 I have enjoyed all the Cat Who Books . Have owned or borrowed or went to library to read them. Always can't wait for the next book to see what Koko and Yum Yum are up to. Have two of my own and think they are smart things to have 
 Excellent book! Terrible narration by Mandvi. I cannot understand why he did not learn to pronounce the common Indian names in the book,... wasn't that the point of using an South Asian narrator 
 I couldn't get into the stories or the characters....  I like short stories and novellas, and was hoping for something in the vein of Ray Bradbury or Stephen King...or Robert Heinlein...  ...I found none of that in Gibson's "Burning Chrome".. 
 I have long been fascinated with the Spanish Civil War and bought this DVD with high expectations.  What a disappointment!  Rather than a history of the Spanish Civil War, it is mostly a look at Brits who served in the International Brigades, based around the memories of a few elderly members.  The overview of the war is weak with no coverage of the events that led up to the Spanish Civil War, little coverage of the political events during the war, virtually no coverage of daily life in the Nationalist and Republican zones, etc.  The focus is firmly on the battles fought by the International Brigades, but little attempt is made to place these engagements in the context of the war and the descriptions of the battles are weak.  Anyone not already familiar with the war would have been perplexed by this presentation.  As stated earlier in this review, the focus is on the Brits.  No coverage is given to so many of the interesting facets of this war.  The Requetes are not mentioned.  Neither is the Anarchist leader Durruti.  Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera and the Phalange are absent.  Franco is reduced to a figure in old newsreels and no background is given to him.  The only Republican leader to receive much treatment is La Passionaria, and this is largely in the context of memories of her by the Brits of the International Brigades.  As one might expect from the focus on the International Brigades, the tone of the presentation is overwhelmingly left-wing.  A British historian is shown sporadically, and he does his best to present accurate information on the war, but the narration and the rest of the presentation largely reduces this complex struggle to a leftist fable of good Republicans against evil Fascists.  From the credits I believe the film was actually produced in 1995.  If that fact had been mentioned, and if it had been emphasized that the DVD was mostly about the reminiscences of British members of the International Brigade, I would have awarded it two stars.  I think it would still be a poor piece of work, but I would have known what I was getting.  I give it one star because it was marketed as a history of the Spanish Civil War, and it is not.  
 I got my first month(a horrible Green Day issue)and then nothing! Uh,what up? Its not that good of a magazine,I just want what I paid for 
 I very rarely write reviews, but I looked over a  few on here and realized I had to chime in.  I believe Faith Hill is one of the most brilliant country artists to come down the bin.  Take Me As I Am, It Matters To Me, and Faith were masterpieces of interpretation, vocal prowess, fully developed albums.  Faith Hill as an artist however began to go astray on Breathe.  Breathe was an album of phenomonal moments spread out over mediocrity.  With Cry, Faith Hill's search for new audience completely led her astray.  "Cry" and "When The Lights Go Down" are the only even vaguely listenable tracks.  The rest of the album is a mish-mash of pop-wanna-be songs that don't even begin to live up to the potential of the artists.  Sometimes fans become blinded by loyalty to an artists, and I don't believe it is fair to people to buy an album based on those opinions 
 I bought this book hoping to discover psychologically why we keep too many things and how to change the behavior. Also some tips on keeping spaces "things" free. Instead what I found was over-simplified cliches about Gary Keepitall or Lisa Hummingbirdbrain (I swear these are actual names she gives people in the book). There is a LOT of repitition, and really, who needs to know that to keep track of your schedule you could get - guess what, bet you never heard of it! - a day planner! Really? I could?   I think most of us know what we could do to keep track of our things, what a good book about making peace with your things might be about is how to do it, how to motivate yourself to do it and how you can overcome the behaviors that keep you from doing it. The one or two studies Glovinsky quotes in the book appear to be all the education on the topic she has, other than that she simply reiterates common sense - like buy a container for your things! - that anyone smart enough to order a book from Amazon is probably smart enough to already know. Please skip this book - unless you truly don't know about day planners or plastic bins 
 This travel guide is just okay. It doesn't go into detail at each destination, just an overview. I expected details especially in Atlanta, Charleston, Savannah and Charlotte. I did not find this book helpful 
 It is always gratifying to see popular books about science get rave reviews because we scientists benefit from public enthusiasm about what we do. Erwin has a chatty and disarming style that is a joy to read. Unfortunately, it is a public disservice to distort reality as Erwin has done in this book. In depicting his role in the whodunit, Erwin has liberally embellished his own contributions and those of his colleagues. After proclaiming for years that the extinction was unrelated to the Siberian volcanism, this book now implies that such a relationship was his idea. The whitewashing treatment of his team's blunder in misdating the extinction and related events is worthy of the most guileful politician explaining away some scandalous act.   As long as you don't mind the plethora of factual errors and self-promotional aspects, it is a fine book. Unfortunately, it will not weather history well. 
 I have never read any of Hoffman's books and only bought this one because it was a "highly recommended" read at my local bookstore.  This book is awful to say the least and I don't understand how it can get such high praise.  The first thing that bothers me about it is Hoffman seems to be romanticizing being a homeless and aimless drifter.  The main characters Matt and Edmund are exactly that.  Matt "asks" houses and other places if she can stay in them, there is a word for that it is called squatting or trespassing and it is illegal.  She gets her food out of dumpsters. Matt apparently got her powers after too much drinking and drugs, interesting message there, be a homeless drug addict/alcoholic and get the power to talk to inanimate objects.  Hoffman refers to the garbage bag Matt has her property in as her luggage.  Give me a break.  The story itself doesn't flow well and goes off in weird directions.  Matt and Edmund visit his sister and find this wild magic lying around and his sister and her family just accept it and are all OK with it.  They finally meet up with Susan, totally blow apart her carefully constructed world and she blows off her job and her carefully put together life without a second thought and goes off with someone she doesn't know (Matt) and someone she hasn't seen in over 10 years (Edmund).  That makes absolutely no sense.   I will not be reading anything else by Hoffman 
 What a terrible disappointment this book was -- it's ALL in the How to Cook Everything cookbook that came out a couple of years ago.  You are best to get the larger book and pass this one up.  Mine is coming back to Amazon 
 Stick with Blitzkid because they can sing ten times better than this guy. He is also in Blitzkid actually and he plays drums...where he belongs. The songs on this cd are very well written and played, its just a shame that the singing is so forced and cheesy. I mean I know this is supposed to be 50's style doo-wop rock, but please. Better things in the genre....like Blitzkid 
 (...)It really sucks, simple as that. That moaning of Scott Stapp, those lyrics of Scott Stapp. Ugh, SCOTT STAPP! It seems that anything he touches turns to crap. Let's not forget Celebrity Poker. By the time this album came out, it was pretty much confirmed that Scott Stapp and his Creed cohorts were nothing more than a sappy music rendering, trying to be sensitive, poop band. "Not so fast..." moans Stapp. Early in the album is the "hit" song "What if". This song showed us that Creed still had some edge to them. The only problem was that the lyrics really didn't enhance this listening experience. I know the song is called "What if"; I don't need the phrase said 64 times. And another thing. The first time I heard Creed, I could have sworn I was listening to Pearl Jam, bad Pearl Jam. Apparently I wasn't the first to make this comparison, and the band knew it. That guitarist, what's his face, I don't know, even had the gall to say the following: "Eddie Vedder wishes he could write a song as good as Scott Stapp." Well, Scott Stapp wishes he could sing in a way so people don't think he's ripping off Eddie Vedder, which he's clearly doing 
 If you want to learn project management or get better at it, don't read this book.  It brushes over important concepts and spends and inordinate amount of words attempting to describe the profession. It assumes detailed knowledge, gives very poor examples and, in summary, is a total waste of time 
 I agree w/ T. Morrey's review "Worst publishing I have ever seen, February 7, 2005".  I haven't even read the book yet, so this isn't a review of the content but rather the quality of the "publication" itself.  The book I received -- and paid $20 for -- appears to be a crude copy of an original publication, so far as I can tell.  I very much doubt that the copy I received is true a HarperCollins publication.  Looks more like a photocopy.  I'll be trying to get my money back for this one 
 I really didn't like these stories.  The narrative voice wasn't compelling, and when I finished, I usually thought, "And?  So what?"  Not recommende 
 I was trying to think of the best short description of what this is. Sure it's a propaganda film but that doesn't mean much to most people. However, most people have seen attack ads around election time. That's what this is, a very long political attack ad, full of all the things we commonly see in such ads: distortions, sarcasm, scary close ups, mood music, mocking tone, glaring omissions, out of context quotes, etc.  That said, the most rewarding review so far must be the one by AT "DL" (New York), who basically condemns Michael Moore as pro-Bush because Fahrenheit 9/11 doesn't say Bush engineered 9/11 himself. What's next? A review that condemns AT "DL" (New York) as pro-Bush because his review didn't say that Bush flew the planes himself? Or that Bush is an alien who gave birth to Saddam and Osama on a UFO?  Just when you think you've seen the craziest conspiracy theory .. 
 George Sluizer's original Dutch-French version of The Vanishing (aka The Man Who Wanted to Know) offers one of European cinema's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths, feeling his way one step at a time towards murder. If you've seen that version, you probably still can't get the final revelation out of your head, but the film had plenty more to offer than that, playing with chronology, subverting the usual cliches of its 'Lady Vanishes' plot (the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive) and throwing in some excellent characterization. I can only assume that for this 1993 US remake Sluizer was so determined that no-one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself, but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work. His career never recovered.  Chief culprit is an astonishing performance by Jeff Bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level. A friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that Bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing, and this film is the proof of the pudding. Every movement is overly mechanical in its precision, making him look like a rusty clockwork toy, while his voice is a bizarre mixture of Tootsie, Latka Gravas from Taxi and a Dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from Dok-tah E-ville. No banality of evil here, just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying "Please. Let. Me. Kill. You. Thank you. For your. Consideration.'   But the blame really needs to be shared out here. None of the performances are good: often, they don't even look good - Keifer Sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station, Nancy Travis flounders badly and Sandra Bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession. Not that they're given any help by either director or writer Todd Graff. The script is particularly weak. The chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on Bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. Worse is the rush the film is in, draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next. Rather than the high/low mood shifts in the couple's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location, we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he's probably better off without her. As for the new and improved happy ending - standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame `let's end on a joke like a TV cop show' moment - best not go there... which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie. Even a shockingly bland and uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score can't do anything for this one.  
 i think the newer version "the love affair" with Warren Beatty/Annette Benning better. 
 I see that some readers had good results from this book while others were frustrated. I'm afraid I'm in the latter category. Being new to the whole .NET world, I lack the experience to fill in the blanks regarding details the author omits. I have been unable to see any of the sample meshes, or to get the compiler to locate the DirectX classes. Based on other reviewers' comments, it's clear that these things are possible, but one cannot achieve them by following the instructions in the book.   I don't question the author's qualifications. I think the difficulty lies with the publisher. For hands-on tutorial material, especially when it is aimed at beginners, it is important to do a real hands-on review prior to publication. It isn't sufficient to edit the text for grammatical errors and leave it at that. Had the publisher actually tried to use the book, they would have encountered the same problems as I and others have encountered within the first 15 minutes. It is not acceptable to approve tutorial material for publication unless and until it has been verified accurate and usable by the intended audience. I will be very cautious about purchasing books from Sams Publishing henceforth 
 This book is a waste of money. Very disappointing 
 If you're the choir, I don't suppose you'd mind being preached to.  But this is not a book for the real world or for real people.  The author's advice basically consisted of pray real hard and read your Bible more.  I found the book to be useless and I didn't appreciate being lectured about how I need to be more religious.  Waste of time.  Waste of money 
 After reading this book in its entirety, I now realize that it was made for Mr. Power's personal gratification and not to enhance the lives of those that suffer discrimination within law enforcement 
 Clearly this Movie was never intended as High Art, or even a Zombie Gore Fest, although Hyped as such, so it`s probably a bit unfair and easy to take Shots at it, however I think it fails on it own terms.  *** Many Spoilers To Follow ***   Stop Here if you plan to view the entire Film.    The Premise: A group of stupid Eco Terrorists raid a research facility in London, even though warned by a researcher, release some highly agitated  but otherwise normal looking chimps who then attack and infect them with a  fast acting ( within Seconds ) virus that transforms them into insane, red-eyed murderous really fast creatures who attack and infect other normal humans through bites and even scratches. One drop of their saliva or blood can infect you.  The Plague is let lose ...  The  Hero: Cut to a skinny kid of about 110 pounds with a dopey beard laying naked on a hospital bed, it`s 28 days later and he wakes up, but no one's there. He then wanders around an empty London, in hospital scrubs, looking confused,  yelling " HELLO !! " , " HELLO !! "  There are no bodies outside, and nothing that looks like the remains of one. There are almost 15 Million people in Metropolitan London.  Where did they go I asked myself  ?   The Supporting Cast: He then wanders into a Church, and finds it full of what looks like sleeping people, he yells " Hello !! "at which time some start screaming and rush at him, in the close-up it`s clear they have Turned and he slugs the Creature-Priest Thing  with his bag of Coke Cans. He gets out , more Stuff Happens, eventually  he meets smart and tough Selena (Naomie Harris) armed with a matchete and Mark (Noah Huntley), armed with a steel bar, who have avoided infection and explain the situation to the dim whitted  Hero, who turns out to be a Bicycle Messager Boy who lives with Mum and Dad. Seems the Creatures come out mostly at Night. Mostly.   Hero insists on going Home, Mark & Selena tag along. We find his very middle class Mum & Dad peacefully dead in bed from an overdose of Booze and Pills. Guess they could not live in a World Without Telly... More talk and moaning and tears from Hero who very unwisely lights a candle at night which naturally draws an attack by some Nasties, more fighting, bad guys are killed by Selena and Mark while Hero cowers on floor. Mark gets infected, denies it,  but is chopped by Selena who " can see it in his eyes ". Damm Girl!  if I`m ever in a Zombie Movie I want you along !  Day 2 comes, the pair then wander aimlessly though London chatting away about everything but how to deal with the threat and survival  and at this point I start thinking; wouldn`t it be a good idea to get some Guns ?  preferably full auto, with a lot of Ammo. I mean, although the Creatures are fast, they are stupid, don`t run in packs and make a lot of noise and can be killed and stay dead. Police Stations and Military bases are all over London,  probably deserted , and filled with Guns....but this doesn`t seem to occur to our wandering charactors who trust to a Baseball Bat & Machette which you must get close  to use....emmmm.    I start squirming a bit in the seat, and for the first time look at my watch, but it`s still kind of ok. So far, it`s still a tight, well made interesting film, with the bloody action well filmed and important to the story line, and mostly believeable in it`s own low buget Post Apocolypitcal setting with taut dialoge that holds my interest.    Maybe there a reason the Hero is cast as Stupid, or will he grow and learn through experience ?,  maybe, but it better be soon because we are almost 30 minitues into the Film, and it`s getting real hard to identify with him. Or care.  The Suporting Cast 2 :  Night Falls. Our pair see flashing lights on the top of a High Rise, much action ensues, they find more survivors, just a average working type Dad Taxi Driver and his young daughter. More Talk, seems they are out of water and there is a radio broadcast giving direction to go North where the Army ( who usually have Guns )  has set up a Secure Area. Works for me.  After some debate on whether it better to stay where they are, isolated, in fact trapped on top of a Building,  with no water or power or food or real weapons until overrun by Zombies, or travel North to safety , in Daylight and safety ( remember, the Monsters don`t operate in daylight ) this Group of Dopes reluctantaly decide to go North, in a taxi, with no guns..( remember Rule # 3 of Zombie Films: Gun Are Good )..and at this Point In Time this heretofore good film starts to move rapidly downhill in believablity.  The Journey of the Dumb: Piling into Dad`s hack, loaded with junk as if going on a Brighton Holiday, with all, even tough Selena giggling and laughing, off they go. When faced with the choice of driving through a Dark tunnel , where it is obvious that they could be trapped and killed, or another safer route, they naturally chose the Tunnel. Stuff Happens.  Stopping to get gas, the Hero wanders alone into a dark, confined space for no real reason, armed only with a Baseball Bat. More stuff happens.  Stopping for the night, they decide that a picturesque, open field with a few low stones is a great spot and preceed to ......You Guessed It!   Start a Really Big Fire and go to sleep with no one on guard.  I`m not making this up folks..!!     Nothing Happens. However they do get to see a Family of White and Black horses running free, and it`s clear that we are no longer watching a Horror / Action Film, with some internal logic but a trite  " Message Film " .  They reach the Army Blockade, but no one is there, in spite of dead everywhere, they proceed to split up and wander around this perfect ambush site for a look see.  More stuff Happens.  After this, the stupid illogical stuff comes fast so this is a good stopping point. At the end we learn from the crazy and sadistic Army Major ( aren`t they all though ) that the Goon`s can`t farm or feed and will likely starve because of it.  Think about that one.   We also learn that the Virus is contact borne, NOT Airborne, think hard about that one Dudes !  Since it started in one local it`s very unlikly to have spread thoughout England in 28 days....big Plot holes, dumb ending, 110 pound Stupid Hero becomes Arnold The Terminator in 10 mintues. Girls decide it`s far better to die a gruesom death then Put Out and Lose Their Honor  to what looks like a bunch of boy scouts in Cammos, who are their only protection... really dumb stuff after an excellent start.  Sad....this was a really superior film  for the first 20 mintues.    
 The summary of this movie makes it sound like a light-hearted happy-go-lucky type of film.  Unfortunately, it is exactly the opposite.  Aside from the funny scene involving the Colonel, I didn't see much humor.  Mainly this movie revolves around the serious (not funny) topics of neglect, racism, and self-worth.  At first I thought that maybe I just wasn't getting the Czech type of humor, but by the end I was thoroughly depressed.  Maybe if my expectations had been different I could give this more than 2 stars.  If you like deep, thoughful movies, then this might suit you, but don't expect Sideways part 2 
 I purchased this book based on a good review in Upside Magazine, but I have to confess to being rather disappointed. Ms. Ferdinaldi never really describes data warehousing per se; the book is more of an instruction  manual aimed at novice managers to help them figure out how to ask for a  data warehouse. I was anticipating a review of warehouse types and  technological issues, but instead got a primer for B-school freshmen about  how to suck up to upper management and make nice to the  "technicians". Further, it is written for an audience of Fortune  1000 type managers - she spends far too much time on dealing with  bureaucracy issues that just wouldn't exist at smaller companies, where  data warehousing is just as critical an issue. About 10% of the text is  educational, the rest is pretty much "duh". And the writing style  is repetitive redundancy - the author states the same thing numerous times.  In short, if you are a businessman (read - non-techie) who wants to learn  about data warehouses without getting a computer science degree, then look  elsewhere 
 This is the weakest book of the series.  I have now read them all, through PMS Outlaws.  The book has the witty style of the other Elizabeth MacPhearson mysteries, but didn't hold my interest very well.  It is important to the series, though, because it tells us a lot about Milo, who is featured in two subsequent books, and it introduces Elizabeth to forensic anthropology.  The ending is a bit of a surprise, so I guess that's in the story's favor 
 While I am not sure what exactly these do taste like, I don't detect the peanut butter here. The texture is good, chewy enough, but the taste is...odd. Not at all sweet. I can't imagine any child (or adult) grown accustomed to high fructose corn syrup actually enjoying these. Bleh.   If you want peanut butter, the Clif Bar has a much better flavor (and an even denser, chewier texture). If you want a Z-Bar, I slightly recommend the chocolate--although it too tastes a bit odd and is inferior to the chocolate Clif Bars. Builder Bars are also worth a try, sufficiently sweet and flavorful. Of course, with these alternative product lines you will get about twice the calories.   Although I will not buy these again, I give the company a star for a worthy effort 
 This isn't so much of a game guide as it is a character list, and even that is incomplete (missing a character). The information in this section is copied directly from the character illustration section of the game, and contains nothing that would be helpful in game.  There is no information about the default statistics for any of the characters (health, ki, attack, defense, etc.), only a list of their 5 special moves, and that information is available in game as well.  There is no information on the advantages, disadvantages, or unique abilities of any of the characters, many of which you would never be aware of unless you discover them by trial and error, accident, or through other sources of info on the game. Some characters, for example, have the ability to absorb health or ki from opponents or absorb the energy from opponents ki attacks, or to regenerate lost health. This obviously useful information is not even hinted at in this guide.  The guide contains no information on the Z-evolution character customization feature, such as the specific effects of increasing various character attributes or of special items.  Although the guide contains a list of fusions for unlocking many of the characters, it contains absolutely no information about those characters which can only be unlocked by collecting the dragonballs (Roshi, Kid Goku, Tao Pai Pai, Great Ape, and Vegeta Great Ape), or even how the dragonballs are found in the game. This is a serious oversight.  An even more serious oversight is an error in the basic controls. The actions for the R1 and R2 buttons and for the L1 and L2 buttons are listed incorrectly. This is unforgivable in a game guide. How can they not get the basic controls right? All of the information on the basic controls is covered in greater detail in the manual that comes with the game and in in-game tutorials.   The walk-throughs for each of the fights in the story mode only state the obvious, and were not at all helpful.  This game guide offers almost no value whatsoever, and I consider it a total waste of money. Unfortunately, this seems to be par for the course for Prima. Other Prima game guides I have purchased have been similarly lacking.  Perhaps Brady Games will develop the strategy guide for the next Dragonball Z game and we'll actually get a guide worth buying 
 This was a comprehensive collection of statistics and War Department strategy notes but it had no life. It gave no feel for the soldier, sailor or marine on the ground.  It was all acronyms and big picture strategy. If you are looking for something less academic and more readable try a different account of the battle. Since this was one of the most gruelling and bloody encounters of the war, the participants should get more ink. Here, the brass get all the attention 
 This otherwise excellent account of George W. Bush's appalling environmental record (strategically?) ignores, and thereby condones, the President's three most deadly anti-environment policies: never-ending mass immigration, nearly open borders, and countless stealth attempts to reengineer more amnesties. These policies are fueling a US population explosion that is outstripping that of many Third World nations.  Bush and Pope (and his Sierra Club) are something like the dazed South Asian islanders seen wading out into the sudden eerie low tide, oblivious to that high distant foaming crest, a tsunami, making its way, making its way.  
 Intrigued by the relative frequency of citation of this book in the new "web 2.0" universe, I was disappointed to find only a sequence of factoids on social experiments and little in the way of analysis.  From the very beginning of the book the reader is invited to agree with the central thesis (that a crowd of independent individuals does better than a smaller elite group) and it very much feels like evidence is carefully selected to reinforce the author's argument.  The book could have been twice as thin without losing much of its substance.  I would qualify it as a light business read, entertaining but not quite convincing if you're not part of the choir 
 This is one of the worst children's games I ever played.  There are caterpillars to move around, but they don't really go anywhere, and it's so simple that even my 3 year old is completely bored with it.  Buy any other game but this one 
 I've read 300 of the 362 pages and I can't be bothered to finish.  Not particularly well written.  The secondary characters are un-developed and annoying... in fact, the same can be said for the main characters.    I don't care what happens to them.  I don't care about finding out what the "mystery" is.  I can't figure out how they could possibly have fallen in love.  The author just springs it on you.  It's a bit insulting to the reader, in fact.    The heroine is passive and whiny... "[spies (or whatever) are following me and I'm going to do nothing about it except wait for them to spring on me at every tourist site and "ruin" the tourist experience for me.]"  This is my first book by this author, and unless I forget her name (it's a very bland, forgettable name) and accidentally buy something by her again, it is the last.  I'm really glad I only paid a buck for it 
 Is it really worth it? I mean sacrifice your reputation which you worked for 30 years for another million bucks 
 First off there is one good song on this CD believe it or not, "Right back Where We Started From" and actually it sounds out of place with all the other crap that litters the remainder of this disc. These songs are best forgotten--they sucked when they came out and they suck now.  If you must listen to them then attend a wedding reception 
 Since the break up of our 6 year relationship I have purchased many books.  This one was not as helpful as the others because the information was very introductory and not deep enough.  It seemed like the book is saying that God is the answer to saving the marriage.  Maybe true, but I was hoping for  a book with more deep psychological analysis.  I recommend the books  "Letting Go" by Dr. Tracy Cabot, and "Make Up Don't Break  Up" by Dr. Bonnie Eaker Weil 
 A pamphlet would have accomplished what this guy said in the entire book!  I wanted to strangle him!  Repetitive, condescending, overly simplified and so BOOOoorrring!!!  Here is the nuts of it all:  Pick a stable stock with a narrow spread between bid and ask.  Buy 2000 shares and then sell it 1/16 higher right away.  Everything else is simply preamble... over and over and over.  Hope I saved you 20 bucks 
 	Sally Denton's Faith and Betrayal is a disappointing book. It promised all the elements of an exceptionally dramatic (and true) story: love and loss, wealth and poverty, dedication and disillusionment, an epic journey, a peculiar religion, polygamy, theocracy, a massacre, and perhaps betrayal. But Denton's account is so replete with inaccuracies and confusion of facts that it destroys all credibility. Listing her errors would take nearly as many pages as the book itself. In addition she failed to use the richest repository of primary sources of Mormon history-the LDS Church Historical Department Archives. Presumably this is because she assumed she would not be welcome, she believed the records there had been selectively censored, or she thought they would have little relevance.  	As a non-Mormon historian working on the stories of disillusioned converts in the same period of the mid-nineteenth century, I can assure her that for the past decade I have never been refused generous help in the Church Archives and have found the records there amazingly rich, especially the correspondence of Brigham Young and the diaries of contemporaries of those who left the church.  	Denton makes Jean Rio's piano a pivotal issue, which she says was brought to Utah in 1851, though Jean Rio never mentions it in her trip diary nor does the captain of the company she traveled with in his (which is in the Church Archives). Denton fails to give a source for her account of it. It is quite possible Jean Rio ordered the piano later after her arrival in Salt Lake and had it shipped from the East. As for the tar-covered crate (p. 165), if that is in a museum in California, could not have Denton done the research to find where it is?  	Was Jean Rio's piano taken by the church leaders through "consecration"-a rule of stewardship (pp. xvii, 129)? Did Denton bother to inquire in the Church Archives what the consecration records show? Not all records survived, but many did. It is unlikely the church purged them of information about the piano. Likewise, did Denton ever ask the staff at the Museum of Church History and Art about the provenance of the piano? One Jean Rio descendent believes it was gifted to the museum by a Mormon descendant. Here again Denton confuses her facts: She states (p. 130) that the piano is in the "Church Temple Museum"; there is no such institution.  	Denton claims the piano ended up in the "Amelia Palace, the home of Young's favorite wife, a beautiful Englishwoman named Ann Eliza Webb Dee Young Denning..." (p. 129). Here Denton has all too typically confused Young's so-called "favorite" wife Harriet Amelia Folsom with a later wife, Ann Eliza. Neither were English. The Gardo House, the so-called "Amelia's Palace," was not finished until after Brigham Young's death; Amelia lived in it a short period to establish her claim in Young's will, while Ann Eliza never lived there.  	Denton quotes from one of my papers (pp. 153-54), and although the quote is correct, she misinterprets my account, stating "The flow of Mormon defectors had become the largest emigration to that point, far surpassing even the California gold rush." No records can support that idea. Likewise, she claims that "U.S. Army escorts oversaw a burgeoning traffic of disaffected Mormons fleeing Zion." There was only one such escort from Salt Lake of approximately forty families.  	Although a beautifully produced little book, publisher Alfred A. Knopf should be embarrassed at having accepted and published such a consistently unreliable "history." I'm sorry to advise potential readers not to waste their money 
 After using this product for about a month and a half, I began to get very high blood pressure readings (157/106).  My doctor took my BP on the same day and got 130/80, which I also got with my manual cuff.  I find that this machine tends to show a rapid pulse as well.  The only good thing about it is that you don't have to record your readings manually.  If they calibrate the machine properly, it would be a great thing, but I wasted my money 
 Before you devote a lot of time reading his work, you ought to look up Reich's biography on Wikipedia.  He was incredibly prolific and is notable for having written against Fascism and come out against Communism long before it was fashionable.  He is also known for inventing the infamous "orgone box" and ending his days in jail for medical quackery and a remarkably incompetent defense.  His work is dense and inadvertently thought provoking, but mostly manic and meaningless.  It should be preserved, but not widely read 
 This movie seemed to vacillate between funny ha ha office bullsh*t and then really freaky stuff that made me cringe and want to retch. I don't like that; going back and forth and not knowing what they "want" from me. And I REALLY didn't 'get' the ending. I didn't buy the romance. The only thing I enjoyed about this whole movie was Kevin Spacey; that's it. Just skip through the rest of the crap 
  It was kinda hard to use and after about 6 months it just stopped even though I always kept it charged. Since this is the type of product you might take camping I don't recommend it because it's not reliable.    I used it once or sometimes twice a day....no more so I really think it should have lasted longer 
 I appreciate that there has to be some of this to cater to the various tastes out there--but this book has way too much.  I read 4 stories in a row that were either about lesbians or bisexual men.   I am going to stick to books that have more balance or emphasize hot sex between men and women.  The other stuff just doesn't do it for me.  I got bored and started turning the pages fast.  Disappointing 
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 My problem with this book extends from the fact that it advertises itself as a general book about writing a thesis.  From its description the authors of the book would have you believe that this book is for everyone in any field.  In actuality, this book has an extreme bias towards the social sciences and humanities, most notably education research.  If you are in one of these fields this book is an excellent resource for you, and I recommend it to you.  However, if you are in a science or engineering field, like myself, than this book will be of no help to you.  I bought this book to help me with my thesis believing that it was a general reference.  I received this impression after reading both its description and table of contents on Amazon.  When I actually got the book, I realized its extreme bias very early on but kept reading attempting to extract useful information from it.  The more I read, the more I was disappointed.  It details things such as "problem statements," "research participants," "research methodology," "ERIC: Education Resources Information Center,"  etc. and omits any information relevant to a thesis in the sciences or engineering.  When reading the book I finally came across a section on detailing your research instruments.  This confused me greatly as when I read it instantly thought of the measurement equipment I used in my lab when I read the phrase research instruments.  I went so far as to ask people I knew in the social sciences and found out that the author was referring to items such as surveys used to collect data from study participants in social science research.  It was at this time I stopped reading the book because it was very clear to me that it had no application to my field and the book itself was a complete waste of my time and money.  I'd like to take this opportunity reiterate that my negative review stems from the fact that this book masquerades itself as a general reference guide.  This is no doubt an act of dishonesty.  From my perspective I have been lied to and cheated.  I do highly recommend this book, however, if you are in one of the fields it is written for.  If you are in the sciences or engineering like myself, than I highly recommend the book "Enjoy Writing Your Science Thesis or Dissertation!: A Step by Step Guide to Planning and Writing Dissertations and Theses for Undergraduate and Graduate Science Students" by Elizabeth Fisher and Daniel Holtom.  I bought this book after giving up on the one detailed in this review, and have benefited greatly from the information it has conveyed 
 Usually I skip over album reviews if they are too extreme (5 or 1 star).  But it's quite called for here.  CAN A MAN RAP WITH ANY LESS CHARISMA??!!    Cam's come quite a long ways, as evidenced by this album.  Average production.  Uninspired, generic rhyming schemes and also-ran content.  The production and engineering are fuzzy and lo-fi - and it's not on purpose.  An amateur job all around.  It would be nice if this was cut to 4 songs and labeled a demo tape.  There's definitely growing pains all throughout.  Skip to his later selection 
 This is a good example of a book about Ukraine written by a person with a Russian mindset - crucial points about understanding the Ukrainian culture, spirit and sense of independance are wrong. Buy and read this book if you want to know about all Russian misconceptions of Ukraine. Otherwise choose someone more knowledgeable. Two other reviewers made good points about what's wrong with the book, which you can notice even without reading it: 1) The explanation of the origin of the name of the country is wrong. This has been an issue of fierce scientific debates between true historians and pro-Russian communist pseudo-scientists who preferred to see Ukraine only as a border of the bigger Russain empire; 2) peasants on the cover of the book look really dirty, uneducated and backwards - like Ukraine doesn't have writers, scientists, cultural artifacts, national symbols over more than 2000 years of its history - well, there are millions of things she could have chosen for the cover of her book.  Sorry for the people reading this book and thinking they actually understand where Ukrainian sense of national identity and independence is coming from 
 As the previous reviewer wrote, this DVD only shows the NFL Films version of Super Bowls IX, X, XIII, and XIV.  It does also have a short profile of Jack Lambert, John Stallworth, Chuck Noll, and a couple others.  They are only about 2-3 minutes a piece though.  The league season highlights are horrible.  Who cares about the other teams.  I bought this because it was supposed to be about the Steelers.  Wish I could get my money back. Gave it two stars instead of only one because of the profile on Lambert, he was the best 
 I am a fan of Michael Crichton's.  Having said that, I felt that the writing style of this particular book was incredibly choppy, and that certain characters were not well developed at all (e.g. the wife!)    The basic premise was very interesting and the book was suspenseful; it moved along at a fast pace.  However, Crichton added too many characters, and made the book too dense.  I had to skim the last several chapters because I wanted to know what happened at the end, but I was getting extremely bored.  Obviously, he has come a long way since this book :-) Sigrid 
                The major problem with this book is Shiller's basic misconception of what the major problem is concerning decision making about the future ,given the incomplete amount of relevant information available in the past and the present,based on what D.Ellsberg called ambiguous probabilities,  J M Keynes called probabilities with low weight(uncertainty),and Benoit Mandelbrot called wild risk(as opposed to the mild risk of the normal probability distribution).Shiller bases his understanding on the "new"behavioral economics associated with the work of Tversky,Kahneman,Thaler,etc.This kind of approach emphasizes not the major problems of ambiguity,uncertainty,or wild risk of Ellsberg,Keynes,and Mandelbrot,but relatively mild problems associated with the Allais Paradox(certainty,reflection,translation,and preference reversal effects plus other assorted anomalies).The problem is that the Tversky-Kahneman approach ,and other associated approaches allied with them, are based fundamentally on the view that the normal distribution is the  correct  distribution to use for educated,rational decision makers.The problem ,then,is that decision makers in general are not rational;they are irrational and uneducated decision makers ,who allow their emotions,combined with their hopes and fears,to influence their decision making .All the anomalous behavior can be traced to the basic irrationality and ignorance of decision makers,who supposedly resort to all kinds of heuristic shortcuts because they have not mastered the fields of statistics and probability correctly.The position of Ellsberg,Keynes,and Mandelbrot is completely different.The decision maker is rational,but must "rely" on probabilities that he knows are unreliable,vague,ambiguous,unclear,and uncertain.In such a world the attempt to gain additional information,as in the stock market,leads to herd,crowd,and cascade effects as each individual decision maker attempts to obtain a little, additional amount of relevant information from other sources that he feels are better informed.Thus,it is the ambiguity or uncertainty of the future that leads to the creation of bubbles,manias,panics,and crashes.These events have little to do with the Tversky-Kahneman approach.The normal probability distribution is completely worthless as a guide to action in the stock market and other financial markets in the face of ambiguity ,uncertainty,or wild risk.In his preface(pp.ix-x),Shiller claims that"...economic thinkers have been limited by the state of relevant risk management principles of their day".Shiller claims that Keynes did not have command of such risk management ideas.The fact is that Keynes,Ellsberg,and Mandelbrot have forgotten more about these ideas than Shiller will ever know.All seven of Shiller's new types of markets and new types of insurance totally ignore the fundamental problem of ambiguity/uncertainty.They are put forth in the misbelief that the kind of decision making problems examined by Tversky-Kanheman are the main explanation for the boom-bust nature of financial markets , the volatility that results,and the unstable nature of such markets  in a capitalist system.Shiller needs to completely rewrite this book and base it on a foundation of Keynes,Ellsberg,and Mandelbrot 
 I returned this item as it was not the Bunnykins Children's set that I expected.  This set is no longer manufactured in England it now comes from Taiwan.  The quality and the coloring is not the same.  I am very disappointed that this set is no longer made in England.  I will not purchase another one.  I am willing to pay more for English goods.  I am tired of cheap goods 
 One of the 1/4" rings snapped the first time I put it on my rolling pin. 
 Corkscrew has a nice heavy duty feel and does a good job of getting the cork out once you get the corkscrew into the cork and that is where the problem lies.  Usually (but not always) Oxo products are good at making things easier to do.  I have yet to figure out what they had in mind when they designed this one.  Getting the screw into a cork is no better than a run of the mill winged corkscrew and probably worse because it is so bulky.  You also have to hold hard onto the body to keep if from turning while you are getting the screw into the cork.  Poor design this time OXO. 
 I didn't particularly find Paul Verhoeven-directed `Hollow Man' impressive and I actually thought its characters are stupid and the story was silly (tell me, who would like to be absolutely invisible without thinking about its risk?), but the plot of the sequel is even more preposterous, After the promising opening ten minutes, the film soon runs out of gas, depending on so-so set-pieces and countless plot conventions.   The story is, in short, about an invisible killing machine Griffin (played by Christian Slater who is not seen but heard almost all through the film). Griffin needs serum that would keep him alive, so he stalks the scientist who knows how to make it. There are stock characters like a determined PD detective, his partner and military officials. Peter Facinelli plays the cop Frank Turner, Laura Regan the scientist Maggie Dalton and William MacDonald the officer whose name, sorry, I don't remember.  The attack and chase scenes involving the invisible killer are passable at best with OK effects, but the film spends so much time to show Frank and Maggie running and driving around in the city without knowing what to do next. Usually directors like Michael Bay can keep entertaining us with his loud, showy and very enjoyable actions, but Claudio Fäh, as in his previous B-action film `Coronado,' takes too much time to get to the point. The stunts are decent, but the slack pace of the film damages it considerably.  But what kind of military officers and scientists would dream of creating invisible soldiers before inventing invisible weapons first? Are they supposed to fight with bare hands? In the original film CGI-enhanced actions and Kevin Bacon's over-the-top acting made us temporarily forget the silliness of the plot and numerous holes in it. It was guilty pleasure, but in the sequel, you even don't get that 
 I have not even read the book as of yet. I have just skimmed over reviews written by some of the readers. I understand that this can be an emotional subject for many different reasons. If you come a background in which your anscestors had not been enslaved or lynched or gassed, you may not get why some readers become emotional with this subject matter. I do have a fact based on what I was told from the horse's mouth. Egyptians do consider themselves to be black. I lived in Turkey in 2000 and on my flight back to the U.S., I was waiting in the terminal at the airport in Izmir. This woman kept staring at me. I assumed it was becasue I was the only black woman around and I had grown accustomed to the interest I drew while living in Turkey because it was sincere and genuine. Anyway, she finally approached me and said, "My brother and my nephew and I do not mean to seem impolite, but we are just so happy when we see a brother or sister," I asked what she meant and she said, "Oh, we are black like you, our mother is Egyptian and our father is Turkish, we are black, like you". I noticed their complexions were darker than mine and their was of the same grade as mine. It never occurred to me that they were "black". I noticed that they took such pride in being recognized as such. It really all comes down to what an individual feels he or she identifies most with and what they were taught to believe and whether or not they were taught the truth 
 This book's premise is great, and I thoroughly enjoyed the first 75 pages.  We meet the two main characters and learn interesting things about their lives.  Arlette is the 'book doctor,' and the query letters that are interspersed with the action are very entertaining.  I loved reading about this side of publishing...  Then I hit the wall.  Too much discussion in the text about feelings, nothing more than feelings...I started skimming.  The dialogue started disappearing.  The query letters sent to Arlette all started sounding the same, as though the author had lost her ability to change voice.  I gave up at page 130, regretfully.  I stopped caring about the characters, but I wanted to like the book more and couldn't 
 I cannot imagine why a publisher agreed to publish this book.  Of the purported 166 pages of text, from page 69 onwards are the text of three speeches to Congress.  Of the 60 pages before that, every second page is a poorly reproduced picture.  The result is that there is only 30 pages of actual material, and those are written in large font.    The book stats show that there are 5647 words in total in this book - maybe enough for a first year tax essay, but he would have failed on content.  There is nothing to learn from this waste of paper.  It should have been 15 pages long and given away as a pamphlet.  Save your money.  
 Wasn't worth the subscription. I found the magazine to be bland, full of ads and basically boring. All the information can be found doing a quick web search. Highly Disappointed 
 How can anyone like this book??? its got to be the worst horror book I have ever read and I normaly like a good horror book now and then. I mean most Horror books or movies give me the creeps this one I could resd in the scaryest place in the world yaw and go to sleep. got to be the worst book ever writen by the way I am 13 just dont wana give out my account name on here late 
 When I purchased this DVD, I was hoping to get the complete picture- an unbiased presentation. From scratch I could sense what was to come. Bad presentation coupled with one sided propaganda forms the crux of this DVD. It is not well researched and very important issues have been completely omitted. What little was discussed appeared to be very tainted.  I definitely did not expect National Geographic to come up with this kind of a DVD. I will definitely think TEN times before I purchase anything from them. Maybe they should just stick to wildlife/geography/ecology and leave history/religion/spirituality alone 
 My pastor recommended this book and for the life of me I cannot figure out why.  I've read other articles by Jack Hayford in the past and he's one of the few charismatics who's scholarship I had some respect for.  No more.  This book is based almost exclusively on human experience and contains very little exegetcial content.  He interprets God's Word in the light of human experience instead of vice versa.  He doesn't define his terms, he comes to his argument assuming the legitimacy of tongues speaking today and doesn't make a Biblical case for it as I was hoping.  He claims that every instance of gibbersh tongues speaking is a known earthly language.  According to Hayford, because there are more than 6,000 known languages on the planet and no one person could possibly identify all of them; therefore if we don't recognize the gibberish it must be a known language that we are just unfamiliar with.  What kind of logic is that?  He also conveniently forgets the requirement for a tongues speaker to either have an interpreter present or to be quiet.   His assumption that even though we may not know the language we're supernaturally speaking, that we are somehow edified apart from understanding, without dealing with Paul's major thrust in I Cor. 12-14 on insisting that nothing be done apart from understanding because it would be of no value without it.  A typical charistmatic approach...long on anecdotal evidence, very short on exegesis.  I'm sure Rev. Hayford is very well meaning, but don't waste your money on this book 
 Can you say headache?  The video editing switches from multiple camera angles at a rate of about 1 camera every 2 seconds.  You never get to see anyone in the band "jam" out.  I think the editor wanted to avoid being boring by just showing the stage from one camera, but the result is the opposite extreme.  It pretty much ruined a perfect DVD for me.  The Band is stellar and the audio is incredible.  I think it's better to turn the tube off and just crank the speakers.  Or just buy the CD.  Compare this to Death - Live in LA and you will see what I mean 
 This is not one of Kellerman's best books.  I was so looking forward to the book coming out, but I was sadly disappointed with it.   The premise of the story was fine, Dr. Alex Delaware receives a scrapbook in the mail containing murder scene photos. These photos bring back haunting memories to Delawares friend, Milo Sturgis, who is a homicide detective.  As a matter of fact, these photos look familiar.  This was a great way to start the story, and I was hooked, but soon it all became confusing with too many characters and in a effort to keep the identity of the killer secret til the end of the book, the plot got fuzzy.  I usually love his books, but he missed the mark on this one.   If you are reading Kellerman for the first time, don't get this one.  If you are a returning fan, skip this one and use the 8 bucks for something better 
 Bennett book is underpinned by fear and loathing.  He blames parties not responsible for the so-called collapse of the family and of morality.  Self-righteous myopic heterosexuals like himself need to take stock of their own role in what ever de-evolution they perceive.  Stop scapegoating minorities 
 I should of written these years ago.  They are wack, plain and simple.  If it's on MTV or VH1, you know it's commercial.  They can't rap, they are just another of the Down south's ABC rappers 
 Establishing industry leadership gives companies an advantage over competitors: they can shape the industry in a way that benefits them in the long term. Platform Leadership deals with how companies can establish and maintain such a leadership.  The book starts by presenting four levers that companies can use to become leaders. The four levers are (as described in the review above): 1. Determine the scope of the firm 2. Design product technology strategically 3. Shape relationships with external complementors 4. Optimize internal organizational structures  The authors carefully analyze the rise of Intel as an industry leader and show how Intel chose to position the levers. This part of the book is worth 5 stars. The research was done in depth with many interviews of Intel managers. The analysis is insightful. I particularly liked the explanation of Intel's failure to enter some markets (video conferencing).  The authors then go on to show how other companies have achieved industry leadership. This is where the book starts to unravel. The research is skimpy, with pages after pages of copies of PR announcements. The analysis sections are short and often a repeat of the PR. There is very little of value.   Worse, it seems that every company sets the levers differently: some limit their scope (Intel) but others do not (Microsoft). Some are fully integrated (Microsoft) but others are a patchwork of small units (CISCO). In brief, it seems that the levers are irrelevant to the success as a platform leader.   Since the authors cannot detect a pattern to industry leadership they end up with a weak conclusion: becoming a platform leader requires a company to realize that it needs to influence partners. While this is true and in some ways insightful (how many companies do forget this piece of advice?), I cannot help but being disappointed by the book 
 I'd considered buying this book from Amazon, and decided to first examine a copy at the Boston Public Library. I was unimpressed. The tone seems aimed at middle-school students, and the text is littered with patronizing "Dick & Jane" anecdotes. A quick glance through the table of contents suggests that Grice and Skinner address nearly every conceivable aspect of public speaking -- but a closer examination reveals a complete lack of depth. It seems as if they simply brainstormed ways to add pages without actually investigating their subject.    The most derelict example I found was the second chapter, devoted entirely to a discussion of ethics. This chapter includes a section on plagiarism, where Grice and Skinner define plagiarism and warn students that getting caught may result in failing a class or being expelled from school -- hardly the sort of information you'd expect from a college-level textbook. Meanwhile, Grice and Skinner lazily sidestep the most challenging issue -- the employment of speechwriters -- by confining its mention to a brief, rhetorical question among the chapter-end exercises. In other words: "Here's a complex issue. We've exhausted our space with rudimentary ones, but we encourage you to do some real work on your own!"    There are some informative, useful books on public speaking. Richard Dowis and James Humes have each written excellent books on crafting and delivering a speech. Virgil Anderson and Ann Utterback have written valuable books on training your voice, and Livingston Taylor and Keith Johnstone have written classics on stage performance. My suggestion is to skip this book. I was thoroughly disappointed with its lack of ambition, and I'd hate to be stuck with a professor who found it respectable 
 I was a philosophy major in college and I hated this book.  But then again, the whole NAMBLA fic genre really doesn't do it for me.  I'm sure some literary aesthetes are going to pick this review apart, good for them.  I'm incredibly well-read and thought this one was just a tepid bore.

 *PLOT REVEALED*  An utterly worthless foray into English overbearance and haughtiness, this film marks Hitchcock as a worthy propagandist and architect of 'fear as subtle entertainment' in the pre-War 1930's.  Working and financed by the ministry of propaganda in London to indoctrinate subordinate English audiences into supporting the rationale for the vilification of Germany, Hitchcock eases the tension by making this a "comedy".    Wasting the first half on indulgent emptiness (the scene at an Austrian Hotel where the boring Brits are talking about Cricket and drinking tea), he then goes on to flabbergast us with indecipherable montages that are the most rank and absurd creations, the fight scene in the baggage cart for example.    His support for the upper Brit classes is especially drab and tedious, meandering between hero worship and idolatry, not to mention the wooden acting of the actors.  The story concerns a "secretive plot" about an old woman who has disappeared from a train traveling in the Austrian Alps, simplistic, innocuous even but Hitchcock wants us to believe that it is a most urgent matter because a fluffy headed ingenue doesn't want to think she imagined it all.  Of course, she will be the agent provocateur for exposing a nefarious plot by 'evil men'.  Immature plot?  Definately.  Banter, insipid and devoid of any vivacity, is exchanged between high brow English snobs in the most elusive way, bordering on reductio ad absurdum and yet they seem to be assured in figuring out what has transpired on the train.  This is nourishment for those who can't think very well.  The story continues until the stuffy, pretentious, oaf-like English on the train become diverted by bumbling and incompetent foreign agents in one of the most pathetic scenes ever in cinema, the Brits, debating the attack itself for 5 minutes in proper English, sit there in front of open windows, with one gun and hold off 24 well armed foreign agents for 20 minutes.  Also in this scene, the 80 year old woman "spy", jumps from the side and runs away into the forest just as easily, how 24 well armed foreign agents could be held from the train itself is a question any reasonable human can debate, or why they were even too stupid to see the old spy jump off.  If you can believe in the superiority of British snobs, then you must believe in the idiocy of this whole conniving film.    Of course you can guess the ending, the woman falls in love with the English chap who helped her on the train, and England is saved and her glorious social structure remains intact, an utterly absurd film from a director who is a specialist in fear and suspicion during the paranoid 1930's but most audiences will take this as merely a "thriller" instead of understanding its proper origin and purpose in ideology of propaganda.  
 DO NOT rely on this book to pass the exam. It lightly touches most of the important subjects, but goes nowhere near deep enough to be useful. I agree is it better written that the BCSI book, but it needs to be much more thourough in its handling of the subject matter. Very poor considering its Cisco 
 I have always enjoyed Rita Mae Brown's work. That being said, and yes, this  story line does wear abit thin, but the worst, unforgivable sin is that she read the story herself.  It was awful.  Several times she will start a sentence, only to stop and restart after a few words.  There was no feeling of character in her voice. Yoy can hear her swallow and clear her throat, so I guess it's the production values that are the biggest offender 
 Without a doubt Thomas Wolfe is the worst...I tried reading this book many years ago...it was awful and dull and boring beyond description...anyone who recomends this book must be a dullard. 
 I've been a fan of these games since the first one - Secrets Can Kill - came out.  I've played them all.  I'm not at all sure what's happened to the games, though.  While the graphics have steadily improved, the puzzles, plot, and gameplay have really gone downhill.    The first game, "Secrets Can Kill" had pretty horrific graphics, but the story was compelling and there were some fabulous puzzles in it.    Things really picked up with the second game, "Stay Tuned for Danger".  Better graphics and a very interesting story, very cool puzzles, great plot.    I can absolutely recommend Games 2 (Stay Tuned for Danger), 3 (Message in a Haunted Mansion), 4 (Treasure in the Royal Tower), 5 (The Final Scene), 6 (Secret of the Scarlet Hand), 7 (Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake), 9 (Danger on Deception Island), and 10 (Secret of Shadow Ranch).  These games are similar in length and have interesting puzzles.  Lots of areas where you can snoop around - which I really enjoy.    Game #8 (The Haunted Carousel) is interesting and has wonderful graphics, but is awfully short.    I did not at all enjoy #11 (Curse of Blackmoor Manor) as I found it way too difficult.   I also cannot really recommend #12 (Secret of the Old Clock). It was too short and repetitive.    I did somewhat enjoy #13 (Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon) and #14 (Danger by Design) but they were nowhere near the quality of the earlier games in terms of plot or puzzles.  And now, we have #15.  Outstanding graphics, but way too short.  The amount of repetition of puzzles in order to advance drove me completely crazy.  I don't mind Nancy running about doing errands to help people (for that, I thought Games 3 and 4 had it perfectly balanced).  But I like each task to be different and interesting.  Not mind-numbingly repetitive and boring.    This seems to be a factor of the more recent games - delivering telegrams in Game #12, painting pictures in Game #14, and now finding seashells and making necklaces in this game.    I miss looking for clues.  Putting together evidence for a purpose.  I miss puzzles that actually are woven into the fabric of the plot and are there to advance the game.  It seems like the repetition now might be so that it can be said that this game took X number of hours to complete.    I also miss learning useful things.  In #1, I learned about American Sign Language In #3, I learned about Chinese symbols and the San Francisco earthquake In #4, I learned about latitude and longitude and how a sextant works In #6, I learned SO much about the Maya and how to work a HAM radio In #7, I learned about Roman Numerals and Prohibition In #8, I learned how to make invisible writing! In #9, I learned how to work a HAM radio and about Pacific Northwest sea animals  After that, well, I didn't really learn very much of anything useful in any of the later games.    If you've never played a Nancy Drew game, please, please, PLEASE do yourself a favor and start with one of the earlier games (although probably not the very first one - the graphics aren't as good and switching discs can be highly annoying).  But give #2 - 9 a try; you won't be disappointed!  Oh please, Her Interactive, PLEASE go back to the way they used to be structured.  I'd gladly sacrifice some of the improved graphics if it meant regaining some plot, cohesion, or integrated, interesting puzzles. 
 I have listened to R&B and hip hop for over 15years and this is possibly the poorest way I have heard the way word "DJ" be used. This album is track after track of mediocre songs with "DJ" Clue shouting useless shout-outs at the beginning of every track. A DJ is supposed to mix, blend tunes and think about how he/she will use the 74mins of music time - this guy clearly has little DJ skills and insists on giving hiself props on EVERY TRACK. This album pales into insignificance compared to say Fun Master Flex who IS a DJ. This album is very very disappointing unless if you like "DJ" Clue's other material. Listen properly to the album before you buy. Having said that, the T-Boz tune is very good, however, like all the other tracks, it is spoiled by Clue's aimless screams at the beginning. There will be people who like this album for the combination of big-star artists in that respect, it is good. But as for DJ Clue - not talented as a DJ and on the whole, quite disappointing 
 Thank God I didn't and picked it up as a Bookcrossing book. No, seriously, what do I really think? YAWN! I've just finished chapter 8 and am still waiting for her to do something interesting. Although each chapter starts off with a quote about spying, the amount of "spying" she's done so far is contained in a paragraph and involves a short phone call. The rest of what I've read is devoted to  meandering through her past, in no particular chronological order, in the middle of nothing and jumps back to the present. Her memories are mainly about boyfriends she had or wished she had, small incidents about her past job that she hated(Doesn't hold a candle to The Devil Wears Prada), being cool and doing drugs in college. She spends most of the present trying to be cool with the homeboys in her office by making wisecracks on the fire escape during smoke breaks, or getting plastered and obsesses on a man, any man, as she can't seem to live a week without one no matter how much a loser. I'm afraid I can't finish this either. I have too many other books waiting to be read. I'm disappointed though because the title sounds like an interesting story 
 Spend your money for some other DVD. If you're interested in watching this movie, just rent it 
 Well written but dodges every touchy issue. Womens rights, minorities etc. One thing is to say how things ought to be and another to explain why things are the way they are.  
 Since the reviews printed on the inside cover of the book all are blurbs, here are my blurbs:  "Really hard to get into ... tough to follow who's who ..."  "Opens strong, but fizzles out early ..."  "I literally feel asleep while reading this book one night ..."  "You'll finally give up without really wondering who did it ... 
 Maybe it's just the geek in me crying out for mercy, but I find a lot of the details of this book pretty far-fetched.  Plus, after we figured out whodunit and such, it just seemed to drag on forever.  I ended up skimming the last 30 pages or so just to get it over with.  I thought it was OK, but it definitely caters to a less technically savvy audience than I : 
 I almost wasn't going to read this book.  The description didn't appeal to me at all.  But, as we all are die-hard Danielle Steel fans, I knew I had to try, thinking "Oh well, she HAS to get better!"  Wrong - what a dumb book, dumb story.  While I didn't hate this as much as Impossible (who can forget the wacky artist?), this book was just a waste of time to read.  And come ON, how much more could go wrong before the ball?  I did enjoy her mother-in-law though, and I wish you read more about her past.  But the story was exactly just "fluff."  Who cares about such things anyway?  How I'd love to read a real-life story of someone who actually STRUGGLES in this life!  Although we all read to escape our own lives perhaps, and sometimes books about exciting lives can take our minds off our own troubles for a bit, Danielle Steel's books take us nowhere and we just end up frustrated.  How can she not read all these reviews from her unhappy fans and try to change her ways?  Ah for the days of Thurston House, The Ring, Wanderlust.....those days are long gone, I'm afraid.  But yet - we keep reading - and are bonded by our constant disappointment 
 This guide to culinary careers is terribly overpriced for the information it contains. The quick descriptions of different culinary careers have some value, as do the appendices listing culinary publications and organizations. However, the career descriptions are quite short and the advice is unremarkable. On the topic of finding a culinary mentor, for example, the author advises you to find one. That's pretty much it - no discussion on how to choose a suitable mentor, or how to convince an experienced professional to take you on as a protege. The book mentions the apprenticeship system but doesn't explain how to find an apprenticeship. The section on choosing a culinary school/vocational program is much better, though.  Something trumpeted in both the book description here and on both covers of the actual book is the inclusion of up-to-date information on salary statistics and earning potential for the spectrum of culinary professionals. It must have been printed in invisible ink, because I don't see it *anywhere* (and yes, I have this exact edition). This promise was my primary motivation for getting the book, so I was very disappointed (disgruntled, even) that this information is NOT in the book after all.  Don't spend money on this book unless you're just looking for a quick overview of the career possibilities. That's the one thing the author does well - it describes (in brief) a wide range of culinary careers beyond the obvious white-linen restaurant ones.  This book could have been greatly improved if it had expanded on the career descriptions, perhaps including short interviews with actual culinary professionals, especially those in roles like institutional cooking or food research. Of course it also would have been much better if it had actually included the promised salary information, too.  It's a good book to have in a library or career center, but it's not much use for your home reference bookshelf 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's site for details on these items, which are also available via Amazon) 
 This book is a pioneering effort to simplify network analysis for the unitiated but... there are too many eccentricities and mistakes for this tome to be taken seriously as either  a technical guide (see Wasserman and Faust) or a sociological simplification 
 This book was a waste of money.  It's meant for beginners that aren't familiar with the terms and concepts of stock trading in general.  If you don't already know these terms or the basic concepts you shouldn't attempt to day trade.  If you do know these terms and concepts, then this book is a waste.  The day traders survival guide is a much better intro book and I highly recommend it over this one.  Other recommended trading books to start you off are High Probability Trading by Marcel Link and Trading for a Living by Alexander Elder 
 It's a great concept although resistance is almost useless. I'm in my mid-thirties and, although reasonably fit, have never been able to pull off hundreds of crunches mainly because of back problems when doing them. Here was a solution which claimed to get around this.  When I first got the unit, I gave it a go and found the resistance almost unnoticeable. I opened the front, replaced the yellow bands with the "heavy duty" orange ones and tried again - again, almost nothing.  At 6 seconds a rep, 10 minutes gets you 100 reps. Don't know about you but although I could do 100 crunches in the conventional sense, I would certainly know about it the next day. I tried 100 reps on this contraption two days in a row without feeling a thing. This makes the commercials you see showing the six pack wielding workout freaks claiming they "feel the burn" very hard to believe.   With that said, this isn't necessarily the fault of "As Seen on TV" that they sell this product - what's worthless to me may still be of value to someone else although I can't imagine who. They did offer my money back in full despite the usual 10% restocking fee but given that a third of the sale price was a non-refundable shipping cost, it hardly makes it worth the effort. Am going to find another use for it - perhaps a coat hanger? Positive voters must be getting kick-backs from somewhere. Perhaps they got their money back if they agreed to promote it.  Don't believe me - buy one and find out for yourself. 
 This book is definitely not one to purchase if you are looking for detailed accounts of climbing these mountains.We read far more about the planning and personal lives of these men; neither of whom is interesting enough to command this attention. The dialogue between the two men is incredibly canned and sappy and Ridgeway tries in vain to capture the true feelings resulting from these ascents. You would probably be better off reading individual guides if you want to get a feel for these climbs. There are definitely better books on the subject 
 There is two sides to this book. In one respect it is not nearly as comprehensive as it should be, in the other, it is ideal for someone who knows nothing about computers. Windows Professional for Dummies takes you through the bare minimum of features on a step-by-step basis. The advantage of this is that you don't have to be a genius to use the book, but the disadvantage is that you don't get as much out of the book as you would have liked. When my father first started using a PC he knew nothing about it and this book was a great start for him. I am impressed by my father's progress since he received this book, but I realize that most of his progress was through trial and error, not through this book. If you have to learn how to click a mouse, this book is great, if you want to be able to do more, I would recommend you look for another book 
 In this book the author tells us so there are only 2 effective attacking procedures, which leading to success - the combined attack and double blow. This is very important and not quite understood, but if you mastery these techniques you might not be so dangerous, but much more carefully player. If you want to make this book useful to you, you have to study it very carefully and minimum twice (it is thin - only 110 pages). All subjects are devoted to tactics, but there is one chapter devoted to strategy of attack. If you are "tactics scientific" you are in good place. In this book there are few useful mating attack mechanisms, it has showed coordination of the pieces and combinations - how it has born and how arises. I like to recover it because from time to time (once a 2-3 months), because each time I read it, I discover new things - particuraly how important is coordination of the pieces, how hidden treats are dangerous and complex to recognize (and to build) - sometimes they are very deep underground, but if you know how they build [what elements] and how to recognize them early, then you should not be afraid of them. I should note: sometimes complexity of chess combinations are sometimes very frustrating too see, but in closer look (and with much practice!) you can see and understand that they are "connected [composed] simple blocks". This book contains 19 (short) chapters and has no any tasks to solve. Level of this book is not so high [it is not difficult; maybe a bit - especially for quite begginers]. Advice for begginers: when you study it carefully you might see that it is quite fine and nice. To the end of my opinion I can only say that this author is respected Soviet author... (he wrote great endings in 5 volumes 20 years ago). I think this book is too expensive if you compare price to what it contains. If you want any good book about tactics and combinations you should to consider (best im my opinion): "Art of Attack in Chess" by Vladimir Vukovic or "One Thousand and One Winning Chess Sacrifices and Combinations". IMPORTANT: Review of Paul Imseih (Sydney) [Complete waste of money, January 30, 2005] is right :-(. This book is really poor. If you have bag of money to waste you might buy it, but I think there are many books much better than this one (see a bit sooner). If you have to buy book of this author you might buy "Chess Tactics for Advanced Players" - this is really good book which is worth its money. But this "Chess middlegames - essential knowledge" with 100% certanity is not! I gave it note 2 stars, because material might be interested (but not for 15$ - maximum 3 to 5$) 
 I was excited to get this book because of the great reveiws it received.  But I quickly became dissapointed.  The beginning started off good and had lots of promise to be an exciting and enjoyable read...but after I read 40 pages still nothing exciting happened.  It took forever for the two main characters to get together, I was bored with them.  And I really got sick of hearing about all the friends and their boring lives.  Usually I love Susan Elizabeth Phillips's novels.  My favorites being Kiss an Angel and Dream a Little Dream 
 Andrew Weill is perhaps the most well-known of these type of practioners.  Unfortunately, some of what he has to say has been clinical disproven. For example, in study after study, large amnounts of Vitamin C given orally do absolutely nothing more than a   placebo for cancer patient.  Yet he still preaches this.  Given intravenously, actually, there is some evidence that it may work for some people..but it does not work by stimulating your immune system..it works in a different way.  The book How To treat and Prevent Cancer with Natural Medicine is far superios in my opinion, even though it was written by four naturopaths in 2002.  Even then they admitted that clinical studies were showing that there was no advantage of taking Vitamin C orally over a placebo,  and the authors freely admitted it. But much of what the discussed in that book..Eight Magic supplements to take when you have cancer..has actually been proven. I am a cancer patient with myeloma.  Maitake D fraction, curcumin (it must be taken w/bioperine an hour before meals), selenium, and some other things they mention have all been proven in clinical studies or are being worked on.  They do not promise that they have a cure of anything..they only say it may help in the context of complimentary medicine. They do not claim an organic diet will cure cancer or that medical science would hide it if they have a cure.  The book by Quiallan I think claims that an organic diet will cure you, and there is post after post that this has actually worked.  Maybe it has..but as a myeloma patient..my immune system is overstimulated, so I cannot take most immune system supplements..and some like Vitamin C are actually antagonistic In Vitro to myeloma treatments..this usually translates to the same thing in the body..unlike positive in studies that often do not pan out.  Anyway, I am not saying Dr. Weill is all wrong, but do not pretend he has a cure.  I have known secondhand two people who have been cured by long fasts of only carrot juice, another two by healers (I  am not religious), and one who claims that barley juice and lowering his PH totally got rid of his cancer.  I believe these people all may have gotten rid of their LOCALIZED tumors this way. For blood cancers, such as leukemia and myeloma (a cancer of blood produced in the marrow), we do not exactly have localized tumors.  But with the addition of supplements mentioned in Dr. Murray et al's book, my response to medications has been phenomenal and I have went into remission. Unfortunately, at this time, myeloma always comes back from remission. There is new understanding why this may be so..that just came out December 2005.  There is even a drug available..but it will not be available to myeloma patients for a long while 
 I had high hopes when I picked up this book because Styron is a terrific writer and I was interested in the subject. By the time I was done I nearly threw it across the room. Admittedly, Depression makes for a tough topic, but that's not good enough.  There's more to Depression than staring at an empty page, unable to muster the courage to write one single word. The dark places of the soul also have their fires, their drama, even if they are played out in secret.   I will grant that the writing is spare and elegant, as you would expect. But I would have traded all the insider literati name-dropping for one paragraph that gave me a visceral sense of how he felt, something that put me there with him. I have read instruction manuals for appliances with more passion and conviction.   Styron is candid about his descent into alcoholism, but the self-destruction inherent in alcoholism does not imply the elimination of ego, frequently it heralds the triumph of ego. In Darkness Visible, Styron maintains egomaniacal control of his subject through aloof detachment, showcasing a carefully polished veneer, never inviting the reader in. 
 Unfortunately i was not impressed by this book, i had heard so many great things and bought it based on reviews, and my love of nature - but i have picked this book up three different times and can not get into it, i just find it boring. I am not a nature hater, i have a bird feeder, a bird bath, a dog and a cat as pets, I love animals and can stare at the birds at the feeder for a long time, infact that is much more entertaining to me than this slow moving, boring book.  I will pass it on to a friend, and hopefully they can find the magic in the book that i was unable to appreciate. i just found it to be too dry 
 This book gives you basic info on how to conduct business - that's available gratis. Chapter 7 was a major dissapointment. If they weren't willing to share their secrets, then why write a book? Oh, I know...because there's more...an insidious way of promoting their "other" company.   Nice try, but I can see right thru this weak marketing effort.  I returned my book to Borders. Keep your receipt, as you will be dissapointed with their banal Ginsuism 
 I never bought a copy of this book but was provided an unsolicited copy by the author thirty years ago. I regarded it then, as I do now, as a serious challenge against, not a part of, historical bible-based Christianity. Since spiritism and necromancy are among the pagan occult practices specifically identified and forbidden in the bible (Deuteronomy 18:10-13, Leviticus 20:6), it can be expected that a christ portrayed from such sources would also be in contradiction with the bible (fell in the garden of Eden(i.e. sinned), reincarnated numerous times, sat under eastern masters, etc.). These assertions may be intriguing to someone who is under the enticement of the occult, but to the orthodox Christian they are utter blasphemy against the Son of God. The book convinced me that Cayce functioned as a spiritist medium as defined in Deuteronomy 18 and that the Cayce readings were demonically inspired.   Nowhere in the bible does the Spirit of God endeavor to fascinate anyone with the prospect of spiritual knowledge, rather he deals with the deeper issues of the conscience; the imperative of repentance and new birth, and the seriousness of death and judgment to come. "And as it is appointed unto man once to die, but after this the judgment" - Hebrews 9:27. Denying these biblical tenets in favor of reincarnation is serious business as reincarnation glosses over personal accountability and the right of a holy God to reveal every secret and to settle all accounts at the final judgment.   Being a born-again Christian since 1967 and having advised the now-deceased author of my convictions in these matters, I would not recommend this book to anyone seeking Christ, but rather the gospel of John, then the rest of the bible. The true, living Lord Jesus is there. Repent of your sins, receive him as Lord of your life, keep his words and you will find him, for he then will flood your inner being with himself (John 14:23).    "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" - John 3:16 
 I notice most of the 5-star reviewers posted in 2000.  I don't think these sets have aged very well, unlike, say GU Sydney or Expeditions done with Sasha.  This is a bit too dancey and not enough trancey for my taste, if that makes any sense 
 Roger Ebert is a great movie reviewer and he is the most famous film critics in The United States, but this book will be an unnecessary waste of money.  To find all these reviews, a film lover just has to go to Ebert's website on the Internet.  There, the reader will find all these reviews and many more!   
 Philosophical musing of hard core materialistic reductionist, incapable of open-mindedness to overcome blindness of shortsighted old-paradigm scientific dogmas, thus incapable to see a revolutionary "big picture", which is offered by cutting-edge scientific discoveries of our days in the fields of quantum physics, epigenetics, neurobiology, neurosociology, social and emotional intelligence, etc., etc., etc. This book gives no articulated, nor substantiated answer to the question it claims to give, just contributes to mental confusion and emotional illiteracy. Enlightenment is something the author would NEVER enjoy... Waisted time and money for those readers, who could sense the historical merger of all scientific disciplines and ancient wisdom we are witnessing now. 
    No one with a true understanding of Billie Holiday would consider her a Blues Singer.  As such to truly study Blues Legacies, it would be better if a Blues singer like Memphis Minnie, one of the greatest female instrumental blues singers, were included. Surely, Dinah Washington, justifiably named the Queen of the Blues, or Ruth Brown, (Miss or maybe now Ms Rhythm) would be more appropriate to a study of Black blues women.    This hints that the generalizations in this book may be the result of pushing around reality rather than studying it. This is an all too frequent problem in the writing of academics who seem more concerned about creating their own little niche of analysis, than situating their work in the realities of life, culture, and art where the blues or Jazz, and Billie's real life live.      Billie did not like to be called a Blues Singer.  If we are concerned with the voices of Black women, then someone involved in this book should have at least had the respect to listen to Billie Holiday's voice on the matter.  She considered herself a Jazz singer and later a cabaret singer.    She recorded very few blues.  The two blues she recorded again and again "Billie's Blues" and "Fine and Mellow" were only recorded because in two different recording sessions there was time to record additional songs, but no preparation or charts existed for any song, so an easy to play blues was selected. Billie recorded them and performed these two tunes often because she had the author's credit and publishing on them which made it easier and more profitable. This is despite the fact that the exact word sets had been sung and recorded by real blues singers before Billie had the brains to record AND copyright them.  Listen to Helen Humes sing an exact version of Fine and Mellow with another name during the first Spirituals to Swing concert that took place BEFORE Billie recorded her version.           A good contrast with Billie, though male, was her friend and often colleague Jimmie Rushing who served with her in the Basie Band. Despite his penchant for claiming he was a ballad singer as well--Rushing actually thought that when Billie left Basie that rather than hiring another singer, he alone could fill the gap--Rushing's recordings with Walter Page's Blue Devils in the 1920s, with Moten in the early 1930s, and with Basie in the 1930s and 1940s are masterpieces of the blues. Many of his renditions like Good Morning Blues have become standards for blusicians of all stripes.  Lesser known but deserving more attention are his great blues recorded with KC musicians for John Hammond on Vanguard in the 1960s.    Otherwise she recorded few blues, particularly in her most artistically developed period between 1934 and 1945. Indeed,  Billie's lack of a blues repertoire and disinclination to perform blues cost her her position as female vocalist with the Count Basie Orchestra, a match made in heaven. While there were no doubt other factors involved, many Basieites especially Buck Clayton who was quite close to Billy have said Billie was replaced because she didn't perform enough blues to suit John Hammond who acted as de facto manager and AR man with the Basie band.  Hammond replaced Billie Holiday with Helen Humes who had been recording blues for ten years before she joined Basie.  Humes, of course, continued to record Blues with Basie, and then as an independent singer from  then until her death keeping her magnificent jump blues alive for several generations of listeners.  Clayton's complaint is a standard one leveled at white Jazz producers like Hammond and Norman Grantz that they wanted blues, not more harmonically developed music that Black Jazz musicians really wanted to play.        The blues is a specific genre of African American musical, poetic, and cultural expression with its own distinct history, evolution, and practices.  Simply collapsing every  Black performer into the Blues makes the blues meaningless and demeans the work of the millions of women and men who have created the blues in the last 110-120 years.        Another insult to Billie, is the tendency to see her as a "blues figure" because of her "tragic" life.  This is the tendency to evaluate Billie as the public life disaster that she tended to milk in desperation in the last years of her life symbolized by the fake autobiography _Lady Sings the Blues_.  This contrasts than the artistic consideration she deserved and received from other musicians and singers.  She was a competent and practicing jazz artist, raised in the music business (her father complained he played guitar for every jazz artist in NYC in the 1930s and early 1940s but Billie.  Her mother boarded musicians and catered musical parties). From a young age, Billie was considered as knowledgeable as the top instrumentalists of the music by those top instrumentalists.  Those who rely on the "tragedy" to induct Billie into the Blues express a greater ignorance given that as her own drug addiction advanced, her music had less and less of a connection with the blues, climaxing in "The Lady in Satin" which is a vain attempt to take The Lady into non-Jazz pop. All of her original blues were recorded in her pre-heroin youth in the 1930s, not in the 1950s when Billie's self-made "tragedy" had begun to destroy her voice and musicial viability and then her life.   It is quite bizarre for anyone to claim Billie's performance of Meeropol's song "Strange Fruit," has any relationship to blues music given her very straight reading of the tune, the unblueslike straight minor it is given, and the unjazzlike accompaniment. If one wants to see what a Blues Singer can do to this song, one needs to listen to the astounding version recorded by Josh White which is blusey and also more dramatic and satisfying than Holiday's more celebrated version.  Holiday's performance of "Strange Fruit," tends to be elevated by folks for the justifiable political message the song provided and the controversy involved.  However, an honest or even rational evaluation of the performance seems to be unavailable these days.  This raises yet another ignorance, the outsider's view that "The Blues" is always sad or "tragic."  The immense body of the most popular blusicians--that is blues artists that Black people listened to-- of the 1930s like Memphis Minnie, Tampa Red, and Leroy Carr served up a bunch of pretty happy, often double entendre, blues. Blues music was overwhelmingly dance music, with performers not playing the three minute blues contemporary white blues wannabe's deduce from recordings, but 10 to even 30 minute versions of their songs for dancers from Juke Joints to the big ballrooms. Unfortunately, people who have never studied the blues as a real genre, misplace it as the solo moaning of the "existential Negro," rather than the jumping music of a century of African American Saturday nights.                 As an African American performer of the blues and other Black traditional musics as well as a scholar of African American music tradition, this kind of non scientific, non-traditional, grab bag sloppiness about our music and our culture is a sign that even among our own, the outsider's false generalizations about the blues reign.  You would think our own would know the score.   
 I was pretty dissapointed in this set. Perhaps it's better suited for an engineer. I bought 507 Mechanisms at the same time and found it to be much easier to understand even though it was originally published over 100 years ago. I sent this set back b/c it just wasn't worth the money to me 
 I have bought many parenting books & found the information in this book somewhat limited & not very informative.  There are plenty of other good parenting books which go into better detail than this one 
 I found these essays disappointing as one quite familiar with the strength and breath of Dobyns work.  I felt the questions he asks are too easy, too obvious for such a formidable thinker, I found this quite surprising, and  so though I enjoyed the essays, I didn't really learn anything new 
 Dr. David Beck is a pediatrician who is still grievibg the loss of his wife Elizabeth, 8 years ago. Elizabeth was supposedly murdered when was kidnapped all that time ago. All this time later as David still searches for clues as to what really happened-appears a message on his computer, It is a warning which reads "Tell No One." Tell no one what though? This writer keeps giving warnings to David, and the next thing he sees is Elizabeth's picture waving at him looking as though she is still alive and well-and maybe she is. But in the process, David is getting framed for strings of murders, as someone is against him, and wants revenge. And this person will stop at nothing to get David, And not only that, but he just knows that Elizabeth is still alive after receiving clues to meet her at a resort.   I thought the book had too many twists and turns at once, and in places was disjointed as well. However, it kept me interested until the end 
 Metallica were simply one of the worst most overrated and pathetic bands ever. Most of their trite albums deserve no stars. Their only good cds are either Master of Puppets, or Black Album. KILL EM ALL is such a bore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! James Hetfield, the lead singer just screams and can't sing at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Why???? Why can't he sing more proper like Lou Greamm(Foreigner), & Mark Knopfler(Dire Straits)???????? Each and every song on this album is bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't listen to the people who rate Metallica's albums a five star. They are overrated....Green Day is better. Get Them, Dire Straits, and Foreigner insted.  Ps. This album is worth a minus trillion. 
 I bought a new state-of-the-art computer in February that came preloaded with Windows Vista. I was initially excited to get a computer that was running the newest operating system, and I hoped it would mean that my computer would have a much longer effective life. I have been nothing but disappointed since receiving this machine, especially knowing that had I called Dell, they would have installed XP instead.  PROs: -Better security (it prompts me & allows me to stop some of the annoying "automatic" programs that software makers sneak onto your system) -Better appearance (this is strictly cosmetic, and I'd rather stare at an ugly screen that worked rather than a pretty, useless one)  CONs: -FREEZING: I use this computer 2-3 hours a day and I can expect 1-2 freezes/day. Restarting often fails, and I have to cut the power and restart again. -DISPLAY PROBLEMS: although the cosmetics of the program were better, Vista can't display anything right. I tried updating the display driver which caused a major crash after restarting. I had to boot in safe mode and rollback the driver to get my computer back. Apparently, the newest display drivers are incompatible with Vista. -INCOMPATIBILITY: Entirely too many programs are incompatible with Vista, including some fairly big ones (lots of Adobe software, iPods, display drivers, etc.) I know Vista is new, and these software companies are slow to adapt, but does it really make sense for an operating system like Vista to render virtually all of my other software obsolete? Why can't Vista play nicely with the other kids? -ITS SLOW!!!-- Part of the reason I bought a new, state-of-the-art computer was to replace my old laptop (which still runs OK, but has become a little buggy & sluggish in the past 4 years). Although this computer is light years ahead of the old one, it actually runs EVEN SLOWER than my old laptop. Technical support has largely attributed this to the demands of Vista.  BOTTOM LINE: 1. IF YOU ARE NOT GOOD WITH COMPUTERS, AVOID VISTA LIKE THE PLAGUE 2. VISTA IS A RIP-OFF. Save your money and keep/get XP-- I'm probably going to return my computer and make the manufacturer install XP so I can regain some speed and system stability. Maybe in the future Vista will work OK, but not right now... 3. The incompatibility issues-- though there are several-- conspicuously include problems with Mac-oriented software (iPod, Adobe). I can't help but feel that Microsoft built-in these specific incompatibility issues in order to battle Apple 
 The scripts are buggy and don't even work out of the box and they certainly aren't well written enough for a production website. The contact email address in them bounces, perhaps the author's gone into hiding in shame.  On the plus point they do give some ideas on what could be done to improve a site, as long as you write your own Perl 
 I purchased this book for a gender studies class and upon attempting to read it, realized that pages 109-140 are completely missing. GONE.  Needless to say, I am not particularly thrilled that this wasn't caught by someone.  The content of the book, however, I would give 5 stars. Lots of historical insights and information I didn't know much about 
   "Evan Cornog's masterful new look at the American presidency explores the ways our presidents craft persuasive personal narratives and how their storytelling can capture the public imagination and build the support necessary to govern," exclaims the flyleaf. In reality, this is an object lesson in how the disingenuous journalist can craft their stories to appear as scholarly research when, in fact, they are just old fashioned partisan campaigning.    Cornog's book should serve as a warning to anyone who believes the media are "objective": Cornog is an associate dean for plannig and policy at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism and publisher of the Columbian Journalism Review.    My copy of "Power and the Story" is now loaded with slips of paper, each bookmarking a lie or distortion in Cornog's campaign tract. Cornog claims that the old Soviet Union was an American stereotype rooted in habitual ignorance or modern prejudice. Just what does Cornog find admirable about the old Soviet Union? Its gulag system? Its forced exile of minorities? Like others who apparently felt that acceptance of the Soviet Union was the right thing, Cornog casts Ronald Reagan's declaration of the Soviet Union as a message "inadequate to the complexities of the world." Why do people like Cornog come out and specifically say what was good and admirable about the Soviet Union?    In Cornog's view, Lyndon Johnson embodied the Texas Populist Tradition while George W. Bush is rooted in the Conferdate past. The single tenuous reference to support this theory is to yet another overtly partisan screed. This reminds me of Stalin citing Lenin as a persuasive authority.    Time after time, Cornog bases his assertions on the assertions of other partisan and sometimes thoroughly discredited sources such as Joseph Wilson whose partisan claims were debunked by investigative committees on both sides of the Atlantic. But such minor details cannot deter a rabid partisan like Cornog from his appointed rounds. He is a part of the journalistic community, where truth is apparently the first casualty.    In the final analysis, Cornog offers sophmoric history of how - big surprise - Presidential campaigns weave legends around their candidate and how history distorts them. He pays no attention to how determined such posthumous efforts can be, as in the case of John F. Kennedy. All of his contemporary sketches are clearly skewed: Democrats are all saintly, Republicans evil.    In all, this is just another anti-Bush rant. What makes it disturbing is that the author is someone who apparently is an "educator" of future journalists. With Cornog's work as an example, we can whistle goodbye to whatever shreds of honesty and objectivity remain in journalism.  Jerr 
 I really like Jimmy Smith and his B4...  However, this CD has two problems: 1) it isn't a blues CD, it is a Jazz CD.  2) It doesn't feature enough Jimmy Smith, rather the trumpet and sax are also featured.  If the CD were called Dot Com Jazz, I would give it more stars, but wouldn't have bought it... 
 I needed information on how to settle a claim on my own after a car accident. This book gives very little information about any of its topics. I eventually found Car Accident Secrets at http://www.caraccidentsecrets.com which had an over 50 page book with Forms and Step by Step explanations.   That book helped me save over $3700.00 on lawyers fees and is an awesome guide before or after you have an accident.  This book is just too simplistic which I should have expected, When so many topics are covered in one book it must be really hard to be very descriptive. I should have known better 
 yes this book is about a love story between bussy and dame monsoro.  her husband monsoro is not getting any, how would you feel. this book teaches you a lesson and this lesson, don't buy books you don't know, cause they [are bad 
 Isn't it frustrating when a book spends a lot of time building up the problem-to which you say, "Yeah! yeah! That's me!" and then gives you no answer, or a weak one to which you say, "No duh!" I'm afraid this book is one of them. The title is misleading because you assume he will help you find the life you've only dreamed of, or at least point you in the right direction to get started! But I was left depressed after reading it because it basically says that God gives us desires that we can't have on earth so that we will long for Him and Heaven. I don't believe that's the abundant life Jesus promised. So I went to the Bible. (I should have gone there first!) I looked up every time it talks about desires and got my answer. "Delight yourself IN THE LORD and He WILL give you the desires of your heart!" Ps. 37:4 So I set out to seek Him. I started reading "Knowing God" by J.I. Packer and began to get answers to all my questions about desire! I hope you'll find them too-in Him 
 Listen closely and you'll notice that she slips off key several times during the second half of "Lodestar," betraying a weakness in her voice and ear. It would've been a nice song had it ended halfway through 
 I bought this collection hoping it would be good...it's the same old junk they've been playing on CMT. Reba's music videos are OKAY, nothing great, and I figured that they would be specially edited or something for this DVD...but they aren't. Very disappointed. Waste of money. Reba can't sing worth beans! Her voice sounds terrible! Reba needs to get off her a** and get a REAL job instead of mooching off of these hard working country fans. Get a life REBA 
 If you pick up this large book please take a close look at the genealogy chart. From the top down it looks like the unwrapping of a rope. As the rope unravels it becomes frayed, chewed upon and ratty. That is what happens to this book. I must confess that I just had to finish it because I wanted it to end not as I had predicted. But, it did end as predicted. For example, once you looked at the chapter titles and saw that the end was titled "The Blitz",  when reading the chapter where the Romans hid the gold you immediately knew that it would be found after a German bomb hit that place in World War II - it did and it was!  This book is NOT Follett's "Pilars of the Earth" nor is it any one of Michner's - not even "Poland"! It is too long, to frayed and not small enough for an airplane read. I cannot recommend it to anyone. I have not read Sarum, and now I won't 
 While The Fear Book and The Depression Book might be amongst the best books in their class, they are still complete nonsense, which doesn't say much for this class of book. I regret wasting my money. I'd sell them on but I think people, particularly suffering people, need protection from this autho 
 If the Kranks really did what they set out to do and skip Christmas, that would have been a good story.  The end.   Instead, they end up having to scramble to try & make Christmas "happen" for their daughter unexpectedly coming home.  In other words - a typical stressful material holiday, instead of a celebration of friends, family, or even, gasp! Christ's birth.  I agree - if you don't want to celebrate Christ's birth, if you don't want presents and holiday decorations and family time - skip it.  Why torture yourself?    It would have been a good story if they did this.  Instead, the plot deteriorated into a very stupid, ridiculous and unrealistic dash to the finish line of "making Christmas happen."    A completely unsatisfying and unfunny read.  Threw it away so others wouldn't have the displeasure of reading it 
 I would lie if I say that I saw Titus or heard the soundtrack (I take it it's true that some songs were copies ), but what I was frustrated is that I heard a totally ripped traditional macedonian song called "Zajdi,zajdi jasno sonce", here disguised as the 24th title - " Message for the queen ". Hmmm, I wonder how Tyler gets his "inspirations".. 
 To begin with the movie Tootsie is classified as a genre of romance and comic.This movie is produced in New York. The protagonist is Michael Dorsey and he is the most important character in the film.The situation of this movie is of a man that is a talent actor but for reasons of money he decides to dress like a woman.For the reason that he cannot continue woring in the job he has and that his manager tell him nobody would hire him because he is unemployed  by that time. So there is where Dorothy appears and he starts working as a women is a soap opera in televison where he becames so famous. He gets the job here but he did it without having the intention of hurting anyone and also anyone in the place knew that he was a man dresses like a woman.In addition he falls in love with one of the woman that works with him in the soap opera. Thre is only one friend that knows what he is doing. He has one problem and is that his bestfriend falls in love with him but he didn't treat her well for the reason that he is in love with the other woman.The characters of this movie are really good actors evryone seems to knoe what they are doing.THe way the character acts in the movie is ok and the decision the man takes to wear  women's clothin instead of try to find a job in the way he is seems to me very intelligent. Because he could only accept that he was unemployed but no he decides to do something so that he could work. The stes in the movie are really well done and I like the part where the father of the woman that acts in the ospa opera gives a ring to dorothy without knowing thta she was a man.The lightnoing is was ok in every scene you could see everything ok and well iluminated. The costumes the actors used where a little diffrerent form he ones we use right now but eventhough they were not the same they look ok.Furthermore th emusic they put inspires the movie to look more interesting, there were not that much music but it was ok. This movie could be reall in life because  sometimes when people dont have jobs or they got fire they do everything they can to have a job. I will really recommend this movie to my audience because itis interesting to see how his man do all that work with enthusiam and it really leave us a message of life. 
 At the end of this film Gene Hackman's character, strung out thanks to his surveillance heavy lifestyle, finally snaps and pulls apart his house in search of a mythical bug. This scene concludes an examination of the psychological toll that surveillance takes not only on the listen-ee but also the listener. Hackman plays Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who is at the top of his field. He gets assigned a mysterious conversation that he has to piece together throughout the film. More interesting to me was to see all the little ways that his job affected his life. He staunchly defends privacy, even though it is his job to invade it. He refuses to open up to people because he is paranoid that anything he says will be used against him. I know that today it is very fashionable to criticize Bush and his wire tapping program but this film only piles on. The chilling affect we watch take place in the world of Harry Caul is a microcosm for what is happening in our world today. Simply because you are aware of Bush's spying ways causes you to engage in self-censorship every time you send an email or talk on a cell phone. Harry deals with the reality of his situation by descending into madness, and while that may not be healthy I'm not going to be the one to say that he is handling it the wrong way.  While there are lessons here that deal with living in Bush's America, this still isn't a very good film. This is a much smaller scale than Coppola usually deals with and it doesn't seem to be a very good fit for him. The script was original and unpredictable. However, it was also slow and filled with nonsense. I watched the film twice and still don't have a firm grasp on what happened at the end. Also, the scene in which we visit Harry's twisted dream was a total miss for me. The purpose was to show just had mad he had gone. To me it looked like Coppola losing control of his script and inserting a scene which only served to take the viewers out of the film. Hackman gives a good performance which was the norm for him pre-"Unforgiven."  A dashing Harrison Ford is trotted out to remind us of just how old he has gotten. Still, this film falls flat.  Most of the film involves Harry trying to figure out the entire conversation. The tools he is using look downright quaint compared to what we know Big Brother is using today. I liked the way this film reminded me of "Rear Window." As in that film we watch as a lonely man has his imagination run away from him. It is a theme that affects us in our daily lives. Every story we hear has holes and lies in it. We have to fill those holes and sort out the BS to come to a perceived reality. But what if we're wrong? Nobody likes being called paranoid and nobody likes to be asleep at the wheel. If for no other reasons watch this film to explore these ideas. Then think about whether your communication behavior is paranoid or ignorant, and whether your Ok with your cell phone coming with a built in bug. **1/2  
 	And lo' my children, the lord said unto thee that... wait a moment... this is the modern age why am I talking like a medieval preacher? Maybe that's because the profoundly stupefying effect that The Viccar of Wakefield by Oliver Goldsmith had on me.  	The story starts off in a monotone text voice and goes on like that for the entire one hundred ninety nine pages, give or take a few pages depending on version. The story follows a preacher and his family as they fall from grace into poverty. A merchant steals all the money that Viccar Primrose has invested, leaving them poor and forcing them to move out from their home in Wakefield. The book continues and follows the family's trials and tribulations. 	This book was extraordinarily hard to read, I would not recommend it to anyone that is not a college level English student, and even then only at your own risk. No words are in quotes, the fourth wall is broken constantly, and the main character just preaches what the author thinks about everything. It is probably one of the hardest books I have ever read, and I am a junior English major in college.  	The characters are amazingly flat, the plot has some redeeming qualities though. The plot shows how the people of the time lived, had fun, and loved; not to mention how mothers regarded their children. The ending though was so... contrived that it ruined whatever interest the main story had.  	All in all, this story was a waste of time. If you want to learn how things worked in that age, there are plenty of stories that are easier to read, much more accurate, and have less author interruption then this book. Its negatives greatly outweigh its positives, so unless you have to read it, stay away. 
 VERY USEFUL IN PLANNING ANY WEDDING. I'VE WRITTEN MY 1ST CERAMONY AND AM VERY HAPPY WITH ALL THE GUIDENESS, ALL THE IDEAS AND HELP FROM THE BOOK.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOO 
 Hobsbawm's metaphysical system, communism, ultimately denies national sentiment.  So we can expect, and we do indeed receive, considerable attempts throughout the book to diminish, degrade and put down nationalism -- everything from the anti-intellectual argument that nationalism only began when the word "nation" appeared, to an exegesis of its evils in the 20th century.  This bias is made worse by high-handed, hypocritical lecturing at the end of the first chapter about how the social scientist is supposed to be "objective."  Phffft!  Eric is one of the last people in the world to lecture us on objectivity 
 As someone whose adult ADHD diagnosis changed and enriched my life, I feel called to write a reaction to this book.  I truly feel I am part of the increasingly small number of people who HAD A TRUE and ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS.  Also, at my employement, I work with a guy who is diagnosised autistic, and feel I know him fairly well.   In contrary to what I feel this book is saying, I have been incredibly baffeled as to what autisim is, or any understanding of it what so ever.  I even told my parents, "I think autism is the opposite of whatever ADHD is."  I don't think I have ever been as shocked to read something as when I came across this book.  What comes to mind, is that ADHD is actually a rare disorder/blessing that many non-ADD (as well as autistic) children and adults are being falsly diagnosed as.  ADHD has been as abused and misunderstood as much as the way most of our modern educational systems have been to the true ADDers themselves!  I am curious about more on this topic, and will be watching for it.  On a personal level, however, all intution tells me that that ADHD, and especially ADD, are being twisted and contorted farther and farther away from its original discovery and meaning!  
 I found this woman to be a bit crazy.  One minute she's saying that you should never ever criticize someone's writing, next minute she's telling us which sample of writing is better than the other and which we should emulate.  She actually says that her students' writing was better than someone who's already been published, which was alright at first but after about 10 different examples of her bashing the published writer, I found her to be quite pompous. All writing is subjective, and I don't see what gives her the right to tell us which writing is BETTER than another, based on HER point of view.  I felt like I was being yanked around by a leash.  She also says we should just sit around being lazy and idle, and that it's a good thing.  I'm sorry, I just don't see it her way.  It's like a recipe for disaster.  Anyway, that's just my take on it.  Take from it what you will 
 I am so sorry I read this book under the illusion it was a mystery type of book. The author has been writing on the edge of fictional biography/mystery, and this time she crossed the line.  I got bewildered when the "plot" never turned up, the bad guys were just so unimportant that the twins linguistic skills just overrode their appearance on the scene and Peabody's maternal instincts just couldn't be bothered with evil doers.  The book is probably fine for those who bought the author's work for reading about the sentimental family interrelations but for those who expected something more exciting it is a dissapointment.  I feel as if I was sold this book on false pretenses.  
 I like Metallica first of all. But this was their worst release along with Kill Em All. All the songs on this album are really horrendous. Metallica only made about a few good albums, want to get one???? Get Master of Puppets, Black, and Ride The Lightning. They all have about 3-7 good songs. This album is a waste!!!! Get those albums insted 
 I LOVE the series. Have read every book. I am disappointed that they started out in paperback and when it became popular they switched to Hardcover. Tacky in my opinion. But anyhow. I love EVE, Roarke and all of them. In my opinion this one is lame and boring. I actually felt that I eithe wanted to skip pages ( but you never can because right then and there you might miss something ) or just was very eager to read about anything the friends and buttler had to offer. It was okay to find out about another piece of Eve's past. But she goes on and on and on... and yes it is important, and in every book it is mentioned, this time it was written in a very lame and boring style. Very sad. The entire story had no umpf to it. It is as if Nora Roberts wrote it with half her brain already dreaming of her next vacation or she was bored with this as well and couldn't quite get it right. That happens. Doesn't make it bad or the series bad. I LOVE it. But this one, what a drag it was. Blah. I could tell from the beginnig who it was. Now we just had to wait and find out the details that usually EVe puzzles together. It was as Eve was just tired. And the story just didn't move on. No umpf and fire behind it. Just listing of situations, ideas and people's problems. Boring. I recommend this series to anyone interested, but of course hope you will start with the first one. To fully understand the relationship between all of them. And why now do we have to be cross with Mira? It not just sad but stupid as well. Doesn't fit. Never got the point in the last book, why it ticked EVe off so much. So her friend had a bit of a hard time accepting that this icone of hers wasn't all he seemed. Not as if Eve never had her moments of meltdown. Yes she always did her job right but so did Mira, she delivered in the end. I love the relatinoship between Mira and Eve and really didn't need to read that they were not doing well together. And the make up was, okay but not thrilling.  Okay. Enjoy this book, I am sure it will thrill many but for me it was a boring book.  
 My daughter tried this stuff first and hated it.  It made her feel sick but also disoriented.  She was trying to read a magazine but couldn't understand a word of it.  She gave them to me and I took one before heading off to a meeting.  I was asked to take the minutes but really struggled to concentrate to do so.  I suddenly felt so jittery and dizzy.  I couldn't focus on any object or understand what was being said.  I was afraid I would have a heart attack or something.  I had a very disoriented and disconnected feeling.  Thank God I wasn't driving!  This is definately not a good product for many people 
 Take a catalog of tactical gear and weaponry (complete with gushing descriptions of brand names and specs).  Wind around it the outline of a half-thought-out plot, people it with cardboard characters, toss in one or two short-lived but totally predictable plot twists, and you've got a Brad Thor novel. Complete and utter drek.   The biggest mystery in this book is how a writer of so little talent manages to get published anywhere outside "Soldier of Fortune. 
 In response to erikguy's review: Aren't life's little ironies funny? In several of your reviews, you've been heard to attack "stupid 80's metalheads" over their taste in music, calling them, among other things: "retarded" and "cowardly." Yet in your recent review of Funeral For A Friend's album "Hours," you actually sided with my negative opinion of the album. I, who proudly proclaim myself to be - in your words - a "stupid 80's metalhead."  On to the album then. Yep, it really is pretty abysmal. The guitar and bass work, for the most part, consists of chunky power chords strung together sloppily. The result sounds fragmented, dull, crude and just generally badly written. For an album which so many proclaim to be so "emotional," you would think it would at least convey some sense of melody, but there's none to be found.   The drumming is equally poor. It's made up of repetitive and simpliatic rhythms, heavily reliant on the snare drum, which fail to synchronise well with the guitars. The double bass pedal, on the rare occasions when it is used, is mainly used in short bursts to beat along with one repeated chord from the guitar, which is not only pointless, but gives us the (probably correct) impression that Poison The Well are such incompetent songwriters that they are incapable of incorporating the double bass into the overall song structures. Even the album's speed is done wrong; it rarely rises above mid-tempo, and thereby failing to give any impression of energy, even while the opportunity to go for an anthemic approach instead is wasted.  And then there are the vocals, possibly the most disappointing element of this album altogether. They consist mainly of weak, high pitched wails, which not only grate the ears, but also clash badly with the music. Occasionally we have short bursts of lower moans which I assume are passed off as this album's clean vocals. I have yet to hear another such incompetent singer. Possibly the only redeeming factor of this album is the production, which is clean enough, and you can hear the bass, even if the drums are flat and over-produced, a failing common of the hardcore/metalcore genre.  In conclusion then, my message is pretty simple. If you want angry, emotional music, powerfully evocative guitar work and rabid drumming, tortured howls dredging up inner agony, then for the love of God, BUY SOMETHING ELSE! Pick up "Slaughter Of The Soul" by At The Gates, if you want some idea of what I'm talking about 
 If I ever:  a) subject myself to this movie ever again  or  b) subject anyone else (including animals) to this movie  Form a mob and follow through with my wish in the title of this review.  Just one question that still haunts me...  How does Travolta's career survive this debacle and Pepper's hits the tank? 
 This book is merely a hundred something pages long and yet 99% of what the two authors said are in defense of the traditional church doctrine. The only credit they gave Dan Brown is the fact that he stirs up the debates reguarding Mary Magdelene. That's it. The rest are just praises of how the church's version of the history makes better sense, has more morality and is more ethically-oriented. They completely dismissed any Gnostic ideas. You don't need to waste a few dollars on this book when you can attend the church for free and have the pastor tell you the same things 
 I bought this toy from a local Petsmart for my 2 yr. old Boxer.  He had this toy chewed up within 20 minutes.  The rubberband like material broke off into his mouth very easily.  I recommend this toy ONLY if you only want to play fetch with this toy.  Do not let your dog chew on it! 
 I found this to be a dull look at a suburban family falling into moral ruin 
 To cover all the problems with continuity, logic, theology, geography and plain common sense in _Left Behind_ would take a whole book.  One hardly knows where to start.  Perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to Christian religion by this trashy novel.  As such, it isn't even a decent trashy novel; instead of steamy sex scenes, we get sanctimonious sermonizing.  Worse than that, what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the Bible into a cheap comic book, ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it's too late.  The comic book aspect can not be overemphasized.  Even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario (an idea with virtually no scriptural support), little in the characters' actions, thought processes or dialog rings true.  One gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student.  God ends up looking like the ultimate villain, demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side Or Else.  Whatever happened to the inspiring Christian writers of yesteryear?  Who is the present-day equivalent of C. S. Lewis, or Catherine Marshall, and why aren't they getting more attention?  These were writers who actually made you THINK.  LaHaye and Jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing God wants us to be doing; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought.  They show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask.  One wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all, or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter.  These days, it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of Ann Coulter or Pat Robertson, whose mission seems to be to turn Christianity into a twisted, bigoted caricature of what it once was.  Perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured.  If _Left Behind_ is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from Christian writers, then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind 
 Straight out of the box disappointment with the extremely poor quality.  Plug into wall and does not work.  After trying numerous different outlets/wiggles of the cord, it finally powered on.  After putting in a card, the pics were ok, passable.  The mp3 popped and moaned and popped some more, and I was only playing very quiet jazz.  This is not worth the money even though it is cheap.  Pay a little more and get one that is of better quality 
 I ORDERED THIS CD THE PACKAGEING AND CD SAID TAVARES LIVE. THE CD WAS AN OLD COUNTRY ARTIST. I WAS SENT ANOTHER COPY THE SAME SAD MUSIC,THE SAME PACKAGING AND SAME SAD MUSIC. I PAID TWICE TO RETURN 2 CD'S  I WOULDN'T KEEP FOR FREE IF OFFERED. BECAREFUL WHEN U OPENA BOX U THINK U WANTED. YOU MAY WANT TO RETURN IT RIGHT AWAY. I WOULD LABEL THIS NO STARS IF I COULD 
 seriously, if you've read the joy luck club you've read them all. in case nobody noticed, her books are all the same. whoever said that the kitchen god's wife was a duller version of the joy luck club wasn't that far from the truth because it just WAS the joy luck club, only you've read it already so you knew what was coming. ie fights between mother and daughter. how profound/prosaic. really, read one of amy tan's books and you can talk about all of them with some kind of authority. 
 This book is very disappointing. The writing is terrible and rather amateurish. The writer bored me, maybe something's lost in translation from French, I don't know.  I already knew the killer the first time he was introduced in the book, although the writer tried to create red herrings which did not work. Mara sounds stupid, immature and inconsistent. Skip this book, it's not worth your time. Peter Mayle's mysteries set in France are way much better that this. At least his novels have sense of humor, suspense, very interesting characters and most important, they are very well written 
 Previously, I read the first two books of the His Dark Materials books with ease. They were easy to get into and the plots were more interesting. The third book is just a disgrace. I read the first couple of chapters and just could not say, "Oh, lets continue reading the Amber Spyglass." I practically had to "force" myself to read it, and eventually, I got tired of forcing myself to read it, so I decided to abandon it. There are three main keys that has led me to discontinuing this book. 1. The plot, the characters, the settings, etc. was just absolutely boring. There were no action-packed parts of the book in the beginning. And a major have-to-do thing for authors is to draw the readers in right from the beginning, and Mr. Pullman has not done that in this book. 2. This book is way too long. The combination of boringness(not a word, but oh well) and lengthiness is definitely not a good combination. 3. Why does PHilip Pullman have to be so against Christianity? I read his bio on wikipedia and he has all these critical comments on C.S. Lewis. It's okay for him to hate the religion, but others have the right to appreciate their own. He's also in these associations that are just so religious related. I just think he shouldn't show his hatred in his books 
 It could be a really good book with lots of insights to provide; however, it failed to grap my attention with the draggy way of writing. It came on as boring as ever, I even tried to pick a few topics which I might be interested in to read, to no avail. It was too painstakingly boring and lengthy to go to a point, if there's even a point, I just couldn't sustain long enough to get there. I have no doubt that it is a great book in self-help, just not my kind 
 all i want to say is that if you want to interprete gita in its fullest then don't go for any translations.first study sanskrit and then read gita in its original form.that would be the right path for knowing the truth 
 Two problems.  First problem.  Let's say you're the typical kidnapper-rapist-killer.  For fun and out of postmodern boredom, you kidnap two girls off the street in New York City.  What are the odds that your randomly-chosen getaway and killing spot is going to be exactly where one of the girls lives, 60 or 70 miles away?  One in ten million?  Twenty million?   Second problem.  The movie, even with a run time of an otherwise-short 84 minutes, doesn't have enough action or development to fill the void.  In short, it's boring, and in several scenes where Craven seems more interested in the bucolic Wechester County scenery than moving the plot along, I found myself reaching for the fast-forward 
 This book from what other reviewers said really doesn't add much new info in terms of the much-publicized deaths of TuPac, Biggie or Jam Master Jay ... which is one of the big motivations I'm sure most of us consider reading a book like this.  Also the fact that this book was written by a cop from the once secret "Hip Hop police" is also somewhat novel.  You'll spend most of the first 20 pages sifting through this guy trying to straddle the fence -- sounding official & professional to rep police but also trying to come off as empathetic and altruistic in his quest to "save" hip hop's elite from crime & corruption.  Read this book with a grain of salt!!!!  I dropped it after Page 21 (go to a bookstore or library and read the bottom 2.5 paragraphs).  Parker's basic premise in his defense of policing hip hop is NOT that he sees the stars as needing protection (which is why soooo many rappers still roll deep, packin' heat!), but rather that so many are still so heavily involved in criminal activity he's doing what he does for public safety.  Give me a break.  Who's really afraid of Ludacris? Jay-Z? Kanye West? Chamillionaire (or 50 Cent for that matter)?  Parker dares to use the term "public safety" in this defense and discusses how any number of acts of gunplay could "breakout at any time" when rappers are in public.  Let's see, we've got ...  A raging war in Iraq & the threat of nuclear terrorism.  Ongoing police brutality issues.  Trickle down damage from crooked politicians.  Real crime.  All kinds of sexual predators.  Increasingly fragile school systems not to mention poverty, intolerance & all kinds of social ills.  Yeah, Parker's doing a great job defending society from public enemy No. 1:  Poor black men who use hip hop success to rise to a better life.  Skim the book's latter chapters for the minor details you seek if you'd like, but I pass on reading more of this crap.  I'm sure he's got interesting stories to tell, but this book just reads like an opportunist looking to make a fast buck by preying on the weak-minded blind enough to believe rappers (code for young black men) must be tamed 
 Boring and Dull!!  Here is an example of what you will learn in this book!  "Symptoms of fear include: Wideopen eyes, screaming, hands over the face..." Wow!  It's a good thing I found that out!  Who knew??? You don't even get these interesting tidbits until page 289 of the book! The last page is 294!!  Ridiculous 
 This could just very well be the worse novel in existance. There is no clear beginning, middle or end, but rather the story feels bland and the character developement is vague in almost every aspect. The narrator comes out of the book as selfish and a whinner and at times she seemed unsure of her sexuality. Nothing in the story is explained well enough to actually call this a story. It's as if a person grouped a bunch of words together in hopes that something good would come of it, but sadly the only thing good about this novel was after I set it down, because I wouldn't have to bear looking at it any longer. 
 This is Kaufman's first novel. His previous publications include a memoir (Jew Boy), a poetry book and a few anthologies. Kaufman admits to being a "binational, Israeli and American." As an Israeli he did time in the Israeli army or more properly Israel Defense Forces, giving him the experience necessary to draw on for this glimpse into a soldier's life.   The title, Matches, is a nickname the officers gave the soldiers, "one-strike flames that burned up and died." It is narrated from the perspective of Nathan Falk. An American Jew, who feels alienated at home in New York, has chosen to fight along his Jewish comrades in the Israeli army. Living on Time cigarettes, French fries and mud coffee he leads two lives, the one he has in Gaza and the one he has in Jerusalem. Were it not for the constant reminders from fellow soldiers that he is a Yankee he'd probably forget.   In Gaza, no one likes the Israeli army or its soldiers. Everyone they come across glares at them with "an undisguised look of hatred." When he is on leave in Jerusalem he spends his time in bed with another man's wife, a beautiful red-head named Maya, an artist with psychological problems Nate isn't equipped to handle. Some of them brought on by his need to control and withhold despite saying "she was all that I care for".   What I liked about this book was the view it provided outside the usual media propaganda. It looks into the culture of Israel from two perspectives. One, although briefly, from the somewhat safe stronghold of Jerusalem and the other from the frontline of Gaza. It was a difficult read on many levels especially since my reading seemed to coincide with Israel's recent turmoil but it did help me to understand more about what is going on; although I might not always accept it.   What ruined it for me were the in-depth side stories about a man defecating in the street; a sea of rotting horses, camels and goats; cutting off the ears of a dog and feeding it to him; and the horse that fell on a land mine. By the time I finished it I was just happy it was over. Some may think I'm losing the point of the story but I mention this only for those who would not want to read such content (in detail) which in this instance is more offensive than the rest of the story.   It dates itself with some of the language, like "Jerry Bruckheimer fireball". There's no real sense of a conclusion by the end. Nathan is still a soldier; the fighting continues and people keep dying on both sides. Nathan hasn't learned anything since the beginning of the book; he just keeps on keeping on with no real purpose other than being a soldier.   What I would have liked to have seen is an appendage or two; like a mini weapons diagram to reference the numerous weapons mentioned throughout for those with no frame of reference. A map of the region would also have been helpful.   Matches is not high on my list of recommendations but if you're curious about the life of one Israel soldier from the perspective of someone who has lived on both sides this may whet your appetite for more. If you have any sensitivity to animals being hurt, skip it. Review written by M. E. Wood 
 There is some great advice for the novice agent in this book. But I think the author/agent speaks from two sides of her mouth.  She promotes good ethics and attention to detail in terms of contracts and client-care.  BUT, her own business is based on facilitating For Sale By Owners and an a la carte approach to representation.  Both of these approaches to Agency undercut our business and our income.  We spend a lot of money in this business, and are at great risk of frivilous lawsuits, burn out, and even our personal safety. Undercutting the traditional 6% (or even 5%) commission by offering limited services for a reduced rate undermines our whole industry.  Any author/agent who supports cut rate real estate services should be read with skepticism 
 i would hate to say anything to discourage young people who are interested in writing. however, having read this book after all the publicity it received from the media and the press, i have to confess that i was not satisfied with it at all as far as my expectations were concerned. i cannot say i've gotten anything out of it except the pity it left me with for all the things she had done to herself and/or let others to do to her if this book is based on the writer's own real experiences as said ofcourse. i have also bought and read the new one out by her named "L'odore del tuo respiro", which has become available this month where i live, and unfortunately, i don't think she is getting any better 
 This book is not very detailed, and is not at all comprehensive.  It takes a "broad spectrum" look at Mennonite life which is to say that it does not cover anything in decent detail.  The most liberal  "Mennonites" are no different than anybody else, and  "Mennonite Life" is a sort of meaningless term.  Old Order  Mennonites are all lumped together and not covered well at all 
 Junk. Junk. Junk.  Mine lasted for only three weeks then one day stopped working 
 this book is another one not worth buying.  It is funny that non intiates like to write books about a religion they do not have a firm grasp of knowledge of 
 I cannot believe I wasted 90 minutes of my life on this crap. I almost NEVER find movies bad. It's happened very few times in my life, but oh my, I cannot seem to find words to describe how bad this movie was. First of all, it was EXTREMELY disgusting. If your idea of a comedy is watching fat men take watery-sounding craps on small toilets, seeing close up shots of peeing in showers, people vomiting violently on restaurant parking lots, and hairy man cracks, then yes, I agree, this is the funniest movie ever made. Yes, I know what you're asking yourself, and the answer is yes: it's worse than BORAT. Yes, BORAT. If you thought nothing could more disgusting than Borat, you haven't seen anything yet. Second, a comedy is supposed to make me laugh because it's laughably funny, not because it's laughably BAD. The storyline is terrible and the acting is a joke. It's just not funny, and it's that simple. Watching my own toenails grow is more fun that watching this movie.  Avoid this one like the plague 
 Although I have not read this book, and do not intend to I just want to say a couple of things.  No offense to the author who wrote this book, but this is sick.  All the hell this family has been through and there is a book about the murders????  I am so appalled by this.  I stumbled across this book by accident just now.  I was looking up an article to send to a friend when I found the amazon.com search that came up.  Another thing that disgusts me is that there is a picture of the family on the cover.  Is this really needed?  I went to school with his oldest daughter, and to see what she is going through is horrendous.  I just hope that Camm and Boney both rot in hell for what they have done to their families, and the whole community.  For those of you who believe Camm didn't have anything to do with it....how do you get high velocity blood spatter on you clothing if you weren't standing there witnessing it?  And he was close enough for not only the blood splatter, but for gunshot residue?  What more do you need?  Even if he didn't pull the trigger, he was still there and didn't do a thing about it.  That's all I have to say.  
 I Have been a Commission fan for many, many years. When I came accross this CD I became very excited.  Here were the original members of my beloved COMMISSIONED, back together again, and performing all of my favorite tunes! Of course I bought it.  However, I must say that I am somewhat disapointed. Perhaps its the fact that the songs were recorded live in concert.  My favorite songs did not minister to me in the same way as the individual CD's had in the past.  It was as if the new lead singer was trying the "Out-Do" the original members. As if he were trying to make his mark.  On many of his solo vocal spots, he was yelling out the lyrics and not blending with the others. This was a major "turn off".  In retrospect, I feel that I should have purchased a greatest hits type CD format. Peace 
 I thought it was going to cover the entire aspects of the recording studio including the suitable equipments, unfortunately it was just directed toward the construction. I'm not the construction engineer so why would I care too much on the details. I think basic theory on the construction is enough and more elaboration is needed for the furniture and equipment selection 
 This book was the unrealistic and boring pretentious adventures of a girl that I'd never want to meet in real life.  The characters lacked depth and tried to make up for that with vagueness.  This might be a decent book for anyone who doesn't realize that the "perfect girls" aren't really that in an incredibly guliable way, but for the rest of us with half a brain, stay away from this utter waste of time 
 The sad reality is that year after year fewer American students are going into the fields of science and the best students (and teachers) are increasingly brought in from overseas. Most recently non-citizens in the U.S. have received more Phds in the sciences and engineering than citizens.   The fact that (un-)intelligent design is given a sounding board or that idiots like Phd theologians are pining on scientific theory shows how far we've fallen behind. In a generation or two moronic ID theories will vie hand in hand with New Age idiot beliefs while leadership in real science and technology migrates to Europe and Asia.  Shame 
 Awesome table of contents.  Gives you a smattering of everything.  A special strength is the section on Arcnet, the hot technology of 1979, that some of us are still using.  However the book doesn't really get you up to speed in anything in particular.  You'll still need to dive into deeper waters like those in Charles E. Spurgeon's _Ethernet: The Definitive Guide,_ Thomas Maufer's _IP Fundamentals: What Everyone Needs To Know About Addressing & Routing,_ and Rich Seifert's _The Switch Book._  Does not cover Windows XP 
 I picked up a copy of this pretentious garbage at a library used book sale. I paid one american buck for it, which was about 100 cents too much.  It's obvious from the start that Rush is extremely impressed with his massive vocabulary. Probably giggled himself to sleep each night after he finished his writings, imagining all the ignorant folks who would need the same dictionary he used to write it, in order to decipher his blather. I would recommend any of John Steinbeck's novels to any human who plowed his or her way through this dire drivel, simply to clean their mental palate. Dumpster fodder. 
 ...in the previous reviews. This is, simply, a screed. Imagine Ann Coulter on a bad day, and you've got an idea of the tone of the book. Not that it won't appeal to a certain segment of the "reading" population for precisely that reason, mind you, but for most people, it's something to be avoided. Like acid. It's not inconceivable that some would disagree with the current administration's policies. But pure venom and hate isn't going to carry the day 
 There are MUCH better books in this category.  This one just doesn't do the topic justice 
 NOVA isn't what it used to be.  The BBC Series "The Planets" contains much of the same subject matter, presented more accurately with interviews of more relevant people 
 Adult parties, that is.  As a person with a dirty mind, I loved this book, as a mother, I was offended.  It had cartoons doing "it" in several positions.  The pictures were too much, and I will never show my kids this book.  
 THE ROLLING STONES SUCK! THEY ONLY MADE 2 DECENT ALBUMS IN SOME GIRLS AND TATTOO YOU. DIRE STRAITS, METALLICA, AND FOREIGNER ARE A BILLION TIMES BETTER! I CAN'T BELIVE SO MANY PEOPLE REVIEWED THIS AWFUL ALBUM AS IT SUCKS. THEY ARE JUST AS BAD AS GREEN DAY, PINK FLOYD, THE BEATLES, AC/DC, AND LED ZEPPELIN. AVOID THIS ALBUM AND GET MASTER OF PUPPETS FROM METALLICA INSTED 
 It's a handy mirror for the price but if your looking for a good vanity mirror, I suggest looking for something larger with a higher magnification.  The light is not great at all.  It's very dim.  One of the good qualities of the mirror is that it's cordless and comes with an adapter if you don't have batteries handy 
 Definitely THE most overrated programming book I've ever read. Why?   Well, it's not great for beginners because it's difficult to follow - I read large chunks of this book when I first learned Perl - the Learning Perl book was much better. Also, the writing is so geeky-cutesy.  In every other paragraph, you can feel the authors chuckling at their own stupid Star Trek/Monty Python/Lord of the Rings jokes and references.  We get it already, time to watch some new movies/tv shows and read some new books fer chrissakes. Most of all though, the book is so disorganized.  Have a question about a regexp metacharacter?  Good luck finding it in this haystack.  I know it's not pitched as a pure reference manual, but you would think it would be easy to find out what the difference between * and *? is. It's not. Perl is incredibly powerful but somewhat painful to learn, which is compounded by the fact that many people rave at how quick and easy it is to become productive with it. Googling your Perl questions is a lot better than reading the Camel book (the nickname of this book in case you don't know). The Perl Cookbook rocks though, that's another excellent Perl title. This is all coming from a devoted Python fan who learned Perl first and respects Perl for its impact on web programming and the newer scripting languages like Python and Ruby 
 Every single aspect of hunting can be reproduced non-violently simply by replacing the high-powered rifle with a camera.  Hunting is about killing and bloodlust, period, and no amount of pseudo-new-age baloney can change that 
 This is an entertaining book but for those who have read previous biographies of these two stars, they will notice that several pictures are labeled wrong and some of the information is inaccurate 
 I never really loved this heating pad. The contents within the rubber get twisted easily, it seemed to heat unevenly at times, and towards the end of its life I actually heard little clicking noises coming from it. I got it for Christmas last year, used it a few days after....and then last night it died. No heat, though the light went on.   This thing had weekly use on my couch--never left a 5 foot radius. I didn't fold it up, and I never used it with moisture. A year of use is a letdown. 
 As other people said before me, I couldn't be a bigger Will Ferrell fan.  He's incredible.  But I can't say the same for the writers of some SNL sketches or the people who choose what is put on these DVDs.  I thought his first Best of DVD was pretty good (not great, but what can you do).  As far as the second DVD, it's almost like NBC or whoever felt like playing a practical joke on the buying audience.  None of Will's popular recurring characters showed up, and in the rare instance that they were included (Janet Reno, the lover, Actor's Studio), it was like the worst sketch was chosen.  Again, Will is great, but this DVD is not.  PLEASE believe the customer reviews.  Save your $13 and buy Old School or Elf 
 I did this program instead of my regular program with some interesting results.  My golf was about the same, but my feel in my short game was better, which I attribute to moving in different directions in the program.  I might have gotten the same thing from basketball, I don't know. However,  after 2 weeks of this, I felt my overall strength and endurance was down  from previous.  So what I did was borrow some of the movements, added them  back to my regular routine of basic weight training and cardio work. Borrow  the book from a friend or library, copy the best exercises and don't bother  with it after that 
 Thoughful male protagonists?  If you are a forty-ish man who fantasizes about being seduced by his sexually experienced 17-year-old babysitter, who likes it rough, this novel will titillate you.  Once you get over being thoughtful about that, you will be jerked through a fast-paced predictable plot until you leave the book in an airport for its next victim.  
 I have ordered this coat 2 times and returned both coats.  I'm very disappointed.  This is supposed to be a reversible coat.  However, the hem of the black side is too long. Consequently it hangs below the hem of the bronze side when reversed.  And, it does not look good at all.  The company needs to revise this pattern 
 This is the worst novel that I have ever read by a major author.  I have read a couple other Alex Cross novels and I did not find them to be awful at all.  They weren't very good but they kept me turning the page.  While I was reading this dreck I began to get a sense of Patterson's work ethic.  He sets a goal for himself and does not stray from it.  One maybe two chapters per day I suppose, and when his muse is on vacation for a couple of months this is the result.  Not a snowball's chance in hell that this would have been published if it weren't written by Patterson.  I'm done. Don't waste your time.  Really 
 Although this book gives the reader much useful information on GSM, the style is poor and and needs editing by Artech House.  when I first read the book I got out my marker pen and delated large sections of useless text.   The explanation of Channel Coding and Signalling, 5.14.4, started by saying  'The passengers (user data) in an airplane may have all paid full fare, the  plane may be safe, and the accomodations exceptional, but nobody is going  anywhere without the a pilot and crew (signalling data).  The book is still  in my bookshelf as it is a handy reference manual on GSM, but I am sure  there are better books on GSM out there 
 "The Well-Ordered Office" is about techniques that can be used to reduce stress in your office.  Author Kathleen Kendall-Tackett gives 50 techniques to get things under control.  I'll be honest... I didn't like this book.  The title suggested to me that this book would be about specific office organization techniques like filing and equipment.  However the author only gives a brief overview and ends up offering no help whatsoever.  A good example is the chapter on good programs for your PDA where she only offers categories of programs and no specific programs whatsoever.  Sure.... list management software could be helpful but only if you have a good program!  Which one is the best!?!?!  The book also contains several "filler" chapter that I have no idea why they are in this book.  Chapters such as "Travel safely and in style" and "Balancing work with the rest of your life" are completely unrelated to the title.  If I want travel advice, I will get a book on traveling.  If I want advice on how to balance my life, I'll get a book that deals with that topic, not a book that spends 2 pages on such a broad topic.  In summary, don't waste you time or money on this book.  It isn't worth it.  While there are 1 or 2 pieces on advice in this book, I would recommend "Getting Things Done" by David Allen instead.  2 out of 5 stars 
 Watch the movie first for the breathtaking special effects.  Only then if you're interested, should you buy the book, because it has a few more details in it.  I pity those who bought the hardcover 
 I was hoping for a relaxing instrumental CD where we could enjoy our favorite Beatles tunes. It is relaxing, but I can't even recognize the melodies of the songs. If I don't look at the back, I don't know what song is playing. That's not what I wanted out of this CD. If you want a bedtime CD, this is great, but not if you specifically want Beatles tunes 
 This is a well written and enjoyable book.  However, I had just read a few days before, We Were One: Shoulder to Shoulder With the Marines Who Took Fallujah and what a difference.  You could tell that this book was primarily written from reading mission reports and letters.  Those segments just didn't have any color to them and were not material to suck you into the book.  There were definitely some segments that appear to have come from personal interviews and they were definitely more colorful and interesting. This book is a worthwhile read if you're going to read a few books on Fallujah, but if you had to chose one, pick We Were One.  The guy was there and the writing is just much more passionate and engaging 
 compared to the other books on this subject i have read this is one of the weaker ones. Still if one wants to know about our little friends this book is not useless. But in all honesty this is not the place to start when it  come to fairy researc 
 "Mother, you won't recognize me now... don't be embarrassed by your ugly worn-out son."   - R. Stewart, "Bad 'N' Ruin", 1971. 
 This book could be good. The topic is an important one, one that faces many different people. The content however was very dissapointing. This book contains a lot of repetivness.. and not much but the same facts stated  over and over.. I was very dissapointed 
 I've had this pasta maker for 9 months and used it regularly over that period. Overall, it does what it is supposed to do. However, there are two major problems. First, two parts broke for seemingly no reason other than poor design and quality. The mixing bowl cracked on my first use and it took at least four months to get a replacement from DeLonghi. Recently the housing for the extruder shattered. I also lost one small part and had to wait months for a replacement part from DeLonghi. Overall it seems like there are too many parts, making it overcomplicated to clean and assemble, and the parts are of poor quality. The second major problem is that, the way dough is extruded through the circular feeding tube, the pasta easily falls together and sticks. You can work hard to keep the individual strands of pasta floured and separated---but isn't this supposed to be a machine that makes thing easier? Since buying this machine, I have also purchased the Kitchenaid stand mixer with the pasta roller and cutter attachments and feel this is just infinitely easier to use and produces much nicer pasta, particularly for flat pasta shapes such as fettuccine and spaghetti. I also ordered the ravioli shape for the DeLonghi and it produced sheets that were simply too small to work with. The Kitchenaid makes nice, wide sheets and you can adjust the dough thickness to meet your needs. Note that the extrusion machines (and also the extrusion attachment for the Kitchenaid) are your only options if you want to make shapes like macaroni.  
 As the mom of a 25-month-old late-talker, I have been searching high and low for information to help my child with his delayed speech.  Sure, this book was entertaining; these kids are indeed fascinating.  But after reading the Einstein Syndrome, it was clear that my boy is not one of the children Sowell is describing. Overall this book left me with more questions than answers on the subject of delayed speech.    If you actually want to do something to help your child, and not just read about other kids who turned out to be super-intelligent engineers, buy "The Late Talker: What to Do If Your Child Isn't Talking Yet" by Marilyn C. Agin, M.D., Lisa F. Geng and Malcolm J. Nicholl.  This is a book that gives parents real answers about how to help their speech-delayed children 
 I know this is supposed to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, but. to put it simply,I found it to be unreadable although I tried several times 
 I didn't read the fine print and missed "accessory boxed set".  This contains a mask, VERY SMALL cape, and light saber.  It does NOT include any pants.  The cape on a 4'8" boy only went down to the waist -- not down to the knees, so the label that it's one size fits all is very deceptive.   Not sure why an "accessory boxed set" would include the cape and top portion of the costume.   Accessories would be items like a saber gloves, and perhaps a voice changer add on.   Anyway, this is a rip off and don't waste your time buying this for anyone over 3 feet tall.   I'm returning this one. 
 While her voice is certainly one of the best, this selection of songs (other than the first and last on the CD) is painful to sit through.  If this album is in any way a reflection of the artist's life, then you can't help but feel sorry for her.  Very depressing and cold.      
 I bought this as a Christmas gift for my fiancé. I looked all over for a money clip/wallet that had an actual clip - not just the magnetic clip. So needless to say I was thrilled when I found this one online. After my fiancé opened it up, he put his money in the clip. The clip is located in the middle of the wallet so you have to get creative and fold your money more than just in half. After using it for a few weeks, the pin in the clip fell out. He was able to fix it, but I would not be comfortable carrying money around in a faulty clip. 
 This is what the front of my new Indegenous cd says. Early on, there was Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton, Then later Carlos Santana and SRV. Heres a new name to throw on the blues rock alter Mato Nanji. Are you serious? This is a misprint!! I demand my money back! This cd blows! I have been hearing about Mato lately and figured I couldnt go wrong! This cd is a joke. I could play better then this guy and that aint no laughing matter! I spent $19 dollars on this false advertisemnet. I should sue the record company for placing that quote on the front of the cd. I will never spend any money on this guy again. Is this what a recoed company has to do to sell something. Geeesh. Mato has a horrible voice to boot. This guy dont even come close to the guitarists it advertises. If you want a guitar player that fits in with SRV, Santana, Hendrix, Clapton, check out Joe Bonamassa!! Joe would blow this guy completely off the stage! Please people, get real! There are way too many other great guitarists that are much better these days. If you wants some blues that is just another Texas style guitar player buy this but Im getting burned out on SRV knockoffs

 This movie depicts the said goings on of rich kids with too much time on their hand. Once again Larry Clark delivers a film which is nothing more than for him to see a bunch of teen kids naked. It's Kids but with a murder plo 
 Well, I'm done.  I made it a little ways into Pillars, and decided my time with Terry Goodkind is at an end.  I was very taken with Wizard's First Rule; it was a great fantasy work, and I was thrilled with having added it to my collection.  But from there, the story just became dull, pointless, and frankly, just too predictable.  Referring to the series as a story can only be done loosely, though.  The series has actually struck me more as a series of short story novels, sharing main characters and some themes.  Up to this point, the stories have followed a very basic, repetitive outline:  Richard and Kahlan are happy together. Richard and Kahlan get separated, seemingly forever. Richard must endure trials and hardship to hope to return to Kahlan. Kahlan must endure trials and hardship to hope to return to Richard. They both learn important lessons about themselves and humanity. They are reunited, with much rejoicing.  But now Pillars of Creation comes along...  and while I was never overly-taken with the template Goodkind was using (refer to the above story skeleton and fill in the details with whatever philosophic point Goodkind is trying to make this go around), at least the plotlines revolved around characters I had somewhat gotten to know.    No longer the case, unfortunately.  About 100 pages in, I closed the book, put the dust jacket back on, and put it back on the shelf.  I may pick it up again somewhere down the road, or I may just offload that shelf of books to the local used book shop.  Or I may re-read the first six books with a highlighter and note all the Robert Jordan similarities.  I may need two highlighters...  I think it's time to re-read Martin and get back to what I enjoy about Fantasy 
 This book does have lots of good information, but the author could have at least used spellcheck.  There are spelling errors on almost every page, as well as a few missing words spread around the book.  There are even a few places that the author copy and pasted an entire paragraph.  All of this left me thinking of this book as being cheap and I had to question the validity of the information if the author doesn't even bother to check for errors in his own book 
 This was nothing more than an advertisement for a couple of ex-SEAL's who started a company. Obviously based on entry techniques, clearing, (etc...) it shows nothing interesting and was a complete waste of money. After the second disk I turned it off, and just gave it to someone. TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT! (for lack of a better printable word 
 I buy these kind of books to decide what activities to do on vacation with my family. I do  not buy these books to listen to an author complain about peoples religion, political beliefs, or any of the sort.    If this author  would have made the comments about a Black Community about a community that  has a large Mormon population he would have be censored and his writing  rejected.     Although the book does give some good information about local  communities, it pales in comparison to the detailed information given in  the Wyoming and Montana versions that I have.     To bad the author was to  busy bashing Amtrak, Mormons, and Conservatives, instead of giving accurate  information. The author fails to point out several points of interest that  I do know of 
 In all fairness I was looking for a different book -- when I got this in the mail it wasn't what I expected.  Though the title would have you believe it would be a suitable replacement.  I was planning to drive from LA to San Diego and was looking for some cool landmarks.  Well each state gets 2 pages, so you can image the ideas I got for stopping points.  Zero.  I looked up Massachusetts, my home, and all it seemed to talk about was Howard Johnson's.  Given HoJo's has burned a place in local memory and was an important early player in the motel business,  no evidence exists of it today.  So bad road trip book.  Mildly interesting history book 
 I am amazed and mystified that most of the reviewers herein found the movie to be excellent!! As for me, I made it about thirty minutes into the film before turning it off in dismay. The fault in order of importance: poor screenplay, poor cinematography and poor performance by Pacino, who seems to be vying for the most over-the-top performance. The film was absurd in many ways from the outset: the pans from star to star lasting just short of giving the viewer any purpose for any of the fast camera pans. Close-up after close-up conveying no meaning, Pacino overacting like Jack Palance in one of his not-so-famous European pieces of tripe from the sixties and seventies, an utterly dumb plot with Pacino and company proving at the beginning that they are bumbling cops.   First example, they chase the bad guy to a cabin which is on stilts or something like that; then, instead of staying on the ground below and smoking the bad guy out or something at least tactically sound, they storm the stairs and Pacino stands right in front of the door yelling "Police, you're under arrest."  They kick in the front door and find that the culprit has escaped through an underground water source. Of course, Pacino follows and dives right into the underwater stream, having absolutely no idea where the guy is or if there are boobytraps of some sort.   Cut to Pacino running around in nearly zero visibility fog, glimpsing the guy for a second or two before losing him in the fog. Stumbling around further, Pacino is obviously disoriented until a shot is fired at him from, we must assume, his quarry. Did the screen writer forget that Pacino's colleagues are also supposedly chasing the culprit, too?   Inevitably and apparently not, because Pacino spots a figure in the fog and plugs him. As I watched this scene unfold, I became thoroughly disheartened when it becomes clear what I knew already, that Pacino has fired on and killed his partner. It was then that I decided that I had had enough.   By the way, the European version, with Stellan Skarsgaard is infinitely superior. Don't waste your money or on-line rental queue on this Hollywood drivel. Ditto for the other Pacino junk I rented at the same time, The Recruit, which I could only stand for about a half hour too 
 This might work for families with older teenagers, but my kids (10 and 13) just won't eat things like baked fish or squash or eggplant. They're not picky kids; we travel extensively and they'll eat all kids of food, but I'd say four out of five of the recipes in this book were failures at my dinner table. It's a good place to start if you have no idea how to cook for a family, but I've had much more success with Cooking Light 
 This is sentimental tripe -- a yuppie's nostalgia for a pre-gentrified city. As for the Amazon.com reviewer who prefers this rubbish to the amazing Ric Burns series or to anything by Studs Turkel -- all I can say is, buddy, you're not a real New Yorker 
 The sub-title of this book, "Rapport-Based Training," made me give it a try, even though I do not employ force-based training methods. I do, however, try to give everyone a fair shake.  However, there were some things in this book -- which is full of hypocrisy, BTW -- that turned my blood cold. His inclusion in puppy testing of checking for pain sensitivity (he calls it touch sensitivity), because your training program will assume the dog will respond to pain, is chilling. And the statement "Experience says that force is an inescapable training element" shows that, no matter how open-minded he says he is in the preface, this trainer has not explored all options. He views "tough" dogs and "submissive" dogs as irredeemable, while other training programs not based in force have turned these dogs into wonderful companions.  Although at no time does the author suggest that he is not a force-based trainer, he states repeatedly in the front matter that he gives a dog a chance to learn before applying force; yet from lesson one he recommends giving a new verbal command to a dog and applying pressure with a pinch collar to force a dog into various as-yet unlearned positions. Hypocrisy.   I was hoping to find in this book something more based in relationship-building than the traditional correction-based methodology, something I could recommend to those who cling to force-based methods. Yet the only place where I could agree with this author is that a pinch collar is less damaging than a choke chain (which, frankly, has no place on any dog). It was a disappointment.  Better reading materials for those who don't want to use strictly food-based training methods include "Excel-erated Learning" (Pamela Reid), "So Your Dog's Not Lassie," and "Never Say No"(Dr. Mugford). 
 I ordered my subscription 3 months ago and still have not received it.  
 I'll admit that I didn't read this all that carefully, so I will qualify this short review by saying I may be wrong.  However, I do feel that the lampoon on modern architecture is a fairly cheap shot.  There are reasons the Bauhaus was necessary that I don't think Wolfe gives due credit.  Sure it is an easy thing to point out the outcome of uniformity in design.  Yet it is interesting that the two buildings designed by Mies van der Rohe (one of the members of the Bauhaus) in Chicago are the two most interesting and noticable ones: the sears tower and the hancock building.  But beyond that, German architecture prior to the Bauhaus had significant problems that needed revision.  The lavish designs that defined the German aesthetic (sloped roof, criss-cross panels, etc) were expensive in a time when thousands were poor and homeless.  Cheaper designing was not just trendy, it had an extreme human need.  Some of Wolfe's points are good, but overall far too simplistic for something that can't be summed up that easily.  The Bauhaus was necessary and they did a lot of good for a lot of people.  I think Wolfe is too American to write this book.  All he sees is the effects in America, but he doesn't give Groupus and company enough credit for their political struggle and their social goals.  It seems a little innappropriate to me for an American writer to criticize left wing politics in 1920s Germany as Wolfe does more than a few times.  We live in a place were democrat and republican are catch phrases and bumper stickers.  There left wing and right wing was dead serious business and the members of the Bauhaus had their lives at stake for what they accomplished.  I respect everyone in that country who had the courage to fight against the inevitable high tide of ultra conservative politics.  Many people died trying to sustain the Wiemar Republic and keep the Prussian militantism of the Nazi party out of power.  He strikes me as a little insensitive to this plight.  Wolfe's PhD is in American studies, I just think he should stick to American issues as it doesn't appear he is able to grasp the complexities of Germany between the world wars.  At the very least, he is not able to do a competent job is so short a work 
 Its a shame when a band changes tact for the worse, but I cant help but give them credit for trying, what do you do when you've released 5 or 6 albums/ep's all along the same line and you start to get a touch bored with the style you've honed to perfection, you go in to the studio with a different producer and you experiment, this one "I think" fizzed and died soon after conception.  you can only hope that the next one rises from the bland ashes of this release 
 I think this book fails to supply the most important information to those with fibromyalgia. It makes the dissorder seem so mysterious, when it is not. Much is known about FM that this book skims over or doesn't mention. Sleep is the major component to FM, because of a deficiency of serotonin, preventing us from getting delta sleep, the restorative sleep that revitalizes energy, and heals/relaxes muscles. Check out "Fibromyalgia" by Daniel J. Wallace. That does a much better job 
 Though advertised as a continuation (i.e. 14th Edition)of the "Filmgoers companion" it is only a list of people in the movies. Gone are Halliwell's definitions of movie tradecraft and lists of themes, individual classics and personal notes. A fine actor like Lee J. Cobb gets a single line, while Jayne Mansfield, known more for her off screen antics, gets many more. The quotes from the movie personalities is a nice touch, but when I look up somebodies filmography I do not want to see etc. at the end of an incomplete list 
 It's very boring, pictures of old shoes , i think they picked the worst shoes from late 90's 
 This has to be Dolph's suckiest movie.  I'm a huge fan, and I own a ton of his movies and watch a bunch more on a regular basis.  But do not buy this movie, save your money and buy one of Dolph's better movies like Army of one or Men of War.  Personally though I'm pumped for the release of masters of the Univers 
 This is a very basic manual.  Especially good for those with little or no accounting or financial background 
 Italy has been using the Euro for over two years.  These lessons spend much time teaching the student about Lira.  It also spends time teaching you BIG NUMBERS.  That is really useless when dealing in Euros! Pull this product off your site until it joins the 21st century!  The Italian speaking woman is also very difficult to understand.  She does not have a clear voice when it comes to the endings of words.  
 Every time I teach Animal Behaviour I swear that I am going to change texts "the next time" -and every time UNTIL NOW my students have said that they REALLY liked Alcock, well, the latest edition changes all that. As other reviewers have noted (and for reasons that escape me) Alcock has allowed his publisher to "dumb down" the text into a bland "pretty face" that turned students off in droves. As I moved through each chapter I kept thinking "How could someone as smart & interesting as Alcock make so many cool subjects so BORING?" Previous editions convince me that it ain't him, so it must be the publisher. Margins are huge, more and more gratuitous "illustrations" clutter up the text & break one's stream of thought, and by mid-term I essentially threw up my hands, apologized to the class & went to using the original primary sources with the book as a marginal reference for those that got lost. If you have a huge lecture course full of unimaginative students who want to take one & one only Behaviour course so that they can say that they have "done Behaviour" then this text is probably perfect for you, otherwise I would suggest haunting used book shops for past editions or going straight to the literature. the whole thing reminds me of "New Coke" -a marketing scheme that ignored its market. Alcock is an excellent scholar and in the past his book has been a great source of original material which I have encouraged my students to have on their shelves as a reference source,but this is a shame 
 The good thing about Missionary Conquest is that it forces you to reconsider assumptions about the role of missionaries to indigenous cultures.  That's good.  There isn't much else to recommend this book to you, because Tinker is not trustworthy.  At the beginning of the book, Tinker states that when examining the primary source material, he will rewrite the Indian side of the encounter without even telling you.  That should have been a giant red flag, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt.  After all, maybe he is right, and that the primary sources misunderstood or even misstated the Native American side of exchanges.  However, it turns out that he felt free to rewrite what the white people did, too!  I actually bothered to look up one of his sources on De Smet.  In fact, it was one of his clenching arguments for his thesis on De Smet.  And, it turns out, Tinker completely rewrote the white side of the exchange as well, so much so that Tinker essentially wrote nearly the exact opposite of what happened.  You can view the book "History of Early Steamboat Navigation on the Missouri River" online at Google books yourself if you don't believe me.  Pages 196-198 are the relevant pages.  Sadly, I don't have time to look up all his sources, but needless to say that when your primary argument against someone relies on completely mangling the primary source, what does that say about the book as a whole, especially when he admits to completely rewriting the Native American side of nearly every exchange?  So, if your goal is to get another perspective on the role of missionaries to indigenous cultures, then sure, read the book.  If your goal is to find an objective account of what happened in this period, then this book is certainly NOT the book to use.  Due to the rewriting of primary sources I don't consider it scholarship as much as propoganda.  Also, if you want a good, positive book on a missionary who respects indigenous culture, I recommend Bruchko 
 Dosn't work.  Still receving lots of auto-dialer calls.  Waste of money 
 Dr. Dean Ornish is a quack, plain and simple. He is on the advisory board of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which is just a front for PETA. Do an exact phrase google of "The Dietary Delusions of Dean Ornish" to get the skinny on this fool.  If you want to save your life don't waste your time on this book. 
 I previously reviewed this product and had nothing but great things to say about it.  My opinion has now changed, after owning it for a few months I have had nothing but problems.  The first thing to break was the self propel.  Then the on and off switch quit working, it just stays on, to turn it off you have to unplug it.  Now, it keeps throwing the circuit breaker to my house when you plug it in(brand new house).  It is still under warranty, but Hoover says that I have to take it in, and they will only pay the bill if it is their fault.  I don't want  to take the chance in what they preceive is their fault.  This vacuum cleaner should be recalled, I can not imagine it is very safe if it will not even turn off.  I just threw away alot of money, and now have to go buy a new vacuum cleaner 
 Amazon advertized three used and one new Dyson...  What would you think?  I thought I was purchasing a "new" Dyson from Amazon as seller.  When it arrived it was the reconditioned unit-- I am 63 years old-- (health not great) and old hands tore the box up getting it open-- don't have the resources to get another box and wrappings to return.  Stuck-- hope it works and last a long time.  Very disappointed in Amazon advertising. Buyer beware.. 
 I have been a fan of Oriana for the last 30 years. Her objectivity, fairness and compassion has impressed me when reporting on Vietnam, Mexico City, her interviews with History, her letter to a child never born. However The Rage and the Pride deeply disappointed me. It seems to me that Oriana in her age has lost her valleys of understanding, compassion and objectivity and is living in the peaks of irrational and passionate hate. I am very sorry to see that one of the great and most excellent journalists of our times has decided to let herself fall into the abysm of rage and pride.  
  Sometimes you just wanna choke the execs up there in the Capitol tower, who have continually disappointed and ripped-off Raspberries fans with countless repackagings of the same established, reknown hits of this arguably very important group.  With a couple of exceptions, this collection has been released (in nearly the exact sequencing) at least twice in the last fifteen years, and there are a number of import compilations sporting similar track listings.  Furthermore, rumors of the inclusion of unreleased demos (e.g. "I Saw The Light;" "Overnight Sensation") on THIS particular release proved false.  Damned if I can find a BMG copy of the 2000 compilation with the four demos; thanks again, Capitol!  My rating is based on the gall of this self-absorbed record label, and not the beautiful music contained on the disc.  It gets a 2 instead of a 1 only cuz they included "I Can Remember."     
 I have always been suspicious of books that seem to spring from the author's need to settle a grudge against a person or organization.  This book reminds me why.  Its somewhat shrill and patently one-sided arguments do not do justice to the subject at hand.  While I'm sure that there are kernels of truth in this account, I believe that the topic would be best served by a more objective approach 
 THe complete fat flush program is an impossibility for most. The time it takes to shop for, prepare, and consume would be a full time job. Not to mention that you are suppose to drop everything to search out all "organic" meats, veggies and even juice! I did learn some interesting facts about how to increase bile production.  Just add some lemon to your water, cut back on your portions and enjoy life 
 I read this book a week before my trip to Cuba, so the anticipation of realizing a 5 year traveling dream could make the most boring travelogue exciting.  However, my thoughts always drifted away from the subject, and ran into the author.  Each situation was a refection of himself, rather than a foil for understanding the the country and the people.  Great that he left his utopian ideals for reality, but what does that mean for the people?  Does he see the people differently as they are not part of a great experiment, but rather a totalitarian regime?  It does not require an anthropologist to point out that people living in hard conditions but joined by a visible future and a stake are quite different than those realizing their lives are out of their control and often forceably reminded of that.  I found both those people in my two weeks there, but in his book only found them rationalizing Mr. Bakers own political beliefs.  People, and Cubans specifically, are more than just subjects under a political structure, no matter how dominant that structure is.  Mr. Baker never brought that side out.   He did pique my desires as a 32 year old single man and solo traveler, even though the stories seemed like the braggadocio of young men in his telling, missing crucial details.  Him picking out the Tropicana girl at the tourist-only show and saying there was a connection on sight, and that is why she went with him is self-delusional, if not disingenuous.  But for this reason, his book is no travel book.  After one "date" with a woman my second night in Havana, and all female interactions that followed, if not through Cuban friends, I realized that Mr. Baker was omitting the main reason that he was so desireable; his wallet and that valuable dollar that is between 5-10% of a monthly income there.  There is a story there on how prostitution could be different in a country such as Cuba, as I believe it is, verses other stops of the sex-trade (which Cuba is, although never mentioned in his book), with refections of the women who are involved and what it means to them and the price they pay emotionally, spiritually and socially.  But he chose avoid those prominent questions and play to his ego for us the reader.  But after a visit there, you realize his glaring omission of what passes between lovers before they part, and he begs the question of why would someone so in love with a country treats its daugthers that way?  At least bring it to the attention of us the reader and traveler.  Alas, he rivals the tourists he so often slanders, using a country for its beauty, oblivious to the ramifications.    I give this two stars because without traveling there, the power of Cuba can sustain mediocrity, and the premise of riding a BMW through such a poor yet vibrant country is quite vivid.  A digital camera has similar effects on the populace.  And I do give him respect to realize the failure of Communism, against his desires.  But his realizations are from his mirror, not the beautiful country he travels or the complicated but ultimately inspirational people he's met 
 While I remember listening to their previous album "Lemon of Pink" and being blown away by the  sampled instrumentation and assured flow of these surreal compositions that rivaled the organic electronic innovations of Mum, I am sad to say the new album sounds something more akin to mediocre, experimental b-listers Styrofoam (who have done some good work despite that comparison). For some reason I was under the impression that this album was a B-sides album, and I still hope it is, because if not, then I feel the majority of fans out there seriously misjudged the talent of this band, acrediting the first two albums to a drug-induced vision. This all too apparent drug induced not-so-much-of-a-vision shows it's ugly head in the format of too many overbearing, if thought provoking sound clips with not enough musical substance to back it up. Hopefully these guys will reaffirm their gifts with the next release, but I know I don't speak alone when I say that the transcendental moments of amazing electronic fusions found throughout their last two albums are all but replaced by shoddy, juvenile gimmickry that actually does feel lost, yet safe.  
 The title of the Riddle of the Sands is exotic but beyond that - this is an unbelievably boring tale of two friends who come together at some godforsaken islands to reveal a British traitor.  That's the gist of the novel. But what follows is a convoluted storyline full of slang, garbled nautical lingo rendered in half completed sentences that have no head or tail. Understanding such a text will require a supercomputer not to speak of a mere mortal. The writer seems to have written this book in some opium-induced hallucinatory trance. This is a heck of a one-way trip to self-congratulatory egotism, if I ever saw on 
 This book is a question and answer EFT guide for dummies.  There is a page that gives the location of the tapping points on the human body.  The points are abbreviated with symbols, i.e., EB for Beginning of Eyebrow, or UA for Under the Arm, SE for Side of the Eyebrow, Th for Thumb, so as to be able to identify the approximate vicinity of the acupuncture point.   However different "symptoms" are relieved by tapping different points (as in acupuncture). One is supposed to try to find the symptom he is experiencing and then is directed to tap on the appropriate acupuncture point, all the while thinking of the symptom to be alleviated and stating affirmations. Each symptom has a different set of points on which to tap and by the time one finds a symptom and then goes back to pages 6 and 7 to identify abbreviation symbols and check the chart to see to what parts of the body the symbols refer, one could easily get a stress attack.  Meanwhile, there is no index directing one to the exact pages for his symptom. This is not what I was looking for.   I want an EFT book with an index that directs me to a page and then gives me the acupuncture points to be tapped, while assuming a certain peaceful state of mind. I want the book to be very specific about the location of the points, also the pressure which should be exerted in the tapping. I do think that this system has some merit because it does utilize the acupuncture points of electrical stimulation and would love to try it.  This book is more of a psychology book than a direction guide to using the EFT power points.  Then there is the question and answer format that is no help whatsoever.  More time is spent trying to locate the topic in which you are interested, than in getting actual answers.  You must read through dozens and dozens of questions to find your topics of interest and then, maybe your concern won't be addressed after all.    I do hope that someone in the field publishes a user-friendly EFT/Acupuncture Tapping Point Manual that will be easy to use and contain an INDEX, please.  I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because it does contain valid psychology concepts in the questions and answers.  However as a valid EFT Manual, I'd give it a 1 because you do at least get the chart on pages 6 and 7 identifying the acupuncture points 
      I found this book both disappointing and sad.  The author clearly has a God paradigm that isn't working. This book is devoted to desperately trying to make it work.       First, Crabbe describes a God who has made written promises that He (God) doesn't reliably keep (healing, provision, and protection being prime).  Then, when a person is in intense emotional and/or physical pain due to God's unkept promises or sheer inaction, Crabbe's God emotionally abandons them.  God (alias "the comforter" in some circles) just up and leaves the person to tough it out on their own.       The book's "redeeming" idea seems to be that, at this point of emotional abandonment, the person becomes so utterly crushed and broken, shattered and literally terrified, they are finally either (1) able to encounter God because life has become horribly dark and meaningless thanks to God (who could have prevented this whole situation but didn't), or (2) they are writhing in pain for relief and simply don't know where else to turn, except to keep turning back the "higher power" who has already abandoned them.  (As God is a liar who repeatedly doesn't keep promises, and an abandoner who has promised comfort, then leaves;  this is getting weirdly close to looking like a child who keeps returning to an abusive parent.)       For the person at this shattering life nadir, having an intense but unmet desire/hunger for God is depicted in the book as an intermediate level of "doing great".       Yet, if they are doing great enough to finally "find" God, the God they meet at this point is an angry, harsh, lightening-throwing Calvinistic God who is furious at them for suggesting that they deserve anything. In fact, Jesus has to protect us from this God by throwing himself between the cowering sufferer and the lightening bolt of God's indignant anger which he has just hurled at the sinful "arrogant" sufferer.  (This is depicted as establishing for the sufferer that Jesus is his best friend.)       After that, the book quickly ends, giving the reader little help in how to balance his newfound "joy" with the ongoing misery of his life, agonizing pain, and unmet needs.  How exactly does this work?  The few paragraphs devoted to this sound rather like God has put the person on some kind of drug therapy, i.e. due to your new "joy", the fact that your whacked-out-on booze kid storms into the house at 4 a.m. just isn't quite as important anymore.  It's  hard to get a grip on the "feeling state" in this type example.       You know . . . if this is really how it works, then I hope it is simply all over when I die.  This God is a nightmare.       I actually agree with the idea that suffering, to a point, can turn us toward God. In fact, I even agree that suffering may play an essential role in the journey toward God.  But I don't like the way Crabbe's God is positioned relative to our suffering, and I don't like the picture of God Crabbe paints.       Horrible unaddressed suffering is not always redemptive -- it can destroy a person (and others around that person).  Crabbe doesn't discuss if God ever crosses that line.  Or if the line to destruction is crossed, who crossed it?  And how?  Is this a God we can trust?  For what?  Is this God really "on our side", or is this God basically out to enhance his own "glory"?         Crabbe is quite admirably honest about the problems he has encountered in relating to God.  If a reader has had similar problems, then reading his candid stories could be cathartic.  On a more individual note, Crabbe seems to have personal guilt about having arrogantly yelled at God for more blessings when he already seems to have a ton.  If a reader with lots of blessings has assumed God owes it to them to make their life even more perfect, then this will also be relatable.     But the heavy-handed contortions Crabbe goes through near the book's end to reconcile his genuinely disturbing experiences with some very unattractive theology is quite discouraging -- even alarming -- and not helpful for either God's reputation or for maintaining faith.     Joy is not very well defined or described in this book.  But under Crabbe's scenario, could anyone but a masochist set out to find "joy"?  And if they found it, what kind of God would they have to rely on, from that point forward?      Based on past experience, maybe this God would just decide one day to jerk the rug out from under one's hard-won "joy"?  And if so many of these other promises aren't kept, then why should a person believe this God's promises about heaven are true?   
  I got this magazine as a gift, starting a few months back.  I really can't say I'm impressed.    Admittedly, I'm much more left leaning than this conservative (sometimes very, very conservative) magazine.  Dispite my bias, I can still recognize good writing and well made points - this magazine generally lacks both.  This isn't to say that I've never seen a good point or anything, they're just fairly rare.  If you want to read a well-written, well-argued, conservative mag this isn't it 
 Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...  But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of "The Partner" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks 
 the movie title itself says a lot, the movie itself is a total scam, fools people to rent or to watch it. a horrible directing, script and performance. you'd better jump off empire state building in the late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this brain-dean bad movie 
 what a joke...people believe the stupidest things...do some research and you will see that this is a joke.  I hated it 
 Let me start by saying that the book is very informative.  She's obviously done her research and the details prove it.  Unfortunatly, it seems as though her job at PLAYBOY didn't instantly qualify her to write a nonfiction book about hell.  The book is rambling at best.  It's like when you talk to a civil war historian or something and they cannot keep their thoughts on course.  "And then Jackson moved to outflank the union lines.... funny thing about Jackson..."  She does this often.  Now you may say to yourself: "self, 2 stars seems a little low for just that one flaw"; to which i would respond that it is really, REALLY annoying to read.  If incoherent writing and frequent tangents dont bother you, bump that rating on up to 5 stars. 
 When I got my Fagor pressure cooker I thought it was going to be a long relationship. But I have learned over the past few months that it's much more trouble than it's worth.  It may cut cooking time in half, but it certainly doubles clean-up time.  It's hard to regulate the cooking of the food that's locked inside the cooker.  In a regular cooking pot I can look inside and see how things are going, add things at the right time, make any adjustments that I need.  I like the ease of just bringing a regular pot to a boil, reducing to simmer, and coming back when the timer goes off. I hate trying to get the pressure right, worrying that it's too much pressure, and then waiting for it to depressurize or depressurizing it manually to speed things up.  Food textures are often all wrong. And when is it done? You can't just open it up, look inside and say "ten more minutes".  For the same price you can get some very nice copper-bottom pans that will last your whole lifetime and have no gaskets or valves that will need replacing 
 I did not expect it to be so child like, I thought it was better. I guess is good for a kid but I got it as reference book. I am sending it back  Thanks  marineus 
 As a Nationaly Certified Medical Massage Therapist with 20+ years in practice, this book disturbed me. While it is clear and conscise on many things, it's section on Fibromyalgia is disurbing, and makes me wonder what else she got wrong.  Fibromyalgia is not a muscular disorder. It has widespread diffuse pain, but specific muscle pain is caused by Chronic Myofascial Pain Syndrome. Even though the two syndromes frequestly co-exist, they are not the same thing. Fibro sufferers often have significant reduction in the effeciency of the Lymphatic system, resulting in significant intersitial swelling etc. She lists only two references to a disease that affects 10% of the popluation. What this text does not mention is that a significant number of pathologies that are listed as "contraindications" respond well to massage therapy if the practitioner has had appropriate training in pathology specific techniques. 
 This a wonderful book to read to children or to read yourself.  It tells the history of this Country of Ours in story form.  This makes the reading of it very fun and exiting.  The book also includes some wonderful drawings in color.  Don't miss.  It will make you proud to be an American 
 For those of you who like mysteries that follow clues and have great detective work, this is not for you. Did not hold my attention and I forced myself to finish it. Maybe it's the psychic angle that I found unbelievable. Very predictable and people dying left and right with no time to follow a single clue, not that they looked for them anyways. 
 First I will start with the positive (and only reason it got anything above a star). The chorus in this was terrific, wonderous, and beautiful. Their voices were perfect, and their talent... unquestioned.  However, what is to be questioned... is the conductor and the orchestras talent. Which confuses me because Harnoncourt's Brahms cycle is very good... this, is not. A poor waste of SACD if one asks me.  So, where does it go wrong?  (1) The horns are awful. They are like piercing beasts which rip through ones soul. Terribly out of place, and played with such force as to approach ugly. If this is what Harnoncourt intended... then it was an awful intention. The chorus is almost totally drowned out by their blairing voice.  (2) It seems that there is no balance, nor true dynamic range in this piece. It seems that Harnoncourt has forced everything in this narrow lane and doesn't allow a chorus to realize its full potential. I'm sorry but "artistic creativity" can only take one so far. It can't, and shouldn't, be allowed to cover for either poor playing, poor performing, or good old stupidity.  (3) Finally, these effects come together to create something of such awful quality that I've only run across one requiem that was worse (Hogwood's). Such a terrible interpretation and performance should be buried and forgotten.  If you want quality, seek out Marriner's interpretation 
 This sounds a lot like 'Out of time', but not quite as good in some  respects. 'Pop song 89' is a perfect opening to the album, it moves along nicely and is pretty catchy. Other highlights include 'World Leader Pretend', with nice percussion and steel guitars.  There are three acoustic songs which began kind of a theme on the next couple of albums. 'You are the everything' to me has absolutely no melody and moves along rather boringly. 'The wrong child' attempts to utilise harmony vocals. They are completely out of key with each other. Another poor effort. The high 'OKAYYYY' parts are unbelievably out of tune. 'Hairshirt' is third cut in the same vein as the previous two. Same chordal structure without much melody going on anywhere. Clearly, the ballads needed to be perfected. 'Orange Crush' is a more catchy tune. Mike Mills can also be heard in the chorus and, at the risk of sounding controversial, he actually has a better voice. Much purer. Why he did not sing any lead until the next album, is just unbelievable. Probably the strongest track. The best way of summing up this album is that it consists of three types of songs... 1) The Pop songs - Pop song 89 (good), Get up (ok), Stand (rubbish), The bonus cut (ok and catchy) 2) The ballads - Mentioned above, all rubbish. 3) The rock songs - World leader Pretend (good - toes line of being a ballad also), I remember California (grundgy, not too bad), Orange Crush (very good), Turn you inside out (rubbish 
 The reading was okay, but there wasn't much meat to it. Each page has a paragraph or maybe two that tells a story. Only a handful are interesting as many explain boring stuff like where pictures of old executives are located. One of the most interesting pages told about how Disney bought up all of the FL property using fictitious companies. For the price, I was disappointed as most of it is not notable. If you're a Disney buff, get this from the library and save the $$$ - you can read it in a 1/2 hr sitting 
 This book raises ignorance to a level near sublime. It is wretchedly prejudiced against the Germans, blind to the suffering of the Russian soldiers, and maniacal in its insistence on digging out racial prejudice. I have read many works of history, and a good few on the Great War. This is an infamous performance and a shameful waste of one's time and money 
 While the historical aspects of this book are interesting, the author expects you to know too much about the bible and religious philosphy and stresses signifigance without bothering to explain those aspects. It's almost as if the author is writing to impress his contemporaries and the vernacular is very onanistic. It's almost insulting. Imagine that you are in a very boring class, catching snippits of interesting info if can remain awake. Once again there are some interesting parts, but was ultimatly dissapointed after reading this book. This is not something to read if you are new or want to continue reading about this subject 
 Writing and story were not characteristic of Grisham.  He seemed to write as if his readers could not remember what was just said in a previous paragraph.  Very preachy about the plight of the homeless.  I am giving it two stars because I could actually finish reading it, but I do not recommend this book at all 
  Do dogs understand language?  Do they have their own syntax and grammar?  Stanley Coren thinks so.  Or maybe, as with many of his other books, he's only pretending to believe what he says in order to pique people's interest and sell more copies...  The words we use in dog training are actually irrelevant.  Since I train dogs in Manhattan, I often find myself on an elevator with one or more dogs.  When the door closes I'll say, "What do we do on an elevator?" and they'll all sit.  This often charms and surprises the other elevator occupants who may say something like, "Look!  They understand every word you say!"    Not really.  I trained the dogs to do this by first saying "What do we do on an elevator?-we sit."  Once that pattern was established, the dogs were able to make the leap from "What do we do on an elevator?" to "Sit" quite easily.  In fact, I could have as easily trained them to do this by using nonsense words, gobbledygook, ridiculous sounds that have no meaning at all.  So it isn't my words or syntax the dogs are responding to, it's my intent, my body language, my tone of voice (all carrying emotional information), and a previously established pattern of behavior.    Stanley Coren should know this better than anyone since one of his dogs is deaf, yet still obeys him.  Why?  Because of his body language and a previously established pattern of behavior, not because the dog "understands" his words.  Coren would say that the dog understands his hand signals the same way the hearing-impaired understand sign language.  But looked at objectively it's far more likely that the dog's response to hand signals is still just part of a previously established pattern of behavior, not a linguistic or cognitive process.   Coren would still disagree.  He claims that certain vocalizations made by dogs can be grouped together, which he takes to mean that there's a kind of syntax or grammar at work.  I'm sorry, Stan, but real language doesn't operate on such a simplistic level.  And while it may seem brave and controversial of Coren (who has a degree in psychology, not linguisics or animal behavior) to disagree with Noam Chomsky about the nature of language, at this stage in the development of linguistic science that's a bit like a high school sophmore disagreeing with Sir Isaac Newton about gravity.    Look, it's fairly obvious to anyone who really understands dogs that the reason certain yips, barks, growls, etc. are sometimes used together and others aren't (which isn't always true, by the way -- it depends on the dog), is that each vocalization comes from an emotional, not a cognitive state.  In other words, certain emotions -- like fear and aggression -- may be felt by the animal simultaneously, while others -- calmness and fear -- can't be.  It's not grammar or syntax, it's emotion, pure and simple.    Even if Coren hadn't thought this through from an emotional point of view, if he'd spent any time at all studying comparative neuroanatomy he'd know that a dog's brain has no Broca's area, which makes linguistic ability totally impossible.  But as with other books he's written (his LEFT-HANDER SYNDROME was notorious for being based on false data), Coren doesn't seem to care much about the truth.    Still, I have to admit that it's hard not to buy into this myth because as human beings we're constantly explaining our feelings and experiences to ourselves through our thoughts and inner monologues, or to others through conversations, letters, etc.  As a result we're almost forced, by the way our brains work, to supply a similar linguistic medium for a dog's feelings and behaviors when no such medium or ability exists.    I trained my dog to respond in a certain way whenever I ask him a certain question.  And I have to admit, I like the way it feels when I say to him, "Do you love me?" and he wags his tail, comes over, puts his paws on my chest, and licks my nose.  Does he understand the meaning of that sentence when I say it to him?  Of course not.  But I know he understands the emotion.  It's a shame that Coren doesn't get this fundamental difference between real linguistic understanding and pure emotion, particularly when the misinformation he disseminates in this book can be detrimental to the relationship between you and your dog, a relationship that SHOULD be based on real and, quite often, wonderful emotions, not on any imaginary ability to use and understand language.    If I could I'd give this book no stars at all 
 I have been struggling with a true Othello syndrome .. where my mate accuses me of having a non-existent affair.  This book devotes one paragraph to that specific problem, and the advice is summarized as "get professional help".  Thanks.  This book overadvertises & underdelivers, and is probably useful for mild cases of jealousy.  If you are the victim of serious delusional jealousy then get yourself a copy of The Green Eyed Marriage, which is based on real psychiatric research and helped me cope tremendously.  If your mate drinks or abuses substance, get yourself to Al-Anon 
 I have read about three quarters of this book and my biggest problem with it is that the testimonials by the boys seem really contrived, as if their words have been doctored up or forged. He has interviews with twelve year olds that flow so beautifully and articulately that it actually comes off as very inorganic and makes you wonder whether or not these kids' words have been doctored up. The vocabulary these kids use is often too sophisticated sounding for their age 
 Simply put, this is one of the books that shattered Schlesinger's credibility as a legitimate historian once and for all.  Once he was "Artie," the precocious high-flying historian/prodigy, amazing his peers & elders with his dazzling talents as an author & scholar.  Now he is a superannuated peddler of Camelot nostalgia and a defender of a school of thought that has been so thoroughly discredited over the years that it truly is a wonder that anyone takes Schlesinger seriously anymore.  Really, the only author/historian that is worse in this field is possibly Manchester.  How can anyone regard this stuff as serious history?  It is as though Schlesinger has sustained a sort of man-crush on JFK for all these years and cannot bring himself to be even remotely objective about a rather undistinguished administration.   He really contributes nothing to this field of study, so save yourself the effort of reading this tripe 
 I have most of EJD's books and I was definitely not impressed with this one. It actually took me a little over a week to finish it which is unheard of with me and my beloved EJD books. I'm just not feeling this one but I still buy the hardcover out of loyalty and because a bad EJD book is better than a whole lot of other garbage out there that's disguised as "good" fiction.   EJD chose to write a plot involving scams, murder and suspense like he did with "Thieves Paradise," wish was not my favorite either. The main character Driver gets caught up with married lover Lisa. She is a psycho to the tenth power. Reading about how she kept up with Driver's every move just made me shudder to think how easy it is for a person to stalk you if they choose.   I like that the backdrop is Los Angeles. Although EJD is not originally from Los Angeles, he's lived there long enough to have effortlessly captured in his novels the love-hate relationship you can easily develop for this city. You can't really describe it, you just have to live there to understand and appreciate his descriptions. I do like the appearance of characters from his previous books such as Arizona, Pam, and Panther. I'll admit Rufus was funny for words. The twists and turns of the story was okay but when it came to the end of the story I couldn't care less what happen just as long I was done.     The good news is that I am ready for another dose of EJD. The man is a great author who really takes the time to write books that the majority of black people can relate to in one way or another. Like I said earlier suspense novels are fine but I'm hoping the next one goes back to his roots and deals with relationships. 
 What a piece of liberal trash!  My five year old found it useful to press flowers 
 This book in my opinion was not good at all, they went way too in depth on some concepts and poorly explaned a lot of them, and it was structured that one would have to read the whole book to be able to write a functional program, trust me, there are better books on c+ 
 The funny thing about reviewing a CD is that if you don't like it, people will give you a ton of "not helpful" votes.  Well fire away, people, I don't care, but hopefully this helps someone else out there.  I purchased the CD because I'm a huge Queens of the Stone Age fan.  I knew to not expect QOTSA, but I didn't realize just how bad the vocals on this thing were going to be.  If they had stuck with just going all instrumental, this CD would be damn near a 4 or 5 star CD.  There's great riffing on here, quite a bit of a heavy, Black Sabbathy type sound, combined with some long jam session stuff.  But unfortunately they come back to perhaps one of the worst vocal performances ever captured on track in the modern era.  Animal from the Muppet Show would have done better.  Seriously bad, and the thing is, it almost sounds intentionally bad.  And as others have noted, the lyrics are stupid.  And there are some tracks where thank goodness these vocals are absent.  And yes, you can say they were joking or being humorous, but that doesn't make it any less annoying.    That's the kicker to me--if they weren't going to bother writing good lyrics, or laying down good vocals, then why even have vocals on what could have been a killer instrumental rock CD?  And listening to QOTSA, you know they COULD have done much better in that department.  
 The title and premise of this book is to put Family First. Yet I just read an interview with Dr Phil in one of the major national woman's magazines. He says - very proudly - that in all the years of their marriage he has only spent a day or two with his wife's sister and her family because he prefers to stay home and let his wife visit on her own. He feels time with them is wasted and he put his foot down from the very start of their relationship that he would not visit them. So, that is putting family first??? How incredibly sad for his wife, her sister and all their children. The entire clan has suffered because of his attitude. And what a shame that he sells this attitude as good advice 
 Shawn Hatosy (The Faculty, Outside Providence) is in love with Rachael Leigh Cook (She's All That, Antitrust) but she doesnt love him, she only wants to be his friend, then enter Hatosy's friend, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (Tv's Elvis, Velvet Goldmine) who becomes Cook's boyfriend and Hatosy becomes jealous from this....who hasnt gotten made when a friend seduces the girl you love....you know what, who cares really. Hatosy tells the story in flashback telling the story to cop Lorraine Bracco (The Sopranos, Medicine Man). This boring story has no likable characters and invokes really thin interest with me. Cook is really stale, Hatosy, as much as a good actor he is is rendered dull and Meyers plays another sleaze ball like in most of his thrillers. Worth a look and by god Im not looking again and towards the end you're like....WHY I DID I RENT THIS?!!. Also starring Estella Warren (Planet of the Apes remake). 
 Even a week ago I would have said this is book is probably the best popular introduction to the subject. Now that the New York Times has effectively called into question every word published on the subject by its reporter, Judith Miller, I feel I should warn folks to read the book with the NYT's admitted failures in mind. It's not clear how this scandal relates to the information in the book not associated with Iraq's bio-chem weapons programs, but those sections at least are thoroughly tainted by the evolving story of how Iran/Chalabi/White House/DoD collaborated to manipulate public/government opinion by feeding Miller disinformation 
 I know that no book can cover every topic, but this book left a lot out. It went into great detail about what I should do if I got some pretty rare diseases, but barely touched on the subject of Morning sickness, which is much more common.  And some of the information was just plain wrong. I trashed the book when it made me freak out in the 20th week because I couldn't feel the baby move. It advised that I should call the doctor. When I did, I found out most women don't feel it move until 21 weeks. Unfortunately I found this out after I had cried my eyes out thinking something was wrong. I would not suggest this book to anyone 
 It's summer, and my reading matter always lightens up significantly! I spotted this book at the library and figured, why not!  I know, I said never again for Danielle Steel, but the plot interested me.  How bad could it be, right?    Well, there's good news and bad news.  The good news is that the plot is different for DS, and held my interest enough so that, unlike Impossible, I actually finished it in one day.  The bad news is that this book seems entirely devoid of any attempt at editing.  The repetition is maddening. When reading becomes a chore, and you can skip entire pages and not miss anything, it's time to start some serious editing.    Here are some suggested areas of improvement:  - Shorten up the paragraphs.  They should not exceed a page! - Try spending a little more time developing the characters.  I couldn't "see" Sarah - when I read, I want to be able to clearly visualize the people and after hundreds of pages, I never had a clear vision of the main character - Pay attention to style. Every time she spelled out 30,000, I wanted to pull my hair out.  Small thing, but numbers over nine should always be written in numerals unless they are at the beginning of a sentence.  As I've written before, DS needs a good editor. This book could have been one of her best to date.  
 I'm having a hard time believing the reviews I see here. Gucci Gulch is by far one of the most boring books I've read this year. Perhaps, it's because it was required literature for Intro to Poli Sci, but that's beside the point. This book is too detailed. I agree with the comment where it should have been condensed, but I want to stress that this information cannot be found elsewhere without intense research. I commend the author for his diligent work, but this book just wasn't for me. It's 291 pages on the Tax Reform of 1986. If that's your cup of joe, I would highly suggest it. Avoid it if you are a casual reader. 
 The first two short stories seem to have nothing to do with the main story. I couldn't stand Harriman. If an enginneer says it is impossible or the plan needs to be changed, he should agree with them and change it. The story itself is boring because you never learn much about the main characters 
 Hahaha. Bubblegum music at its finest. There are definately better singers out there that can ACUTALLY sing, unlike Ciara. Garbage lmao. Those one songs, what are they called, 1, 2 Step and Goodies. LOL! Bubblegum, and why is Ludacris on that song "Oh". Sellooouuuttt! LOL. For reals though, if you seriously payed more than 10 bucks of your hard earned money for this. Ouch 
 Leaving the Fold  #1. They know of Christ but they do not "KNOW" him.  Matthew 15: 8 These people draw nigh unto me with their mouth, and honour me with [their] lips; but their heart is far from me.  #2. They accept the Word of God but after a season turn away. No foundation.  Matthew 13: 21 - Yet hath he not root in himself, but endures for a while: for when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, by and by he is offended.  2 Timothy 4:3 - For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away [their] ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.  2 Timothy 3:5 -  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.  #3. They care more about and mind the things of this world.  Mark 4:19 And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.  Romans 12:2 - And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what [is] that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.  #4. They follow and teach man made religious doctrines. (Catholics praying the rosary, praying to Mary etc.) They break into denominations when there are no denominations.  Romans 12:5 - So we, [being] many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.  #5. The very elect will and can be deceived.  Matthew 24:24 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if [it were] possible, they shall deceive the very elect.  #6. He has no tolerance for lukewarm Christians.  Revelations 3:16 So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth. 
 After finishing the 70-290 book in the set and taking the exam, I am shocked at how "out of touch" this book is with the actual exam.  Topics that were barely touched upon in the book ended up being huge sections in the test and vice versa.  I started buying Sybex cert books because of how well the CCNA book was done and how it actually related to the exam.  I'm hoping the other books in this kit are a little more up to par 
 Normally I wouldn't waste my time... Normally I would write a "real" view. but.... I hate this band... time and time again I buy the album thinking "maybe just maybe" and everytime... I am dissapointed they suck more and more... They are barly in the rock genre... they cry almost enough to be cosidered childrens music... I hate them... Don't buy it... DON"T DO IT 
 Jerry is one of history's great stand up comedians, no doubt. That is why this is worth listening to. Be aware that yes, there is a lot of material on here that is old. Basically stuff you might have seen Jerry perform on an HBO special back in like 1982. I think since he regrettably never released a stand up record before he decided to use a lot of this to preserve it on a CD. That in conjunction with the fact that he might not have had that much new material. I wish he had vintage stuff of him recorded from small comedy clubs back in the 80s. I always prefer on a comedy record that it is performed in a small club as opposed to a huge arena or hall. You definitely lose all of the intimacy that I think makes for the best stand up comedy experience. All in all since this is Jerry's one and only comedy record it is certainly worth checking out, let's face it a mediocre Jerry output is better than a lot of comedians best stuff. 
 We purchased this book to use in our accelerated curriculum since we have a substantial vocabulary unit connected to Frankenstein.  However, a few days into the book, we are noticing major departures from Mary Shelley's novel.  Kaplan has irresponsibly marketed this book as if it is the original version.  
 This product looked light it was one of the best made USB lights/fans out there except the light and the fan burned out after 1 month of use because of overheating 
 It's probably been 15 years since I read it, and EVERY person in the years since with whom I have discussed this book has said the same thing.  It was literally a book that kept me up until 3 a.m. - and THAT is how it ends?  I'm hoping Dr. Crichton had a publishing deadline or something.  
 How to read this book:  Cut each of the 240 pages exactly in half with an exacto blade. Read the top (or bottom) half of any page combined with the bottom (or top)half of any other page. Write a review lauding the "originality" of this book.  Example, bottom of page 159:      "Although one of the popes made Galileo take back every word he said, as well.       Meantime my period and I still remain no distance at all from each other, presumably.      Well, or the pain in my left shoulder and I, similarly.      Perhaps I have not mentioned the pain in my left shoulder.      I have mentioned it."  Page 108, top:       "Although some few happened to be of the Via Vittorio Veneto, which is almost directly below the Borghese Gallery.      The reverse of that statement being equally true, by the way.      Now that I think about it, I may have worn that soccer shirt all the way to Paris, even.      Doubtless I stopped sitting on the other shirts after the rest of my own garments dried, however."  Anyone who claims to have read this book in any other fashion - sequentially from the first to the last page, for example - is lying.        
 I expected more information as to dates and specific predictions for the current time period.  The book was very vague and seemed to be missing much.  I would not suggest this book for reading 
 Good Housekeeping does not send a notice to the person receiving the subscription in a timly manner. It shouldn't take 2 to 3 weeks to receive notification 
 I watched both "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" and its documentary "Making of ..." and was impressed by the dancing and the dancers (particulary the incredible Tommy Rall).  Looking for a film that showcased any of the dancers in that film I came across this and after having read the reviews of the dance sequences both on this website and on imdb, I decided to purchase the film.  Then I noticed the cover.  I thought "Is this what I think it is?", and clicked on 'see larger image'.  YIKES!  It is!  I have children at home and thought that this is not an illustration that is positive or educational, to say the least (after just having placed "Hands Are Not For Hitting" on my wish list!).  If Warner Bros decides to change the illustration on the cover, then I'll consider buying it.  Until then, for those of you who are concerned with the images your children see, I suggest you view the 'see larger image' of the cover before you decide to buy 
 This is a must read for all teachers. It is also very insightful for individual growth. Writing on Both Sides of the Brain allowed me to see where my students were and why they were doing some of the writings they were, and why they were having a hard time with other writings. Writing on Both Sides of the Brain is just a great page turner you want to saver, but can't wait to read the next page 
 I purchased this prior to surgery thinking it would be great for recovery.  However, the "nature sounds" only worked the first time I turned it on.  After that, despite changing batteries, etc., the sounds never came back again.  I wouldn't recommend this purchase 
 Ok, i REALLY thought this ball would be GREAT considering the overinflated price and since it is endorsed by the NBA.  NOT SO!  This ball feels very similar to the cheap $20 balls you can get at your local department stores!    Feels similar to the Wilson NCAA solution game ball, but slightly less tacky, but since it has to be pumped up so much inorder for it to actually bounce it feels almost like rubber.  I personally do not like that.  This ball is supposed to be able to be played out of the box, without a break in period.  Well, i hope it gets to feeling better over time, but since it supposedly has not break in period, i am very skeptical.  I honestly do not feel the "crosstraxxion" design does anything to improve the the feel or grip of the ball.  If you like the feel of leather, this is NOT for you.  I am NOT impressed!  Search for reviews for this ball before purchasing!  The only thing you can do with this ball that you can't do with others, is say "Well at least this is the Official Game Ball the pros use!"  
 If you are truly interested in learning about Druidry, please stick with authors who have honest academic backgrounds in the subject... Such as; Miranda Green, Barry Cunliffe, Ronald Hutton, Philip Carr Gomm, Anne Ross, Peter Berresford Ellis, Emma Restall Orr, Philip Shallcrass, John & Caitlin Matthews 
 I agree with a number of previous reviewers. Grimassi stretches a poor understanding of historical context to fit into what he bounces between "wicca" and "witchcraft".  Wicca is not an old religion, indeed it is not much of a religion at all. It has always lacked definite theology (what is the saying about ask three wiccans what they believe and you'll get four answers...) and Grimassi does more damage than good by presenting historical materials is non-scholarly lights. In fact, the book is poor on all accounts. From confused terminology to "chopping" of source materials. This is a waste of money 
 I wrote a review not long ago on this book (you can see it down below), and I suppose I damaged my credibility as a "critic" by claiming in the review that I was only about halfway through the book. Well, I have finished the book, and I believe that a new review is in order.  As indicated by the FIRST half of the book, ALONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE just never caught me. Though this is his only work I have read (and plan to leave it at that), Richard Reeves has become a bit of an enigma to me: how does a man so devoid of literary zest become so acclaimed for same? It's a mystery, but don't misread my intentions; I'm not here to hack the man to death. I really put alot of effort into reading this book, and I recognize that he put tons of effort into WRITING it. It's brilliantly researched, and of this there is no doubt. Yet, I had to concentrate hard and dedicate myself just to finish it. I was tempted to walk away several times. Why, you ask?  Well, for pretty much the same reasons I listed in my first review. ALONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE is dry, cold and basically completely uninteresting. Myriad facts which comprise one of the most shocking and pivitol events in political history are presented like the directions in a stereo manual. It's literally like reading a technical diagram, and when you think Reeves is going to go off on an interesting tangent (say, for instance, some curious note of Nixon's personal life, which is why we're reading in the first place, right?), after one or two meager sentences he regretfully gets back to business as usual. If you're into exhaustively researched dates, times, government acronyms, and media and political insider jargon, then this book is for you. If you read not only for the pursuit of knowledge but ALSO the pleasure of the *act* of reading, then I can only condemn this work. Stay away from it.  There is nothing wrong with the material. That's simply not the issue. Any other reputable biographer/author could have taken the exact same research and drafted a fine and enjoyable volume. It's simply Reeves' impersonal and uninspired writing style. I'd be really surprised if Reeves didn't have as bad a time writing PRESIDENT NIXON as I did reading it.  Even lacking works in literature, film and music, I believe, should be experienced just for perspective (to quote the great philosipher Butthead -- of Beavis and Butthead fame -- "if nothing ever sucked, you wouldn't know when something was cool"), but I will not say the same for this book. Technically, it IS well-written (there are no typos or grammatical errors) and is also a fine representation of expert documentation, but there is no redeeming value here as far as historical worth goes, and there certainly isn't anything to be hoped for in the department of literary enjoyment, either. If you are interested in Nixon the man, Nixon the politician, or even Nixon the President, I cannot stress strongly enough avoiding this book and looking elsewhere. It just isn't worth your time (or money).  In short, ALONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE almost made me forget why I love reading in the first place.  Unbelievable. 
 How many pages should a writer fill to explain that a character is afraid of forks, knives and mirrors?  Two?  Well Koontz takes over a hundred, and repeats, repeats, repeats.  500 pages should have been cut from this book.  Repetition weakens writing 
 It's ALive 3: Island of the Alive is down right hilarious. Nothing is better than watching mutant babies grow up and eat people. I mean seriously. My personal favorite scene was the court room scene with the "baby" in the cage. Good laughs.  In this flick, Michael Moriarity portrays a father of a mutant "baby." The government decides to put the lil' suckers (theres five or so now) on an uncharted island. Five years later, they decide they need to get "fluid samples" off the creatures for scientific research. Michael Moriarity goes along for the ride. Well the "babies" have grown into five year old "adults." And one of them has had a baby of their own. Yes indeed, Moriarity is a Pappy. All is well until they all die. Except Moriarity. The monsters want to get back to civilization and Moriarity gets stuck with the job of taking them there. Somewhere along the journey, they chuck him out into the ocean, Cuba picks him up, he gets back to the states, bla bla bla. All in all, this is a funny movie that deserves a four star rating on a B-movie scale. Watching this movie alone is like getting beat to death by golf clubs, but watching it with a bunch of B-movie lovers is a riot.  If you liked "Island of the Alive" I recomend: the awesomely bad movie "Creature," it's sci-fi on drugs and totally funny. What I learned from Island of the Alive: Cuban officers are nice AND funny 
 There are many different opinions about this book. I did read Hotel Paradise but don't remember reading Cold Flat Junction, so that may account for the reasons why I had a hard time getting into this book. I have read Grimes' other novels and numerous Jury books, and I like her style of writing. This book is just not up to par with the others 
 I believe this is the second worst book I've ever read, although having not bothered to finish it, it had potential to rank higher on the list.  The concept, the characters, the plot and the writing were so far fetched that it was too difficult to suspend my disbelief long enough tolerate reading it.  I never give up on books; I read them to the end, no matter how much I dislike them.  Leaving a book unread haunts me; throwing out a book is a Cardinal Sin in my mind.  I made an exception in this case and tossed it in my garbage can and felt no guilt.   The writing is poor; there is no eloquence, no wit, no attempt at a remotely believable plot.  The humor is not humorous; it's an attempt at slapstick comedy that falls short of its goal.  It is too obvious, too tiresome, and often just plain bizarre.  The book was recommended by a close friend who enjoys award-winning books; I assumed she'd be on target with this one.  She obviously likes Hiaason's books and find them funny and involving, but simply put,they're not my taste or to my liking.  Find something else to do with your time, something more satisfying and  mentally stimulating than reading this book.  I've never dared to try another of his books since being so annoyed by Lucky You, so I cannot speak for them.  This one might have been an anomaly in his body of work, although I honestly don't know.  But I feel like I wasted my time with this, and to be honest, if I were given a choice between reading this book and snorting dirt, I'd choose the latter.   
 Do you like zombie movies? Of course you do, otherwise you wouldn't be here. But do you like piss-poor make-up design,  God-awful special effects & horrendous lighting? Probably not.  The best thing I can say about this flick is that it comes with 2 discs. The first (Plaga Zombie)is almost certainly a college project.(So I won't comment further on that one. But the second disc (Plaga Zombie: Mutant Zone) should have been better since it was the follow-up with a bigger (I assume) budget.  Anyways; The music was  a little over-exaggerated and seemed like it was trying to make this flick more serious than it really was. (Except the "John West" song, which I still find myself singing. In fact that whole scene is the best part of the movie.) When it comes to zombie comedies, you can do alot better than this one. (ie: Dead-Alive, Return of the living Dead Part 2, Shaun of the Dead) Don't get me wrong, the directors have potential. But that potential would be better geared toward slap-stick comedies, not horror comedies.  Just a Side Note: The main attraction of any zombie flick is the undeads prosthetic make-up.(Peeling Flesh/Half-Eaten Lips/Severed limbs and Disembodied torsos/ etc.) Suffice to say, Absolutely none of these zombies even so much as resembled zombies. (or acted like zombies for that matter). They look more like college kids after Halloween night.  MORAL OF THE STORY:  Time & Money are Precious Commodities.                       To Waste Them on this Flick is Unethical. 
 I used this bag once when traveling and then the zipper completely fell off because it was improperly made, then I got a new bag (customer service was very nice and helpful) and it has a huge rip in the bottom after only traveling with it once and gate checking it (my stroller wasn't damaged), so I have concluded that it is horribly made and a waste of money, still waiting on a refund 
 I have had this textbook now for 3 years.  Sure it contains the basics, but it is now rather out of date, with a bad lay-out.  As a university student I have found it the most useless of all of the 12 marketing textbooks that I own 
 Same old GW bunch of ridiculous opinions. I thought this one might be better, but no...  Now even pine isn't good enough - it has to be 100 year old pine 
 I am a first year veterinary student, and I bought this book thinking it would be a good tool for reviewing my anatomy.  Definitely not the case!!!  The book is not detailed enough to satisfy the veterinary student (at least not at Tufts!).  This is especially true for the nerves and bones.  I would recommed getting the Evans and deLahunta "Guide to the Dissection of the Dog" instead, and coloring in their black and white illustrations 
 Reading this book is difficult, I don't know if I'll be able to get through it.   12 point type gets a 12 point paragraph indent, 14 point type gets a 14 point paragraph indent, this book has paragraph indents of .5 inch, which suggests the type should be 36 points  It's as if the book is trying to hypnotize a person into being a good typesetter, my eyes zigzagged back and forth, and this voice started saying, "you will be a good typesetter, you will be a good typesetter." Something about the excessive white space at the beginning of the paragraphs was putting me to sleep. So any good information about typesetting will be hard to extract. 
 The idea for the book was great, but the book was way too long, although the ending wasn't quite long enough. You shouldn't read this book until your 16 or 17, at least. It was way too confusing for me. Some parts of the book were more intersting than the others, and it was interesting to see into her life, but definately not a book to put on a young adults list 
 I certainly would not recommend this book to anyone as a first Kellerman's novel. There are too many medical jargons and terms as if Kellerman is trying to show off his medical knowledge. There are just too many unnecessary references to either the rarer or more serious and feared disorders unrelated to the story and thus causing a lot of side tracking which to me is a pure waste of time reading and boring to readers especially those with medical knowledge. It took me a long long time to finish this novel and thought of discarding it numerous times even when I was more than half way through the novel! This is especially so after having read the very exciting Robert Crais's "Demolition Angel" followed by Lee Child's "One Shot".  The story in this book are also full of loop holes and I cannot buy the idea of a Conspiracy Club using Jeremy to get to the killer and allowing more murders to take place while he was stressfully doing so. However, I must admit that I did enjoy reading a couple of Kellerman's other novels "Murder Book" & "When the Bough Breaks" quite some time ago 
 This book is dated 1996.  I ran across this book and read it this summer.  Perhaps this book would have been more fresh had I read it nine years ago, but in any case, I offer this review for those who might happen to run across it today...  Rodney Clapp's book began with great promise.  Based on writings by Henri Nouwen, he articulated the angst many Christians feel concerning their place within the modern culture.  We want to have an important role in the culture; instead, we find ourselves clamoring for recognition.  Rather than being the athletes, we are the sponsors.    With an admission that he is not an expert in one particular field, Clapp promises to summon his strength as part-journalist, part-theologian to lead the church to higher ground.  And indeed, higher ground comes into view as the reader marches through the pages: What if the church were truly counter-cultural?  What if the church resisted American dreams and myths, and substituted them for a fresh biblical vision?  The vision of this higher ground kept me turning the pages at first.  Yet instead of reaching higher ground, I found myself trudging over worn paths that only led in circles.  The higher ground remained elusive, and I left this book with frustration.  I think the book suffers from what I call "pompous postmodernism."  This seems to be a Christian literary genre in which the author seeks to demonstrate that all Christians until now have been misguided but, alas, now we see clearly through new postmodern lenses.  Yet as a student of church history, I take issue with important aspects of Clapp's historical analysis.    In particular, his view of the Reformation is simplistic and, in my opinion, misguided.  He worries that the Reformation dismantled the counter-cultural aspects of the church (hierarchy, heightened ethical demands for monks) while not addressing the biblical basis of the Reformers' concerns.  Then Clapp posits that the Reformers' view of vocation (all work can be done in a Christian way) was wrongheaded, leading to a Christian sponsorship of the world's culture.  However, I would argue instead that the Reformers rightly reminded the world that its culture is actually based upon, and dependent upon, the creation of God and the laws of God.  (Clapp admits in a footnote that the Puritans were not so bad.  One is left to wonder how these children of the Reformation got so much right when he claims the Reformers got so much wrong.)    Second, for all the talk about moving beyond a watered down "Constantinian" Christianity, which ailed the church from AD 400-1996, I fail to see what Clapp has to offer.  When the dust settles, it seems the reader is left with basic principles concerning worship, liturgy, community, etc.  While not bad applications necessarily, I am not sure what is new here other than the pride with which the insights are given.  Perhaps part of the problem is that Clapp is overly dependent on the writings of others.  He has done some homework, offering hundreds of footnotes.  But for lengthy stretches, Clapp basically recycles the work of others (Henri Nouwen, John Yoder, N.T. Wright).  Clapp sometimes seems much more like an admiring fan than an original thinker.  Which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the hefty claims about (finally!) getting Christianity right.  In summary, I recommend this book as a springboard for thought concerning the church's role in the world and, in particular, American culture.  But you might want to read some others who have written on the topic of church and culture, such as Charles Colson or Edmund Clowney. 
 Apparently,their last work with frontman Steve Perry and quite the let down.'Trial...' was the band's '96 comeback attempt,but if I remember correctly this CD was a stiff from the get-go.I tried SO hard to get into this fifteen track disc,but even with a duration of 68 minutes,I just couldn't.The songs don't completely suck,they just don't appear to have much life.Fantastic cover,don't you agree?If you're an old school Journey fan,I encourage you to check out their new 2005 release,'Generations' with vocalist Steve Augeri,who's been with the band for awhile now.That CD is surprisingly good,as I'd give it 3 1/2,maybe 4 stars.Keep in mind that guitarist Neal Schon is their 'key' player 
 I didn't feel that this was his best work.  I liked the characters and the story line was great, but lacked in suspense until the 6th of 8 tapes.  Too much detail on mundane stuff.  Suspense picked up on Tape 6, but wasn't the same type of suspense like "PREY".  Enjoyed it, but would've liked more suspense 
 i couldn't wait to get this. but then when I started reading it, i just got so fustrated with it. i mean, it was such crap...what they were saying. they got everything completely wrong. at the end of the book, i was so pissed off, that i started to just write down why hate their stupid little debates they propose. this book is a disgrace to the wachowski brothers and just the matrix phenomenon in general.   
 I'm sure this is a very nice book, just like the Writer's Market books about agents and publishers. The problem with these books is that unless you have a close personal friend in the publishing business or the theatre world, you will never get anything published or produced. No book can help you do that. It's a matter of luck and coincidence, and if you weren't lucky enough to go to college with someone in the business, you're out in the cold, and no book will alter that fact for you. Have a nice day 
 Horrible!  Shame on the Man Booker Prize for awarding any accolades to a book that should have never been published 
 So, being a fan of all forms of literature, more specifically challenging[faulkner], pretentious[d.h. lawrence] and original[kafka] works, I was surprised at how long it took me to get around to reading what's considered Pynchon's most imporant work.  Important 40 years ago, perhaps, but the test of time has totally obliterated the supposed wit in this one.  Oh man, the radio station is KCUF, boy, that's incredibly clever, I bet it's, like, something spelled backwards.  I fully understand what Pynchon was trying to accomplish with this work, to skewer extreme right wing nut jobs, among other things, all while giving us a story with no particular plot, no moral, no message.  I can understand it, but it doesn't mean it's worth my time, I didn't even finish it.  I read about half and then just dropped it to the floor.  I've read in numerous reviews of Haruki Murakami's work that he's a latter day, Japanese, Pynchon.  I don't agree, Murakami's ability to create a surreal dream-like atmosphere is amazing, Pynchon is a hack 
 This book is awful. There is just no excuse for it. This collection of short memoirs are banal, tedious and utterly witless. Peck's only qualifications as a writer is the fact that she is female, over fifty, overweight and gay. Her memoirs are so insipid that finishing this book was incredibly difficult. Reading her memories about her grandparent's cows and how she is unable to pee in the woods made me roll my eyes. When she wrote about her cat, Babycakes, she made it sound as if her cat is ingenious and inovative to do all of these things which cats do naturally (her cat likes string? Really? Wow. . .).  I kept waiting for this book to become the fascinating, utterly hilarious, insightful, witty literary achievement that all the other reviews claimed that it was. Needless to say, that never happened. I plan on giving this book to someone that I don't like very much 
 I bought this book based on the feedback of others on Amazon.  I was rather excited to read it once I received the book.  Although, this book is written extremely well, I found this book rather uninteresting, slow, and anticlimactic.  The author incorporates the letters of Mary Todd Lincoln into the story, which is interesting.  To be honest the most interesting character in this book is the dog.  This book has a lot of potential.  There was just no story-line, no plot.  If you want to truly experience a sense of grief, read this book. But I am human and maybe I missed something that others did not 
 While I realize it's hard not to be biased about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, I think we all expect the Complete Idiot's Guide series to be more factual & even-handed, rather than grossly opinionated. Mr Bard gives no voice to the Palestinian or humanist sides of things.   If you want to learn more about this subject - along with all of the Middle East, I'd recommend The Middle East for Dummies. This writer gives both sides of the story and reminds me of the diversity and plain sense of "just wanting to get by" that everyone in the world shares.  Also, note that many of the reviewers for this book (as well as the Dummies book) are very biased themselves - just check out their other reviews. It's pretty shocking. Example: Jill Malter - she lists herself as a "zionist" on her profile. How do you think that reflects her opinions here 
 I got the filter for the humidifier I also just bought. Upon placing the filter in and turning the unit on, a strong odor filled the room. I had to open the windows to air the room out because I didn't think inhaling the smell was a good idea. Being that it was for my bird's room, I feel sure that it would result in him getting sick or worse. I believe the problem lies in the Protec antimicrobial treatment. I would never have bought it had I known about this. 
 Our son is 7 years old and wants to learn how to play the drums.  I thought this would be a great book (I did look inside the book through Amazon's viewer) and it looked great.  The problem is the CD, it's horrible.  The whole point in having a CD along with the book is so the kid can hear what his lesson is suppose to sound like.  The stuff on the CD isn't even drums, it's a whole variety of other instruments!  In addition to this set we also got Carmen Appice's Realistic Rock for Kids, which also comes with a CD, and we love that one.  Carmine actually narrates the book and takes the kids lesson by lesson like he was sitting right there with them.  He is also playing the lessons ON THE DRUMS so the kids can hear what they are suppose to sound like.  I recommend checking that one out instead of wasting your money on this one 
 This book is poorly written, _utterly_ disjointed, and has a cloying sentimentality that is really annoying.  By that I mean it's not at all analytical: it includes random snippets of poems, etc. that serve only to confound the reader looking for some meat.  Plus, there are certain phrases like "cutting sign" that I hadn't the foggiest idea about until I looked it up.  Help the reader out here.  Yeah, it's hot as hell in the desert, and it's doggone handy to have water.  It sucks that people are dying in the desert and the forces that draw them to _El Norte_ are highly complex and not necessarily their fault.  Still, they are breaking the law from the word go, and well they know it, and it seems to me there are worse tragedies involving truly innocent people.  Plus, it peeves me to no end that these illegals have largely trashed some of the most beautiful and exotic wildernesses in the U.S.  So my sympathy is just not all that deep.  The photos are for the most part of lousy quality as well.  Why it took carrying several cameras, as the author claims, to produce these pictures is beyond me.  Lastly the book is VERY short, with a ridiculously long appendix addressing every single death that has occurred in this area ... newsflash: no one is going to read that.  How could the editors have allowed a book like this to go to press?  It's absolutely amateurish, despite being driven by sincere emotions 
 If you like repetition...read this book.  If you like repetition...read this book.  If you like repetition...read this book.  Did you get the point?  IF Steel is one of the best, THIS is one of her worst!  Starting out, I truly felt she was identifying with a struggle many women experience as children grow up and memories of early career goals start to resurface.  After a couple chapters we had rehashed the issue so many times, we became bored with our own memories!  The book could have been written in three chapters. The only thing that keeps you reading is the fact that you want it to be over!  (I literally took almost two months to read the book because there was no point to hurry through.  The ending is contrived, the characters are either too 'good' or too 'bad'.  In order to finish I had to put space between redings so I wasn't bored beyond belief!)  Can we please bring LaVyrle Spencer out of retirement?  Note to Amazon...don't invest in many copies of this one.  There will be too many copies people will want to unload so they don't have to dust another tome 
 Well, this book is definitely "different." When I read the back cover, I was very excited. Written by the Penn of Penn and Teller, it was about an Atheist sock monkey telling a murder mystery. Brilliant! The actual product is not what I'd expected. Penn's style is very chaotic...reminds me a LOT of Kotzwinkle's "The Fan Man" (which is a BRILLIANT piece of non-traditional narration). The title of Chapter Two made me laugh a LOT. There are several funny bits. Sometimes (and by that I mean OFTEN) it seems that the author is very smug and proud of himself, he obviously thinks that he is an amazingly clever writer. The book can be very arrogant. Also, I think much of the point of the book is to SHOCK people. Lots of name-calling and disdain for much of "normal American society"--the monkey attacks all sorts of groups, including Christians and those who are less sexually adventurous throughout the novel. Also, it is EXTREMELY graphic (again, for contrived shock value, it seems to me). That's not to say that I don't agree with the monkey's P.O.V.--often I think he is dead on (no pun intended) and the monkey/author are definitely not afraid to speak their mind. Sometimes, though, it seems the only point for including some "SHOCKING" pollitically incorrect statement is to create buzz. Maybe I'm just being cynical.  At one point in the novel we (the audience) get to read some of the killer's writings. It's some pretty messed up stuff.   There is one bit of the style that I really do like, though. Every paragraph ends with a song lyric. Most of them I can identify, but even those I can't, they fit thematically.   Overall, I was just not impressed by this book. I was often put off by its arrogance and tone. The chapters written by the killer were very psychopathic (appropriately)...they totally creeped me out. The last few chapters (which were, luckily, NOT written by Dickie the sock monkey) did wrap things up nicely, but I'm just not sure that reading this was worth it. Some of the books assertions were so "shocking" that it was very bothersome to wade through. (The whole part about how women want to have sex with cops and that they all mostly have a secret wish to be "raped by a pig"...just, I have no words...I hardly think that a handcuff/power play fantasy is the same as a rape-wish.) Much of the book was full of these little asides from Dickie. Perhaps that was all supposed to be part of his character-that he was so course and harsh and bad, but I didn't enjoy it. Most of the reviews from Amazon.com have been very positive so, obviously, Penn's novel works for some people.  Also, I thought the "clues" and foreshadowing was a bit heavy-handed. Some of the "trivial" details that would later lead to the discovery seemed so glaringly obvious as I read along...the author seemed to have trouble layering and hiding those facts in the fabric of the story. Oh well. I still love the fact that the back cover has a picture of a sock monkey mooning the reader.   
 I wont say anything about correctness, but in the end Ahmed Ali has been unable to convey the profound tone any of our holy books has, and definitely Kur'an does too.  The English is not in the least exciting or moving.. Finally the edition is a poor one, a uselessly big book, hard to handle when its paperback like mine. 
 I purchased this book after reading the great reviews.  I am extremely disappointed.  This book is simply a laundry list of anything that a parent/teacher could possibly do to give children better self-esteem. Each tip is dedicated two pages.  It wasn't what I thought it would be and would not be easy to refer back to any particular item.  
 There is some decent info, but the worst part is how outdated the numbers and addresses are! You go to call a company and they're gone! Same with addresses--I had many queries returned to me because the company was no longer there. So then, what's the point of the book if you can't get ahold of the people 
 The brief, passionate title of Manes' book certainly caught my eye.  Unfortunately, Manes makes no convincing arguments on behalf of radical environmentalism in this tedious diatribe.  Instead, he simply spouts empty  rhetoric and a few conspiracy theories.  Manes emphasizes his contention  that civilization is on the brink of collapse due to our violent attitude  toward nature.  Do we need to change our attitude toward nature?  Well, I  think so.  Will Manes' book convince anybody of this?  I doubt it.  If you  want to read a good book about the Earth First! movement, read  "Confessions of an Eco-Warrior," a homey but surprisingly  articulate collection of essays by Dave Foreman, an on-again, off-again  proponent of radicalism.  The best I can say about Green Rage is that if  you are into radical environmentalism, it will get you riled up.  The worst  I can say is that it does a disservice to the environment by being a waste  of the paper it is printed on 
 My review reflects the summary I gave. Cozzens is a racial, nationalistic, religious bigot.  He is a smug, pretentious writer. He does not improve with age.  Book is worthless 
 Flat, boring, pointless, plain stupid. Guy gets too pretentious with all that bunch of alleged existencial symbolism, whatever it is supposed to mean. His writing style is quite poor, he uses tons of cliches, and presumes to be telling more than he does. Too kitshy to be true.  I would give it a -5 star if I could. Just stay away from this garbage 
 Just not that impressed with this book.  The write-up was much better than the book itself.  Superficial.  Will be selling my copy as used 
 The amount of matter which the author has repeated again and again if you minus all that repeated matter, the book would hardly be of about a 100 pages .. Don't even borrow to read it . 
 The book is somewhat entertaining, but reading it you realize that the author  doesn't know much about the subject. The part about 18 century was so unrealistic with things like lipstick, iced tea or bath tab, that I was really surprised the characters didn't use computers in that time period 
 I live in northern California, so rain is nothing new to me.  I've been putting off getting a large umbrella for quite some time now, but since I signed up for free Amazon Prime, I figure I'd buy everything I've been wanting for 30 straight days.  This umbrella made my list because I've read some decent reviews on it, plus it's affordable but I guess you get what you pay for.  The first umbrella came and the tip was split.  I ask for a replacement from Amazon which arrived next day (nice service) however, I wish this umbrella is as good as Amazon's service, because the replacement umbrella also arrived damaged.  Except this one is far worse; the entire tip is missing.  Since this is the replacement, Amazon will only do a refund.  By the way I'm STILL without an umbrella 
 Very slow book, very predictable, oddly written (sometimes I had to reread a sentence a few times just because it sounded so odd). 
 i was disappointed after this book was suggested to me. nothing ever happens. there are a lot of long winded descriptions and background and very little story 
 To celebrate the anniversary of our company, we thought we'd give all employees a gift.  Our Apple phobic IT guys nixed the Ipod as a choice, despite the CEO and CTO both owning and recommending them, so we went with the Zune.  Of the 50 we bought, 16 had to be exchanged for quality issues.  We've had issues with the drivers on the Vista enabled computers and spotty syncing with the XP machines.  Several of the units have had poor performing batteries and several also had a buzz in the headphones. We can't use them as data drives so they're not as useful as we'd like.  Finally, store interoperability is zero and we cannot understand why DRM is applied to files if you share them.  Which reminds me, the wireless is half baked; too slow and we've had plenty of hang ups while trying to share. The end of the story is that the CEO is both pissed and embarrassed as to the gift debacle.  He has already said in no uncertain terms that when Apple ships a video ipod, the company will give those to make up for the Zune experience 
 The book is about a spoiled unsatisfiable teenage girl whom keeps marrying men and then running away from her problems because she doesn't like her situation. I was forced to reed this book in school and i had no sympathy for the main character Janie. She needs to realize that the world is not perfect. The only part of the book that i actually cared for was at the begining of the book when she is gossiped about upon walking back to town and she ignores the gossip and holds her head high 
 I understand this was a student film, but why is it still available, and why can you buy it almost anywhere, including TARGET!? The only parts that are laugh-inducing are the parts that aren't supposed to be funny: like when Big J (good God, why did the girl let people call her Big J like it was her name?) reveals that her plans for the night involve her hanging out with her Sony. It's supposed to be sad but it's just funny and then you feel bad for laughing at her. Big J can't help being so dorky. She hangs out with her boombox for Christ's sake. That is, until Jim Carry comes along. He becomes her supporter when she goes to comedy clubs to "perform", but she's not funny. Jim laughs anyway. Way too cheesy. It's so horrible that my brother and I try to get people to rent it, and we tell them that it's the funniest movie we've ever seen... 
 In the dusty California town of Hard Pan, Lucky is searching desperately for something to believe in, her Higher Power. Having lost her mother in a horrifying accident, Lucky is now raised by her "guardian" Brigitte, as her father was not up for the job. Lucky fears that Brigitte (Bree-JEET, not BRIDGE-it) is planning on abandoning her to return home to France. With her survival kit in tact, Lucky plans an escape of her own into the desert, hoping the town of Hard Pan comes to realize what they've lost.  There's so much I could say about this book because there's just so much that doesn't make sense. For instance, why would a woman like Brigitte ever agree to fly to America and raise a child that isn't hers, that's her ex-husband's? Why in a town of only 43 (well, actually 42) people are there AA meetings for every sort of addiction known to man? Things that are supposed to seem interesting and unique have a tendency to come off boring and often times, forced in this book. I just didn't find any of it as special or meaningful as the author would've liked me to.  My biggest problem with the book is that Patron's voice is too scattered. It's not clear who she's writing this for. Lucky is nine years old, the same age as the fifth graders I teach, however a lot of the subject matter discussed in this book would mean nothing to them. At times Patron tries to write and sound like a nine year old, but she has difficulty making this believable because Lucky doesn't think and talk like a normal nine year old. It seemed to me that Patron was trying too hard to write how a child would write and this effort didn't carry evenly throughout the book. To be quite honest, it doesn't work and I think most children Lucky's age that pick up this book, will end up putting it down out of boredom.  There were a few things I didn't hate though. Lucky has a list of "good mother" qualities and "bad mother qualities". This list was adorably touching and heart wrenchingly sad at the same time. I lightly chuckled when Lucky, who wants badly to run away, can only think of places in Hard Pan to hide. She doesn't know how to actually "leave" Hard Pan and like the previous example, it's funny but somehow sad at the same time. Matt Phelan's subtle pencil drawings add a lot to the story as well. Cute as these scenes were, I just couldn't escape the fact that this book is flat out boring most of the way through.  Maybe I didn't read between the lines enough. Maybe I'm nit-picking. Maybe the things I just couldn't get over really aren't that important when telling the story. But don't we have the right to be a little nit-picky when we're talking about the Newbery Award winner? This is the book that is supposed to stand above all other children's books in a given year and I found it incredibly dull. I continue to be disappointed in the Newbery Honor and Medal books year in and year out. They've lost touch with who these books are supposed to be written for and most of the time, I'm left scratching my head.  Now let's get this straight, I don't like to write negative reviews. I don't get a thrill out of tearing down someone else's hard work. However, I happen to believe that a bad or negative review, is better than no review. It's in all fairness to the author, Susan Patron, that I write this, whether she or anyone else cares to read it or not. I guess I wouldn't have disliked this book as much as I did if it wouldn't have won the Newbery, but when a title has that shiny medal gracing its cover, it better darn well live up to the hype. Sorry folks, this one didn't 
 just to make the plot work.  Not very realistic.  If you want a realist cop character, try Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch. 
 While parts of this book were very thought-provoking, too many details were either left out or skimmed over to allow this book to stand alone.  For example, the formula the author supplies to calculate the eccentricity  of a simplex couldn't possibly produce the results he gives in the  adjoining table; some are infinite, and the formula as he states is  specifically designed to avoid such results. If you're really interested in  catastophe theory or chaos theory, make sure you read this book where you  have other reference materials on hand 
 I read the book because of several people mentioning it. His thoughts may sound correct, but there is much lacking in authority and application. He claims to be a minister for the Lord's church. However, some of the comments he makes leads me to believe the church where he ministers has fallen into apostacy. Some of the things he suggests may have some spiritual backing and some things may look good on paper, but I doubt if the application would work. As an instance, he suggests there is no need for a weekly collection. He suggests that a collection is only necessary when there is a specific need. Couple this with the suggested "house church congregation" and the thought that some elders should be paid for their work, one asks, when it come time to pay the elders, from where will the money come? I only hope those who read this book will continue to look for restoring the church according to the Bible 
 I found this book not very helpful at all. There is general information but if you are looking for insights into treatment, they aren't here. Writer is anti-RAI which is fine if your symptons aren't very severe but if they are, this book won't help 
 These poems might as well have been the dictated sounds of gas bubbles coming up through the innards of a body dragged out of a lake. Rich is bitter, stale like old medical encyclopedias uprooted from their post in grandma's attic. If that's what you're into, have at it. Me, I'm not into mothball verse. 
 This book is terrible.  It tells a lot of guys to do things that every dating guru ever tells you to avoid.  I have a hard time believing that the authors are that successful with women.  Don't buy this under any circumstances, unless you want a friend to be extremely unsuccessful with women, then buy him this 
 When I frst saw this book into the store shelf I thought finally a great book about linux projects! Well... it didn't take much time to get back on my feet when I started reading it. I'm not saying it's a ripoff but it's to basic. I haven't learned much when what I  wanted more exactly was to learn much about cool stuff you can do with linux. And also the fact that it is complimentary to R.H. 9 makes it awkward because the point is to run the projects on old computers it would of make much more sense to pack in a small and fast distro that can run better on old computers than Red hat. Finally, don't hope to much about this book except from making your imagination work towards better project than they did. I would not consider every 13 projects in this book "projects", most of them are not projects they just packed them in to make more content! Enough said, don't wasted your money on this if you are at least the intermidiate linux user. Else look other much cooler stuff on the web or mayby some other book. But for the real newbie, it may be a good start... maby 
 Had to send this back as not compatible with my DVD player.  
 I have to agree with the readers that have stated this is not as good as her earlier works.  She seems to be losing her passion and style.  This book is very disjointed in places and I don't care for the personal references she throws in from time to time.  The story will be moving along somewhat smoothly then she out of nowhere interjects a personal statement.  It really takes away from the narrative.    Also don't like the ficticious names nor the recycling of old stories.  Ms. Rule is a much better author than this book would ever show 
 I sat down to read about this after hearing about it for years, and I want my week back. It only took that long because I had to push myself to finish it.  SPOILERS AHEAD: Meggie and Father Ralph (who everyone always seems to refer to as Ralph de Bricassart, even when they're talking to him) meet when he is twenty-six and Meggie is...ten. She speaks, acts and thinks like a 5-year-old, though. As the years go by, Father Ralph de Bricassart becomes sort of a father figure to little Meggie, and she develops a girlish crush on him. As Meggie is also "developing a very feminine figure," Ralph comes to love her in return but realizes that their love can never be. They discuss this in approximately fifteen thousand "Don't love me, my darling, for I love you but you know our love is forbidden and can never be" conversations throughout the book. Finally, after years of smothering their passion, they do it. In a really very boring scene that's all inner ruminating and blurred descriptions. And wouldn't ya know it, she gets pregnant. Ralph de Bricassart realizes (again) that their love can never be, and leaves. Meggie has his baby, and capers about gleefully that she's "stolen" something back from God. But wouldn't ya know it, the kid (who's as angelic and one-dimensional a boy I've ever encountered in literature) decides to be a priest. So she sends him to Father Ralph de Bricassart for training, who--get this--is so totally brain dead that IT NEVER ONCE OCCURS TO HIM THAT THIS MIGHT BE HIS CHILD!!!!!!! Apparently arithmetic is not a compulsory part of training for the priesthood; this guy also misses an incredibly broad hint from Meggie, when even the other priests figure it out. The Big Secret finally does come out (again in a very brief, anticlimactic scene) toward the end, but by then we're too busy skimming to really care.  All this leaves out a great many things--including immortal dialogue that makes Meggie sound perpetually ten years old ("I'll tell you something else about your roses, Ralph de Bricassart--they've got nasty, hooky thorns!"), endless, heavyhanded symbolism (ashes of roses, thorn birds...we get it! we get it!), some dumb subplot concerning a brother who is absent for 90% of the book, and one of the most unintentionally hilarious "tragic" scenes I've ever read (death by pig). Yet the Ralph-and-Meggie storyline really is the only major thing going on. And we never really get to see what it is that draws these two people together. I was expecting other subplots and development of other characters, and this never really happened. Many of the other relationships were sketchy and/or very confusing: Meggie's cruel judgment of her daughter Justine as a "monster" and a "b* tch," for example, seemed to have no basis. The last third or so involves Meggie making peace with her mother and daughter, and it just doesn't matter. The quick "the end" wrap-up would have been an even greater letdown if I'd still cared by that point. Even the most developed characters are flat and lifeless, and thoroughly unlikable. Scarlett O'Hara was selfish, but she was fun; these people are selfish and boring. Sickly-sweet quasi-romantic trash. 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 a guy begins to shrink (wll, there is a story behind it, but that's what he does). and......he continues to do so. in the end he must face a spider which think he's yummy. one little fight for one little man. the book is just as good as it sounds. things that happen in this book has at tendency to be dull 
 I purchased a copy of this book before reading the reviews - it was so bad I thought I'd come here and see what others thought. I know Networking for Dummies implies that the absolute basics are par for the course but the "basics" stuff is really stale material for a recently written book. If one is a beginner, they should be treated to modern information & new advances in technology that make networking simpler & accessable to the "beginner".The cisco product info is weak, the Cisco site offering way more information on each and every product mentioned in this book. If you want a good Cisco book, my all time favorite is Cisco: A Beginner's Guide (It's a beginners guide but not for dummies !) To be fair, I have read quite a few networking guides and several beginners guides and may very well be beyond the beginner level so perhaps I'm expecting too much. However, I can't say I'm happy spending the money - the info is old, too basic, and often I was able to get better information on the cisco site. Oh well.. 
 This DVD was made after baby one more time exploded onto the scene. it contains no performances or music by britney, and only has a few pictures of her. It's just a bunch of interviews with people from her hometown in louisianna...all of which have hair straight out of the 80s and don't work well in front of cameras. It's been recorded on a home video camcorder obviously.  my advice is to skip this...save your money, it's a snoozefest. Even if you area  huge britney fan, you'll end up regretting buying this 
 This MAN does not understand estrogen at all. It is sad that so many women are apparently putting their health into his hands. The reason why so many women and good clinicians are avoiding products like Tri-est is because these products don't feed our bodies the necessary estrogens that our bodies actually produce from our ovaries. Giving women estriol and estrone just blocks our receptors from receiving the necessary and most important E2-estradiol. Our bodies will then metabolize the E2 into the others naturally. Research supports this aspect clearly. The other thing about this guy and his book is that he bounces everything he says off of premarin studies and does not keep the information flow consistent one way or another.  Most women getting on bio-identical hormones these days have never used premarin and want good research or clinical comparatives to support their choices with regards to bio-identicals. This book does not provide either good knowledge or research. Additionally, this book is quite disappointing for one that Amazon places so highly in their search engine.  Instead, I would recommend Wiley's book for the radical approach to understanding what it is we actually want to achieve with our bio-identicals, and Reiss's book for good information on how to monitor ourselves when using bio-identicals. However, Reiss, (another boy doctor) is also a proponent of Tri-est, probably because its just easier for him to prescribe.  Once our female clinicians have really worked out the bio-identicals that are working well for us, then we will all have great data to support our choices. In the meantime, avoid this book 
 I was very disappointed to discover that this book had a homosexual character. This is absolutely inappropriate for a young adult book, and unless a parent has read the reviews that mention it, said parent would have no clue as it sure isn't mentioned anywhere on the blurb in the book.  I usually am more aware of what my daughter is reading, but this time this particular book slipped under my radar.  She told me that it had a reference to a gay character, which I took to mean just a passing reference, but when I read the book, it was treated more seriously than I thought, even going so far as to have the two girls kiss.  It is inexcusable, both on Ms Pierce's part and on Scholastic's.  No matter what the author's personal beliefs, it is irresponsible to have this type of content without a warning to parents. I believe that as a parent, I'm the one responsible for what my children see and do, but it sure helps to have some type of information so I can make an informed decision.  Anise Hollingshea 
 I am so unhappy about buying this book.  I went on to check out Mr Young only to find some very interesting issues this man has had along with some of his co workers. I find it to be all about the Money , not that everyone isnt interested in money.  However there are much better books by pros that are serious and do not try to scare you into buying their oils.    Sorry,  once again  very upset about spending the amount of money on this book. 
 This book irritated me on many levels; not that the writing was poor or the plot weak. In fact, the plot, the premise, the writing were good--unfortunately the characters didn't pull it off or keep me interested because they were all kinda indifferent or unlikable.  I read somewhere the number one reason people keep reading a work of fiction--regardless of plot--is because they care about someone in the book.   In this book, I was hoping they would all drown by the end of the story...  
 I know these watches were inexpensive, but 2 right out of the box were broken and others broke very easily.  The clock functions well, but the straps fall apart easily.  
 Jesus, talk about the little girl crying "wolf." When I picked up this book, I expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with. What I got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption.   The book starts out promisingly, even if Preston surrenders freely to flowery prose. We're given the account of Charles Monet, one of the first documented cases of the Ebola virus. From there on, Preston gives a description of the virus, what it does, how it does it - the works. Then, he moves on to the Human Component, the cast of characters, so to speak, for the big story.  The big story is, alas, not so impressive. It's a case of an Ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause awful problems to come about, but nothing of the sort happens. Basically, people run around in bio-hazard gear, fret a lot, and monkeys die. In between, Preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about other cases of the Ebola virus, cases of people being infected, "crashing and bleeding out," cases that are a lot more interesting than a shipment of monkeys, unless you're a PETA type.  The worst thing about The Hot Zone is just how self-indulgent Preston is. He starts to novelize his subjects a few chapters into the book, which is a noble idea, but not when they don't die at the end. Basically, he's trying to make you care about these people, and all for naught. And by the time that you're supposed to be truly concerned, you actually WANT them to die, because you're tired of hearing about him describe, in active detail, what they eat in the morning, what they do in the afternoon, and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night. When you're addressing a subject as fascinating as a Level 4 virus, why are you spending time talking about Nancy Jaax's hands and karate prowess? Moreover, when you've finally gotten to the monkeys, why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the wild? Does anyone really care?  I wish I could say that this book moved me in ways other than to reverse my peristalsis, but I can't. Preston's ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are tiresome and unnecessary; he had the chance to write a compact little thriller about an averted crisis of global proportions, but he instead chose to "get into the minds" of his subjects. And what a bore that became. There were only two redeeming aspects of this book: one was the description of the African, human Ebola victims, and the other was the description of the virus itself, although, again, both were sabotaged by Preston's inability to write.   If you want to know something about Ebola, go get An Idiot's Guide to Dangerous Diseases and Epidemics. If you're pining for the namby-pambiness of the Human Element, read The Hot Zone. Personally, I like to avoid rereading the Uncle Tom's Cabins of scientific accounting 
 First, despite what the socialist apologists tell you, Walter Rodney almost certainly was killed by a bomb he was holding in his lap while plotting to bust some co-conspirators out of prison.  Only afterwards did his fellow socialist party members concoct a story about exploding walkie-talkies.  Come on.  It exploded in his lap for goodness sake.  Mark Hoffman tried that defense and it didn't get him anywhere either.  Second, championing the cause of the poor, which Rodney admittedly did, is not the same as actually helping them, or even more important for HEUA, being a perceptive scholar.  Rodney's book is riddled with distortions, fallacies and unsubstantiated premises.  One glaring example.  Rodney pays practically zero attention to Mediterranean Africa.  For him, only sub-Saharan Africa is the "real" Africa.  Why?  Because his natural ethnic affinity for the area.  Nothing wrong with that, but then again, you shouldn't title your book "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa" but rather "How Europe Underdeveloped Sub-Saharan Africa." Rodney has engaged in thinly veiled racial rage and socialist dogma to rail against a bogeyman, a straw man, or almost anything other than the truth: Africa's problems arise from its residents, not from outside forces.  And spouting Marxist dogma isn't going to change that fact.  It was known 25 years ago; it's known a fortiori now 
 The Product itself feels solid enough. But that seems to be just an illusion. I tried getting Trigger Finger to work with Reason 3.0. I could get Reason to respond to inputs from the knobs and sliders. But the most important parts, the Trigger Finger's Touch pads, flatly refused to trigger anything, not even Reason's Redrum which this unit was supposed to work well with. After spending half a day trying to fix the problem using Egnima, the softwere that allows users to assign various MIDI functions to each of the control surfaces, I finally gave up and took this pruduct back for a refund. Maybe a seasoned MIDI user can get Trigger Finger to work as it should as the Egnima software is that, an Egnima. But, I have an old Yamaha PSR-410 MIDI compatible Keyboard manufactured well before Reason ever came into existence. It took control of Reason the moment I plugged it in and set it up in Reason's prefs.  So with that logged in may mental notes, I kind of expect something like the Trigger Finger to work right out of the box without any fuss or muss other than seting it up in Reason's prefs. To which it failed misserably at doing. So Trigger Finger gets one star out of me. Sorry M-Audio, better luck next time. 
 I was shocked when I saw the episodes of the second season. I would say the first season was one of the best things to be aired on TV ever. How come they just throw all that down the drain ? You really don't know what to think during the episodes. "Is it a comedy ? Oh, look at at satan and his friends having a chat.Am I supposed to laugh or amuse myself ? And now, is it a serious episode ?" Not to mention the lack of darkness so well conveyed by Frank Black in the 1st season. To sum up, the second season left a lot to be desired. The only thing I can do now is re-watch season one. 
 This book was a waste of time and money.  The author spends nearly 350 pages revealing things that are obvious to absolutely anyone.  He tell us how smiles usually mean happiness, crying usually means you're sad, and faces that look angry.....CONVEY ANGER!  The writing style is painful to read.  I assume the writer is in his late 70's but trying to be "hip and with it."  There are aweful jokes through out.  He also likes lists and bullets that outline painfully obvious body language rules to follow.  How do you tell if someone doesn't like how you're touching them?  Are they wincing and flinching?  Telling you to stop?  Crying?  It really goes like this.  I couldn't finish this book, you shouldn't start it 
 This is closest thing to an official Pretty Hate Machine remix album that you're going to find, unfortunately it only takes into account three songs from the album. This is useless for the most part and is only worth getting if you're a compulsive NIN-collector. The upside to this release is that it encompases what you get on the Down In It single and the Head Like A Hole Opal import single, so you don't have to waste the money on those by getting this. The remixes on this are horrible as far as creativity goes as compared to later remix albums around the Downward Spiral and The Fragile era remixes. This only exists because Trent Reznor wants your money so he can continue using it to go Jet-Skiing and wasting his time playing video games instead of working on a new album 
 The daughter of a prominent Boston doctor is dead, apparently from a botched abortion (which was illegal in the late 60's).  Dr. John Berry's friend, Art Lee, is in jail for the crime, which he says he didn't commit.  So, Dr. Berry sets out to prove his friend's innocence, and runs into cover-ups and lots of secrets.  But there are many doubts, such as was the girl really pregnant, and did Dr. Lee actually perform the surgery, and why is Dr. Berry so interested in finding the culprit?  For Michael Crichton's first novel, it's not bad, but nowhere near as good as some later ones.  The plot is marginally interesting, but it was hard to keep characters straight and the dialog didn't sound very natural.  Dr. Berry (who just takes the whole work week off to investigate) talks more like a cheesy "private eye" than a doctor.  Also annoying was the use of footnotes and endnotes to explain various medical terms and concepts - nice to know but annoying to look up 
 Nothing is clear in this book, it is not organized and not well writing. Filled with charts that are dispersed wherever and not easy to understand.  Frankly it is an advertising of the Investor Business Daily, IBD, please subscribe and you will make money, I lost my respect to Mr. O'Neils when he ended the book by the testimonials from Investors. He even wrote if you deal with a broker who didn't attend his class!! It is a worst investor. 
 I generally like Elmore Leonard, this is the twelfth book of his I've read, ranging from his Detroit crime capers, to his L.A.-set Chili Palmer stuff, to some of his Westerns. Other than the terrible "Be Cool", this is probably my least favorite of his books so far. Set in the years between the end of World War I and 1934, the story follows Carlos "Carl" Webster from boyhood to manhood as the son of a wealthy pecan farmer rises to became a hotshot U.S. Marshall. The story takes place in the dusty Midwest, mainly around Tulsa and Oklahoma City, as Carl faces off with various wanna-be desperados seeking to make a name for themselves.  Carl is a somewhat vain, cocky lawman, with a keen sense of what kind of quote will get him in the papers. His main foe is the son of a wealthy oil man, a no account young man who has everything he needs, but whose selfish nature and appetite for stirring things up leads him into Carl's path. Mixed into this are kinds of period details, from prohibition to Will Rogers shows to Klansmen vigilantes to "True Detective" writers to striking miners to mentions of various real-life bank robbers Pretty Boy Floyd, John Dillinger, and Bonnie and Clyde Barrow.   Despite all this background detail, the story itself failed to engage me. There are none of the clever twists and turns that characterize Leonard's best work. There's a good guy, a bad guy, and an inextricable outcome whose resolution is surprisingly undramatic. In fact, about halfway through the book I realized that the "real story" wasn't going to kick in -- I was in it! And unlike many Leonard books, the supporting cast of characters isn't particularly memorable. Even Leonard's trademark strong dialogue is mostly missing, subsumed by his attempt to stick to period speech. Ultimately, one gets the feeling that Leonard was most interested in capturing the vibe of the period, and perhaps didn't spend nearly the same amount of effort on the actual story. That said, the Depression and its effects are surprisingly absent from the story, given the time and place. All in all, unless you're really really into the whole '30s gangster thing, not worth the time. 
 Frankly, I'm still ticked at having wasted however many hours of my life it took to read YSKOV! (and does anybody else find the exclamation mark as pretentious as all get-out?)  The original hardcover was fascinating: I'd never seen a book in such a hurry to get started that the text began right on the cover.  This was a guy I could get to like.  Problem was, I bought the later paperback edition in an effort to save a few dollars.  If you're still curious, do yourself a favor and spring for the original hardcover--it's a good deal less bloated.  Were there brilliant pages/paragraphs?  Sure.  Too bad they were so interspersed with self-indulgent, pseudo-self-deprecating, unfunny filler as to nearly ruin the book.  I spent the first 100 pages or so enchanted and the last several hundred wishing he and his friend would just go home already 
 I mean, come on. A blind golfer? I thought it was an intruiging premise, too, until I tried to hit balls with my eyes closed. I'm a 2-handicapper, and I was completely hapless. So forgive me if my suspension of disbelief came crashing down.   That said, Cullen writes a pleasant, if completely farfetched tale, with likeable characters. However, I thought the best parts of the book had nothing to do with golf. The subplot involving the mentally ill father was actually more interesting, believable and touching, and the best part of the book was a short bit about Allegheny men and their pickup trucks.   
 How can someone trust an author who admits to cheating. Van Maanen writes, "In the academy, I helped cover for tardy classmates by concocting what I thought to be reasonable tales to tell superior officers. Several times I cheated on exams by passing my answer sheet around the back of the room (as I looked at others' answers sheets). These mostly mundane matters would hardly be worth mentioning were it not for the fact that they point to the difficulty, if not impossibility, of maintaining a clear cut and recognizable observational or participatory research role."   Having openly admitted to cheating in this instance, how could anything he writes be accepted as authentic? To me this is not a mundane matter, it goes to the heart of ethics. Van Maanen can write and tell a story, but how do we know his cheating isn't part of the plot 
 I had to read this book as part of a Masters-Level class on organizational management. I would offer it up for sale, but I intend to burn it when class is over.  Unless you want to read a book written by people who are SO MUCH BETTER THAN YOU ARE (he said with an extra helping of sarcasm), do yourself a favor and skip this book.  It a bunch of religous, self-righteous, fairy tale dogma.  Horrible, horrible book.  Will look nice when it's burnt to a crisp, however 
 If you are looking for a biography on Daphne Du Maurier, I would not recommend Haunted Heiress.  This is a rambling, free form work of literary criticism.  You would do better to check this book out from the library rather than paying the steep price.  You can learn more about the story of Du Maurier's life by doing a web search.    Also, if you are interested in visuals, there are none in Haunted Heiress, save for the cover. The text did conjure up some mental images of Ms. Auerbach, though... (narcissistic, cranky, and snobbish) but none of Daphne Du Maurier.   I did very much appreciate Ms. Auerbach's observations on Du Maurier's affinity for the way men can live their lives, with more freedom and flexibility.   I wish Ms. Auerbach would have done more research on Du Maurier's life and interwoven it with her pop-up thoughts on this book or that 
 I'm required to read this book for my English class nd if I had a choice I'd have thrown it away.  The characters are painfully dimensional.  There is hardly plot to speak of and what plot there is, is told out of order.  First Leila is eloping with Mason and telling Mah about it.  Then Mah is askibg her when she's getting married.  Then Leila is with her sister in New Yorl.  Then she's back in San Francisco.  To make it even worse, Ng never gives us a clue where or when the character is. this might be forgivible if the story was interesting and provided a reason. As it is, I'm glad I on;y paid 66 cents for it 
 If we were not to educate or cause attendion to the Holocaust, it would already have been forgotten and repeated again. This book only prove the myth of an author's begotten desire to fund his own interest. Most childern will never now the story of Uncle Remus but lets all hope they remember at least who Ann Frank was 
 I found this book to be very disappointing.  All this book basically is is interviews with doctors and patients in regards to different treatment alternatives.  If you are trying to TREAT fibromyalgia, i definitely do not recommend this book.  If you really want someones gripes and groans about fibromyalgia you can get that point of view FREE on line on Fibromyalgia web sites.  If you want alternative treatments options- try The Fibromyalgia Nutrition Guide, although this book is all about nutrition, it is very easy to us and very helpful- All us fibromyalgics know about homeopathic stuff already such as massage and Alternative Treatments just reiterates that and has patients and doctor points of view on Massage, Chiropractic care, Etc... 
 This CD is so boring. Sarah McLachlan has written / performed songs before that have set people alight with her passion, her intensity, her hurt, etc... these are very TIRED renditions of all-too-familiar Christmas songs. Sure, I can stomach a Kenny Rogers Christmas, for some reason it just seems to make sense. But Sarah McLachlan putting out a Christmas album seems to be nothing more than a combination of not having new material of her own and needing some more bucks. Excuse my frankness, but this album is very disappointing 
 This book has way too many stereotypes and contraditions. In the same sentence the author tells women to date for fun, and to make dating a science experiment. Some of her advice is good as a pep talk and to increase self confidence, but the steretypes of men and the games to play are so unnecessary. Be confident and be real. If you are sincerely having fun dating, you will attract the right guys. Dismiss the second half of this book 
 If, like myself, you have many DX and VST plug-ins installed on your system, then Audition 2.0 is definitely NOT the choice with you.  Somehow, the idiots who made this junk have made it completely incompatible with 3rd-party plugs such as Waves Diamond Bundle.  Oddly enough, this was not a problem in earlier editions of Audition, or its former incarnation, CoolEdit.  But now, Audition crashes irrevocably when trying to use many VST and DX plugs (except, of course, the ones made by Adobe themselves.)  Bottom line?  This software is crap.  Absolute crap.  If you're serious about audio production, go with Wavelab.  Heck, even free multitrack audio software like Kristal works better than this.  If, for some reason, you absolutely need Audition, then go with an earlier, more stable version, such as 1.5.  2.0 is about as useful as a football bat.   
 I had high hopes when I bought this book. After all, I fly Southwest whenever possible, because it's the most efficient, well-run airline with top notch employees. Although this book covers that ground, it does so in a hype-filled, "Kellner is great, Kellner is good, let us thank Kellner for our flight, amen" style sure to turn intelligent readers off.  Nobody's perfect. What were the mistakes? What could Southwest have done differently? When the book is nothing but accolades, you begin to wonder if it's all true or not.  I still love the airline, but this book was a waste 
 This movie was nowhere near the original, so should you wish to watch it, don't expect to be in stitches the whole time.  I honestly like it less and less each time I watch it, which to me is a mark of a bad movie.  It does have it's moments, hence the 2 stars (it is after all Bill and Ted, it HAS to have moments!).  My suggestion is rent/borrow it before purchasing it.  If you love it--buy it.  If not--don't.  
 ...I'm giving this a 1 star because Elder is simply not a Libertarian. He should stop masquerading because most of us Libertarians don't subscribe to most of his far-right rantings. Larry, for someone who is so focused on proving yourself to black America, you still haven't had the guts to refer to yourself as a black Conservativ 
 As a screenprinting teacher, I am always on the lookout for good screenprinting manuals to recommend to my students. Unfortunately, this is not one. It is an OK book if you know NOTHING about screenprinting and want to do it for a hobby to make some cards or do projects with your kids, but I do not recommend it for someone who is looking to get into screenprinting more seriously 
 I have read "Open House" and enjoyed it but this was very disappointing. Not only did I not identify with Betta - I actually disliked her, and like many other reviewers I found most of her actions completely implausible - a 55 year old woman renting a room in a house with two 20-year-olds for occasions when she was scared to sleep at home?  They must have been laughing at her behind her back!  There were so many storylines started that never went anywhere - for example the love story behind the letters written to the old lady during the war.  
 Why was this ever made? Just to make fans of the original mad? Rod Serling is rolling over in his grave. When I originally saw this in Burbank, CA, we were screaming and groaning at the screen 
 I think I made myself pretty clear with the title.  But, if further explanation is necessary: Theroux is exactly what he claims to abhor about tourists & travelers.  He's an egotistical, self-centered racist who has paddled aimlessly around the world in lieu of actually parenting the children he chose to have and be a husband to his original wife.  The only reason I kept reading is bc I was traveling to many of the places about which he wrote.  Additionally, I lived in HI and was interested in what he had to say about it.  Ultimately I was embarrassed that I had to share Oahu with him.  And if he mentioned one more time about his claim that scads of Japanese brides throwing themselves off hotel balconies...I mean really.  If you're looking for a fact based book about Oceania, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a self-indulgent POS about a man's traveling mid-life crisis, you can have my copy.  Thank God I only wasted a quarter on it 
 I've given all of the previous Gail McCarthy mysteries five stars.  It pains me to give this one only two, but that's what it deserves.  Usually I read these in one sitting, but by about page 70 I was wondering if I really wanted to finish it.  Interestingly, that's about the point where Gail asks herself if she was "losing the person she had been".  The answer is a resounding yes - in this book Gail is a self-absorbed one-dimensional, even boring, character.  In fact, Gail is not even the main character in the story - her pregnancy is.  It became a game as I read to see if there would be any pages that didn't mention the pregnancy.  There were a few, but not many. This is supposed to be a mystery, not chicklit!  I would imagine that many of Crum's readers are horsepeople who are starved for good adult horse-related fiction, especially of the Western variety.  They will be disappointed as the horses play a very marginal role; almost as if they were no longer part of Gail's life.  There is also very little mystery here - the "event" doesn't happen until nearly two-thirds of the way through and it's pretty clear whodunit.  The book is 90% pregnancy, 5% horses and 5% plot.   All that being said, given the fact that all of the rest of the books in this series are so good I really believe that this one is just a blip and the author is perfectly capable of pulling out of the slump.  She just needs to let Gail get back to the things she's best at - practicing equine veterinary medicine and solving mysteries 
 The only thing that comes through cleary in this book is the author's arrogance.  The reader will get a very good sense that Lang understands the material, but the reader will also get the sense that there must be a better book out there.  Even as a reference, this book is lacking.  The index is incomplete, and many important concepts are either poorly defined or the relevant equivalent definitions are not given.  Finally, the order in which the material is presented is haphazard at best.  This is truly a text only for those with a Ph.D. who work primarily in the field of Algebra 
 There is one thing I finally grasped upon watching 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', however.  I came to the realization that Hollywood has to remake movies now over and over and over again because the films that try to be unique ('The 40 Year Old Virgin') are so awful that studio heads need to go elsewhere for their ideas.  Of course, they're laughing all the way to the bank because the brain dead inside and outside of the continental United States will be for, and laugh at, anything.  This film is popular because Steve Carrell makes the same faces and has the same delivery that he did/does on 'The Office', and people just love those mannerisms (Ricky Gervals is better in the same role, by the way...but that's neither here nor there).   It certainly couldn't be because it's funny.  The general concept of a 40 year old virgin has promise.  That concept added with the most boiled down Middle School potty jokes is not.    That concept added to a girl who wants to take him home but is too drunk to drive, yet she does it anyway and runs into dozens of objects is not.    That concept added with a cross eyed Asian woman waxing his hairy chest while they show extreme close up's of Carrells large nose as he screams vulgarities into the lens is not.  That concept added with 60 year old Middle Eastern Salesmen using every sexual metaphor out loud is not.  You get the drift.  Maybe the boat left and I wasn't on the boat.  Maybe I'm not 12 years old anymore and am amused by jokes you used to hear outside at recess playing tether ball and eating Chocodiles.  If you like juvenile humor, watch something like 'Better Off Dead' or 'Caddyshack'.  Watch a movie that doesn't have to try so hard to write something vulgar to get a laugh.  Sincerely,  Bill Cosb 
 This book is more about his autobiography, and albiet amusing at times, isn't a real investing book. His other one: Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World is much better 
 The authors of this book touch on many subjects, giving very little detail in any of them.  The legal and accounting loopholes are very basic - and they keep referring you to other products and sites they've written/published - making this book one big commercial.  In one area, when talking about the benefits of real estate investment, the fail to even mention costs associated with using equity, cash flow, repairs, etc.  I am a new entrant to real estate investing, and would not recommend this book to anyone.  It is no different than the get rich quick schemes you see on tv/internet 
 This book was not enjoyed by either of my children.  It is so ridiculous that children in the age range for whom its written think its stupid, and the young ones who tolerate witless nonsense don't understand the meaning of the words.  I have an eleven year old and a four year old, both of which were bored by the second page.  The word search within words is a great concept, but I expected there to be some sense about it, so the kids could be entertained AND challenged by the text.  I am very disappointed 
 The very title for the book - "I Con" - despite its cleverness, should reveal the lack of any objectivity, or class for that matter, from the authors, Jeffrey S. Young & William L. Simon. I could best describe this book as a shoddy pastiche of ambiguous-sounding facts, poor research, colored by a palpable disdain for [arguably the most interesting legend of our time] Steve Jobs.  What is really distasteful is that this antipathy of the authors towards Steve Jobs, seems 'personal'; which, in a democratic sense, may be alright i guess, [but only] UNTIL facts begin to wear thin, and the research seems doctored, leaving the rants sounding hollow, unsavory and shrill. And the facts aren't well-strung together either!  From the very opening description in the book, which overdramatizes and harps on about the return of a "reformed" Steve Jobs, to Apple in 1997 (as though the most unfathomably impossible phenomenon in the history of humankind had occurred), to the careful selection of maliciously undertoned quotations, and quite often blatant slanders about Jobs, the book appears to be a collation of 'hate diaries' maintained by two wannabe authors, whose sole purpose in writing this book seems to be to fuel an anti-Steve sentiment among its readers!  If you happen to be one of those people, who finds some twisted pleasure in those idle conversations that involve scandalmongering [especially Steve Jobs], then this book should provide ample fuel for your negative energy 
 The central problem in this novel is that a main character can only be too desperate before one begins to despise them.  
 John Dean is older version of Joe Wilson.  Media hacks who will do or say anything if it will get them invited to the next Washington Post cocktail party.  It is just so hard to take this guy seriously.  He is not a serious thinker, his book is laced with presumptions and ethics projections to the point that it sounds like a conservative wrote it trying to make fun of a liberal 
 Very poor book, realy a waste of time. The review below said it all 
 This book started off slow with the formation of the Hawaiian islands and just continued from there.  The second chapter was more insightful and interesting but it seemed to drag.  Several pages could have been cut or edited out.  It would have been better if this book moved through the years a little more swiftly, than dragging to each persons life.  It was very difficult to finish and this is one book I will not re-read again.  It was about as interesting as a school text book, without a teacher to bring out the lesson 
 Not a bad beach read but nothing in this story is unexpected. I didn't really connect with the main characters. I was interested by the description in the supernatural aspects (the lights) it seemed like a mystery/love story that may have been unique but instead was a way too predictable love story. 
 Yet again another boring book written with all the flair and emotional insight of the list of ingredients on the back of a shampoo bottle. I was not titilated or enlightened by this characters constant sexual confusion. I WAS IRRITATED AND DISGUSTED!!! When did V. C. Andrews turn into an after school special!?! I guess when she became a franchise! This is the only book of "hers" in the past 15 years that I have not purchased (HINT, HINT). Way back at End of the Rainbow I thought it couldn't get any worse. Sadly it has. I will not be purchasing any more of these books in the future. 
 I bought a new grill and wanted to make sure it was used properly. I don't like it when small pieces of food fall through, especially on gas grills, so I bought this. Well, on first use it stained so bad, despite my priming it, and worse, it warped. Hey, I can still use it. But it's kinda like wearing soiled clothes... won't feel as good 
 I wrote an Amazon review of "A Brother's Journey" in which I called the book emotionally accurate and even a "shining achievement". It was. This book on the other hand is by far the most poorly written of all the Pelzer brothers books. Richard wrote this book using diaries he kept during the years he was a drug addict. Did he copy passages verbatim from his drug diaries? I'm guessing he did because he was under pressure from Time-Warner to get this money maker on the road. I hate to say anything bad about one of these boys and I do believe their story but this book is horrifically overpriced for under 200 pages. It costs more than a paper back copy of My Story that contains all three of David's books. The reason I suggest he copied passages verbatim from the drug diaries is that this is truly one of the most poorly written books I've ever read and this is surprising because I thought "A Brother's Jorney" was well written. This book on the other hand is just incredibly rambling, vague, repetitious and disjointed. There is really not much to it. R.Pelzer gets involved with drugs. His mother can't bash him cause he's six foot tall but she continues her emotional abuse. Pelzer befriends some nice people and hides his drug abuse from them. The rest of the 200 pages is endless vauge agonised rambling about how bad he felt about hiding drug abuse from the nice people. There is really not much more to the book than that. Two stars instead of one for one evocative description of a drug trip and because I feel bad for him. First he was exploited by his mother and now it's his editor and publishers. A Brother's Journey showed he had potential as a writer. Then he got forced in to tossing out this garbage. No one bothered to edit this book. They knew people would rush out to buy it and so will you, despite this review. But you'd be better off spending your money on "The Priviledge of Youth. The only truly uplifting Pelzer book is "A Man Named Dave. 
 OK, this obscure slasher seems promising... good premise, attractive and interesting cast with a few known names, decent budget and effects, a sense of humour and witty, bitchy dialogue. I mean, you'd think a horror flick about competing for cheerleader queen would be a can't miss, no? So where did Cheerleader Camp go astray? In two major areas... pacing and body count. Nothing ever really happens until the ending, and after all the build up, most of the murders occur offscreen! So, basically, there's no payoff. What a waste of a great set-up an an eager, game cast. Don't buy, rent 
 Sadly this second book left me unsatisfied. For one, Wouk's misgivings in the first book were well exaggerated in the second. Of course, once one has read through the first book, its hard to stop. Yet, by the end of War and Remembrance I was thoroughly sick and annoyed by Wouk's characters. It's hard to relate to super humans, who constantly do super human feats. Most of the characters in the book come from superior stock, graduate from the top universities, have extremely good looks, and seem to harbour traits that make superman look normal and mundane.  I guess after spending endless hours reading the book I am somewhat frustrated. Perhaps you will be like me, and by the second book without pausing. But, for the sake of saving some time, I recommend you consider parting with the characters in book one. Don't make the mistake of buying book two just because book one was so good.          
 I have this for a month now and I have issues.  The DVD's burned (at slow speeds)are skipping and freezing in my DVD players. The problem is a lot worse with DVD+/-RW. I have several burners (this is the most expensive) and this is the first time I have issues. I also tried different discs. The firmware on Lacie website was not updated since September 2006.  Stay away from this drive.  This is a repackaged Samsung SH-162L which costs $30. Is a rip off... I got stuck with it.. 
 This was the first Hard Case publication book that I have tried.  It won't be the last, but I was hardly impressed with King's story.    I don't so much mind having a story with no ending (I got the point even without the author's afterword that was obviously meant to propitiate his regular readers who he correctly feared would be disappointed by this latest work), but couldn't King have given more of a mystery?  That is, after all, what is expected of a crime-mystery book.  I can't believe that I was asking too much.  Instead, I was treated to 178 pages of "Welcome to Maine!"   
 I thought these wipes would be a handy solution for the office or situations where I don't want to carry around a bottle and a microfiber cloth.  But contrary to what's promised on the package the wipes left big watermarks on lenses, which ended up dirtier than they started.  The wipes work okay on a computer screen, though

 I couldn't believe that I bought this crap. I didn't learn anything from this book. It has so little content. Most of the book is an appendix listing the stocks on the Nasdaq. This is most likely an attempt to make money from the day trading craze. I bought this because of the last few glowing recommendations but  they must have been paid to write it. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. There are better ones out there that provides better details on day trading 
 For almost 600 pagers the author examines a double crime in 1970 from every single angle and viewpoint. It becomes excruciatingly dull, especially when we are force-fed the red-tape police files (yet additional versions of the versions we have already read). A hackneyed opening plot line about dissatisfaction with ones own race and identity is disposed of early, but not replaced by anything of interest or usefulness to the story. Forget this one; Walters has other very fine mysteries for you 
 It's hard to believe I watched the same movie as everyone else here. This movie fails on every level. It isn't a good action movie, or a good silly movie, or a good comedy, or a good satire ... or much of anything but an endless parade of lame gags, terrible dialogue, weak characters, vapid plot, and so on. There isn't anything redeeming about God of Cookery. Don't be fooled into thinking you'll like it because you like Shaolin Soccer, Iron Chef, Rumble in the Bronx, Ong Bak, or almost any other far-superior show or movie to which it might be compared. God of Cookery is just painful, feeble, and empty 
 I have both "Five in a Row" (for older kids) and "Before Five in a Row", which is designed for younger kids ages 2-4. While "Five in a Row" is not bad, "Before Five in a Row" is not worth it. Many of the children's books (at least 7 or 8) are out of print and a few are nearly impossible to obtain, even at our public library.  As others have pointed out, the suggested activities are mostly common-sense and rather unimaginative anyway. Also, the "Five in a Row" series has an evangelical Christian focus, which may not be appropriate for everyone. Some better alternatives for preschool children include "Ready for Reading" by Ashley Bishop and "Peak with Books" by Marjorie Nelsen. These books are non-sectarian and use classic children's books that are more readily available than the titles suggested in "Before Five in a Row. 
 Once again, Robertson slaps together a poorly sourced work championing the slaveholding South.  True to form, he neglects to mention the source of many of Jackson's maxims, Benjamin Franklin, in whose autobiography many of them can be found -- as any competent American historian would know 
 In response to Adam B.'s review of the book I would just like to say that Babette Cole is NOT a HE .  She is a SHE.  And it kind of negates all the points he makes about sexism and gender roles when he automatically assumes the author is a male.  A correction may want to be made to the review to he does not look like such an idiot.. 
 "This has been a story of an American soldier whose involvement in the making of the world's greatest dictionary was singular, astonishing, memorable and laudable - and yet at the same time wretchedly sad." - Prologue.  Well, that certainly could have been the story.  But what it was was a history of the dictionary (as in "the history of the horse") with W.C. Minor's contributions finally gotten to on page 116 or so.  Winchester, the author of several other books I'll avoid, also seems to suffer from the common malady - or unwillingness - of not knowing how to end a book.  So the last fifty pages sink the poor reader into...the history of insanity/dimentia/Alzeihmer's, whatever you want to call what Minor suffered.  Whereas I should have shed a tear when the main character - assuming it wasn't a dictionary - was laid to rest at age 85, I was fairly glad to see him go. 
 People, I love Covenant, they have become one of my favorite groups ever.  This is total tripe compared to everything else they have ever done.  It feels like they either gave up, or ran out of creativity.  If I was them I would be absolutely embarassed by this effort, because they are capable of soooo much more. The only track I like, and I really digit, is 20 Hz.  It is one of my favorite covenant tracks ever. Everything else? Garbage. Just being honest people, don't force yourself to like it just because it is Covenant 
 This type of stuff gets old fast.  Buy it suckers 
 Unlike most reviewers here, I really disliked this book.  The main reason is that the entire novel is a gimmick without any real substance.  There is no reason to tell such a dull story except for the fact that there is some mysterious story-within-a-story complexity.  The characters, especially the protagonist Iris, are bores.  Iris is like a 300 page wet blanket.  Most of the other characters are 1-dimensional cut outs.  Her sister Laura is the exception, but she got on my nerves too with her one-note quirkiness.  The story-within-a-story is more a gimmick than anything else.  The science-fiction meta-story within that story I thought was the most interesting part of the book, but it goes nowhere and its purpose is even more tenuous than its parent.  Finally, this is my second Atwood book, and I really dislike her writing style.  It reads as if she is trying too hard, and even the simplest situations feel forced.  I don't understand why everyone seems to like this book, but I would just suggest not to believe all the hype. 
 I really didn't like this book to say the least.  I didn't like the way it was written.  I didn't like the story line at all.  None of it made much of any sense and much of it seemed to contradict some basic Jedi guidelines.  I was looking forward to reading this I thought it would go more into the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin a few years after Episode 1.  I thought it might include some insight on Padawan training.  I couldn't have been more disappointed.  Overall it was a really stupid story that wasn't at all believable, even in the realm of the Star Wars universe.  Just bad.  It does have a couple relevant story lines that you might want to know if you plan on or do read all the Star Wars books published. I would only read this if you are one of those people, otherwise I would definitely recommend skipping this one 
 This book gets two stars for being well-written, having cute pictures, and being fun to read.  However, I am concerned about the content.  If you want to bring up your children to resist peer pressure, then this might not be a good choice. I'm sure the author didn't intend anything bad, but when the hippo finally goes along with the crowd to have some fun, some alarms go off in my head.   Clearly the hippo's struggle was with shyness, and the other animals certainly weren't doing anything "bad," but when my daughter encounters situations where others are having fun but she's struggling with her moral compass, I want her to have the strength to leave that situation and find some different friends who have their heads on straight.  When my daughter's a little older I'll ask her to help me write an alternate ending for this book, in which the hippo will find some real friends who respect his values and like him because of who he is, not because of what he does 
 Michael burned up an the doc blew up in Halloween 2, end of story, end of franchise. Money hungry producers and writers need to get a brain and think of something new. The mask is even horrible in this so called film. Rest in peace Mr Plesance, I hope God let you through the pearly gates after making such horrible sequels. Currently Rob Zombie is remaking the original Halloween, what a travisty. What next, Alice Cooper remaking Jaws or Ted Nugent remaking The Godfather. Leave classics alone 
 i call this and all the other rap music trash along with the rappers. anyone who calls this stuff music and likes it needs to get a life. once you heard 1 song you have heard them all.  
 Lahaye once again showed his weak eschatology and also shows he rehashes the poor "research" done by other bible "teachers".  While I know the pre tribulation rapture is proved in the bible, very few pre-tribulation "teachers" have studied for themselves and do not see what is clearly taught in the bible.  Instead of doing their own research, they rehash and regurgitate the poorly researched articles and books written by extremely poor researchers.  Lahaye is guilty of rehashing poor research taught by other "teachers".  Lahaye is also guilty of changing what the bible clearly teaches and has deceived millions.  One example of his false teaching is that someone can take the mark of the beast and still be saved and go to heaven.  This DOWNRIGHT LIE has deceived people into thinking that 'taking the mark' is 'no big deal'.  All his books show the tribulation is "no big deal" and people can go on living fairly normally while judgements are happening (seems he doesn't think antichrist will turn off cell phones, electricity, or internet if they refuse his mark)  I will restate that the bible clearly teaches a pretribulation rapture - only none of the 'POPULAR' bible "teachers" do their own research so they never publish the clear teachings of a pre tribulation rapture.  Lahaye has done more to deceive the world than most people do - and he will be rewarded severely for his works.  Remember - Jesus said if the world loves someone, they are not His - because the world will hate those that are His as they hate Him.  Popularity of ANY bible "teacher" should be suspect because of what Jesus said.  Lahaye is a false teacher teaching deception that closely mimics the truth (just enough to be believed by most 
 Uhhh, puh-lease. Okay, maybe a little kid who was like, 3 would like it, but older kids will find themselves snoring away. I had to read this book for school. It is about two unintelligent little kids who get a dog. They lose the dog. They are sad. They can't figure out who took the dog. The dog comes back. Whoop-dee-doo. End. Ya see? I could have written this book better. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK!! EVER!! 
 I hate to take the time to write this on here...but, as far as I am concerned Smooth Jazz is a sad excuse for music.  I am an avid jazz fan and musician.  Smooth jazz is a joke 
 While reading this book I found the details of some cases to be unbelievable.  Also, the "photographs" of the murderers and detectives all looked fuzzy and more like drawings.  I've read a lot of true crime and never heard of catching a murderer because he breathed his asthma medication on the murder victim's hair.  Or because they chemically deduced which cologne he wore. And who leaves their backdoor open when they know a violent Doberman Pinscher has been getting through their backyard fence? Sure, just let that dog on in. And whose place of employment has a record of all employee's blood "groups" (not their TYPES, just their GROUPS), when the employee doesn't even know HIMSELF what group he is?  Then I read the introduction, which I always skip, and found out this book is FICTION, not true crime as the cover announced and in which section it was in in the book store.  As FICTION, it's okay, (I prefer Agatha Christie), but I don't believe the forensic work in this book is even based on any fact. So read it for entertainment, but don't be so gullible as to believe any of it 
 The author wrote this to feel smarter than the reader.  It should have been called "Stroking my Ego" by Robert Kruse.  The concepts are lost in a sea of algorithms.  The sample code in the book is divided up so much that you can't read it.  There will be source code for one function of the program, then some text, then a couple of exercises, then some examples of bad code, then an example of better code, then more text, and then the next function.  No where do you find complete source code for one sample.  The first sample has less than 100 lines of code.  It starts on page 7 and goes to page 24.  In between there are 3 dummy functions and 6 exercises and countless lines of text.  The code is bad too.  In the first example in the book there are redefinitions that will cause errors in MSVC6.0.  And the examples are far out there.  You would think maybe start with an address book or something.  The first example is a game that each cell has to access eight neighboring cells.  To put it bluntly, I've read some good programming books, and this ain't one of them 
 Based on all the hype, I thought this book would change my life.  But it didn't.  In fact, I found it to be fairly disjointed and at times, contradictory.  There were too many perspectives and the story didn't really even have a cohesive plot.  This is the most overrated book I've read since The Da Vinci Code 
 It is a shame that the vesion is cropped not widescreen !!!The poetry of the movie is destroyed! 
 Only 38 pages into this book, I've had to put it down in sheer awe of how utterly inaccurate this book is.   From the questions it suggests you ask a prospective pediatrician to the AAP's "neutral" view on circumcision, this book is obviously written in a very biased undertone.   Thankfully, I got this from the library. All I have to do is return it and try and forget the bad, bad information it provided.   Keep looking 
 I have very mixed feelings about this book and can't say I enjoyed it all that much. I love the story of Sappho, what little is known of it, and so I picked up this book expecting to see a historical fiction novel cut with realism, research, and certainly the unavoidable necessary lewdness of the celebrity of Lesbos. But monsters? Centaurs? I mean, the story of Sappho's life is not the story of The Odyssey and for the life of me I don't understand why  author Erica Jong decided to give her readers a combination of Greek heroine and Clash of the Titans.   Once I was able to get past the fantasy elements, I realized that I was not being pulled into the story on its own merits. There wasn't enough emotional dimension -- for all her travels, we're shown pretty landscapes and scary oceans but we don't see enough of a real character. I read Sappho's poems in college and the talented mind behind those words is NOT present in this book.   I'm not saying the book is without its good points. Jong has certainly done a lot of research and her enthusiasm is many times contagious. But I found the whole bit a little odd... like picking up a book about Cleopatra and seeing her encounter dragons, unicorns, and the goddess Isis. If Jong had written about Ariadne, this all might have worked. The blend of fantasy just didn't add up to a palatable meal for me 
 I unfortunaely am not like every other person who has read this book . I too am one of those "Hippie" moms (not the worst thing in the world to be called, but I am insulted nonetheless)- although there are a few cute anectdotes in this book that make me smile I can only say that is why I gave this book two stars instead of one.   The front cover lists this book as a "survival manual". As a mom of a two year old boy who has yet to sleep for a period of four hours or longer at night am at times desperate for a "survival manual".   Directly quoted from this book I read ... "Can't we do somethng to make their own bed or crib more appealing (like fill it with gummy bears and boxes of fruit punch)? Why must the entire family end up in tears? The answer to that is: I don't know. I have spent ten years of my life wrestling with very mixed success, with the different approaches to teaching my children to stay and sleep in their own beds, and it only seems to work when disappointment and tears are involved. But here's some good news: I have also discovered that crying never killed anyone."  ----I'm not joking page 183 it is in there.----  AGHHH! What?? What century is this woman livng in? Who cares about being "groovy mommy"?  To note also do not get this book for any factual informational whatsoever, you will be extremely disappointed. This book may I repeat "may" if your bored and have some free-time(ha!ha! cause as mommies with toddlers you have tons of that) give you a couple of giggles. Perosonally, I'd rather run after my screaching bare bottom toddler with a diaper.  If you are looking for a means to help your child through the most important years of his or her life, ideas on parenting techniques or for sound advice, find a book that was written based on concise factual information which involved some sort of research, not just on one mother's memory and experience.   ******    *******    *******    *******    ****** For a book on gentle sleep tactics and a great author read Elizabeth Pantley "The no cry sleep solution" you will get so many useful tips and so many ideas you'll be a wealth of educated researched information. 
 Renny Reynolds is a talented designer.  I own his first book published in 1992 by Viking Studio Books entitled "The Art of the Party, Design Ideas for Succesful Entertaining".  While browsing through Amazon, I discovered a more recent book by Mr. Reynolds published in March 2003 by Gibbs Smith in Salt Lake City.  Although the name was similar, the publisher and publication date as listed were different. Upon receiving the "new" book, I was surprised to find the EXACT same book published in 1992 with a new book jacket and fly pages.  What a disappointment.  The pictures and ideas are dated; if you want up to the minute new ideas, do not order this book.  I attended parties in the 90's that used these very themes.  Why order the new book when you can have the old one with dated ideas much cheaper.  
 I read exactly half the book and stopped.  Based on all the criticisms of the unlikely ending, that was a good decision.  As it is there went hours of my life I won't get back!  The book is silly and laughable.  The premise sounded great - but the book is bad.  Really bad 
 What a load of garbage.  Equating a camera with a gun and the act of photography with a violent crime, is so ridiculous it does not even deserve to be discussed.  She has no idea waht she is talking about 
 For a second edition the text, figures, and tables are riddled with errors, in some sections almost a mistake a page.  The text is too frequently interuppted by data, making it difficult to read 
 As a fan of Buth and his song contributions to the Flatlanders, I was disappointed to find many of the songs to be unsubtle, strident polemics against war  or the obstacles to peace.  The melodies were not memorable.  It is in sharp contrast to Neil Youngs most recent release dealing with the same topic.  
 I loathed this book. I despised it. While every eighth grade English teacher in the U.S. may hate that I say this, I'm only telling the truth. There are characters that are so cocky and reading about them made me want to gag. Tom Sawyer as a boy and as a character seemed both annoying as a real human, and unrealistic. Becky, too, was unbelievable. No young children such as those could possibly act like that, and besides, I don't truly believe a boy Tom's age would be so cool in a cave, and rescue his lady-love.  Tom Sawyer and I just didn't get along. It's just one of those things. I suffered through reading it, though perhaps someday I'll try again, and the experience will be better 
 I will not even bother you with story line. This is the worst book of JAK work. It was so boring that I had to skip a few pages and start reading and then skip more few pages. The characters, the plot and storyline was awful. It seems to drag more and more with each pages. And the mystery even seem stale.  Because of this book, I decided not to bought the final book of this series regardless if the third one is good or not.. For those of you who are the fans of JAK or even those who are just trying her first Mrs. Krentz work, I suggest you NOT to read this entire series. Just try her earlier works like Absolutely, Positively, Trust Me, etc.  To Mrs. Krentz, please write more quality books than the quantity ones.  
 This is the most horrible product I have ever bought  in my entire life so if you want a nice gun this is not it 
 This is my first Harlan Coben novel and though it was a page-turner at first it became improbable very quickly.  By the end of the novel it seemed as though the author needed to wrap it up but he had forgotten how many sub-plots he had created.  I was left confused and unsatisfied.  It was almost as if a few pages had been ripped out of the book and I never got a plausible answer as to how everything fit together.    It's so hard to find a good author nowadays! 
 First off, Kanye West is about as mediocre a rapper as it comes. He looks plain, sounds plain, and if it wasn't for the controversy that surrounds him, everyone would be like "Who Cares?" But while he sings about Jesus and lives like he is a prophet, there is no substance to him and his music. Lame beats, hypocritical lyrics, this is the core of what is wrong in secular music today. His interviews show him as arrogant, racist, and unlovable, but it is selling his music and that's what he cares about. So while his rapping voice is mediocre and his rhymes are abysmal and his life is lukewarm, he is sure to sell records galore and people will adore his hypocrisy (and their own hypocrisy). So let's be real for a second, because I am about to give you the best CD you will hear in years - it's a mixture of rap and rock, with (real!) beats, acoustic guitar, splashes of piano, and a voice that can sound like Chris Martin of Coldplay one second and then rap like LL Cool J the next...buy today Mat Kearney's "Nothing Left To Lose." The best CD of 2006 and without an ounce of hyprocrisy while being true to himself 
 Oleanna is about a twisted, vicious young woman's need to bring a man (and by extention, all men) down. John, played by William Macy, is a college professor. Carol, played by Debra Eisenstadt, is one of his students. When Carol seeks help for a failing grade, John goes out of his way to help her personally, on a one to one basis. Carol is more than a little irritating and John becomes more than a little irritated by her seeming inability to grasp the simplist concepts. Playing the good professor, John faults his pedantic self for her failure to understand the material. Days later, John is caught off guard when Carol maliciously levels the charge of sexual harrasment against him - just in time to destroy his bid for tenure. Her earlier need for help has been a set up. Carol has been keeping notes all along - cataloging any word or action she might turn against him. Carol's campaign against John is facilitated by what she refers to as "the group." That is to say, by the usual nest of ideological feminists on campus in which Carol has "found herself" and a place for her sexual neuroses. She comes fully armed with her feminist groupthink about sexual harrassment and rape. Her arguments against John rest on rejecting the evidence of one's own senses in favor of a left wing vocabulary thick with words like "patriarchal," "hegemonic," "classism," and an obvious hatred of men. The director, David Mamet, tests the audiences patience as Carol apes the usual post-modern jardon that would put into question our everyday intersubjective (common sense) consensus about the meaning of our everyday words and actions -- especially the everyday words and actions of men. For Carol and "the group,'" reality is always trapped between parentheses because it is always determined by power and those who have it. Men had it in the past. She and her group have it now. Her "reality" takes precedence over John's. Carol eventually trumps her charge of sexual harrassment with a charge of rape and John, bless his heart, loses his inhibitions about hitting a woman. All in all, this movie held my attention, made me needlessly anxious, and pissed me off just enough to want to write my take on it.      
 I don't think most people ask themselves, "I wonder how corn flakes were invented?"  It was hard to get excited about the documentary.  I mean, the Kellogg brothers were not Marilyn Monroe, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., or Pocahontas.  Still, this may be good for history fanatics and fans of camp. This documentary did not avoid Dr. Kellogg's anti-sex campaigns.  They mention his hatred of mastering the domain and advocacy of enemas, though they never mention the term klismatophilia. This documentary is lopsided, focusing on one brother far more than the other.  Like many Biography episodes, this one interviews a biographer and several living relatives of the subject.  I usually think documentaries that have actors dressed in period pieces recreating things are cheesy.  This documentary avoids that tactic, but it did move more slowly because of it.  Seeing one still photo after the next got boring. Many brilliant people make useful statements and stupid statements.  Sigmund Freud and Margaret Mead are other examples.  If you avoid throwing the baby out with the bath water, Dr. Kellogg was quite an interesting person and this documentary becomes worthwhile 
 After the 1700s, this play fell into obscurity. It was later revived in the mid 1900s. Its period of obscurity does not surprise me. Believe me, I am a champion for Shakespeare's underrated "Timon of Athens" and "Coriolanus." I honestly TRIED to like this play, but I was forced to concur with the great Isaac Asimov who said: "Though it ends happily and is therefore technically a comedy, it lacks a carefree fun and happiness of the previous comedies. it is, indeed, rather an unpleasant play..." Well, onto the play. We meet the widowed Countess, her son Bertram, and the elder Lafew. We learn that the king is ill and quite possibly terminal. Possibly, Helena's father could have cured the king, but alas, he is dead. The Countess gives Bertram some advice that is not so far from the advice Polonius gave Ophelia. (Though the bumbling Polonius ends up being easier to like!) Helena loves Bertram, but feels beneath him and contemplates virginity. One comical moment is when Parolles reveals that in a way, virginity is a form of vain self love. Later, Helena cures the king, and Helena asks for Bertram as a husband. Now this is where I have a problem. Bertram is made out to be a villain. But how can we possibly not sympathize with him? Maybe Helena deserves something for saving the king, but does she really have the right to impose marriage on someone who doesn't like her? Well, Bertram is forced to go through with the marriage, but he quickly decides to help Florence against Siena. Poor Parolles who knows this forced marriage was unethical is constantly made a subject of ridicule in this play. This is where I have another problem. Rather than the clever misunderstandings of "The Comedy of Errors," the clever marital confrontations and errors in "Midsummer Night's Dream," or the comical and clever passages from Jaques in "As You Like It," the comedy in "All's Well That Ends Well" is reduced to the lowest possible form. (Flat out ridicule! It is interesting that in the word ridicule, we have the letters for cruel, but I am digressing.) In one decent elemenet of comedy, Bertram makes it clear that he would rather go to war than lie with his wife. (And perhaps in time, Bertram can appeal to the king to release him from this marriage. It wouldn't be unheard of.) One interesting thing is that Bertram remains honorable in the sense that he does not 'ravish' Helena. He doesn't love her, and therefore will not engage in sex. It is rather repulsive on his mother's part how she fails to understand the situation. Even if she was on Helena's side, she might AT LEAST understand Bertram's frustration in that he did not consent to the marriage. (And possibly try to at least talk things over in hopes of coming to a peaceful solution.) But no. She just rants and raves. Later the Countess reads a letter from Helena stating that she will leave so Bertram can come home from the war. This throws Bertram's mother into yet another rage on Helena's behalf, and perhaps moves the reader into sympathy with Helena. THAT IS, UNTIL OUR GOOD OLD UNCLE ISAAC ASIMOV points out the hypocrisy of Helena: "Helena is not quite as unselfish as she is presenting herself to be. She does not go to the shrine at all but sneaks off to Florence in disguise as a pilgrim hoping that she may yet return her reluctant husband." Well, onward. In Florence, Helena meets with Diana (whom Bertram loves). And Helena thinks she can trick Bertram into making her pregnant. We then have the cruel practical joke on Parolles where he is blindfolded and threatened to reveal military secrets (to friendly forces of course) or else. Perhaps even Shakespeare felt bad over this scene as he has Parolles say: "Who can not be crushed with a plot?" (4.3.340). We also see Bertram try to win the affections of Diana. Diana of course feels nothing for Bertram. But again, the hypocrisy of the play is prevalent. If we accept the fact that Bertram should respect Diana's wishes that she doesn't love him, how do we account for the fact that Helena imposed an unwanted marriage on Bertram? But of course Diana consents to meet Bertram and of course it will really be Helena who meets him. But even tricking Bertram into getting her pregnant is not enough. Helena decides to throw a sympathy party for herself by spreading the word of her death back home. Now in "Much Ado About Nothing," Hero had a valid excuse for staging her death. She was humiliated and disgraced in front of several people for something she was totally innocent of. But Helena was the one who imposed an unwanted marriage on Bertram, and she still wants a sympathy party. One redeeming element of the play is that Lafew shows some sympathy for the disgraced Parolles and offers him a job. And of course, in the end Bertram feels bad over Helena's staged death and is happy to see her alive again. Helena may very well be the Britney Spears of Shakespeare's characters. 
 This is not a book to buy if you are searching for good, clean funny reading.  I bought this book for my husband for Father's Day.  I read some of it - more than enough to get a good idea of its bent - then passed it to my husband with an apology and another gift to outweigh this disastrous purchase.  After he checked the book out, we both agreed the proper place for it was the trash can.  If you want a decent and truly funny book to read or to give your husband for Father's Day next year, you need to look for another book.  
 I recently saw Danielle Steel interviewed and was impressed that she had raised 9 children, lost a son to suicide, and did so much humanitarian work.  I'm not a fan of this type of novel but thought I would give it a try since I was so impressed with her in the interview.  There were two things that drove me nuts about this book, the most annoying of which was her repetition of words and phrases, often right on the same page.  "He was going to ask Carole" and then in the next paragraph, "He had decided to ask Carole."  The second most annoying thing was all the cliches.  It isn't often that I roll my eyes while reading a book.  I also think she spends way too much time with her superficial descriptions of places and people and not enough time having them do things.  I like the way other authors develop their characters by showing us how they behave, react and what they say in different situations.  I think having a character kick a dog (3 words) tells you a whole lot more about them than 50 pages of superficial drivel, which this book is full of.  I think Danielle Steel is a remarkable woman, but as an author, at least of this particular book, I don't see the magic or talent I expected from a person who has been called, "the world's most popular author."  447 pages.  Two days.  That's time I could have used elsewhere, feeding the hungry or ministering to the poor or sick.  OK, probably just reading another book 
 They don't hold very much for my very heavy wetter. I'm switching to cloth anyway 
 I have read numerous books on Forex trading and this ranks amongst the worst. This is a sham and is designed in duping wannabees into partubg with their hard earned cash. The tools mentioned in this book are available free on many websites and the strategies are too simplistic (in a bad way) Good luck with implementing them but by the time you do, the event will have been and gone 
 HERE BE MONSTERS By Cameron Dokey (2000)  RATING:  2/5 Stakes  SETTING:  Season Three  CAST APPEARANCES:  Buffy, Xander, Willow, Angel, Giles, Cordelia, Oz, Joyce  MAJOR ORIGINAL CHARACTERS:  Big Mama/Zahalia Walker (Civil War vampire); Webster & Percy (Big Mama's vampire sons); Heidi Lindstrom (victim); Suz Tompkins (victim's friend); Nemesis (other-dimensional entity of judgment)  BACK-OF-THE-BOOK SUMMARY:  "Something icky is brewing, as usual, in Sunnydale.  This time it's in the form of two clean-cut, prep school-type boys.  Buffy's suspicious from the start--their fashion statement is so old it's dead, and it seems they have a slightly unnatural attachment to their mother.  But then, almost everything about these boys is unnatural--they're vampires.  Not ordinary vampires, either--they are descendants of a clan known for its ability to summon powerful occult forces.  And when the Slayer dusts this dynamic duo, she learns what you get when you mess with a vamp family tree.  Now it's up to Buffy to battle her personal demons--or risk endangering her own most cherished relation.  Because mama vamp has something in mind for Joyce. . . ."  REVIEW  Here Be Monsters starts out strong, with a creepy, unique depiction of two vampires dragging a helpless victim home to their "Mama".  Big Mama, wife of a Confederate civil war soldier, works hard to bring her two boys up "proper" as Southern gentlemen in a world of declining social values (a.k.a, present-day Sunnydale).  Cameron Dokey does a good job with making Big Mama come alive (so to speak) as an insanely over-protective mother, and the crazed fury that results when Buffy and Angel stake her two boys makes the first half of the novel an enjoyable read.  Unfortunately, things rapidly go down hill from there.  Big Mama rather predictably kidnaps Joyce, and then the story takes a real turn for the worse when a silly, wise-talking other-dimensional entity known only as Nemesis is invoked in order to test whether Buffy loves her mom more than Big Mama loved her kids.  The Trial has Buffy go through the standard mindgames (fighting her younger selves, having visions of friends being murdered) before fighting a giant spider.  A limp moral is the final touch on an altogether cheesy ending.  Dokey shows real potential in the early chapters of the book--the banter between Buffy and Angel is crisp and witty, the action is fast-paced and interesting, and there is a very strong interlude with Joyce putting pictures in a scrapbook while ruminating about her daughter's life.  The verdict of the Trial is clear, however: Here Be Monsters is a Buffy book best avoided.  Jhaeman's Buffy Reviews:  http://www.geocities.com/jhaeman (c) 2004, Jeremy Patrick-Justic 
 A book I was looking forward to, but was very disappointed by. The theoretical parts are ok, but it is nothing you can't find online. The real meat for me was the example code. And oh boy, is it terrible. The chapter on J2ME (the most important one) has two code examples that the author claims are working.  These examples won't start, they won't even compile! They are half finished programs written by a Java amateur. I can only hope it is not the author himself, because if it is it casts considerable doubt on the rest of the book.  I find it amazing that the publishing company includes this in a published book, they really must have rushed it out. Even more shamefully is the fact that this code is available to download online unchanged at the book site. No errata at all 
 Oh, no. I can't believe I wasted my time reading this.  I want to throw up. NO, No, no.  At the beginning the storyline seemed interesting, but toward the end it just got worse and worse until I wasn't really sure what was going on. Ugh. Oh, well. 
 Author doesn't have anything in this book which not already available free of cost on the internet.  It was a total waste of my time and money procuring and reading this book.  May be useful to people who can't search items on their own online. Admire the market who knew how to title useless books like these! 
 I have enjoyed many of Anne Tyler's books, particularly, "Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant," "Breathing Lessons" and "Back When We Were Grownups".  "Saint Maybe" was a huge disappointment.  The plot and characters were mediocre at best, and a bizarre religion, The Church of the Second Chance, played a major part in the story. By the end of the book, it had completely taken over.  The Church of the Second Chance fell somewhere between a strict religion and a cult.  Yes, Ian Bedloe was close to a saint for looking after three children for the best part of his life, but why the book was named, "Saint Maybe" is still a mystery to me.  One of the children in Ian's care made reference to Ian as perhaps being "Saint Maybe," but who the heck is Saint Maybe??  The closest I could come up with is "MAYBE you will finish the book... and MAYBE you won't! 
 Wretched little ditties by Cutesy-Pie Paulie, puffed up by a competent arranger into a bloated mess.   McCartney may be the most overrated musician of all time 
 Why?  Why waste your time and money on producing crap?  Sony execs must be out of their minds. The Ghostbuster fans have been waiting years, and writing countless petitions to get the episodes on DVD, and this is what they come up with?  No. Give us season DVDs. Give us a 140 episode box set. Give us something. Not 4 non-sequential episodes on a disc that can hold MANY times that.  What a waste. This product gets 1 star because, apparently, you can't give it zero 
 This is the most disgusting book I have ever read. This not actually a textbook, but a bunch of statistical data. Authors even do not try to teach you, what they try is to make you familiar with techniques and tools used in the world. Yes, they do provide you with some simple examples, but do not teach you how to apply. They try to be concise, instead of being concise, they just ommit a lot of information and provide book references for you to search on your own.  If you want to get familiar with the most modern financial tools, you can buy it, but if your goal is to learn, get a profound understanding of concepts, train yourself, then look for another option.  The authors, from my point of view, just scholars, who do know a lot, but unfortunately, cannot teach and explain.  The book lacks exercises. There are some, but do not pretend to master swaps or hedging doing them. Book is just a statistical summary on current situation in financial markets, some theories, which of little value for a real job and that is all.  Do not pay for it, unless you are Warren Buffet. :)) 
 The blurb writers and reviewers of this book must have been compensated because never have I been so disappointed in the advance word regarding a novel. Yes, the writing is poetic, but the story is aimless and the characters not defined.  In quantity and quality this is a very thin book 
 I've been following David Torn for quite some time, but this is by far the worst album he's ever done. This was a waste of time, money, and effort.  What we have here are no compositions, no melodies, no harmony, and no rhythm. Why would a great guitarist like Torn release such crap? I have no idea.  If you want to hear a great new album by a jazz guitarist check out John Abercrombie's new album "The Third Quartet. 
 I watched this movie, not because I am into Ms. Milano, or her breasts, but because it was shot (sadly) at my high school--Shattuck-St. Mary's School in Faribault, MN. Doesn't say much for the school, or for the faculty who had bit parts in it. 
 I purchased this movie based upon the reviews and recommendations from others on Amazon.com who ( I assumed ) had watched it and liked it.  Not knowing the titles or directors of good erotica, I based my decision on those comments.  I have to say, and I'm usually NOT one to go off griping about things that don't deliver on their "advertised" qualities, but this was by far and without a doubt the WORST movie of ANY category I have ever seen.  I considered selling it on e-bay just to recover some of the cost, but I refuse to subject any poor unsuspecting man (or woman) to this garbage.  If you're looking for something to set the --mood-- this movie will NOT do it 
 The only confessions I heard (read) were that he had a great time with beautiful babes from around the world and that he was so cool because he traveled around the world, saw beautiful babes, drank coffee with a spoon, met lots of high ranking peoples who he dined and wined...oh and did he mention, he met a lot of beautiful babes. I guess this did lead to his divorce...so sad.  Oh and then he saw some poor people and something inside said, mommy...  Anyway John, you're the one making millions here and I'm just writing a review...and not getting paid. There, I confessed, I'm only doing this for the money. At any rate if you do write a sequel, and indeed, I think you should, would you mind including a couple of confessions having to do with some of the actions you were involved in that made you An Economic Hitman. Run-On. Thanks John    
 I had to spend the same amount of money fixing a tuning problem on the guitar and changing the string 
 This particular DVD edition of Nosferatu is an excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film's mood.  I'm not sure when this "score" was "written", although it is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film.  Nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the film.  With this edition's music, I got confused at times between what I saw and what I heard, and the whole thing became an unaffective joke after a while.  If you want an affective, edge-of-the-seat experience out of Nosferatu, I reccomend another edition.  
 This is a good product but...  Unfortunately webrrot feels no need to stand by its current marketing claims of:  Free Software Updates Spy Sweeper is continuously updated to provide you with the most advanced and effective spyware protection. As a Spy Sweeper customer, you receive these updates to our software absolutely FREE.   This is simply not the case they have now instituted an anual subscription update fee like the big boys. When I addressed this with them on the phone they suggested I take it up with the vendor "Fry's Electronics" they should have warned you.  Our issues are concern over the future marketing claims made by this manufacturer. They will also say you should have read the small print... We guess their interpritation of free and the rest of the world's is a little different. Who knows what they will decide in the future.  We are seriously disappointed in webroot 
 In this fine work of literature, Mr. Manovich illustrates that he can talk a lot about computers, even though he doesn't know anything about them.  He makes a plethora of fallacious statements, such as when he argues that all digital media must be discrete and contain only discrete objects, neglecting one can define a continuous geometry using discrete coefficients.  If his statment were true, there'd be no way to draw a circle in Adobe Illustrator, but I know I've done that before!  Read this book if you don't know what a computer is and won't mind misinformation presented to prove points that are stupid and worthless anyway 
 I enjoyed the tour through literature and philosophy and felt the author did a good job of outlining the nature of the problem.  Like other reviewers I was disappointed with the emphasis on Christianity in the end- with graphics of the tortures of hell and commentary about death being the greater leveler.  Until I got to that section I sustained the belief that Alain de Botton was writing with some neutrality.  His emphasis on Christianity, while ignoring other world faiths and spiritual beliefs have to offer, admits bias and disappoints greatly as the book comes to a close.  Certainly Buddhism, for example, would have much to say about status anxiety as well?  The first part of the book is much more rewarding to read.  By the end of the book when the author starts biasing his comments within an unexpected Christian framework, shattering my belief I was reading a neutral book with intellectual integrity, I was truly sorry I had recommended it to a friend 
 I had to continue to send back this product because it wouldn't work. I ended up going through 4 before I gave up entirely. This product is NOT reliable and I didn't even want to give it 1 star 
 "The Case for Israel" is written by the Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz. Politically, he could be described as a Cold War liberal. He supports gay rights, affirmative action and OJ Simpson, while opposing Cuba and Communism. And he supports Israel. Ironically, his support for Israel is as uncritical as the attitude of the CPUSA towards the Soviet Union. Dershowitz even defends house demolitions, and have proposed that entire Palestinian villages be destroyed in retaliation for suicide bombings. Despite protestations to the contrary, he also supports torture. Yet, Dershowitz is a member of Amnesty International!   "The Case for Israel" is a piece of badly edited and completely fanaticized pro-Israeli propaganda. It was obviously written in great haste, since it contains a number of factual errors and misspellings. For instance, the author seems to think that the Philippines are a Muslim nation, and calls the notorious Spartacist League "Spartacus League". In an earlier edition, he even claimed that the phrase "Turnspeak" comes from George Orwell. (Its Newspeak, of course.) While sloppy editing like this is amusing, the main theses of the book certainly are not. Here, I will concentrate on just two of them.   First, the question of collective punishment. Dershowitz argues that all, or most, Palestinians are guilty, since they sympathize with terrorist groups or actions. Thus, even punishment of civilians is justified. There is a "continuum of civilianity", says the author, since its not always easy to distinguish civilians from combatants among the Palestinians. They are all in on it, after all.   Of course, this bizzare line of argument works both ways. Most American Jews aid and abet Israel. Would that justify a bomb in a Brooklyn shopping mold? Most Israelis support the on-going attack on Lebanon. Does that justify bombing Haifa? And what about kibbutzniks at the Syrian border or settlers at the West Bank? They are heavily armed, and some of them are illegal, making the distinction between civilians and combatants on the Jewish side hard to draw. Indeed, Osama bin-Laden justified 9/11 in exactly the same way. The American people elected the politicians responsible for attacking Iraq and supporting Israel. Therefore, they must take collective responsibility for the death of Arab civilians. (See "Messages to the World" by Osama bin-Laden, available here at Amazon.com.)   Alan Dershowitz attempts to circumvent this by claiming that the Jews who are killed by Palestinian suicide bombings are "perfectly innocent" and are killed "regardless of their political views". But most Israelis dont vote for parties demanding immidiate withdrawal from the Occupied Territories, and today most support the attack on Lebanon. By Dershowitzian logic, they are therefore not "perfectly innocent". But the opposite is true as well: Dershowitz demagogically points out that some Israelis killed by suicide bombers were teenagers. Yet, he supports the massive ethnic cleansing of Germans by the Soviet Army during the last phase of World War Two, seeing this as suitable collective punishment. Of course, these actions affected teenagers as well, including teenage girls gang raped by Soviet soldiers... By implication, Dershowitz even seems to support the nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where many teenagers and kids died as well! (For the record: I support the Allies and my grandfather was a Communist partisan during the war. But that doesnt mean I have to accept Allied atrocities.)   The author of "The Case for Israel" also claims that there is a difference between intentionally killing civilians (like Hamas) and unintentionally killing them while bombing military targets (like the IDF). He also points out that Israel gives advance warning before it bombs civilian areas. Are there no bounds to the cynicism of this man? Perhaps Israel doesnt "want" to kill civilians (its bad PR, after all) but their two invasions of Lebanon clearly prove that they couldnt care less if civilians do get killed. They are, after all, all guilty, right? As for giving advance warning, the IRA gave advance warning before its attacks against civilian targets in Britain. Logically, Dershowitz should claim that the IRA and the British were morally equivalent, but of course he doesnt. Besides, there may be many reasons why civilians cant leave a targeted area even if given advance warning. Witness the hurricane Katrina in the US. Besides, why SHOULD they leave? Would American Jews "just leave" New York if given advance warning about another al-Qaeda attack? I guess so, but they would surely demand swift counter-action by Ms. Rice. And Im not talking UN resolutions.   So why do Alan Dershowitz have one standard for the Jews and a quite different one for the Arabs? This bring me to my second point. The reason, of course, is that he believes Palestine to be rightfully Jewish. And not just Palestine, but apparently Transjordan as well!   On what grounds? That Jews have an automatic right to Palestine, no matter what, is an idea that can only be "justified" religiously. But the author is a secularist. With the risk of drawing some fire, I dont belive there are any secular grounds for automatically granting the Jews Palestine, save one: the "right" or might of conquest. Before the Zionist colonization, Palestine was predominantly Arab, and had been Arab for around 1200 years. No amount of sophistry can change this fact, and Dershowitz tries some! That Jews had an independent kingdom in Palestine over 2000 years ago is irrelevant. By that logic, New York City should be given over to the Manahata Indians. Ironically, that would force its Jewish community to re-settle in Israel, something they havent been very keen on doing for the past 60 years. Presumably, Egypt should be given over to some descendant of Cleopatra, provided such could be found.   The case for Transjordan being Jewish is non-existent on secular grounds, pace Dershowitz, and flimsy even on religious grounds. Some Biblical passages suggest that everything from the Stream of Egypt to the Euphrates is rightfully Jewish. That would include both Transjordan and half of Iraq! Other Biblical passages suggest that "only" the northwestern part of Transjordan should be Jewish. But most limit the Promised Land to Palestine proper, leaving out the areas east of Jordan. The rabbinical commentary "Tevuos Haaretz" exclude both the Negev and Transjordan from Eretz Israel, but include Lebanon. "Kaftor VaFerach" also include the coast of Syria, but again, no Transjordan. The relevant maps can be found in the Stone edition of the Jewish Bible, available from this site.   So what is the real case for Israel? Frankly, the only case that could be made for it, is that Israel exists, have a powerful army, and simply wont go away. In a perfect world, Palestine would either be Arab, with the Jews forming their own state some place else, or Jews and Arabs would love each other, and hence create a bi-national state. But the Jews created their own state in Palestine, and they dont like Arabs. Welcome to the dog-eat-dog imperfect world. For pragmatic reasons of Realpolitik, compromises are called for. What the compromise must be is obvious: a two-state solution, with Israel withdrawing from the West Bank and Gaza strip, where a Palestinian state should be set up. The Palestinian refugees, unfortunately, cannot return, except perhaps to the Palestinian state. I agree with Prof. Alan Dershowitz on one point only: It was indeed a mistake for Arafat not to continue the negotiations at Camp David in 2000. However, I suspect that the road to Palestinian statehood would have been a rocky one even had he done so, since Israel would surely have demanded all kinds of "security guarantees" from such a state. Arafat isnt the only culprit here...   When I was more pro-Israeli, I wrote a more even-handed review of this book. Since then, I changed my mind. Mr. Dershowitz, I have read your book VERY CAREFULLY and only give it one star out of five!  
 We got this game free in a box of Corn Chex. We thought, Oh this will be fun since the show is cool. So we got home and played it and it was so annoying! There's just like a black screen before and after the question shows up and a black background. Just, don't buy it if you want to have any fun 
 Terrible sound, boring.... worst classical CD I have ever listed to. I highly recommend Mozart: Requiem 
 I though i was a big fan of postmodernism until I was told that this is one of the essential texts of the movement.  I enjoyed Waiting for Godot, but found this book to be completely unbearable.  I couldnt even get through the first of the three short novels in it.  There is no plot whatsoever, which is, of course, the point, but it doesnt make for an enjoyable read 
 What the Dormouse Said is an attempt to try and tell how the personal computer developed out of the 1960's counterculture. Sadly the author becomes so fixated on one person that he misses his chance to tell the great story. No author has yet to be able to capture the development of the personal computer but this book does have most of the salient elements. From the development of the ARPA net to the IBM 650 we can see the computer industry cloacae.  The need for the killer app or the internet is apparent but the attempts to link this all to one visionary who was not even involved in decision making or work on these projects is pitiful.  Doug Engelbert was not even around for the roll out of Xerox's computer or the Altair craze that ended with the distribution of Gates software.  This book gets two starts for the fact that it has all of the pieces there but loses the rest for being unable to connect them. Hopefully someone will finally tell this story someday.  
 It's not too difficult to understand how "Behold a Pale Horse" has become "the best selling underground book of all time"(according to a blurb on one pro-Cooper website)--after all, people want to(and do) believe in outlandish things. The problem with the late Bill Cooper's book is that it damages any serious attempt to examine the reasonable premise that every aspect of world affairs is controlled by a handful of wealthy, powerful men. Cooper believed this, Cooper was a nut...therefore it follows that everyone who agrees with the basic hypothesis is a nut, too. Rightly or wrongly, this is what people believe. (If you're looking for a serious treatment of this subject, albeit from the POV of someone who thought it was a good thing, take a gander at Carroll Quigley's monumental "Tragedy and Hope".) To all the "if you can't handle the truth, don't read this book!" reviewers who know little to nothing about Bill Cooper: I invite you to do a Google search on the man and acquaint yourselves with another truth, the real truth. Milton William Cooper was a certifiable headcase. Numerous former friends and acquaintances have described him as a hard-drinking, ill-tempered, violent man who was incredibly easy to fool. Cooper's contention that John F. Kennedy was killed by William Greer, the driver of his limo in Dallas, is of course well-known...but he also believed, and told audiences at his lectures, that the aliens on the Fox television show "Alien Nation" were real aliens. He wasn't kidding. Cooper would hear or read an outlandish tidbit of information, then take it--and repeat it!--as gospel. Fellow "fringe" writers and researchers like Bob Lazar shunned Cooper after he accused them of being government agents who were out to discredit him. There was, of course, no need for anyone else to discredit him: he took care of that himself. Nowhere in this rambling patchwork quilt of a book(mostly documents and articles from other sources, really, with a comment here and there by Cooper himself) is there a shred of proof to back up his extraordinary claims. Cooper made no attempt to verify the info he included, and it would have been impossible to do so in almost every instance, anyhow.   I'll go on record as saying that I believe the circumstances of Cooper's death were suspicious. I feel badly for the man because he came to such an ignoble end, and because his affection for his wife and daughter is so evident in the foreword to "Pale Horse". This was a human being with real feelings...but he was very, very disturbed. There are countless other books which examine this subject more rationally; so many that "Behold a Pale Horse" should NEVER become any conspiracy theorist's bible.     
 An alternate title for this book would be "Captain Underpants Aces Graduate School (Extra Bonus: 'Frickin' Gratuitous Pseudo-Swearwords on Every Page !)".  I purchased this book based on positive reviews that confused the distinction between lewd and stupid - lewd I can handle.  This book will be relished by life members of the fart & burp club who wish to obtain a graduate degree with the least effort. It largely ignores the concept or utility of graduate education.  Perhaps the book relfects the biases of the social sciences, but my grad students in the natural sciences would skin me alive if I assigned a book that squandered so many pages on the excessive trappings of extended adolescence while instructing them carefully in the art of dodging.  Its key redeaming features are a collection of excellent quotes and written caricatures of professors in the social sciences and humanities - the authors must know my dean 
 Are you kidding me?  This is nothing more than a VHS to DVD transfer and it looks awful.  It's a complete travesty.  'Extreme Prejudice' is one of the most underrated action flicks of the late eighties.  A wonderful homage to Peckinpah that deserves better treatment than this piece of garbage.  Oh, and the cover art sucks too 
 A false dichotomy has been built in the non-scientific Creationist camp, and with it is implicit the assumption that if Evolution - though a Fact of Science - could, nonetheless, be disproved, then (by default) this proves the existence of an almighty, omniscient, benevolent Creator. "But wait...!!"  They shout, "Who are you to say that the THEORY of Evolution is a fact of science?"  This question stems from an unfortunate, common misunderstanding of the word "theory".  "Theory" merely refers to a framework by which processes can be explained.  Thus, we have the uncontested Theory of Gravity and the Theory of Plate Tectonics.  Now - we all know gravity exists, and we should all be aware, at this stage, that Evolution does too.  Creationists (now re-marketing themselves as the more scientific Intelligent Design advocates) are growing exasperated by the Scientific Community's growing refusal to let their misinformation stand unchallenged.  Creationist pseudo-science has been soundly beaten and the answers to all supposed "Questions Darwinist's Would Rather Avoid" are available to anybody honestly seeking the truth rather than a convenient belief that will compliment their religious convictions.  Perhaps it is for this reason that Marvin Olasky reaches into the past and attempts to breath honour and nobility into the ignorance that brought us the Scope's Trial.  Here he presents the Prosecution as both the majority view and the underdog, victimized by a Liberal Media.  No amount of spin though, can put a positive light on the absurdly simple William Jennings Bryan ("associated prosecuting council") who, under cross-examination from Clarence Darrow, made the mystifying claim that "If God had wanted a sponge to think, a sponge could think."  He also asserted that humans are not mammals.  Bryan further displayed his utter stupidity by expressing his belief that the world couldn't possibly be older than five thousand years.  This Literalist Biblical interpretation puts Scope's Trial creationists not only at odds with Biology, but with History, Geology, Common Sense and Decency as well.  How could the media, liberal or otherwise, do anything other than laugh at this flagrant buffoonery?  The title of the book, Monkey Business is, itself, a rather annoying reminder of red-faced rants I've heard in which an indignant Creationist will express his disgust in the idea that Man was born of Monkey.  It's worth mentioning that this isn't, nor has it ever been, the claim of Darwinism.  Darwin never asserted that Man was spawned from Monkey, but rather that both species evolved from a common ancestry.  The fossil record now clearly indicates that this is correct.  Creationists like to claim that there are inexplicable breaks in the fossil record.  They are behind the times.  The gaps have since been filled, proving Evolution (again).  What makes Evolution worth fighting for?  Simply: Our understanding of Evolution determines our future progress.  Viruses grown immune to antibiotic treatment can not be understood outside of an evolutionary context.  Genetic diseases must be understood in an evolutionary context.  As acclaimed geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky said, "Nothing in Biology makes sense, except in the light of Evolution."  We all stand to lose if Evolution is marginalized in American schools. There are those who like to try and turn the tables with the claim that Science itself is the dogmatic religion and that the Intelligent Design advocates are merely trying to promote "open-mindedness".  This implies a mis-understanding of what Science actually is.  Science isn't an arbitrarily chosen belief system, like a religion, based on bias, superstition, fear and ignorance.  Science is a system by which we test, observe and conclude based only on reproducible experiments that are then subject to rigorous peer-review and validation.  If a piece of the puzzle doesn't fit, Science will not distort it to make it fit or omit its presence to pretend it doesn't exist.  Individuals who do this will be found out - by Science.  The Blurb for this book makes the astonishing assertion that modern creationists have nothing to be ashamed of. Let us think on this.  If it is not the believers of creationism that should bear their shame who, then, should?  Perhaps it is the propagators of pseudo-science - who have led people to believe that there is some type of debate in the Scientific Community when there is not - that should be ashamed.  And as for this book, Olasky should be ashamed.  Ashamed of his poor hack-work, ashamed of his plain ignorance, and ashamed of his own un-evolved mind that has left him far behind; somewhere in the Dark Ages 
 Not expect from this book an "encyclopedia", is more an "aproximation" to the Waffen-SS world. If you don't look for a detail information it may help you to know units, history, and the flow and ebbs of some personalities and units. A book for beguinners 
 This is an extremely disappointing copy of 3 great original movies.  Looks as if it was duplicated on poor dvd equipment from old, used VHS tapes.  No wonder it's hard to find out who made this.  I wouldn't want to take credit for it, either.  Hard to enjoy in this poor format. My delivery took place in February, 2006 
 This book is way too descriptive and boring.  Do not read i 
 The Koran is an invitation and a warning to all of mankind. Its outstanding global influence on 'believers' is to move them to tears from the beauty of its classical arabic language and its message of unification fairness and justice and above all a continual reminder that we all(let me know if you know any exceptions) have one final fate.Death.And a final return to Him(male or female sex not implied) who created us to try which of us  was best in piety good conduct and charity. In fact even a lack of kindness and concern for a passer by , an un-invited guest(irrespective of faith)is frowned upon by the Koran which  in fact demands generosity and hospitality to all. Only unreasonalbe oppression is encouraged to be resisted. No 'believer' condones acts of violence against innocent people of any race creed or colour. Only 'hypocrites'  masquerading as believers or in fact total disbeleivers masquerading under the name of 'believers' who representing a vanishingly tiny number in proportion to the 1.7 billion 'believers' on this planet actually condone such vulgar acts. So get it striaght - dont mix up the truth with falsehood - there is no secret of the Koran , on the contrary it is available everywhere  for  close scrutiny and at nearly all bookshops near you(unlike the book being reviewed). Those who think that the koran is a secret coded book on how to offend and assault your fellow man must have read the wrong book.The rapid rise over 1400 years of its message is a result of the heart-rending beauty and appeal to the human heart and not due to acts of violence ( as we know that does not work - look at the Christian crusades for instance). If you want to understand the real Koran then study the original book along with the history and the language. Dont bother reading the book which is being reviewed unless you want to hate your fellow man and humanity and dont respect the truth or more importantly if you neither respect or want to know or care about the truth 
 I bought this for Christmas and it worked for a little while in the house and we even made it to the pond where it took a spin on the water, as it is supposed to be able to. Well, after about 20 minutes the hand control gave out. It's no longer working and changing the batteries didn't help! Not the kind of present I want to give or have my kids receive! 
 A doctor warned me once that people weren't built for rapid mentally jumping from one thing to another and that hi-tech companies tended to use people up. Sennett's warning came quite late.  Sennett's findings seem well intended but not surprising at all to anyone who has worked in hi-tech. I suspect many other workers have noticed the consequences of the "new" capitalism. Similarly, there seems nothing wrong with trying to simplify what is happening by noting a few key characteristics and values. Sennett's observations on the exploitation of "teamwork", although familiar, are welcome. "Risk", "failure", "flexibility" , it all can become as manipulative as political speech about "liberty", "democracy" and "free markets".  However, the 176 pages seem like 20. Despite footnotes, Sennett seems to be writing as if he were the first observer of capitalism, entirely out of character for the profound author of  "The Hidden Injuries of Class:. The exact nature of the impact on character in this newer book seems largely unestablished. The efforts of unions, albeit sparse with hi-tech, goes unnoticed. The real consequences on real lives becomes an apparent gentlemenly philosophical exercise. How carefully he closes: "But I do know a regime which provides human beings no deep reasons to care about one another cannot long preserve its legitimacy". If there were, in this book, more sociological and less anecdotal support for such a claim, "The Corrosion of Character" might be worth your reading. As it is, you may well know it yourself.   Sennett does note at the end a "fear of the resurgence of unions". I didn't see that Sennett provided any pointers on where to seek help apart from an abstract appeal to community. Instead of watching your own character corrode, one possibility is seeking out a union on the Web (such as the Industrial Workers of the World).  This book was a big disappointment as I had read Sennett before and been quite impressed, so I may now have expected a lot. It may still be that for some readers this book will help identify for them what is troubling about their work and serve as a basis for discussion of work problems with others. 
 I read this book while doing research for my own book, CUSS CONTROL, the Complete Book on How to Curb your Cursing.  I give the editor credit for the compilation, but for what purpose?  Some of the expressions are clever,  some are funny, but most are not.  People who read this book looking for  new ways to express themselves should determine if they will come across as  amusing or just crass.  While I believe the basic word has some value,  promoting its use is a social disservice. The fact that the book has  received so many favorable reviews reflects the decline of civility and the  dumbing down of both our language and our concept of what is funny. My book  has an entire chapter on this word that is not only more amusing, but also  thought provoking 
 I like Ludacris. Don't get me wrong.  But this album is kinda annoying.  The blow it out yer ass song is hard to listen to and repetitive.  The splash waterfalls song is also really redudant, if you heard it on the radio as many times as I did, you might agree.  He just talks through too much of this album... instead of rapping.. the beats are kinda weak and repetitive.. there are 3 good songs on this one: Diamonds in the Back, We Got, and Eyebrows Down.  The rest of them are kinda annoying.  But like I said I DO like Luda.. just get red light district or word of mouf instead 
 This book is an excellent reference book for the serious ghost hunter / paranormal investigator. Provides good case histories as well as "ghost stories" that can be used as examples on investigations 
 This book is not based on sound acting principles.  It directs teachers to ask students to play emotions rather than objectives, thus breaking one of the cardinal rules of acting.  Once I saw this, I refused to read on and immediately returned the book.  It literally made me physically ill to read this book 
 If anyone is new to the Dark series by Christine Feehan, you absolutely need to READ DARK PRINCE FIRST.  Feehan introduces a new race of paranormal humans, and you need to know what about their Carpathian/vampire universe.  Also, what happens in this book deals directly with what happened in Dark Prince.  Dark Desire is not standalone.  After Dark Prince you can almost pick up any of the other books.  Dark Desire has very little romance in it, so if you want to see some romance, don't bother.  It's just one big pool of blood and torture.  People are strangled, stabbed, staked, shot, mangled, manacled, healed and then injured again, bitten, bled...it just doesn't stop!  Oh, and they have a lot of sex even whey they are still bleeding.  Whatever.  And you almost need a scorecard and a handy family tree to piece together who did what and which people are being healed and by whom, and who else is near death at any particular moment.  Not that I want to be babied through a book, but everything happens awfully fast. and it seems that way too much goes unsaid with these people, as if Feehan didn't bother to organize the nebulous mass in her head.  There are too many characters and too many sideplots.  Think of it as a cross between a gorefest and a soap opera.  Suffice it to say that everyone is okay in the end.  So now you can get this from the library and skim to the sideplots that you're interested in. (for me that's the Gergori subplot).  On the whole it's not a disaster, but NOT great in terms of a romance 
 Remodeling a Bathroom fails at delivering on its title subject...bathroom remodeling. The book's focus is so broad, so wide, as to spend little time talking about things specific to bathrooms, no more than about 10%-15%.  Every other trade skill required to remodel a bathroom gets only a little less coverage. But there are better, much more focused books available specific to framing, plumbing, drywall, electricity, tiling, and trim carpentry. The Taunton Press offers complete and thorough books on these subjects I fully recommend.  Most people will DIY part of the remodel work and subcontract out work they're uncomfortable with or feel unqualified to tackle. Planning the remodel and subcontracting out work get some mention in chapter 1, but far too little.   There's little information on building mud-set showers or shower pans, but considerable information on tiling that shower.   There are chapters devoted to framing, doors and moldings, drywalling, but no mention of removing or refinishing or installing a traditional steel/cast-iron bathtub.   Page 59 illustrates a solderless copper pipe joining system and describes its advantages; It pictures the required electro-hydraulic installation tool, but then goes on to same that this is a system for professional installation only. The same chapter purports to teach copper piping system design and soldering technique on page 56 to 58.   Most of Taunton's "Build Like A Pro" series are really good, but this one misses the mark 
 As most of the Revolution Studios movies, "The Wedding Planner" is not a conventional one. You won't find the classic leading lady with the classic leading guy in the classic romantic-and-predictable-as-usual story. And this stereotype-melting effort is probably what catches our attention. To see couples or situations you normally don't see due to social stereotypes and conventionalisms it is certainly a rather interesting exercise. Having said that, "The Wedding Planner" is also really fun movie to watch. Most characters are great (except perhaps Lopez' italian admirer who is plainly lame). And my other serious complaint is: what's with Matthew McConaughey's hair in this movie? It looks so dry and frizzy and so artifically colored! I think they could have afforded to give the leading guy a more stylish look. On the other hand, passing J. Lo as a italian gal is not very believable (I mean). But on the up and up, J. Lo's wardrobe and hairstyling are remarkably beautiful in this movie giving her a tidy, neat and classy look very distant from her usual flamboyant bombshell persona. Overall a nice entertaining light and funny romantic movie to watch. 
 From previous reviews, I got the idea that "Never come Morning" would be gritty, and a masterpiece.  Well, that's not the case.  It is quite gritty, with EVERYONE a crook, from a Polish barber who is also a pimp, from the one-eyed police detective.  The story follows Bruno, a thug who dreams of well..being the Great White Hope.  Of course, we know he's a thug, and will always be nothing but a thug.  Bruno and his thuggish friends talk in a Chicago dialect that grates on your nerves.  Algren is not Mark Twain, so it further alienates the reader when you want to hear English you can recognize.  I felt zero sypathy for Bruno's predicament, and I felt sick that Steffi would see anything in this character 
 "Four Brothers" is yet another nail in the coffin of John Singleton's increasingly moribund moviemaking career.  The director - who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty "Boyz n the Hood" - has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once-promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again.  The story, reeking of artificiality, features Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother.  When she is killed in a convenience store robbery, the quartet launches into action, seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced, through their investigation in the neighborhood, that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe.    The main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters.  By not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother (except for one embarrassingly bad Thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a first-year film student), we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith, rendering the boys' thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best.  The acting is uniformly flat, with the characters little more than wafer-thin stereotypes, and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and second-rate given the Singleton pedigree in this area.  The boys' running around from venue to venue in their Detroit neighborhood, brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother's killer, is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque.    With nary a single moment that rings believable or true, "Four Brothers" is by-the-book filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more. 
 Does anyone even care that the "Author" John Miller, formerly of ABC's 20/20 and then the head of counterterrorism for the LAPD, is currently the Assistant Director of Public Affairs for the FBI in the BUSH regime...I mean...Administration.  This book is Propaganda. Period 
 First, the review by Ed Cambell (above) is terribly unfair as he is listed in this book as assisting in the final product.  There are parts of the book where the chapter fails to address the "questions" that appear at the beginning of the chapter. So, some of it is incomplete. So, while the description of some chapters tell the reader what the chapter is about, you can finish the chapter and find that it did not live up to its description.  This is very odd.  Also, while the author has some very interesting insights, he interprets some lines of the palm is some fairly offbeat ways.  If you have been reading palms or have been reading a compendium of palmistry books, you will fine this book a little strange 
 Though I have only become acquainted with the Lovecraft universe/Cthulhu Mythos in the past year, and though I was greatly looking forward to delving into this collection when I discovered it, I really feel that this particular collection falls short.  Devotees to the mythos that enjoy any story with any mention of the Lovecraftian place-names, characters, or phenomena will no doubt enjoy this volume for trivia-compiling purposes, but I found the stories within to be mediocre at best and occasionally downright laughable.  These stories will most likely not be enjoyable to most readers.  The few bright spots (perhaps, less dim spots) include China Mieville's "Details", though even this seems to fall rather far from the mark set by his other work.  A large portion of the others are just silly or seem to depend entirely on the final single-line zinger for horrific affect.    I would strongly suggest that those new to Lovecraft, and in search of more of this type of literature, seek out volumes such as "Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos" or any of the fine works by Thomas Ligotti.  If you are determined to read this particular collection, please do not pay more than 3 dollars for it in a used bookstore 
 Purchased these to use while jogging to replace my broken Aiwa swoops. The sound quality is horrible. I can't stress it enough. It wouldn't even be worth it for 99 cents 
           Gene Kranz's experience from inside mission control is one that not many Americans experience for themselves. This riveting book expresses the problems that he had to encounter and overcome. Kranz was a major contributor to the success of the space flight operations and all of his accomplishments are revealed right in this book. Kranz's competitive edge to segue America's "space world" into the number one position and his daringness in the Mercury to Apollo missions not only helped unite Americans, instigating a feeling of national pride, but it also wired the world together to work in one common effort. Kranz is able to provide behind the scene information, sharing the myths and stories of the media about the men in the mission control and thus providing the reader with the true untwisted story.         Through this novel, Kranz takes us back to the primitive age of technology when there were no books previously written on the actual methodology of space flight. This book is truly enthralling for everyone, not just space buffs interested in the detail of flight control. The network of trust and driven scientists motivates the readers to read hours on end. The emotional conflict and skepticism provided by Kranz illustrates the intense life of these men. This book takes us behind the scenes of Apollo 13 and lays out all of the problems and obstacles that the controllers on the ground had to solve and overcome. By the end of the novel one can truly say that failure is not an option, especially not for Gene Kranz. 
 TOO BORING TO GO ANY FURTHER THAN THE FIRST SEVERAL CHAPTERS. I THUMBED THROUGH THE REST AND SAW IT WAS ALL THE SAME. NOT REALLY A PERSONAL CONFESSIONAL-SHE MENTIONS HER PROCEDURES VERY BRIEFLY. IT INSTEAD READS LIKE TEXTBOOK MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE ORIGINS OF PLASTIC SURGERY. IF YOUR ANYONE WHO HAS HAD, OR IS PLANNING TO HAVE ANY SURGERY OR INJECTIONS, SKIP THIS BOOK-UNLESS YOU WANT TO READ ABOUT SOLDIERS WHO WERE DISFIGURED AND MAMED DURING WAR SO PLASTIC SURGERY WAS BORN.

 I am glad to know it wasn't just me. I was really disappointed by this book. I have tried to read everyone of Cornwell's books and picked this one up based on past experience. It does not even come close to her usual skills. It may be that it was written for serialization in a magazine. It should not have been allowed out as a book. Her publishers did not do her a favor by letting this go out to the public. It is possible that Win and Sykes could become interesting characters in a well developed book; they were interesting in this book and I liked the setting in Cambridge, but it wasn't enough 
 It's just that simple.  There is NO credible clinical evidence that chelation therapists do anything for patients except lighten their bank accounts.  If any chelation therapist wants to sue me for writing this, BRING IT ON!  
 There are many Pilates teachers out there, but this particular book, "A Pilates' Primer," by Joseph Pilates is the one sure guideline for mastery of the practice 
 A marketing dream, no doubt, the European release of "Further Down the Spiral" differed in several tracks from the US release.  Largely, my review for the US release is relevant to this one, but there's four different tracks on here that weaken the overall quality of the record.  As a rule, the remixes are clever, inventive, and great at changing mood, at a sense of heightened tension to the material.  The best stuff from the US release is on here as well-- dark and moody retreads like "The Art of Self-Destruction, Part one" and "The Downward Spiral (the bottom)" and fantastic reinventions like the Rick Rubin "Piggy (nothing can stop me now)", but missing is a pile of great "Eraser" remixes, the "quiet" version of "Hurt", and a 'self-destruct' remix.  "Self Destruction, Part Three" sits in for part two, again by J.G. Thirwell, and is somewhat less interesting-- sounds like a single mix quite honestly, and the live version of "Hurt" in place of the quiet version is kind of a whatever substitution.  Neither of them is particularly intriguing or additive.  And the two Charlie Clouser remixes ("Heresy" and "Ruiner") I'm just not sure what to say about them.  Clouser turned them both into dance songs, nice beats and "Heresy" has some effective sample use, but neither piece is anything I really found worthwhile.  Bottom line on this one, stick with the US release unless you're a completionist 
  This is THE BEST SELLING Bible in America for good reason! Ease of comprehension, lovely modern English, pleasing packaging, and the best conservative scholarhip for both textual reconstruction and language translation.  Read I WAS A TEENAGE JEHOVAH'S WITNESS and JEHOVAH UNMASKED for two of the wildest rides ever!  
 McCall has a lot of perspective on racial issues. So much perspective, in fact that he understands how both whites AND blacks view each other. Whites think blacks are stupid, whites don't want to live around blacks (integration is just a pretense for giving blacks the boot)You'll get the basic idea after a couple chapters. There's no need to think for yourself when you've got someone as brilliant as McCall telling you how you think 
 I just read this short story and I didn't like it is just to hard to read and their is really nothing that makes you want to keep on reading this story.  It is verry (not my type).  I read better stories by better  authors.  A good author is Dean Koontz now he has good books and stories.   You would probably like Dean Koontz  more than this Edgar Allan.  Without  having to be confuse at any moment while your reading

You will have to pay shipping, but you are getting a great pair of headphones to replace the previous defective model. 
 Having read a few of Anne Tyler's books in the past, I was looking forward to reading her latest novel.  At best, I found the book to be wholly forgettable.  At worst, I found her bottom line premises, upon which the book is based, without much merit.  I say so with some personal insight.  I was born in America in 1944, the first in my family to be a native born American.  And yes, my parents spoke a "foreign" language at home, among themselves and with their friends and relatives.  I was schooled in the local public schools, and interacted with youngsters who came from all sorts of backgrounds.  This remained true as I went on to college, and then graduate school.  My family did not feel like it was outside of the American mainstream because they had their roots in Europe.  To the contrary, they felt blessed to be here, and never missed an opportunity to praise America and all it stood for.  While our parents spoke a concocted language to us (we called it Germglish), we fully understood their native tongue, while we (the children) only conversed in English (to them as well as to others). Our experience was not unique;  infact, most of the people we met came from similar homes and backgrounds.  Now, perhaps growing up in New York City is different from living in the Baltimore suburbs, but I don't really think so.  I think that the greatest thing about this country lies in the fact that ALL of us came from somewhere, either recently or once upon a time.  And while we may choose to interact with people who share similar backgrounds, I really can't imagine that most of us are embarassed that we are not the American stereotype...white, protestant, having ancestors who came over on the Mayflower.  For this reason, more than any other, I found the book to be based on faulty premises, and when the central feature of a book doesn't ring true, the whole book ends up being less than fulfilling. 
 This item is completely useless. I ordered it, installed it, connected it, tried to use it..............no feedback. Adjusted the connection...............no feedback. Tried to use it with a "learning piano" software which was specially designed for it..................nothing. Changed my control panel settings..................nothing. Maybe its just me! 
 Exiled Cubans in Miami up to 1987. This is real old stuff. I wonder why this book is still being published. Felt like a collection of shorter magazine--newspaper articles compiled to look like a real book. Many long, disjointed sentences. Could use an updating. There must be better books out there about this topic 
 I read this book in an earlier edition borrowed from a friend.  I ordered it with the intent of sharing it with people.  When I received my own copy from Amazon, I realized that to lend it out would seriously undermine my credibility.  Here's why: almost every page has a distracting typo, including the back cover.  Although the content of the book is arguably sound, the extensive typos in this printing compromise the message to the extent that the book is virtually useless.  In network marketing, where the all-important goal is to establish the legitimacy of the industry and raise the level of respect for the companies and people involved, a book which creates the opposite effect should be avoided.  
 I had to read this book for school. I thought I would love it, but it turns out I was WRONG. This book was mind numbing. It is drawn out and boring. I almost threw the book away and rented the movie. I should have. This books sucks. Don't waste your time reading it 
 A bit of context: I am an intermediate photographer recently introduced to digital SLR through the purchase of a Nikon D70.  I am well-versed in general photographic knowlege and the theories behind color management and light in the context of digital photography.  I purchased this book hoping that it would help me to understand enough about color management to at least start asking the right questions about how to apply color management to my setup.  I became so frustrated with it that I've had to stop reading it several times just to collect myself.  In no particular order, the book is flawed in the following ways:  * It is not well written.  I stumble over poor writing more than the average reader, but this book simply had too much akward prose and was overly conversational.  Unfortunately, this poor writing was more than just a distraction: important points were frequently lost to unclear writing. * Full of marginally useful examples.  The author provides step-by-step instructions for numerous software programs (and a few pieces of hardware too) that are completely useless for those of us who don't have the software (or hardware). * Many "tips" revealed to be unimportant.  One of my biggest pet peeves was that on several occassions the author provided lengthy explantions of processes, features, or concepts, only to wrap up his discussion with "but all of this isn't really important, so you don't need to worry about it." * Poor organization.  The book could have benefited significantly from a reorganization around those tasks that the average reader was likely to try to do.  I found myself finishing the book still unclear where to even start thinking about my color management setup, and with basic questions still unanswered. * Meaningless examples.  The author provides (some very striking) images in support of his ideas, but many are not directly related his points (single images with captions like "Professional photographer X uses color management to make sure that the colors he sees on his screen are the same as those on the final print")  I give it two stars instead of one because there is some useful information in the text -- it's just incredibly hard to find amid all of the clutter 
 We never got to see the movie as both copies of this DVD that we ordered had problems and would not play on any DVD player we owned.  Amazon.com was very kind in crediting us for both bad copies and even gave us a coupon for a discount on a future purchase for our inconvenience.  (Great customer service!)  You might like to know that we found a copy of this movie at a local retailer and it would not work either.  Maybe it's a manufacturing defect.    Thanks for asking.  It's nice to be able to voice an opinion.  
 the album - which was her follow up to the (someday will be thought of as a classic album) "Single White female." is not anywhere close as what she could be capable of. and i can prove it too. i reccomend "The Metroplitan Hotel" it is magnificant and on of my favorite albums of the year. i found this album not very good at all. and the songs i did like are on her "20th Century Masters" album.  i feel with this album she sold out. she made this album either to capture the same success she got with SWF or she catered to the country music industry by letting her try to cement herself as a rival to Shania Twain. (Which i always felt they were trying to do.) the album sounded too phony, the music itself was by most part mechanical and i did not feel she was trying to get me to believe in her.i got the feeling she was trying to just be sexy in her presentations both physically and metaphorically - and she dosen't need to do that. she already is without trying to force it on me. and that is the feeling i got - i feel this album was too commercial anyway like she and her label needed the quick buck.  if you want to get it to hear her try to compete with Shania Twain or you want to look at her pictures within the case, then this album is for you. but i don't think this is near her best effort. she said nothing new to me and everything she did say sound like Shania should be saying it. it sound phony and cartoonish and very commercial. like i said there are thing i do like about it. but i can get just thoes thing from her Masters album.  she a much better talent than this album makes her out to be. 
 My primary complaint with this book was its predictability.  Less than halfway through, I knew exactly what was going to happen, and I wasn't wrong.  So it was just a matter of slogging through the rest to get to the end.  I also wasn't overly amused by most of the so-called witticisms and amusing one-liners of several characters.  It wasn't endearing, only annoying.    All in all, pretty disappointing 
 If you only like eggs, bacon and ham for breakfast then these recipes are for you. While noting calories and fat Hughes leaves out sodium, cholesterol, protein, and all other nutritional information. If I wanted to raise my cholesterol and sodium intake then I'd eat eggs and ham every day for breakfast. In addition, she adds some variation of fruit to each breakfast. I could of thought of that on my own. I admit that I did not buy this cookbook for the lunch recipes, so my input in that section of the book may not be relevant. However, if I had purchased it for the lunch recipes I would have been very disappointed; no one has time to make these lunches on a daily basis unless they are at home all day and have nothing to do. I hardly have time to make breakfast and dinner! There were only a handful of dinner recipes that even seemed appealing to me and were good...however, would I have purchased this book knowing there would only be a handful of recipes I'd use? No. The desserts aren't worth bothering with unless you want to spend time preparing a variety of fruit and spice combinations. Not very exciting. Fortunately I only paid $8 or else I'd be a lot more unhappy. Also, there are no pictures and that makes it difficult to get excited about as well. If you're looking for a diet book look somewhere else. If you're looking for low calorie recipe ideas, look somewhere else. There is nothing special or exciting about these recipes. 
 I have received no emails from ANAsuper.......No tracking number..........and extensive delivery estimate....I do not know if I should cancel order.....I am trying to give them a chance to show me their wares. I can understand if this product has special preparation time, but I have recieved not one communication nor confirmation. No product information 
 The photos are beautiful, the designs are just wonderful...but if you have kids this is not real life. This is a magazine lifestyle. You could only do this if you had an unlimited budget, there are no true solutions for real families with real children and real budgets. Sure my home could be organized if I had an open checkbook and could have such fabulous built-ins, and all the baskets I could buy! Stick with the real simple magazine and leave the book for the coffee table. 
 Jim Ainsworth clearly demonstrates his extensive financial consulting experience throughout this book.  Much of the information is valuable, and it covers the important beginners' range of knowledge effectively. However,  his 'down to earth' style is not only irritating, it actually makes the  book painful to read. Good written English is not always the same as good  spoken English. Surely the man is a succesful financial consultant, but  that doesn't make him a good writer. It just goes to show that in a hot,  growing industry like financial consulting a book written by a 'qualified'  author will sell even if it is poorly written 
 DBF was trying something different with this book- and I appreciate that- but the effort just didn't gel.  Grace, a worldly travel agent, lets her overbearing extended family bully her emotionally.  This organized and ballesie travel agent, whose boyfriend does stem cell research, caves into that?  That premise didn't wash and Grace's extended and detailed faith crisis really wore me down.    DBF's humor was still there, but I disliked Grace's family so much, and tired of the overly described faith crisis, that I just became irritated and started skimming and flipping pages to get finished (I've never had to do that with a DBF book before).   The travel agent slant allowed DBF to describe other locales, but, DBF, please return to writing about the sea water and marsh of the Low Country.  That's what hooked us! 
 The premise was great. The storytelling, very awkward. The technological information could have been interesting, but it read like an instruction manual. I give one star for the final cat-and-mouse and another for the funny way Mr. Clancy portrayed the Soviet apparatchiks 
 My enjoyment of the PBS telecast was just fitful.  The production itself was just breathtaking - faithful to the time period, expensive, detailed and colorful. The costumes were of a quality one rarely sees anymore - imaginative designs, the attention to detail, and color coordination was all beautifully done.    The two stars, Brent Barrett as Fred/Petruchio and Rachel York as Lilli/Kate, are both movie-star handsome, exceptional in this regard, and looked their parts to the hilt. York especially looked like a 1940s lady of the theatre, while Barrett really does look like a matinee idol.    I was far less pleased with their performances and singing.  It's not that I don't doubt their talents; they obviously have star quality.  But whose idea was it to have Fred and Lilli behave like spoiled, bratty, whiny children?  The kind you see on TV sitcoms - immature, silly, and really, really dumb-acting.  These two were quite unsavory, ridiculous, even unsympathetic characters. Everything was way over-the-top.  Furthermore, all of the constant mugging, overacting, eye-rolling, excessive broadness and exaggeration of expressions wore thin after a short while.  Rachel York repeatedly screamed, shrieked, yelled, caterwauled and went beyond behaving like a mere shrew: the show turned into The Screaming of the Shrew.  This Lilli had no sophistication, class, dignity, warmth, irony or even wit...even her sarcasms and irascibilities were all wrong, too teenage-princessy...she was a high-decibel harpy and little else.     Brent Barrett was a little better, but he still came across like an excitable high school kid.  Fredric Graham should be a aspiring-classical actor type - albeit vain, hammy,  insecure and prone to an inflated sense of his own-alleged greatness; but a child he's not.   Fred should reek of Martini and Rossi-smoking-jacket-cigar savvy and larger-than-life sophistication, yet edgy, rattled in a way only overambitious actors can be. It's strange, seeing Barrett, this tall, athletically built, distinguished-looking actor, made to behave like an overgrown teenager... sort of like one of those men depicted in sitcoms...childish, foolish-acting and an irritating air-head.  Even his speaking voice (as used here), when under pressure, cracks and acquires that puberty-falsetto (think Tom Cruise when he yells).   He's not anywhere believable as an aspiring classical actor.       I had even more misgivings about York's and Barrett's singing.  Yet I can't blame them exactly; very few people on Broadway nowadays exhibit the kind of fundamental classical training that was obligatory at one point.   I couldn't tell whether York knew what she was doing; her singing displayed a combination of pop vocal crooning, along with some jazzy inflections - yet there were hints here and there of some operatic leanings. As a result, none of her songs coalesced properly; it seemed as if each register, wherever the song in question took her, revealed a different kind of stylistic realm. Barrett, again, was a little better, but he too lacks a truly fundamental technique.  The middle part of his range seems natural and easy, but the higher he goes the tone spreads and sounds constricted all at once; you can't take a pop voice production of tone and expect it to bloom properly. Moreover, Barrett was often afflicted with a troubling vibrato. From what I can hear, when he speaks properly, there is quite a beautiful, resonant voice in there somewhere, but he's misusing it at practically every turn.    A digression: watching Howard Keel in the film version, I'm more convinced than ever that his performance as Fred/Petruchio is THE classic embodiment of the role in every way.  Keel was among singers, an outstanding, instinctive actor, and brought to the role the kind of distinction it required.  It did not hurt that he was tall, distinguished and imposing (he looked great as Petruchio, so Shakespeareanly dashing). Keel's Fred Graham was ultra-masculine, exaggeratedly vain, ambitious and yet somehow mature and imbued with depth; Barrett didn't even begin to convey these latter qualities.  And Keel's voice - deep, vibrant, correctly produced and gorgeous in tone quality,  was one of the best of its kind for the baritone leading-man roles to be had.   His accounts of the songs are matchless.      More troublesome though, was how York and Barrett interpreted their songs.  Even the simplest melodies were tugged, pulled, underlined and bent out of shape, as though to make the audience understand every little inflection, and bring across the mood with all these exaggerated "espressivo" effects... but all these gimmicks and schticky touches ruin the songs.  "I Hate Men" was the most idiotically overacted spectacle I've ever witnessed.  "Wunderbar" is a beautiful melody whose words are parodical: yet the tune in its beauty should be retained and preserved.  York and Barrett tried to make the song the magical moment it can be, but their voices did not blend, and the song failed to surge as it should (as Alfred Drake and Patricia Morison made it so).   Ditto for "So in Love," (still a bit overemotive and swoony by York) though it was mercifully spared from being mangled in this production (Barrett came closest to producing the most moving moment near the end in this tune).   For the most part though, most of the songs as performed here didn't work for me...Porter's music was poorly represented (the voices didn't serve the score) and Porter's lyrics were banged up and slammed in every which way AND loose.     One of the pleasures of the two original cast albums (the first in Mono, the second done especially for the then-new Stereo era) was Lisa Kirk's Lois Lane/Bianca.  Kirk brought a special brand of street smart babe-sexy sultriness to the role, helped by that deep, knowingly sensual timbre she owned.  Her renditions of Lois's songs are dynamite, are Broadway classics, and what's more, made the role into a real character, not just the secondary comedy lead.  It made for a terrific contrast to Patricia Morison's high-minded lady of the theatre voice and personality.       Nancy Anderson in the PBS telecast was made to embody a completely different Lois altogether...and I hated it.  Lois was here into a nasal-voiced, dimwitted kewpie doll.  She spoke and sang in a pinched, "dum-dum girl" tone, and so the songs failed to come to life.      The rest of the cast did fine...the "Too Darn Hot" number was wonderful, spicy, insinuating and catchy.   But it serves little point in analysing the other factors, because the main elements were too compromised for me to enjoy the show as a whole.  
 It took me less than a day and a half to read this book. And thats not because i was "glued to it" or "thought it was a real page-turner" but basically because it was a real fast read. However, this book, as i stated, is a perfect example of Stephen King's boredom with writing horror/fiction. His work within the last decade especially, has taken some well deserved criticism. Based on the concept that most of his recent books are churned out in a "cookie-cutter" method. Now, don't get me wrong, King is responsible for some of the most compelling stories ever. Stories that seem to transcend the "horror genre", and incorporate elements of mystery, romance, and drama. However, this is not one. I would rate this book only behind "Insomnia" as the most insipid King novels i've ever read. I don't know how to explain it to those who have not read most of King's work. But for those who have, it will make sense when i say that about a quarter of the way into the book, i found myself thinking "oh....it's going to be another one of THESE stories huh?" THESE meaning a really generic character, and a foreseeable "generic" villian, ultimately squaring off in a very "generic" ending. halfway through, i could already see how it was going to end. And this is one of those books where King's references to East coast culture are going to take precedence over the quality of the finished product. Some examples of King's finest work would be "The Talisman", "Night Shift"(THE best collection of short horror stories ever), The Shining, The "Dark Tower" sieries, and The Stand, just to name a few. And if you have not read any of "The Bachman books" (King as Bachman) "Rage", "The Long Walk", Road Work", and "The Running Man", are some of the most well written, and mind-bending stories ever told.  This, however, isn't. And unless you can purchase this book for under $2.00 don't waste your money, or your time.       
 I recently purchased "Afternoons in Utopia" based on the ratings of others on Amazon.  I fell in love with Alphaville's first album, "Forever Young".  That album is as close to perfect as any other I have ever listened to.  But "Afternoons" suffers from the sophomore jinx; with all due respect to others that wrote such favorable reviews on Amazon, the album is a major letdown.  While the lyrics presented here are good, the music and melodies are nowhere near the level achieved in "Forever Young".  I hate to compare, but Alphaville set the bar very high with such a brilliant debut just two years earlier.  I think, overall, that "Afternoons" suffered greatly from the loss of Frank Mertens and was much too ambitious musically.  Notice the list of musicians on "Afternoons" -- 31 long!  This may be interesting but there is a lack of focus from song to song.  The consistency that was so prevelent on "Forever Young" is long gone.  While "Afternoons" has some good songs, and the lyrics are solid, the brillance established on their first album is gone.  This is a high effort album with mediocre results.  I really, really wanted to fall in love with this album as I did with "Forever Young", but it's just not there 
 Ok.. I read the other reviews for this movie and I am a little confused.  Was it the same movie?  The martial arts were "ok" in this, but nothing I havent seen done better before.  The story-line  was.. ummm. well, nevermind.    Oh and did I mention the film doesnt end????  I mean I didnt really care but it still sucked to cut the story line half way though.  I really wantedto like this movie... but the only good thing I can say is that some of the sub-titles are hilarious 
 This book tries to link together everything in Stephen King's books.  Sometimes it tries too hard.  Like finding a character name from one book simply mentioned in another.  Not too mind-blowing.  Some of the interconnections were intersting, but overall nothing to write home (or a book) about 
 If you liked the original theatrical release (which was the first version of the film that made it to DvD) and own it, more than like you have all you'll need from KoH. I REALLY enjoyed the theatrical release, purchased it...and then later bought this version of the film based on many of its Amazon reviews. While it does add a great deal of watching time to the film, the extra footage really does little to improve the quality of the story or increase the depth of the characters to any "interesting" degree. Add to that, that this version of the film doesnt include the great documentaries(History Channel) found on the original DvD release. As I have shared, I REALLY enjoyed Kingdom of Heaven.....but didnt/havent found the purchase of this version to be an improvement over the original in the least. More doesnt always equal better.... 
 Katz's "Dogs of Bedlam Farm" is a litany of Katz's inadequacies as a man and as a dog trainer.  Katz doesn't love dogs (he admits that he dislikes going to places where dogs and people interact, like dog shows, agility or herding trials), he loves HIS dogs.  He loves them so much that he buys them a farm in upstate NY and stocks it with 16 sheep.  Sheep which he constantly whines about having to care for during a bitter NY winter.  He just has to have 16 sheep, five wouldn't be enough apparently, even though they'd be much easier to care for than 16.  Dogs which he loves so much that he lives apart from his wife.  A wife that he SAYS he loves - but apparently not as much as HIS dogs.  If you're getting the idea that I believe that Katz loves his dogs as possessions, you'd be correct.  And, of course, as a source of income as he writes books about them.  And although Katz fails to train two out of three of his Border Collies, so much so, in fact, that he has to give one of his beloved failures away because he thinks he treats the dog as his father treated him. After two failures and although the third dog pretty much trains herself, Katz glories in being known as the local "dog man". As someone who has owned, trained and exhibited dogs for over 50 years, I see little to recommend in this book.   
 I was disappointed with my purchase.   The first two tapes in the series were fine, but when I inserted the 3rd tape into my machine the tape started feeding out the front of the machine.  I checked the tape and the wheels or sprockets they were wound on were loose and free floating inside the plastic casing.  I, then examined the other remaining cassettes and 4 of the 8 had the same problem.  I wonder if these products were seconds or something?  I would not order from this vendor again because it could have ruined my machine and because it is a hassle to have to return merchandise in today's busy work world.  
 After my older brother suddenly died of coronary artery disease at age 40 due to genetically high cholesterol, I needed to learn everything possible on the subject so that I could avoid suffering the same fate.  I read all the books on the shelf, among them Dr. Ornish's.  I disliked this book because it is rather narcissistic and is focused more on Dr. Ornish himself than on educating us about how to avoid heart disease.  Take a look at chapter 1 and you'll see what I mean: "I was trained to treat hypertension..."; "I first became interested in conducting research on heart disease in 1975..."; "I began to wonder..."; "I went to the medical library and began reading extensively"; "It seemed like an exciting opportunity, so in 1977 I decided to take a year off..."; "I hadn't had enough clinical experience to be jaded..."; "I was unwittingly giving many of them hope for the first time since their illness had been diagnosed"; "I went back to medical school and graduated in 1980"; "From 1981 to 1984, I completed my internship and medical residency in Boston."; "In July 1984, I moved to San Francisco..."  This is just the tedious first six pages.  Trust me, it goes on and on like this.  Do you want to learn about how the heart works?  You'll finally get a few sentences on that subject when you get to page 42, squeezed in between more "I did this and I did that."  You'll get a little info on LDL and HDL when you get to page 51.  Sure, there is useful information within the 672 pages of this book, but you'll be forced to become an expert on Dr. Ornish and his life story to find it.  And remember, this book is more than 15 years old.  Perhaps back in 1990 he needed to devote 300 pages to convincing people that he was correct in believing that diet, exercise, and stress affect your risk of heart disease, but that that is common knowledge and not controversial now.  The research is far more advanced in today's world.  If you are interested in Dr. Ornish personally and the history of the study of heart disease in the 1970s and 1980s, you'll probably enjoy this book.  But if you are serious about educating yourself on heart disease and how best to avoid it, I would recommend Dr. Robert Superko's "Before the Heart Attacks : A Revolutionary Approach to Detecting, Preventing, and Even Reversing Heart Disease" (2003) or Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz's "The Expert Guide to Beating Heart Disease: What You Absolutely Must Know" (2005).  These books are more up to date and provide far more useful information. 
 I liked the idea of the half-pint James Bond-like secret agent  played by Frankie Muniz aka 'Agent Cody Banks.'  The story is not exceptionally original, but Muniz, a decent actor I suppose, carried the whole film pretty well, which was enjoyable to see.  Now, finally I saw the sequel, which turned out a big disappointment.  First, you realize that everything is missing from the sequel, I mean, everything that made the original film quite a unique one.  Here, 'Cody' is no longer timid or feels intimidated before women; he just acts like an ordinary American teenager, but this time he is in London!  That's all, and Cody is assigned a job to retrieve the high-tech mind-control device that might be used to control the world's leaders at G7 (or G8 ... whatever).  But ... why do they need special agent Cody instead of ordinary spy like James Bond or any spies you can name?  Because Cody has to get close to the prime suspect, who owns a boarding school, where Cody must be placed.  And for the successful mission, Cody must not disclose his identity before the kids (who wouldn't believe such nonsense anyway).  My question: Do you believe in this poorly written plot, or, more to the point, DO you care?         If you should care, that's because of romance.  In the sequel, you see no Hilary Duff, who was not bad in the first film.  Instead, you get Hannah Spearritt (ex 'S-Club'), but between Muniz and her there is no chemistry.  Add to that, the gadgets are unimaginative ones; the locations are all shot like post-cards.  Side kick Anthony Anderson is same old Anthony Anderson, who is certainly funny, but we know he could be much more funny with better materials, better than doing unfunny slapsticks in the kitchen.       I read that the film's script was being written during the shooting.  What were they thinking?  Did director Kevin Allen approve that?  Did MGM need the sequel that desperately?  Or quickly?  Because Frankie Muniz was reaching the age of 20, no longer a 'teenager,' no 'Cody Banks'?  I don't know, but I'm pretty sure that as far as the script is concerned, the film is a very lazy, unfunny, unexciting comedy of which sole merit is that it was shot in London.  But sooner or later you can see London in another film.   
 After seeing this I wanted to snatch my eyeball out of the sockett it was so stupid. I thought Angela Bettis was through torturing us after her horrible remake of "Carrie", but I guess not. If you're lonely, buy a dog, or try keeping a boyfriend and not scaring him off, but, by no means, do you begin to start killing people off and sewing their body parts together to make you a friend. This chick was seriously messed up. At any rate, I see all the rave reviews, and I don't understand it, but I guess I don't share the morbid imaginations. Afterall, I wouldn't be surprised if this turns out to be a cult classic. I just didn't like it though 
 I ordered this product for a friend's bday since I got these same boots and loved them.  I waited weeks and weeks for her to call me and tell me how much she loves them.  Except it NEVER happened.  I was told the product went out over 2 weeks ago, I call amazon and they tell me to call macys.  I call Macys and they tell me to call amazon.  I've been told the item went out and must have gotten lost in the mail.  Then i am told the product was never sent out cuz it's been backordered and that Aerosoles cancelled the order.  Although now i've told my friend she's getting these boots and now she's not.  I've also been charged for these boots over 2 weeks ago and have made half a dozen calls to amazon and macys and had to explain this whole story to 10 different ppl and spent over 2 hrs of my LIFE trying to get this resolved.  Do yourself a favor and go buy this at the store or directly w/ Aerosoles.  I will never buy anything from amazon or macys online again.  WORST customer service ever and I am SOOOOO pissed right now 
 If you think you know calculus because you understand this book, you are sadly mistaken.  There is no rigor, no real problem solving, just paint by numbers. Calculus is pretty much the end of basic mathematics, this book will not get you ready for real mathematical rigor in advanced classes.  I guess this book is fine if you aren't a scientist, engineer, computer scientist, economist, or mathematician. Then again, if you aren't any of the above you likely aren't in a calc class. In short, this book is for nobody.  The real crime here is that James Stewart is getting rich off this [...], and damaging the future of many students. Overpriced, overhyped, just pure garbage. If this book is required, complain to the math department and then get a real calculus book, and just borrow someone elses copy to get homework assignments. Don't be a sucker 
 The Book Description provided by Amazon.com above says, "Kenan B. Osborne ... identifies which doctrines of the church are "immutable truths" that must be concisely taught. Then, he discusses statements which are currently the official teachings of the church, but which may change in time, Finally, he describes those areas in sacramental teaching which are still being discussed and argued by reputable Catholic theologians."  This description alone should raise red flags among any catechist who is a faithful Catholic, for the official sacramental teachings of the church will not change over time.  This is why the Church is apostolic; she does not change her teaching, but rather, it remains the same in every generation as the Church grows in her understanding of the Faith.  Let me give an example of Osborne's heterodoxy.  Osborne states that these are issues we face today:  Is Baptism a remedy for sin or a celebration for grace Baptism and the equality of all Christians The indissolubility of the sacramental marriage  Any catechist who has read the Catechism of the Catholic Church (2nd ed., 1997) knows very well that these three "issues" brought up by Osborne are not "issues" at all.  They are teachings of the Catholic Church that will not change, even if a theologically liberal Franciscan Friar thinks and publishes otherwise.  Stay away from this text.  It is part of the reason that Catholic catechesis in the United States is in its current poor condition 
 I was disappointed with the book. It was not as helpful for the small, individual investor as I wanted it to be. $10,000 spread over 50 stocks means investing $200 per stock without even talking about any fees for buying and selling 50 different stocks. So from this book I can narrow down my indivual selection of stocks to 25 or 50, but if I only want to purchase 3-5 stocks how do I decide which 3-5 of the 50 to buy?   The book did give me a broader understanding of the different strategies used behind mutual funds. When I review a mutual fund's strategy, now I know the lingo and what the fund manager is looking for in a stock and how that strategy compares to other strategies. So I think the book has made me a better mutual fund shopper, but has not helped me as much in purchasing individual stocks 
 I'm evaluating the DVI version.  The cables are sold seperately, so what's the point to buy a KVM without cables?!?  Lastly, hearing the problems doesn't surprise me, as working with the two port version, I had some problems where computers becames unresponsive 
 I got a copy of this book a few years back as a Christmas gift, and the title and cover immediately put me off (and I'm really not the type that judges a book by it's cover).  It wasn't until recently that I started reading this novel.  Big mistake on my part.  The novel began well enough, but then began a downward spiral.  It had one of the oddest plots I've ever seen, and that alone normally wouldn't put me off a book.  But in addition to the bizarre story line, it seemed as if Koontz had wrote the book, and then went back and looked up every word he had written in the thesaurus and replaced it with a synonym.  Simple sentences were unneccesarily drawn out, and some of his figurative language (especially that which involved Middle Eastern conflict) was flat and boring.  Truly one of the worst reads I've ever had the displeasure of enduring 
 Fortune 500 HR executives do in fact give tips for resumes and cover letters in this book. But if they possess the magic key to getting an interview, they don't share it. Readers won't get the interview everytime because the advice is tired and common: list your experiences and education on your resume; attach a cover letter. Basic online job hunting tips have been layered on top to make the advice seem fresh. It's not. And if it worked, there wouldn't be any need for newer strategies such as the "accomplishment" strategy (at least you prove that you were useful to a business) and the "self-marketing" strategy (much more aligned with a business's needs). As an employer, I want to know what a candidate will do to bring profit to my business and peace of mind to me. It's that simple. I don't want to infer or guess.  And, contrary to what this book implies, I am more receptive to candidates who show initiative and creativity 
 I was totally ready for this book when I read it back in 1989.  I very much believed in consulting my inner wisdom in most matters and was ready to believe that would work with food as well.  Who wouldn't want to hear that you can eat all your favorite foods-even an entire carrot cake-if you crave it?  Sounded like a dream come true.  But the authors did not consider the bio-chemical grip of sugar addiction.  Sugar is not a nutritive substance, so cravings for it are NEVER a signal of a bodily need.  In my case, and the case of many sugar addicts, we want sugar for the same reason that a smoker wants a cigarette:  X number of hours have passed since the last fix and it is time for another one!  There need be no emotional trigger.  I need my first sugar fix the minute I get up, in the form of a big glob of honey in my tea, when I am barely conscious.    I spent a long time trying to find emotional reasons for my sugar cravings, only to conclude that sugar, for me, is like a drug and I crave it for the simple reason that my body is used to it.  A better, healthier approach is found in Kathleen DesMaisons "Potatoes Not Prozac."  Neither can I concur with the authors'  unconcern over extra pounds.  Obesity exacts a terrible social, emotional and medical toll, and simply "deciding" to be okay with extra pounds doesn't make the risk of diabetes, heart disease and cancer go away.   These women have taken an excessively feminist approach that emphasizes accepting our bodies as they are, fashion magazines be damned-never mind that obesity is a DISEASE.  It is ugly because disease is ugly, just like varicose veins, a dowager's hump, and eczema are ugly.    I think that "The Zone," "South Beach," and "Potatoes Not Prozac," are on the right track-lots of low glycemic foods to keep insulin and blood sugar both low, is the key to ending cravings and naturally losing weight.  Food is not just about emotion-there is a big bio-chemical component to consider.   
 It's obvious that my review differs from the majority, but I emphatically stand by my opinion: this movie was really, really, really lousy.   Keifer Sutherland (whom I generally like a lot...he is why I watched this turkey in the first place) portrays a stone alcoholic, chain-smoking, gravel-voiced, burned out bum of a cop who guzzles gallons of booze and staggers from scene to scene like one of the zombies in Dawn of the Dead. This is his worst performance (that I have ever witnessed) and to make matters even more grim, the entire plot is a confusing, poorly-directed mess. I think that the majority of Keifer's boozing is due to his embarrassment over appearing in this truly wretched movie.  If you insist on viewing this bomb, you will hear the word "Jabberwocky" at least 10,000 times (and come to hate it with a white-hot intensity)....you will see Keifer Sutherland's character drink countless gallons of whiskey (often straight from the quart bottle at his desk in the police station) and smoke at least 9,500 cigarettes (this movie could be used as aversion therapy by A.A. or the American Lung Association)....you will see ghosts, apparitions, and silly psychic flashbacks that are about as convincing and relevant as those in "Sabrina the Teenage Witch". At one point, a character wants to convey the name of the villain to Kiefer in a "psychic vision", so rather than just say the name (which would be way too easy), he lures the villain to appear in a mirror ("through the looking glass")....silly.  The basic premise of this movie resembles the TV series "Medium", in which a psychic can sense details about a crime by touching objects associated with the crime....but the TV show is vastly superior in every respect: acting, plot, direction, and characterization. Also, the only psychic visions that a drunk of this magnitude is likely to see involve elephants....pink ones. This movie would not qualify as a tolerable made-for-TV drama...and that is very, very sad.  There are numerous allusions to "Alice in Wonderland" (the original name of this bomb was "After Alice"): Kiefer starts having his "psychic visions" after falling through a hole, a character is named "Hatter", etc. etc. I assure you that none of this cuteness will add to your viewing pleasure in any way.   So, you can listen to the other reviewers and waste your time and money, or listen to the warning I am offering loud and clear: there is a reason that this movie was never released in theaters...and God knows, it shouldn't be released in your home either. Avoid it....you really don't need to hear the word "Jabberwocky" 10,000 times....do you ??? 
 WELL, "THE RUBBER BAND MAN," AS I CALL HIM, HAS STRUCK AGAIN AND I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS CD. IT IS ABSOLUTELY A GREAT JOY TO LISTEN TO, SO MUCH SO THAT I JUST CAN'T LISTEN TO IT OFTEN ENOUGH. I HAVE HAD SEVERAL DAYS OF NOT BEING ABLE TO LISTEN TO ANYTHING ELSE ALL DAY, AND, JUST WHEN I THINK I AM DONE, IT STARTS AGAIN AND OFF I GO, DANCIN' AND GROOVIN'. I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT!    YES, THIS ALBUM GOES VERY WELL WITH THE RECOMMENDED, "IN SEARCH OF SUNRISE 5," (TIESTO) AS WELL ATB'S, "IN THE MIX 3." WHAT A GREAT TRIPPLE PURCHASE!    I'LL TELL YA, I HAVE FOUND THIS CD SO UPLIFTING AND FUN THAT I HAVE HAD MOMENTS IN WHICH I REALLY FELT GLAD TO BE ALIVE JUST TO HAVE HEARD IT...NO KIDDING. I HOPE THAT IT DOES THE SAME FOR YOU 
 As a textbook for teaching the fundamentals of nuclear engineering, the Lamarsh-Baratta text is horrible.  It is riven with errors in the text and examples (and we are using the 3rd edition), the questions are infuriatingly vague at times and in general it does a poor job of explaining an admittedly difficult subject.  Regarding the large numbers of typos, I and my classmates had to search the web for an errata sheet and even then we continue to find errors such as formulae written incorrectly and wrong values for constants.  As for being vague, this text makes you assume many things.  A favorite example is a problem early in the text where we not only have to assume neutron energies, we also had to assume fuel type.  Then we have to assume energy released per fission and somehow come up with an answer we can be confident in.  Ridiculous.  The examples are hit and miss - occasionally they are helpful, an omission I am sure that will be corrected in the 4th edition.  We find ourselves relying on outside texts and materials much of the time to supplement this poorly written textbook.  EDIT ADDED TWO YEARS LATER - Now with perspective from the job world...  After graduating and entering the work force, I mostly stand by the above.  I will admit that I do have my copy still with me.  It does provide the occasional useful overview of a wide breadth of topics.  I must once again point out the many errata.  I still regard it as inexcusable even though I know mistakes do happen - but this is the 3rd edition.    Another thing that would be enormously useful would be if the next edition included units.  When teaching this subject, watching how units cancel out or are used can be very, very helpful to undergrad students.  Many students will be forced to use this.  I would suggest keeping it on your bookshelf, but if you are supposed to use this in your class, I strongly recommend Nuclear Reactor Engineering by Glasstone and Sesonske as a supplement.  The third edition of the Glasstone book can still be found for a reasonable price if you can't afford the most recent edition 
 I tend to agree with your first reviewer as to the "Adam and Eve" features of this novel. It is quite readable and fast paced, but its picture of 30,000 BCE is "way off base" by the standards of modern knowledge. As far as I can find there is no trace whatever of the "wide men" (Neanderthals) in Africa. There is no indication of Neanderthal stupidity, savagery and endemic canibalism ( they had bigger brains than Homo Sapiens sapiens). "Modern man" dates back far beyond 30,000 years even according to the somewhat discredited "Eve" hypothesis. For example Australia was actually settled as early as 80,000 BCE by the Aboriginals, who are effectively modern man biologically. As to the protagonists inventing clothing for the first time as recently as then, well that is farcical.  Neanderthals in Europe were living on the edge of the ice sheets for a whole ice age before then!  Perhaps they were very hairy indeed!!! Over all the cover very much sums up the book. Jean Auel did a much better job, especially in her later books. Eurokiwi 
 the first chapter was awesome... lan gearing up for a battle, there's suspense, there's a promise of action, i was excited to read more.  i'm halfway through the book now and it's been nothing since but morraine and siuan chapters... what is robert jordan's problem?  why spoil a great fantasy series with chapter after chapter of catty females, i don't understand why i still read this author 
 design of book is very poor--pictures totally unclear and print is crowded making it impossible to focus on the story.  The translations are not bad but there is no effort to organize the material and put it in contex 
 I have long loved Mr. Jenkins' work and have adopted a few of his witty sayings as  my own.  It was work to read this one, but I toiled from respect for remembrances of things past.  Still a faithful fan, I look  forward to Jenkins' redemption 
 When I saw this in the library, I guess I was expecting another version of The Nanny Diaries, which was cute. This "novel," however, was poorly written and jumped all over the place; there were no smooth transitions at all. It was basically one big promo of her company--any time she mentioned a "horror story" she was quick to add that it wasn't one of HER nannies. Basically, I thought it was boring and that the writing style emulated that of the 3rd graders I teach. It took me about an hour to read, after which I thought, "How did THAT get published?" If you want to read a nanny book, try the Nanny Diaries. This book is stupid. 
 If you've ever seen the great movie (Thirteenth Warrior) that was based on this book, "Eaters of the Dead" will just not measure up. Maybe the structure of the book was the problem. Crichton wrote it in the style of an medieval manuscript to try to convey the authenticity of an actual 1000 year old document. Maybe he was too successful with that conceit. It was usually the aim of medieval chroniclers to present the dry facts of an event rather than to strive for dramatic tension, character development or an elevated literary style. Unfortunately, those qualities are necessary in a novel.  This was mostly a bore. Don't bother 
 It takes a few attempts to get through this book. I read it through about 3 times before I could understand what the authors point was. It is more of a documentary then anything else. Perhaps he could have ellaborated on the  myths and ledgends, as well as zodiac references to the pyramids. Other  than that, it's an interesting read 
 I got this magazine for a year and a half before I had to quit my subscription recently. I liked all the fashion tips and articles on how to dress for your body size and style, and that is why I subscribed to begin with. But I was not expecting the bombardment of amoral opinions forced on me. (not to mention an overload of advertising- which you will get in most fashion magazines anyway, so that's not a complaint). Sure there was a few lines here and there that were nonbiased (telling the facts of STDs and such), but 90% of the articles on sex, were opinion and not fact. Girls today are having sex with anyone and getting hurt emotionally and physically because of magazines like Seventeen who say that sex is good if you're ready (What 15 year old girl is ready to have sex and get an STD or a baby?? Please.), and that condoms are 100% effective. They are not, but that's what most teen girls believe because of stupid magazines like this. They need to take advice from their parents and doctors, not magazine articles. I was disgusted at the opinions presented as truth to basically promote teen girls doing whatever they want without consequences. 
 Ok, everyone wants to know how McKinsey does it. Works with leading companies, drives corporate strategy, has great influence and often wind up CEOs in their own right.  Unfortunatley this book does not deliver in any depth in my opinion.  It is more of a casual conversation about McKinsey, how great it is with breif discussions of how they work.  Notions such as 'always involve your client' and 'recognize that you may not always have great data' are obvious and not worth the price of the book -- even if you purchased it used -- which I did.  If you really want to know how the McKinsey mind works I heartly recommend K. Ohmae's "The mind of the strategist"  Ohmae was Mr. Strategy at McKinsey and his book really shows you what's in the mind of this influencial company and its consultants.   The two who authored this book, are really trading on McKinsey's name, brand and reputation.  Its a shame and do not be lured in by the title, read Ohmae's book. 
 I hoped that this guide would have more background on the history of the city and its attractions.  The background/history portion of the guide was extremely sparse.  I have not read any of the other popular guides to Shanghai so I cannot make an alternative recommendation 
 I can't understand the good reviews given by others to this movie. Frankly, I thought it was a dog.  Not to say that it had no redeeming features - the friendship between the young girl and the lawn man was endearing, if improbable. And the girl herself was a real sweetie, and a good actress - perfect for the part. In fact, the acting all around was admirable.  But the script! Yikes! Not a single character in the whole movie - with the partial exceptions of the two protagonists - had any motivation for anything they did. People acting awkward or mean (in fact, just about everyone in the movie other than said two was mean), or spiteful, or stupid, for no reason at all!   It seems as though somehow, the movie could have been good, but didn't make it. Call it almost watchable.  I came away from Lawn Dogs (Yawn Dogs?) feeling not at all enriched. Puzzled, perhaps, at why anyone would make such a movie. Well, there was that admirable, unlikely friendship. But that was all.  Pass this one by 
 I don't see what the fascination is with this guy! Okay, the guy can play guitar, but so can millions of other people! YAWWWNNNN 
 Okay, this man was a "god", as we all are, if we accept the teachings of the Upanishads, the Gita, Sri Krishna, and, if understood properly, Christ Himself.  But the Self Realization Fellowship, while wonderful indeed, seems to go by way of the Hare Krishna "cult" (minus, of course, the selling of flowers in various airports) in their veneration of their long dead leader.  The physical body of a dead man has returned to the ground.  The Self has always been One with the Self, and of course no Self i8s any better than anothers Self, um, because it's all one big happy Self, right.  Like salt dissolving in water--where did it go, and is it any less salt?  Think about that the next time you worship a dead man.  As to the text, it's archaic, out dated, and let's admit it--based on the King James Victorian English used in a Bible translated in 1611...YUCK.  I, too, prefer the playful and highly wonderful Gita translation by Eknath Easwaran (go ahead, shoot me), and the three volume set "The Bhagavad Gita For Daily Living".  What I like About it is that no-one claims that Easwaran is "Krishna", or that he is "God", or that it takes "Three years to understand the teachings"--nope, one just learns to focus the attentions inward (which is really what meditation IS, not some "mystical" state or total renunciation of the world), and learn to LOVE, which is what the 12th chapter of the Gita is all about.  I am sure that the SRF belives in all of these things, and this is why I bought "God Talks with Arjuna", and I believe that spending my hard earned cahs is supporting the SRF and it's aims and goals.  But I do not believe that your guru is a "God" in any other way than an expression of the Atman that is in me and you, and nothing else.  I also would warn someone who is considering purchasing this beautiful boxed set (yes, the books are wondefully bound, they are dark blue, and I admit I love looking at them on my bookshelf), that the English used is Archaic, hard to understand at times, and plain boring.  If you enjouy Shakespear and the King James Bible, which I suppose many do, then you'll love this set.  If not, then you'll probably prefer the Easwaran set I spoke of earlier, as well as his much more down-lo-earth commentary, which is based on practical love, meditiation, ans service to others, which I think Sri Krishna would have no problem with anyways, even if the SRF's "god like" guru was actually an Incarnation of after all.  heh heh.  Om  shanti shanti shanti 
 I loved living in 1910 Vienna - the book was wonderfully researched, and was masterful at portraying the characters and times.  And, the mystery grabbed ahold and held on - and seemed like it was really going to have a "whammo" ending.  But no - and don't you feel like you've wasted a bunch of time when that happens.  In this case, the read was interesting enough that I don't feel totally robbed, but disappointed - oh yeah!  Most of all, I was lured by the title and the search for the fig tree, which seemed to gain in significance with each page, only to end in a total fizzle.  We found it - so what?  This book had such potential - what a shame.  Surely someone along the way - agent, editor, publisher - read it and saw its shortcomings.  With all the glowing reviews, one wonders if anybody really read it.  Jody, fire them all and start with a new crew.  You are a great writer and I'll take a shot at your next one 
 I missed this last tour and looked forward to seeing it on DVD.  What I did see were shot after shot of the crowd.  How many did I need to see of the crowd singing along?  How many celebrities did I need to see?  It was like Paul saying, "See how many people love me."  Your an ex-Beatle and the surviving half of the greatest songwriting team in music history, it's okay, we all love you.  The three generational family attending and meeting Paul saga was a 10 on the douche chills meter.  When I go to a concert I'm looking at the stage not at the people around me.  Keep the crowd shots to in-between songs.  At various points in this DVD the talking heads say how important the audiences are to the show.  This is not a Deadhead crowd.  There is no need to average over 20 audeince shots per song (and that's with some songs running only a couple of minutes)!!  The The highlight of the DVD is in the Extras.  Save your money and buy one of the many other Paul concert DVDs that are out there 
 Always considered Merle as a great musician until this. Sings out of tune so much it is embarassing. Merle stick to what you konw! What amazes me is hoe someting this bad got released. It is so out of tune it is embarassing 
 I tried to wait a couple of years to let the hype about this novel die down before reading it, thinking that time would allow me to approach the novel without any bias from previous critiques.  While I don't remember much about the reviews of "The Emperor of Ocean Park" when it was initially published, I do know that the story seems to lack the pace and suspense required for me to maintain any interest in it.  The story centers on unraveling the circumstances surrounding the death of the patriarch of a prominent African American family.  I was hoping that the concept along would keep me interested but the story moves too slowly.  I'm not giving up on this one but I won't try it again for a few years.  
 The art work was beautiful, and the some of the pictures I had not seen before.They depicted a beautifully honest, natural Stevie. Such a warm,inviting smile. It is a shame that they were wasted within those  words. If you are interested in the "quality",  "truth-telling" writings of The Star and The National Inquirer  this is the choice novella for you at an inflated price. To truly know  Stevie is to listen to her, it's just a feeling. The feeling remains even  after the glitter fades 
 This video is not very good at all.  I have been using the 8 Minute Abs video for a few weeks, and I have seen results already!  I thought that I would add some variety to my routine by using a different video, but in choosing this video, I failed!  The workouts are for those who squeeze in workouts during their lunch break without any time to shower.  You will not break a sweat with this one 
 I have enjoyed all of Lisa's Scottoline's books, except this one.  And I should confess this review is only about the first half--I abandoned the book when I got to the midpoint and it still wasn't holding my interest. (I almost NEVER do that.)  If this is your first Scottoline mystery, and you felt the way I did, please don't give up on her.  Most of her books are lively, interesting, funny, and have characters worth spending time with 
 I sat down to read about this after hearing about it for years, and I want my week back. It only took that long because I had to push myself to finish it.  SPOILERS AHEAD: Meggie and Father Ralph (who everyone always seems to refer to as Ralph de Bricassart, even when they're talking to him) meet when he is twenty-six and Meggie is...ten. She speaks, acts and thinks like a 5-year-old, though. As the years go by, Father Ralph de Bricassart becomes sort of a father figure to little Meggie, and she develops a girlish crush on him. As Meggie is also "developing a very feminine figure," Ralph comes to love her in return but realizes that their love can never be. They discuss this in approximately fifteen thousand "Don't love me, my darling, for I love you but you know our love is forbidden and can never be" conversations throughout the book. Finally, after years of smothering their passion, they do it. In a really very boring scene that's all inner ruminating and blurred descriptions. And wouldn't ya know it, she gets pregnant. Ralph de Bricassart realizes (again) that their love can never be, and leaves. Meggie has his baby, and capers about gleefully that she's "stolen" something back from God. But wouldn't ya know it, the kid (who's as angelic and one-dimensional a boy I've ever encountered in literature) decides to be a priest. So she sends him to Father Ralph de Bricassart for training, who--get this--is so totally brain dead that IT NEVER ONCE OCCURS TO HIM THAT THIS MIGHT BE HIS CHILD!!!!!!! Apparently arithmetic is not a compulsory part of training for the priesthood; this guy also misses an incredibly broad hint from Meggie, when even the other priests figure it out. The Big Secret finally does come out (again in a very brief, anticlimactic scene) toward the end, but by then we're too busy skimming to really care.  All this leaves out a great many things--including immortal dialogue that makes Meggie sound perpetually ten years old ("I'll tell you something else about your roses, Ralph de Bricassart--they've got nasty, hooky thorns!"), endless, heavyhanded symbolism (ashes of roses, thorn birds...we get it! we get it!), some dumb subplot concerning a brother who is absent for 90% of the book, and one of the most unintentionally hilarious "tragic" scenes I've ever read (death by pig). Yet the Ralph-and-Meggie storyline really is the only major thing going on. And we never really get to see what it is that draws these two people together. I was expecting other subplots and development of other characters, and this never really happened. Many of the other relationships were sketchy and/or very confusing: Meggie's cruel judgment of her daughter Justine as a "monster" and a "b* tch," for example, seemed to have no basis. The last third or so involves Meggie making peace with her mother and daughter, and it just doesn't matter. The quick "the end" wrap-up would have been an even greater letdown if I'd still cared by that point. Even the most developed characters are flat and lifeless, and thoroughly unlikable. Scarlett O'Hara was selfish, but she was fun; these people are selfish and boring. Sickly-sweet quasi-romantic trash. 
 You would think that someone like Cannell would know better than to write something like this. But apparently even he slips once in a while. If you haven't read one of his other books yet do that and leave this one alone. Otherwise go read someone else 
 Jane Fonda way over-acts, and the direction and production values are just one step above made-for-television level. 
 As an adult, I now understand the meaning of this book; but as a child I actually understood the story to mean that being ugly was bad and made you unloveable and that being pretty was important and made you loveable

 I got this case for my WS-320M, which I've been wearing around my neck like a MP3 player.  The material of the case seems to be genuine leather (or really good vinyl) and brushed felt.  It looks good = professional looking.  I've enclosed what I hope are representative pictures of this case.  All the buttons of the recorder are accessible.  Even when the flap is closed, the microphone/headphone jacks are available, as are the REC/STOP/PLAY buttons.  If the 2 tiny holes on top of the recorder are apertures for the built-in microphone, you should indeed be able to record with the flap of the case closed as well.  There is a little cushion portion embedded as a part of the case that pushes gently against the "HOLD" button on the side of the recorder.  Not only does this prevent the recorder from jostling around, but was probably designed to prevent accidental release of the "HOLD" button.  However, since the HOLD button is meant to slide down (away from the microphone) for it to be released, if the recorder was accidently pulled out of the case, the resulting friction would actually unlock the "HOLD" button.  The belt loop is an adjustable velcro.  I would have preferred a sewn-on belt loop (so the case cannot come off the belt accidently) or a nice stiff clip (for easy access), or even a riveted snap button, but this seems to be a poor compromise between the options. Most of this opinion of mine is probably based on my bias against in velcro in general - they seem to be just weak enough to cause problems at the most inopportune times.  The case is closed shut with another velcro strap,  All in all, it seems to be designed to merely protect the surface of the recorder during transport.  Or, being able to put it on your belt AFTER everything else (line-in MIC, headphone, recording/playing) is set up.  The relative inaccessibility of the buttons when the recorder is inside the case (mainly due to very small buttons), as well as the case not being very conducive to acting as a stand, would lead me to suggest that it is not very functional to record with the recorder inside the case.  The case seems to be better for carrying around in your pocket, and whipping it out for the bystanders to admire the case prior to revealing the recorder.  My bias lies in that I like to use it as an MP3 player, and I wear it around my neck by commandeering a strap/loop from a flash drive.  Placing the recorder on your belt will create more opportunities for the earphone/mic to fall out from the waving of arms and such.  I think a better choice would have been one of the cheaper generic cell phone cases that clip on to your belt.  On one positive note, I believe this is the first time that I was the first reviewer for anything from Amazon.  Woo Hoo 
 I never reveived this book.  The Nancy Drew came in the mail, but that is it.  Who do I need to contact????? 
 Well-researched biography, maybe; however, I found Robb's patronizing tone towards his subject to be distasteful, offensive. A more objective account--without a lurking sneer behind it--is in order. 
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 This book has 30 pages of obvious and worthless information. The book is very thin; when the box from Amazon arrived I looked in the box and almost didn't find the book, that's how thin it is. Of course it is quality not quantity that matters, and there too this book falls short. It was not written by a psychologist, in fact the educational qulifications of the author are not revealed. He is a "management consultant to churches." The average web page has more information than this book. Definitely not worth the price 
 We bought this Krups FLF2-J4 with anticipation of and excelent machine for our needs. It is a nice looking unit light weight and fast at heating a full load of water. However, an odor  is created in the unit and after two weeks of usage it still remains. It hadn't diminished during that time. It smells like burnt plastic and it transfers that to the water for our tea or fresh ground coffee. Not pleasant.  We felt it just wasn't safe. I've repacked it and will return it if possible.  Krups know of this as they mentioned it in their manual. 
 i couldn't help but notice all the dismay displayed in the reviews below about 'an angle' ripping off conor oberst (bright eyes). i'd just like to point out that conor originally ripped off a lesser known, less poster boy type, called DAVID DONDERO. he is an extraordinary & original talent who conor was (and probably still is) a big fan of. without conor's indie boy looks & style, david holds less potential for mass marketing, which is why he hasn't had conor's success.  you should check him out, and  remember he was doing his thing way before conor bounced on to the scene & was given credit for his originality & genius 
 According to the author, Australian history is 200 years of racism, sexism, oppression, dominance, exploitation. The victims are aborginal people, women, the early convicts -- and the environment.  The villains, of course, are white males. When the Australian economy dips, the fault lies with the U.S., world capitalism and neoliberalism. When the Australian economy thrives, it just means Aussies can waste more money on bourgeois geegaws. The tone is humorless, unrelenting, shrill, one-sided -- a prime example of what one Australian referred to as "black armband history". 
     David Brame was a chief of police who committed at least one rape of a woman other than his wife--whom he raped repeatedly---and terrorized certain members of his department, mostly the women.  He harassed and tormented his wife.     This book could benefit from a little feminist perspective. In fact, it's not that shocking to find some cops are wife-beaters; it's a macho culture.  Nor is it shocking to find a chief of police beating his wife----to whom, after all, would she report him? His own department?  
 Why buy an expensive book about anime when you can experience anime on television or read about it online. This book doesn't have any new insights on the subject so I'll say again why bother 
 The reviews posted on the site are longer than the book. It is less than 100 pages long and about 1/4" thick. I know it is a "value" book but it's a tiny, quick read that would be more suitable to a Good Housekeeping magazine (granted not PG rated!) than a book 
 VERY DULL MOVIE! UNINTERESTING CHARACTERS IN A PLOTLESS MUCK OF INCIPID POLITICAL PROPAGANDISTIC DRIVEL. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!   
 James Loewen's "Lies" is a valuable tool, debunking myths and misconceptions-even unearthing causation for common historical misconceptions. Where this critcal work fails, though, is in understanding the purpose for teaching history- for students to understand and affirm American institutions. Loewen's praise of a figure like John Brown does nothing to further this end. I do not believe, as the author does, that history as taught today is propaganda, but I do agree that textbooks are written to serve a purpose, and this being a capitalistic society, they are also written for consumers.   I am particularly irritated at his continuing the present trend of Christopher Columbus bashing. It serves no interests to villify Columbus in the name of historical accuracy. All who have immigrated here owe him a debt regardless of his alleged crimes against humanity. Loewen rails on about the "exploitative" element in Columbus's story, but his personal bias is likewise present in his support for African discovery and claims of racially motivated historiographical discrimination. Similarly, his accusation of Lincoln as a racist violates the historical principle of judging the past through the prism of the present. It is a fallacy which needs context to be properly examined. Both the author and I agree that history is written by the victors, so why does Loewen rehash this ad nausem?  Loewen asks the question, "How is one supposed to feel about the America that has been presented?" My answer after reading his book is, overwhelmingly negative and cynical. His criticism of texts, as well as all modern scholarship revising previous inaccuracies, must be taken into account in teaching history, but his negative tone must be balanced. Students do need to become, in Loewen's words, "crap detectors." Students should be given the tools to analyze events and formulate reasonable conclusions, on that much I think we would agree 
 This book is typical for many of its kind, just a man-hating drivel from feminists...and otherwise good for nothing 
 really save your money and buy the full season sets. why would they put these out after they have the full seasons out there to buy 
 If looked as a parady of some other books it was some what  amusing. But very heavy handed 
 This product was purchased 10 months after comparison shopping and on line reviews. The picture was great until this weekend when I noticed vertical burn in lines whch approximate the boundaries of non-hd broadcasts. Samsung's tecnical department blithely notes such burn in is common and that it is never covered by warranty. The commercial hype by Samsung about their built in system to prevent burn in is just designed to sell the product as the technician admitted it does not really help. Samsung should be honest and let prospective purchasers know the real % of their sets which experience the problem. My friends have Panasonics which have never had the problem even after 3 years usage 
 the description says it has the pratchett story in it, but it doesn't. it only has 4 of the original 11. what a rip-off! 
 This text was required reading for an introductory cataloging class.  I have found it to be difficult to navigate as an introductory piece.  The writing is sub par and it is clear that this is a second edition work.  For example, the author will introduce an acronym and fail to identify what it stands for, or you will find materials that should be restricted to later chapters incorporated into earlier chapters, which creates a scattered organization feel.  Her work in Wynar's Introduction to Cataloging and Classification is of significantly higher quality and is more apropos for an introductory level class than this text.  All and all, I would not recommend this text fro an introduction to knowledge organization.  Hope you never have to work with it in class... and if you do, pick up supplementary materials, you are going to need it 
   I really thought this book had promise.  I liked the character of Edward in Hamilton's previous books, but "Obsidian Butterfly" made him look like a wimp! Giving the guy a "family" and a "personal life" after having him spend years as a cold and calculating hitman was so not the right thing to do.  Why didn't Hamilton have Anita fall in love with him, too?  After all, she's got lovers from a variety of different species! I couldn't even finish this book; it was so disappointing.    Another serious problem I have with the Anita Blake series is the lack of vampire hunting, as listed on the front of each novel: An Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter Novel.  It's quite the misnomer these days.  I wish Hamilton had stuck with Jean Claude (my favorite character) and created more scenarios around him and other vampires.  I probably will not by any more of her books unless they feature Jean Claude and/or actual vampire hunting 
 Slightly above a toy but definately not a sewing machine for anything serious. I ended up hemming my sleeves by hand. Bobbin is loose. Doesn't pull the material through very well. Not at all what I had hoped. I will end up giving this away and buying a real sewing machine. One that will handle a hem. 
 I hate this movie! Because it protrays 17-year-old girls in such a negative light. I'm almost 17 years old and I felt disgusted that adults think that all teenagers do is smoke and do drugs and drink when they really don't.In real life, teenage girls don't do that kind of stuff. I think Hollywood producers should make movies about girls following their dreams and finding themselves rather than they do drugs and overdose and die. It's so disgusting that the media presents teenagers like this to the public and then adults think that's what young girls are like. I don't think I have ever seen a movie about a seventeen-year-old girl like this ever. It's the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole entire life and I shouldn't have seen it to begin with. I'm sorry I wasted my time watching this piece of crap. I love Sandra Bullock, I think she's a cool woman and an great actress, but this piece of trash is too horrible for words. It's sick! Don't watch this at all!!!!!!! 
 Considering the reputation of this book, I was quite shocked to read some of the errors it contains with regard to Australia and New Zealand to the extent I cannot take for granted anything else within its pages.  A short list:   1. Anzacs, pie floaters and lamingtons are not "food traditions" bought from Britain by migrants and convicts.  All of them originated in Australia in the 20th century.  2. The swagman boiling potatoes in his billy can is a new one to me. Billies were generally used for making tea. Most swaggies did not get more than bully beef, flour, sugar and tea.  3. Anzacs are biscuits, not cakes.  4. The "pie floater" is a meat pie in a bowl of pea soup, not tomato sauce, and is not our national dish unless a national dish by definition is something almost universally derided and never eaten.  5. In what appears to be an attempt to cater for different terminology in different countries, the authors have put corn syrup in brackets after golden syrup. However, these are not the same thing, golden syrup being derived from sugar cane and having an entirely different flavour.  6. As above, icing and frosting are not the same thing.  Any attempt to make lamingtons with frosting will result in total failure.  7. In New Zealand, food is not "simple" meat and veg, but rather a reflection of the diversity of the country's population due to immigration.  In particular, food from Thailand, Malaysia and India is common and modern New Zealand cuisine strongly reflects its influences. The book's information may have been accurate 20-30 years ago, but certainly not now.  8. In New Zealand, kiwifruit is most certainly not eaten with every meal!  This is just a sample from the information regarding Australia and New Zealand and clearly demonstrates extremely poor research. The sort of nonsense you might expect from people who still believe Australians ride kangaroos to work.  I suppose for people who don't know any better, it's great, though to me it smacks of the Emperor's new clothes. I shudder to think that anyone has 100% faith in this book. Given Larousse's reputation (not to mention price) I expect a lot more. 
  Ironic that a novel by a writer who despised penny pinching and greed would have his novel published in such a way that to make a few more bucks the publisher makes the book literally painful to read.   The text is simply too crammed on the page, following lines of text is awkward and the lack of spacing simply makes the book painful to read.   Theres other editions of the book that are cheaper and properly spaced. What a disappointment this edition is. Shame on Signet for this ridculousness 
 When a movie producer in 1998 foregoes available spectrum of colors and technology opting to feed his audience grain-black, white and jittery gray, the result had better be good. That fraction of members of the technicolor-drunk general viewing audience who will even stipulate to watch such a thing do so at decided perils of time and money, push Play alongside Mr. Benefit-Of-A-Doubt and strain to see if it works. Thus begins the argument of effect and more specifically, that of color. The problem with a black and white movie is that very few movies that resort to that, despite some grand intention, DO NOT WORK, or, in the alternative, DO NOT WORK AS WELL. Citing two examples - SIN CITY which is near-tolerable acting paired with an absurd choice of black and white, tantamount to robbery, and GOOD NIGHT AMERICA which is all and about the same. The dilemma with black and white productions is that regardless of how well it comes together, there seems always a thread of an argument in the back of one's mind that if one must resort to black and white to make one's point, one might be better served as a charcoal artist. Color is the medium of life. From a budgetary perspective, black and white films save money as the 'challenges' of color, which, in a good feature, can be excessive, are thus eliminated. Yet complications arise - for instance - I wasn't sure if that was blood or motor oil dripping from that guy's hand. Similarly, the entire cast in SIN CITY could have been wearing hot pink, in shades of course, and we would never know. Yet of course this is no excuse to dislike a movie - or is it? One wonders, however, that, if PI production would have had more money, would they have opted for color? Moot point. It's done.  Notwithstanding the obvious that I don't prefer black and white movies and incidentally don't know lots of people who do, PI, although a courageous artistic attempt with significant merits ranging from creative camera work, clever symbolism and high-octane guts, seems to lanquish for other reasons. Despite PI's visceral intensity which is delibertaely hot-wired throughout, spinning out scenes that sizzle the nerves, after Max's third or fourth headache it gives up the ghost. As as result, the movie stays earthbound, weighted down by a mediocre revolving-door plotline (obsessing man chases number grail looking for key to life while beset by outside forces including the recycling feeds of his own troubled mind), unremarkable narrative with a gem here and there, failing repetitive effect and thin, uninspiring 2-D support cast, leaving the movie wanting for depth and intelligent character interplay. Unresolved imagery and scenes lent the impression that this creative endeavor was a bit out of control and ad-hoc which is no fatal flaw in and of itself but in this case was signficantly detractive. Despite a reasonably decent stockpile of cinematic victories the battle wasn't won. The themes inspiring PI have excellent potential however this movie trafficked the runway like an antiquated flying machine - airborne one second, belly down the next. As a fine creative exercise, the creators are praised for their effort and bravery - PI is as bodacious as a skunk engaging rush-hour traffic and commands the watcher's attention until that undefined moment when boredom sets in. Contains subterranean theme seedlings which likely served as brain fertilizer for the subsequent more advanced spin-off -  "A Beautiful Mind" 
 Although the video was easy to follow, there was no variation between the segments.  The 10 minute segments were basically the same. I was looking for a quick video that I can do in the morning but it seemed that I spent most of the time warming up and stretching and then continuing with the same moves.  If you are at all experienced and are looking for a quick targeted workout this is not the video for you 
 Buy the "Office Fish Tank" only if you want to end up sitting around at work and watching your dead fish float around at the top!   This "tank" doesn't even hold a full gallon of water. The "decorations" take up an ungodly amount of space in it and have sharp edges which can be harmful to your fish. You can't just "rinse and refill" an aquarium either. You need to treat the water first, or you'll kill your fish even faster. But maybe that would be a blessing for it, when compared to having to live in those conditions?  If you're going to spend 25-30 dollars on a fish tank, just go to Wal-Mart and buy their 10 gallon kit! It's not much more expensive, and your fish will be MUCH happier with you! 
 The secret is this:  Martians are plotting to take over the late, great planet Earth.  And the way to do it is by releasing inane books like 'The Secret' and then release it also on DVD for those people who don't know how to read.  And while these people are dreaming of those Gucci handbags on the other side of the window in their dreams late at night, the Martians will sneek up on them and tickle their toes and scare them half to death.  Or all the way.    And then they will take over the planet.  While we all sleep.  (We don't have to fear Communists anymore.)  Just those Martians.  Winston Churchill once said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."  That's not true.  We have to fear those Martians 
 It really is to bad that a book like this would ever be allowed to be published.  Howard Sounes is just another name on a list of men that invaded the life of this man.  What kind of man would take information from every source he could find about a person that he never knew and write a book about it.  Howard is the prime example of a man that Bob most desperately tried to avoid throughout his entire career.  It truly is a shame that everybody keeps giving the character Bob Dyaln reasons to regret talking to people on paper in the first place.            
 i have read 5 graham greene books and this is by far the lamest of them. this was conceived of first as a hollywood movie, and it shows. the book is not much more that a silly, corny thriller (just what hollywood orders over and over and over). there is very little character development involved, & the the sense of place (vienna after world war ii) could have been given much greater depth, as well. this is simply a plot being rushed onto the big screen ( a half-baked, lame plot, at that) to make some cash. pass this one by. 
 I've been a They Might Be Giants fan for several years and I am about to become a teacher, so I have been perusing many children's books lately and decided to check out Bed Bed Bed.  I listened to the book with the CD and the thing that stuck out at me the most about this book was the pacing. "Impossible" is the longest song, but all its lyrics are crammed into two spreads. While listening, I found myself becoming bored looking at those pages so long. At that point, the book just seemed like a decorated lyrics page.  "Happy Doesn't Have to Have an Ending", though only 3 spreads (including the title page), was much better paced because of its fast tempo.  "Idlewild"'s three spreads were perfect, since it was a short song with few words.  However, "Bed Bed Bed" was a whopping 11 spreads long, even though its time length was just a bit shorter than "Impossible". I know it's the title song and should probably have more emphasis, but in this case, it meant that I had to flip through one line pages so quickly that I didn't even have time to glimpse at the pictures if I wanted to keep up with the song! I would have much rather had more images of the shape-shifting imaginary creatures in "Impossible" than individual pictures of kids doing things like brushing their teeth and sitting around.  I got this book thinking that it would potentially make a unique addition for a listening center in my classroom, but if I had such a hard time keeping up with the book, I imagine my students would be even more frustrated.  If only a few changes were made, this book would be much better, but for now, if I want a visual representation of They Might Be Giant's kid songs, I'll stick to Here Come the ABC's. 
 The windtunnel II is a poorly constructed vacuum.  It is less than six months old and the motor for the HEPA filter had to be replaced.  It is very messy when you have to empty the tank.  Dust and dirt collect around the hepa filter and falls down when you are emptying the tank. 
 If you want to be scared and paranoid through your first pregnancy, then this is the book for you. This book has no insight on anything. It is vague. It doesnt explain anything in detail. It talks about every possible thing that could go wrong but probably wont. Each chapter lists all the symptoms you might be expeiriencing, but that is as far as that goes. Its not a very good book to turn to you if you have concerns because it will just make you have more! You might as well ask your doctor because this book constantly refers you to your doctor. It has no insight or answer for anything unless you have a high-risk pregnancy 
 i went on a "read 'em all" thing a while ago.  the plot is an importaint issue in today's society but it is really dense and has so many abreviations and  appendices that i thought my head would explode. i feel it would be more intereresting to  listen to Pat Collins. Channel 4 news.  i understand that people outside the maryland virginia dc area would have no idea who he is but he talks in a monotone.  i understand that there are people who enjoy Crichton may be offended but i feel that it is true.  i read medical novels all the time and this is the most lethal of them all.   thank you for you time  yours truely  Kruphnehdahpheweundikaniswalyniaphorganopop  
 At first I didn't realize that you have to use Amazon's software to load onto the Zen.  Once I figured that out (actually my husband figured that out) the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do.  I wasn't able to edit the stars.  If I could I would give this 5 stars.  If you have tried some other sites for the Zen, they are much more difficult to use. Amazon's Unbox is great for the Zen 
 not worth it. very low quality paper, low quality reproductions, bad ink.... publisher has put his profit over any quailty for the reader 
 Man, I don't know what the other reviewers of this movie were smoking, but it should be illegal!  This is, first off, a terrible DVD: 4:3 (full screen) format, with a dark, muddy picture.  Worse, the plot is typical, predictable, and poorly written.  Other than looking for glimpses of Teri Hatcher's body, sitting through this fiasco is a total bore.  I was also surprised at how bad Teri's acting was in this movie, since I've seen her do much better in things she was in previous to this.  That is probably the fault of the director, Erik Anjou, a third-rate director (at best!) who has done a total of two movies and one documentary.  Gee, I wonder why he isn't in more demand (NOT!)!  I can enjoy "B" movies, and bad movies, but this one is just so totally non-involving that it is not even good enough to laugh at.  I can't imagine that this mess was released on DVD for any reason other than to cash in on Teri Hatcher's current popularity, and to suck the cash out of people who are anxious to see a younger (29 year-old) Teri Hatcher nude.    Rent this, if you must, but, wow, there is no reason anyone should want to buy a movie this bad 
 Where I can I begin? It was boring, it dragged the story on, and I don't know why half the people were in the story. It was very confusing. I almost didn't finish the book because it was that boring. This is the only Buffy book that I would recommend that people shouldn't read 
 It apparently doesn't strike people as odd that Bush does not belong to a congregation and rarely goes to any church. Too busy? He spends more time on vacation than any President in history. Too disruptive? Carter not only attended a Washington Baptist church every Sunday, but taught Sunday school. Bush isn't alone; Reagan didn't attend church while President, either 
 The Virgin Suicides starring Kristen Dunst, Josh Hartnett, Kathleen Turner and James Woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline. This film is directed by Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), I really tried to like this movie but I was fooling myself, you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the Coppola legacy but just because your father is Frances Ford Coppola doesn't mean you belong in the same category as best director of all-time. Sometimes magic does not stirke twice. How can all five sisters end up killing themselves, their homelife wasn't that unbearable, a lot of parents are religious, but that doesn't mean you'll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide. Kristen Dunst just gets on my nerves, her acting is the same in every film. Don't believe the hype, The Virgin Suicides is not a groundbreaking, poetic film 
 Looks nice but the roll does fall off and thick paper towels can rub the top edge of the unit closest to the cabinet. Item is being returned 
 If you have read "Reunion" or "Einstein's Dreams", you'll be quite upset with this novel.    It seems rather limited in its scope, and is lacking metaphor like Lightman's other works.  He has developed as a writer since this book, however.  Don't let this one discourage you from exploring his other wonderful novels.  
 probably the most annoying book i have read on the topic in a long time. christine has a crush on one of the subjects in the book and that makes for a boring read. the only good thing i can say about it is that some ' muggles' may find it of passing interest...but i seriously doubt if they would read the whole book. there are so many more in print that would satisfy your interest that are much,much better! if you are serious and have a certain intellectual capacity,please dont waste your tim 
 opened the sealed DVD case and Get Shorty was inside and not the Usual Suspects.   I sent it back requesting a replacement and did not get a replacement.  I got a credit, I think.  Not sure.  I would rather just have the correct movie 
 this book is amaterurishly written and edited and poorly final-proofed. organization is helter skelter.  biggest complaint is way too much fluff.  in fact, the book is mostly fluff.  very little on scoring and strategy other than the obvious qualitative stuff.  hotels.  how the riders get on the bus. did you really want to know the secrets of the podium girls?  well there aren't any. but the writers seem to think you want to know that.  maybe you do.  a MUCH better source for everything technical about the Tour is in Wikipedia.  save your money and shelf space and look it up 
 If you want to read about scientific facts this is not the book for you.  The scientific underpinnings of this speculative book are briefly mentioned and not elaborated upon in much detail.  It's better to just read his paper on the somatic marker hypothesis (which is disputed by the way).  Without a background in neuroscience it is difficult to evaluate his ideas in a serious way, and anyway he asks for introspection (a la William James) from the reader more than anything else 
 Buyer beware: this Elektra version of the wonderful Judy Collins "Colors of the day" has bad mastering. The tape Elektra used was obviously played back with Dolby-C, while not encoded as such. This disc should have been taken off the market. Try and find the gold disc instead 
 The relationships between the various characters weren't convincing and I failed to connect to the main character, Lottie, at all.  The book seemed to ramble on, and didn't catch my interest.  There were a few parts where the action picks up, but they were like tiny islands surrounded by a vast ocean of blandness 
 While many of the poems are fine, some are morbid.  For example, one talks about a boy swimming through the great lakes and drowning, and another talks about grandpa going down the drain and there now being one grandpa fewer. One talks about a dead father who has been haunting his son for 17 years.  This book is completely inappropriate for cihldren 
 Why New Orleans Matters is a short, small format book that attempts to make a case for why the New Orleans that was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath in September 2005, should somehow be restored to author Tom Piazza's vision of the city.  The bulk of the book recounts places, events, customs and people that made Piazza's hometown of 11 years so special for him.  What he describes will be familiar to anyone whose knowledge of New Orleans extends beyond what is covered in a Gray Line tour.  Writing just weeks after Katrina blew away it was too soon to correct, so Piazza repeats, false or overblown media stories that  proved to be false.  Piazza's life, house and possessions were as ruined as the city he loves and he recounts a brief trip to salvage his and a friend's remnant belongings.  He correctly, appropriately and too briefly describes it and grieves for that loss.  That's the book's second theme.  The third theme is Piazza's demand that New Orleans be magically rebuilt to recreate the rare habitat he believes will draw back musicians, street dancers, workers and the underclass whose fragile spirit animates the true (i.e., Piazza's version of) New Orleans.  Unfortunately Piazza does not provide a single specific idea as to how this can be done.  But he clearly tells us it can NOT be done by property development types.  So who does Piazza think is up to the task?  Would it be the same local and state officials who, along with federal agencies failed the city before, during and after Katrina hit?  Piazza better hope so because New Orleans' mayor during the hurricane,  Ray Nagin, was elected to another term in office after this book was written.  In his introduction Piazza asserts that New Orleans "inspires the kind of love very few other cities do.  Paris, maybe Venice, maybe San Francisco, New York... the list is not much longer."  While overlooking Piazza's Western Eurocentric view as to what kinds of cities inspire love among the world's inhabitants, somebody should tell Piazza that dozens of well-loved cities have essentially vanished without a trace throughout history, although their residents' unique spirits didn't necessarily die.  Likewise, New Orleans' spirit will animate other cities just as people who initially came from Africa, Greece, Italy, the Middle East, France, Spain and England, Ireland and elsewhere brought the spirit of those places and combined them to create New Orleans at the particular moment Piazza stumbled into the mix and pronounced it "good".  Already some New Orleans musicians are putting roots down elsewhere - several reportedly decided to stay, of all places, in Portland, OR - and no doubt writers, artists and other creative souls are doing the same.  And many of its disbursed former residents are discovering that the price they paid for New Orleans' colorful folk life was enduring schools, police, government services and economic opportunities that were far inferior to those available to them in other American cities.  Tom Piazza needs to wake up and smell the beignets.  Old New Orleans is forever gone.  New New Orleans will arise.  Le bon temps roulette 
 This high chair was great to start, but after a while the tray table would come loose on one side during meals. I thought it was me, at first, not latching it correctly but we soon realized it was my 9 month old releasing the clasp.   Reluctant to change chairs we persevered and now, 3 months later, she can remove both sides entirely and send the tray and its contents crashing to the floor. I am worried that she will either trap her fingers as the tray comes loose or bruise her legs as the tray falls to the ground.   If you are looking for a chair to last you into toddler-hood and your child learns quickly, don't buy this one. I am looking for a replacement before my daughter hurts herself 
 It's a pretty terrible book overall. It's more like "Dick and Jane Go Downtown." There is plenty of information here concerning the band but Bowman's arrested development writing style makes the sledding rather tough, and at other times, outright laughable. One example is the purported "mystery" concerning how many times Byrne sings 'fa fa fa fa fa fa' in Psycho Killer's recorded performances, live performances, and the six fa-fa-fas documented on the liner notes for Talking Heads '77. As Bowman writes, "The mystery may never be solved". So gobsmacked was I to learn this that I nearly spilled me Jameson's down me loonpants! It also doesn't appear that Bowman actually spoke to any band members for this book. Further, he wears his own literary inclinations on his sleeve: if I read one more likening of Tom Verlaine or Patti Smith to Beaudelaire or Rimbaud I'm going to puke. It's just a not very good book - it reads more like undergraduate hero worship than objective critique. The photographs included in the book are laughable in their triviality. Only the captions are worse. Save your money, this is a real dud 
 I car camp around 6 weeks a year. Every night on a different spot. I was looking for a light and sturdy table. Easy to setup and easy to pack. This table is not the right table for me. Yes it's light. That's the only good atribute I can find for this table. It's cumbersome to setup. The plastic tabs that hold it together are very fragile. The end caps on the ribs of the top surface started falling off even before the table was assembled. It's low to the ground. I would not buy this table again, nor I would recommend anyone to buy it. I give it one star because I can't give it any lower.  Alvaro Sacramento, CA 
 Man, you can't keep selling the same book forever and keep everyone satisfied. I liked the way they presented the idea of BW, but it was seriously outdated. They should make enhancements and upgrades atleast one in two year 
 The problem with this movie is the same problem I see in 90% of movies released by Disney. Although I seem to be the only person to notice this, most Disney movies are a beginning and an end with little to no substance in the middle. In this film for instance, Simba is your normal curious, happy and mischevious child just of course, he's a lion who is next in line to become the next king. His father is thrown off the side of a mountain killing him which causes Simba's problem. Led to believe he is the cause he runs into exile. Good way to start an animated Children's movie I think. About 7-10 minutes later he's grown and on his way to reclaim his place. Where the depth of the story should be is put into a short montage instead of showing his feelings and growing up and when he accepts his reponsability you never fully get a feeling of how hard it is for him. And how easily convinced he is to come back is lame in it self. Timone and Pumba are good characters to have an mixed with The Hiena's(however you spell that) make for really funny characters. But the story as most Disney movies sucks and is really just recycled from every other Disney movie. With exception of the Pirates Of The Carribean movies the company really has done nothing I see should give it half the hype it gets. And on a quick side note. Am I the only one who feels like Disney only spits out these movies to create the endless stream of merchindise that makes the weakest of characers a god in the Disney world. I mean, you can buy an action figure of the midget in the Pirate movies and making Snot Rod who appears in Cars for like 1.5 minutes in like 5 diffent toy car forms that I've seen. Disney Movies in General are nothing more than 85 minute long comercials for a slew of cloths, toys and other worthless collectables. The whole reason the Pirates of The Carribean was ever conceived was to advertise a a ride within Disney World. You can say movies like Dogma, Scarface and The Exorcist are evil. But none try to draw your worship and aww harder than Disney. In other words Disney is the real Devil and Watching Disney movies will damn you to HELL!!!-haha. (for real. watch if you want. but if people gonna dog my taste for being more racey I'm gonna spend that judgemental pendelum around and let you think about what could truly be a sin against God. Remember the 1st Commandment and see if Disney isn't trying to go against it with the way it attempts to pound these characters into your and your kid's head so much that it;s as if these movies, merchindise and mouse ears are the worlds greatest gifts to mankind as if Mickey Mouse is Jesus Christ himself reincarnated as a dirty f**kin' rat 
 AC/DC is no doubt one of the best rock bands of all time, but they are not growing as musicians. Sure, they can rock like they used too, but they seem to be out of ideas. The well is dry. Put out a anthology already!!! At least my favorite band Deep Purple keep coming up with good stuff, and with imagination! The fact that Purple's music continues to fascinate as well as puzzle after all this time is evidence we are dealing with art of the highest caliber.   Anyway, better luck next time Angus & Co.  Stiff Upper Lip ~ AC/DC : 2 stars  
 The only thing exciting about the book is the title.  I could not wait to get the book and read it.  I can't remember being this disappointed in a book - ever.  There is nothing of any value in this - just warmed over hyperbole.  I am so po'd that I wasted money on this rip off 
 This book was quite disappointing, so much so that if it were possible I would ask for my money  back. The author belabors her writings to the point that it becomes irritating. For instance, she explains how electricity heats the filament of a bulb to make it light up. Superfluous information! She also - as another reviewer wrote - publishes all her pictures in black and white, even those she took in color. What was the purpose of that? To make the book cheaper to print?  There is some useful information in the book if you take the time to sift through it all, and it could have been condensed into half the size without losing any valuable content 
 Can't tell you how well it works as it was broken! The cd lid does not close!  
 The history is very, very slow in developing and basically the whole book is noneventful. JB is sent to Bologna and the he came back. Period. Some people apparently wanted him dead! At least that's what Grisham tell us from the start, but then simply nothing happen.  But the most annoying thing - being myself italian - is to read so many mistakes in the parts of book written in Italian!! You fun readding this review? Notto really, I thinko but maybe picture the now you have how of italians parts off Brokker like sound 
 Okay so in the beginning, I was so excited about this perfume.  It smelled AMAZING and the scent lasted FOREVER.  When I say forever, literally forever.  You spray it on after your shower in the afternoon and then go to sleep?  It lasts until the next afternoon.  It's not even just a weak scent that's left on you.  It's like as if you've been spraying it constantly.   But here's the bad part.  After using it for awhile, I felt sick in the stomach becuase the scent was so strong.  I felt like the scent was a little too deep.  It's great for people who like strong distinct scents.  If not though, this isn't the product for you 
 This story just isn't one of Heinlien's best.  More than many sci-fi writers his works have managed to hold themselves and not age.  Podkayne of Mars doesn't.  In tone it starts similar to many of his other coming of age/adventure stories with a female lead, Podkayne instead of a male protagonist.  Podkayne has ambitions of being a space pilot and her mother is much sought after engineer.  Before long Poddy is cuddling babies and deciding she'd rather be a department head in nursing on a spaceship than be a pilot.  Ok, so it isn't really Heinlein's fault that this book reflects prejudices of the era, but there is a strong moral message that a woman's place is in the home.  Poddy does take action to go save Clarke at the end, but when threatened, she faints, practically grovels and waits to be saved.  There are two endings neither which are very good.  Both take potshots at Podkayne's parents for not raising their children right, despite the moral fiber shown by Poddy and bravery shown by Clarke 
 I bought this camera two years ago, the pictures were always perfect, even though from the sixth month it started getting stains everywhere, but then i found out that it was normal, not good but it usually happens to this cameras. But the worst of all is tha fact that it displays the Error 18 (E18), the lens gets stock and the camera won't work at all. I searched in google about it, because the user guide says nothing about this error, and then I read many reviews that said that there was nothing to do about it and many Canon cameras have the same defect... I am really mad and dissapointed on CANON, i will never buy a camera of this brand, and I wouldn't recommend it, unless you are willing to buy a camera for 2 years or LESS and then throw your money to the trash 
 This might have been a good magazine article although it's been done a 1000 times before.  But,  a book and at that price.  Check out the used book prices.  That's what this book is worth 
 Don't buy this book, please! The man is a complete fake. He's degrees are totally worthless. He is making money off of people looking for help and tricked into believing his marketing hype. Just do some research on Google and you'll discover the truth about him 
 The purpose of this book, according to the author's introduction, is "a moral biography" rather than "a life history."  His point is that there is a "distancing" between ourselves and Washington; that he has become more myth and metaphor than man.  The book aims to connect us today with Washington's character and personality.  The author goes into great depth about the literary works (such as Addison's Cato, Bollingbroke and Filmer) that Washington read, but I feel Brookhiser is reading too much into these and provides no evidence of how Washington reacted to these works.  The effect is to continue the distancing between us and Washington by not discussing the man himself; just the influences around him.    I think also the author misses some very important points.  For example, in the Introduction, the author says "it is not important to Washington's public career...what his stepchildren were like" but then devotes the entire last section of the book to metaphorical fatherhood of the Nation without discussing Washington in the role of an actual parent.  I'm sorry, it is important!  It tells more about his character than do the books he read.  Another tool the author uses to connect us to Washington is to use modern-day examples.  At first I appreciated references to Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich and Ronald Reagan.  However, after about a half-dozen of these it just makes the book seem dated.  This is the first biography of Washington that I have read.  I finished the book not knowing much more about him than when I started.  I learned more about him reading Joseph Ellis' American Sphinx (about Jefferson) and David McCollough's John Adams.  Which is sad; it is clear that Brookhiser had high hopes for this book and gave it a lot of thought.  I just thought it missed the mark and didn't serve its own objectives 
 This book is soooo terrible! not worth reading AT all! First off, you have this image in your head of this guy and a girl... but Frank gets these people in HIS very own sdtory mixed up.... the genders you never are quite sure of since one is suppose to be a girl, but suddenly changes to "he says" "she says" crap! Frank get your chacacters sexes' straight before right a book. This was the biggest waist of time in my life to even read a sentance of any of his books! Just absolutely terrible!!!!!!!!!! Read it and waist time and money on something as pathetic as this book, you'll see what i mean. 
 I really wish I could recommend this book. I love the idea of capturing Romans and using them as soldiers on other worlds. However, the writing style is so disjointed and hard to follow, that I found myself struggling to stay with it, instead of flowing with it and really enjoying myself.  Drake will begin a paragraph with a sentence describing some object in the scene. Then he will start writing about something completely different for the rest of the paragraph, and maybe a whole page, before going back to the original object. By the time he gets around to writing about the object, you have started to forget the original context. Reading this book requires a lot of re-reading to make sure you follow what is going on.  Another problem is that there are no chapter breaks. The book is divided into mini-books that are much longer than most chapters. So there aren't many good places to take a break and rest your tired mind (and it DOES get tired after struggling to follow the text).  Finally, the book doesn't have an interesting pacing structure. Until the final 50 pages, the book feels very monotone, empty of build ups, climaxes, dramatic slow moments etc...  This is another factor in the difficult reading. without the minor buildups, fast-paced action, and slow dramatic moments, it all starts to blend together into, one, long, droning, narrative.  And then the end hits you.  Its like Drake came back after a long recess. The writing style seems totally different. The final 50 pages are actually entertaining and much easier to follow than the vast majority of the book. But then it ends. Its so suddenly that I was angry. I plowed through all 250+ pages of mediocrity, finally hit the good part, and then it ended in what seems like mid chapter.  I can not recommend this book unless you are a die hard Drake fan 
 The Ediacaran fossils are an interesting chapter in the history of life. They are also an interesting chapter in "The Garden Of Ediacara." Unfortunately, this book appears to have more material in it about Mark McMenamin than it does about the subject matter. Is it truly necessary to show a photograph of a hotel in Namibia or the author's official Mexican fieldwork badge in order to discuss the first complex life forms? I don't think so. The reader truly has to pick and choose what paragraphs to read in order to learn about Ediacaran fossils as opposed to the author's travelogues. Much of the material is simply extraneous. Proper editing would have made this book much more interesting and pleasurable 
 I thought I'd be nice in giving film two stars even though it pretty much deserves none at all. I wasn't old enough at the time, but I'm sure fans were slightly bemused at the re-emergence of Friday the 13th.  Tommy, now a teenager (and a bloody old one at that) is residing at the local mental institution still traumatised by the terror of Jason and also the death of his mother.  Tommy is plagued by dreams and nightmares convinced that Jason is back from the dead.  And it seems he may be right, when a series of murders begins. But who could it possibly be THIS time. Jason is dead, isn't he? It's up to Tommy to fight his demons once again and get to the bottom of things before he himself becomes the victim of Jason Voorhees? Friday the 13th Part 5 is a perfect example of how sequels in horror can ruin what went before.  The body count in this is ridiculously high and the gore itself leaves a lot to be desired.  Was it really necessary? Is too much, too much? The only ounce of credibility in this film is Harry Manfredini's reprisal musical score.  Other than that, you'd be forgiven for skipping this Friday the 13th entry 
 This small package of noodles came to me in a huge box, which I thought was a huge waste and completely unnessecary.  And, when I opened the box, a small melted ice pack failed to keep the noodles cold, so they were hot and smelled terrible.  I had to throw them in the trash outside right away because of the smell, and called Gristedes and left an upset, yet polite message.  It has been almost a week and I have not heard from them.  Don't waste your money on this supposedly "great deal."  It's not worth it 
 I have never before written a review for a book, but in this case I felt I owed it to my fellow readers to warn them to save their money. Except for "Bumberboom", and the very last story in the volume (Which was fairly interesting), this book was a complete waste of my money and time. The writing was laborious, complex to the point of being incomprehensible; As if the writers were engaged in a contest to see who could write the most cerebral gibberish. As I said, save your money 
 When my kindergartener brought home her first library book I was thrilled to be the one to read it to her. I imagine the aim of this book is to teach kids to not show off. What it does instead is teach kids that if they have a special talent not only should they not enjoy it but envious kids that do not share the same ability are justified in using mean words like , "We don't like him, do we" and "go away". BUT when the special ability can provide something desirable for the mean kids all of a sudden it's fine that the child excels at something. No wonder that "smart kids" have a hard time socially when kids are taught that being special is a bad thing unless they can appease their peers 
 Lamer Daddy = Lamer Band. VDH thinks invading Iraq was a good thing, even though is was not a direct threat to the US. VDH thinks invading 'Mexicans' want to over run the US, even though much of the land was stolen by the US from the aboriginal population. Me thinks VDH is a hypocrite 
 Whoever wrote this book has a great idea in having students actually working things out to find solutions, but to expect students to discover in an hour what geniuses discovered after many years is unrealistic. There are little to no examples, no glossary, and the hints are useless in helping the student understand the concept. All in all, a very poor book 
 Two Federal Marshals are dispatched to a remote island housing a mental institution for the criminally insane to look for a missing patient named Solando.  Throw in a Hurricane that traps the Marshalls on the island, a lot of strange behavior, and you have the premise for Shutter Island.  The book does not live up to the expectations Dennis Lehane's readers expect from him (although looking at the other reviews I could be dead wrong about that).  There are glimmers of Lehane's talents, but the book feels like a rushed screen play.  There is action, there is mystery, there are menacing situation, but it is all very glossy and superficial.  The reader will also probably solve the mystery by page 150.  It is not all grim however.  The book does flow nicely, reads easily and the last 25 pages were very powerful emotionally.  I did enjoy the book, but would expect something like this from James Patterson (this would be an achievement for him) but not from a fresh talent like Dennis Lehane 
 this movie is one of the 3 ~worst~ movies I've ever seen. these 98 minutes seemed more like 6 hours.  and for chrissake - he's NOT an american 
 Mos Def ( I think his name is ) had the most annoying voice throughout the whole movie.  I wish he would shut up about his stupid cake shop already.  If people were trying to kill me I wouldn't keep blabbing about the most senseless things on and on and on.  People are coming to kill me, why don't I talk really loud so they can find me.  Was he mentally challenged or what?  I was able to watch the whole movie as the two main characters were fun to make fun of ;)  Enjoy talking like Eddie (Mos Def) for hours after you've seen it to amuse your friends 
 I really disliked this book. If it wasn't for Sam & Alyssa's story, the one "true saving grace" of this tired-awful book, I would have given it 1 star.    The plot: Meg's ten year old daughter and grandmother are kidnapped by terrorists. They threaten to kill Meg's daughter and grandmother if she doesn't comply with their wishes. They want her to kill or bring them one of their extremist opposers. She kidnaps this guy and decides to turn him in to the terrorists or kill him herself.    Completely unbelievable. This small, slight woman is able to drug and drag around a grown man? NOT!!  Plus, Meg doesn't care who she kills or hurts to get her daughter back. It was terrible. It gave her some rather unlikable character traits. I found myself not caring what happened to Meg, her grandmother or her daughter. She is completely unpatriotic. I could not figure out what John found so attractive about her. He's a Navy Seal. This is a man who puts his life on the line for his country. Would he really want to be with a woman who is completely nuts? I don't think so.    Plus the World War II story was a drag. Why bother? It was a waste of time and paper. Both Ms. Brockmann's and myself.    I find myself wondering what the hype is about Suzanne Brockmann. I have read four of the Seal Team 16 books, or rather tortured myself to read them. I later realize it is because I am trying to find out more about Sam & Alyssa's history. I first learned about them in "Wildcart Karmody's" story and have been reading the books in reverse sequential order to discover more about them. I have ordered Sam & Alyssa's story and truly believe that this will be my last Suzanne Brockmann book. Her love scenes are drab, her plots disjointed and with three to four storylines running consecutively, usually just plain confusing.    Suzanne, I'm truly disappointed 
 I had to purchase this book for a community college class I'm taking.  As a "textbook," it has been a complete disappointment.  The "science" is sketchy, the research is shoddy, and the huge holes in logic are brushed over with explanations like "you can't prove nearly anything empirically in education" (straight from page 8!).  Some of the concepts presented are interesting, but  since Mr. Jensen (no, he doesn't hold a doctorate) provides almost no citations for his claims, there is no way to check his assertions or determine where the theories come from.  The book reads like a multilevel marketing sales pitch.  In fact, you are encouraged to share it with your friends and colleagues and are directed to a website where you could empty your bank account getting "certified" in Mr. Jensen's unique, "empirically unproven" techniques 
 I suppose some people think that one can write anything in a book and call it "history."  But I think Smith's portrayal of the conflict is just too misleading to be called history.  Real people in real life do real things for real reasons.  But after reading this book, I had an image of wicked unarmed Zionists maliciously stealing land from hapless heavily armed Arabs.  It wasn't exactly what Smith had said.  But it was close enough to make me realize what was wrong with the book.  The constant whitewashing of Arab misdeeds and criticism of reasonable Jewish behavior had simply erased the motivations for the two sides in the conflict.  Are there books that do a better job?  Oh yes.  I'll give you ten examples of books that are far better, and there are many, many more:  The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Middle East Conflict (Bard, 2003) A History of Israel (Sachar, 1996) The Siege (O'Brien, 1986) A Young Person's History of Israel (Bamberger, 1985) The Rape of Palestine and the Struggle for Jerusalem (Casper, 2003) Atlas of the Middle East Conflict (Gilbert, 2002) Islam and Dhimmitude (Ye'or, 2002) Right to Exist (Lozowick, 2003) A Place Among Nations (Netanyahu, 1993) From Time Immemorial (Peters, 1984)  Try one of them. 
 The whole book is fantastic, great charts, beautiful necklaces. I statred making the rose designs the same day I got the book 
 Albert Hourani's A History of the Arab Peoples is a widely regarded general history of the Arab world. This is too bad, since as history the book is of low quality, with significant problems of organization and, where relevant to Hourani's apparent biases, factual accuracy. It does have its redeeming elements, but on the whole is for a variety of reasons not a reliable source as a general history of the Arab world, especially for the beginner.  Being the author of a general history of the Arab world myself, before I explain why I evaluate the book negatively I would like to suggest some alternatives, lest I be accused of attacking a rival publication out of self-interest. Philip K. Hitti's The History of the Arabs is a very detailed history which runs from pre-Islamic times to the 19th century. Arthur Goldschmidt's Concise History of the Middle East covers Turkey, Iran and Israel as well as the Arab world and is well-organized for beginners. It was the first general history of the Middle East I read as an undergraduate. Bernard Lewis' The Middle East focuses more on concepts and the flow of history but is also appropriate for those without a strong background in the region.  This book was first published in 1991. This review is based on the 1992 paperback version by Warner Books.  The initial weakness of this book begins with the very first chapter; although containing 458 pages of main text, Hourani's history devotes a mere seven pages to the pre-Islamic period. This is pretty amazing, for anyone familiar with that period, since Arab history prior to Islam is roughly as long as Arab history after it. Exactly how far back Arab peoples go in history is a matter of dispute, but certainly there were people one could call "Arabians" as far back as the beginning of the first mellinnium BC, or 1,600 years prior to Muhammad. The evidence is sporadic for sure, and no writer would give it equal prominence with later times, but seven pages is pretty paltry.  One might suspect an Islamic bias here, but the problem continues in the key early periods of Islam. The life of Muhammad and his immediate successors who established the basis for the Muslim world, spanning about a half century from Muhammad's first vision to the death of his son-in-law and successor Ali, get only 11 pages. The first Arab empire, the Umayyads (661-950), gets seven pages, and the Abbasid Empire (750-circa. 945), which is usually thought of as the "Golden Age of Islam," gets only six. This means 37 pages for the first 2,000 years of Arab history, including its framing epoch, and over 400 pages for the next 1,000. This would leave the uninitiated reader entirely without much sense of proportion.  What makes this book highly unrecommended for the beginner is its weak sense of organization. The middle time period between the collapse of Abbasid authority - roughly AD 950 - and the ascendance of the Ottoman Empire over the Arab world in 1517 is intrinsically a difficult time period to understand and a more difficult one on which to write a history. This is due to the fact that rather than there being one dominant power or a few powerful states, there is instead a multiplicity of dynasties with genuine authority in some areas not extending beyond the town level with a multifarious mixture of Sunni and Shia, Arab, Persian and Turkic ruling groups, not to mention the Latin states. Hourani makes no serious attempt to help the reader keep all of it straight by moving from a chronological approach prior to 950 to a topical one. There are ten chapters covering this time period and the social history of part of the previous two periods (the Umayyads and the Abbasids). There is one chapter which discusses the major power struggles of the time. If you want to understand the relative historical roles of the Buyids, the Fatimids, the Zengids, the Ayyubids, the Mamluks and their contemporaries, read something else.  It is within these ten chapters that this book contains its major strength - its "social history," or its description of the development of the Arab world. In fact I cited Hourani on the social history sections of my own book. In this regard, Hourani really is better than the alternatives. Over 200 pages of the book is devoted to detailing various aspects of how the Arab world came to be prior to the Ottomans. So for those who have already read a general history of the Middle East or the Arab world and want a more specialized knowledge, these chapters are quite useful.  I have several objections to how this book handles a variety of issues of current interest. This book was written during a time period when there was a great emphasis on negating certain negative images of Arabs and Muslims, to the point of deemphasizing any aspect of the Arab world which might be interpreted negatively. The word "jihad" doesn't even have an entry in the index, although it is used, or perhaps, misused. On page 247, Hourani describes a traditional view stipulating that the ruler has an obligation "to pursue jihad by maintaining the strength of the kingdom's defense..." This gives a misimpression, because legally jihad has two military meanings - the defense of Muslim lands and the Muslim community's collective obligation to spread Islam through conquest. Although jihad has a spiritual as well as martial application, its use is overwhelmingly in the military context, and while Muhammad's battles probably could be described as defensive, the vast majority of military actions between that time and the 19th century involved offensive operations (the Christian counter-offensives known as the Crusades being a major exception).  More broadly, the single most influential Islamist movement of the modern age, the Wahhabis, get only a few scattered mentions, and there is no real indication of the wave of extremism which by 1991 had been felt for some time. The primary non-Islamist ideological influence, Marxism, is discussed of course, but the influence of Nazism during the 1930s and 1940s is left out. Nazi Germany is mentioned once in passing, and in the same paragraph on page 331 Palestinian leader Amin Husseini is mentioned, but it isn't mentioned that he was a strong supporter of Nazis, that he moved to Germany during the Second World War and played an active role in the Holocaust, or that despite this he was made leader of the Palestinian cause by the nascent Arab League after the war.  Hourani's account of the 1967 is incredibly inaccurate, giving the impression that Egypt engaged in some bluster and then Israel started the war. He mentions Nasser's demand that the UN clear out of the Suez Canal zone, and includes the defense pact with Jordan, but omits a key fact - the mobilization of Egyptian forces in the Sinai. Once Egypt did this, Israel had no choice but to attack, because of its small population its economy could not handle an extended mobilization, while Egypt could. Hourani also doesn't mention the statements by Arab leaders to the effect that all Jews would be wiped out in the coming war.  On the whole, this is a useful book if one already has a framework understanding of Arab history and if one understands the slant that is being presented on issues of contemporary concern. Otherwise, I do not recommend buying it 
 I just graduated with a major in PR. This books lists 88 jobs in advertsing and PR. However, it is out of date. In the PR industry there are: bloggers, web site developers and other internet position. This books lists NONE of them. In advertising, some positions (like print traffic manager) are almost non-existant. This book needs to REMOVE old 1990's job titles and ADD the jobs that firms are hiring for in the 2000's. This review is for the 2006 version of the book (4th ed). I think the author has gotten lazy and needs to do a complete overhall. This book may be of use if you are looking for a job in PRINT advertising, but most advertising agencies seem to want a person with good design skills and not just newspaper print. This book NEVER lists web skills or HTML that many employers seek today. Sad 
 Pls. Rick Nielsen, "Tell Me Everything"! Why did  you guys get a sorry Producer like Ted Templeman  to Produce what could have been a great comeback  LP? If you Trick fans wanna be in 'My Gang' then  you gotta spread the news to pray for better ef- forts than this in the future if the Tricksters  are gonna stay employed!  'You're All I Wanna Do' and the title track, with it's "Mommy and Daddy" chorus, is kinda  cool and retro for 'Surrender' - now the mar- riage is on the rocks! Like Cheap Trick's ca- reer after this disgrace! It's enough to make  you 'Cry Baby'...Pls. bring back Brant! 
 Don't you all really want some kind of variety in your life. All the guys in Dipset are making the exact same songs over and over on different albums. There isn't anything original to what any of them are doing. When will you get tired of hearing about what these kats bought or what they are riding in? Most people are so wrapped in what they own that they don't even look at the skills of the rapper. Then most of the time the stuff you are mesmerized by, they don't own it they just rented it for the video. These guys have no talent and are flushing decent beats down the toilet 
 I wanted to cry when I put this book down because I miss the Danielle Steele that wrote 'Thurston House', 'Family Circle' and others.  For years now I have felt that she is simply putting out books because she is contractually obligated to by her publishers.  I really feel like her heart just isn't in it anymore.  She has become very idiosyncratic and predictable.  Every book has her main character 'being honest.' I keep reading because I am a loyal Danielle Steele fan and I write this in hopes she'll read it and either decide she is writing because she loves it (like she once did) or decide to retire and let us love her through her earlier works.  This book was just awful.  
  Use this one to put yourself to sleep; it's sappy and really doesn't provide the substance that merits the title... 
 More than one time I said to myself: That's it, Prince! I've had enough of your songs! But then again, I've paid the price just to see if I could discover another of his "pearls". And that's the case with "The Dance", the only one where apparently he's followed his instincts. As for the rest... Well, another composer trying to please the majority with his "easy hits". 
 Boy this movie was weird and psycho. I happen to like the weird movies but it was WAY off the psycho side for me. Friends try to cover up an "accidental death" from one of their friends when they try to pull a prank that goes horribly wrong. Things like this, I try to stay away from. Although I am glad I saw it so I won't always wonder if this movie was actually watchable or not. Now I know. I gave it 2 stars because the movie DID have it's charms. 
 I had to read this book in english class this year and it was absolutely horrid. The jokes weren't funny and the story was just stupid. Also, if you actually like the book, don't buy this edition because it falls apart. The book is about the battle of the sexes and it's stupid, pointless and boring. On top of it, you'll be really confused at times because of the old english. It's not a fun read more like a frustrating read. This is definitely one of my least favorite books of all time. 
 I regret buying this book. It's not a guide for young people to starting your own business unless you call part time babysitting a business or selling your goods at a flea market as having your own business. The "businesses" the author has in mind are are, for example, selling homemade goods to your friends or anyone else you can get to buy them. If you call having a lemonade stand  a business, then this book may pertain to you 
 Phil Jackson groupie and sometime ESPN.com writer Charley Rosen turns in a fun, but sometimes off-putting fictionalized account of minor league basketball life.  He develops the characters well and puts forth a decent plot.  However, Rosen's personal oddities drag the book down.  Rosen is absolutely obsessed with bodily functions and he repeatedly goes into way too much detail about farting, urination, defacation, etc.  At times, the book reads like an immature third grader's delight.  My roommates and I all read it and the general consensus was that the book was enjoyable, but Charley Rosen is a really weird guy 
 If you are looking for bellydance music, don't buy this one. With the exception of "I Cash Radii" and "Cybele", I find this music too dark and lifeless. Actually, most of it is not music, but industrial techno noise. Don't waste your money. If you are looking for some bellydance music that is not all that traditional, try Galactic Caravan 
 I just finished this book and I must say IT IS NOT " The thinking person's Bridget Jones" - The Independent. Whoever wrote that review should be fired ~ This main character in this book (Ariel) has very very very very low self esteem and acts really cheap. I didn't think that she was an interesting character. I kept thinking that the book would get better but it didn't, it was also too long because the character doesn't change or grow. The sex scenes described in this book were a little gross. Overall I didn't like it and I cannot recommend it. The only good thing I can say about it is that it has fast-paced writing. 
 This was THE WORST book I've ever read.  I literally read the last page while standing over the trash can, letting it fall into the can as I finished.  This book was so disjointed... It jumped around from past to present, from boyfriend to boyfriend and back and forth.  I was actually annoyed while reading it and can only be grateful that I didn't spend my own money on it!  There was no plot, no point and definetely no entertainment to be had in this very boring and very pointless read.  
 Loved his other books but this was all over the place, hard to read, and to apply 
 Not much to say about this one,just that it's REALLY bad. The only half way decent song is the flame, and that gets old fast 
 I was extremely disappointed in this book.  I kept waiting for something to happen besides "scanties", than technology came into play, but the storyline was so boring and nothing worth reading about happened 
 My kids think this is a better toy than our dog.  Wasn't worth the money I paid for it.  Comes apart too easy 
 And, if this is an illustration of the "joy" of writing sex, I would hate to see an illustration of the "horror" or writing sex.  One of the short-shorts in the version I purchased of this book details the experience of a male gas station clerk being highly aroused when another male enters his gas station and rapes him in the back room. Is this a sex scene worthy of a story to be sold as literature, or is it a transcribed version of something someone saw at a pay site on the Internet? Do we really want to be sending a message to the public that rape is an acceptable, exciting form of sexual intercourse? I can think of several victims I know who would not appreciate that, one of whom was killed by her attacker 
 I am an avid sports fan and I love football, but sorry, I didn't enjoy this book one bit. I kept waiting for the Grisham who writes compelling dramas (The Broker, King Of Torts) to pop out, but realized midway through it wasn't gonna happen. As someone else here summarized - "it's chick lit about guys who played high school football" 
 Once again Amazon sent me the tablecloth only, no napkins.  This is the second time.   I don't need anymore tablecloths.  I need napkins    
 lauding the virtues of non-make up era Kiss, Motley Crue, and GNR while at the same time stomping on Priest and Maiden it is obvious Chuck Klosterman was formerly a woman. I applaud her for writing about metal from a womans perspective 
 The author has her narrator("Cinnamon") spend most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating Scarlett,in a game of wish-fulfillment one-upmanship. Even though she's calling the shots,as it's her book, Scarlett still comes out miles ahead. Perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society,but there WAS once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism-even if misplaced-just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies,such as "Ivanhoe" presents.The story may have been one-sided,but it's the side MM chose to tell,and there's kernel of truth in the "myth" of the Old South,as in all myths.   Margaret Mitchell has nothing to fear from this silly so-called "parody",which is really a subconscious-or not so subconscious,in fact-effort to knock from her pedestal,that epitome of heroines-Katie Scarlett O'Hara and the wonderful Melanie Wilkes.As if Rhett would ever give any other woman a serious thought-he was obsessed with Scarlett.That's why he turned to women like Belle Watling.And to imagine Mammy killing the male babies,when she had been devoted to Ellen O'Hara from Ellen's childhood.Thank goodness this book isn't a pimple on the fanny of the classic GWTW,because what it is a a travesty-and not even a well-written or engaging one at that.GWTW will still be read and loved for all time,like the classic it is,when this book is selling for a quarter at garage sales.I didn't even pay that,thank goodness-the woman gave it to me,and I read it and burned it with the rest of the trash.I'd give it a negative star if there was such a rating.Ludicrous and laughable-try again,Ms Randall,and try to get over the jealousy of Scarlett and Co. Again,Margaret Mitchell need not fear,LOL 
   I'm afraid I have to agree with the other previously happy Memorex users in noting that Memorex quality/success rate has gone downhill.  I was skeptical when I read the other reviews and I stuck with Memorex, but I have seen the light now. For a year I was very successful with the DVD+R Memorex disks.  In the 25 pack spindles I would buy, they would all work....so in Aug '04 I bought 2 25 packs at Circuit City (a mistake?).   That appears to have been a waste of money.  I just tried to burn a copy of something and I ended up trashing 4 disks in a row.  I was  convincing myself it was my hardware or program or something else.  Then I remembered someone had given me a blank Sony DVD-R disk, so I thought what the heck, let me try that one.    Into the SONY drive it went and it copied without a hitch.   That was the final straw for my Memorex loyalty.  Out of a pack of 25, I have about 10 left, but have had to trash 6 of the 15 I used. Not a good success ratio.  Bye Memorex 
 First he says he cracked down on all those "liberals" but yet he admits to loving their evil ways. If this is as wishy washy as he can get, no wonder he and Sam Donaldson get along ! You can't expect to be credible if on the one hand you attack them but on the other hand enjoy a nice and cushiony rich job offer from these same "liberal media". If he were working as a farmer in Idaho for instance, he'd have more credibility but I'm not so sure Stossel says what he means 
 At first the book is good.After that the book gets a little dumb.I mean c'mon at frist she deosn't like him but when their cousin talks sqwot about him she tries to defend him and make her say ''Julluis is the baby of the world''.Witch was really dumb and odd.Also it uses unkind words like ''hate''.Get Chester's Way instead 
 This offensively simple-minded pamphlet of useless advice is only given out by managers about to lay-off as many people as they can.   Then, to take away from horrors of losing your job, you're meant to feel happy because "change is good".   Not only that... you're meant to believe that questioning change is for losers -- as if change just comes magically from above, and not as a result of corporate incompetence and greed at the highest levels.    If your boss gives you this book (or worse, makes you buy it yourself), I recommend getting "who cut the cheese" by Mason Brown, instead.  And also, remember to steal as many office supplies as you can 
 The book starts out well enough when banker Ben Hartman, in Switzerland on business, runs into an old college buddy who tries to kill him.  Then through a series of accidental discoveries, narrow escapes, and unbelievable coincidences, Hartman learns that practically everybody he knows, and everyone new he meets, is involved in an evil cabal bent on world domination. When you finally find out who the criminal mastermind is, it seems like something only Austin Powers' nemesis Dr. Evil could have pulled off.  Without giving too much away - I have to say that the ending involves the hero attempting a daring rescue from the villain's heavily-guarded, secret mountain lair.  And of course there is a scene where the villain feels the need to carry on a long monologue to explain his evil plot to the hero.  Yeah baby, yeah 
 The sole market segment this book MAY assist are people who have never moved.  The points made are so obvious that it could have been written by your next door neighbor, not an "insider."  The only "insider" aspect to this paperweight is that someone on the inside saw a market opportunity to cash in on a segment of the moving population with a catchy title and nice cover graphics.  The "ABCs" of relocating, as PART I is described, offers about a couple of paragraphs on MAJOR topics ranging from "Negotiating a Profitable Home Sale" to "Insurance, Finance and Estate Guidelines".....hardly subjects that can even be skimmed in a few paragraphs.  Not that I would expect a treatis, but to suggest in the index that such subjects are addressed, is nearly misreprestation.  In sum, if you read the index, you have read the book, because the information which follows, to be generous, touches on each  subject 
 I've gone through so many of these that I have lost count. For someone like myself who reads every night for at least an hour, the light lasts no more than two months. I don't mean the batteries -- I only use the light plugged into an outlet. But it just stops working suddenly after about two months on average. Very flimsy design, I guess. Yet I have continued to buy it because there's nothing else that lets you avoid batteries and is bright enough for a comfortable read. No wonder they don't offer any warranties! But now it looks like there are some other options and I have vowed never to buy this light again 
 This book is terrible.  It misses steps, and makes you do stuff that you would never do in the real world, and the stuff you do in the real word it leaves out. For people who know how to use AutoCad it is more confessusing.  Recommendation Do not buy, there are better books out there 
 This book is a scam.  Artist have to pay a steep price to get in this book, one that has very limited distribution and nobody of note will ever read.  They do the same with books of poetry, preying on the intense desire of artists to get their work out there.  Save your money.  Just look at the first few pages and you will see they have no design ability, thinking that more and brighter means artsy 
 Having served 32 years in the Marine Corps I was amazed at the massive amount of things in this book that are just not true.  Because of this, it casts serious doubt on the remainder of what the author has written. The  author titles his book "CAP Mot: The story of a Marine Special Forces  Unit in Vietnam".  CAP was never a "Special Forces" unit.  I  was in CAP myself and know of whence I speak.  Possibly the author, who  admittedly states that almost everything comes from his memory, recalls CAP  in the fashion that it is written.  However, for those who are interested  in serious scholarship of the subject, I would recommend they go elsewhere.   This might better be placed in the fiction section of libraries 
 This book is about as much fun to read as a book about differential equations.  Good concepts, but the context is very dry and puts me to sleep.  I've been in the industry for several years, and I bought this book as a reference.  But I find myself cringing every time I need to use it 
 My wife of ten years and me saw Brian on our first date in Providence RI he was amazing and holds a special place in my affections for that and other reasons, but this cd to me is a return to the lackluster ZZ Top/Sammy Hagar like songwriting of Nitro Burnin Funny Daddy. I totally understand wanting to stretch out of the rockabilly strait jacket some fans want to pin him in, but I think the man is more capable of the smart blues based americana rockabilly Springsteen and Dylan have explored than this stale arena rock like effort. Sorry, Brain I still love you man and will come out to your 2007 tour, just have to be honest that I really just can't dig this stuff 
 After Bush died off Gavin Rossdale was in limbo. recorded to dull solo singles and hit off acting...whihc hasnt helped much. Now He's finally back on track with a new band. my anticipation wasnt catastrophically high but its nice to hear signature raspy croon put around something new. but saqdly theres really nothing to say about the sound here. While surrounded by veterans (two Helemt on board and a former Rival Schools Drummer)they should of hit it off. But no one really brings anything fresh to the table. Stale distorted guitar jabs, sloppy bass, and rote drumming is the execution for sound;lifeless and faceless. Gavin Rossdale does what he can rapping his signature voice around warmed over guitar riffs. On ocassion they make it enjoyable on loud-soft dynamics on "wasteland" they crank up the punchy and actually melodic "boom box" and the band manages to make geunine quiter with affectivenesss "ambulances". but the band msotly shoots blanks, and too often the limitations of Rossdales voice constantly veer through.Pretty much the inevitable reveals the half assed of it all, And maybe one day rossdale will surround himself with better  and more animated muscian 
 This movie is the sequel to caged woman but not as good. For a movie like this you would expect a reasonable amount of nudity etc.You will be disappointed like I was . Some nice looking Italian women, but alas only a couple of scenes where they get naked.approx 2 minutes. The story line. Male prisoners escape and take over the womans prison 
 I purchase my unit a little less than one year ago and now I am shopping for a different brand.  It worked fine for the first summer season in Texas, but now that it is spring almost summer--it does not turn on at all.  I have completed all of the manual's troubleshooting in addition to purchasing a new bulb and cable for it.  But, it does not work anymore after only 1 summer usage!  I do not recommend!! 
 This book features some fine architect designed, contemporary homes.  ...but the title is very deceiving.  While some of these homes may employ the use of unconvention (suposedly cheaper) materials like corrated metal siding, most of these homes have complex forms, elaborqate steel detailing, and from a construcition standpoint appear very complex.    The book offers no real strategies for building on a budget.  For example, in one of the lightweight commentaries that accompany each house, the author states that the budget strategy was to use convetional wood framing!  How I would love to tell my clients that I could save them big bucks by using this new, innovative strategy.  Most, if not all the homes in this book appear far more expensive to construct than a typical builder's home or even a more convetional custom home.  In reality this is another one of this authors books that needed some type of cause to be published.  As with all of the authors books, the homes are elegent, yet the text is superficial.  
 Worked great for one week.  Hope I can return it.  
 This slap dash compilation of short descriptions was probably put together as a quick way to make a few bucks. The authors are indeed esteemed but I bet each one wrote their part from memory on a Sunday afternoon. The battle descriptions are dry and confusing--most of the maps are useless in determining the sequence of events. Geography seems to be sort of thrown in as a catchy way to snare amateur buffs like myself. I usually read reviews before I buy a book and this time I just "assumed" good quality due to the National Geographic Society imprimatur. Stay away 
 This is a very poorly written book. There is no coherence to it, no direction, no real point 
 this book is just another sex and cheap ones. I guaranteed you not to flip through this book more than once. Don't bother.  
 The VHS took quite a while to arrive. I had ordered 5 other items at the same time and it arrived almost 3 weeks later than all the others, I actually had given up on it's showing up.  The video itself rolls quite a bit at the end of the video when played. However, with the age of the movie, I will grant them some slack.  I was disappointed in service and the product.  I will not buy another movie from this seller 
 Didn't read the reviews.  Shame on me.  Shame on Disney.  This is nothing more than a CD - there are many fine Disney CD's to pick from.  Stock must be really hurting that they have to bite the hand that feeds them 
 I was disappointed in this book.  I had started getting these books on CD from the library amd thoroughly enjoyed the first few I listened to.  I enjoy the author's picturesque, almost poetic, descriptions of things.  Those descriptions were still there, but they did not connect well.  The mystery of the person murdered becomes an incidental by-line, not really crucial to the other goings-on in the story.  There is no expanation to why the return of the turkeys is of any significance and what do the cats' being able to communicate with them have to do with anything in the story line.  I felt very let down at the end of this audio book 
 This book may be helpful for some people who want to know more about possible conspiracies. Personally, I believe some of them; but that's not why I purchased this book. This book is highly misrepresented on Trudeau's infomecials. There are no specific recommendations for treatment of any illnes in this book. Only some vague references to start you on a paper chase. There is not even an index in the book to direct you to information on a specific illness. This book is basically another infomercial for his subscription website. 
 I can't understand why this book has 5 stars.  Yes, the binding is very pretty in red velvet.  However, the recipes are not very practical.  I am not looking for an every day cookbook here, either.  A good portion of the recipes, especially appetizers, use caviar.  If they don't use caviar, they use oysters.  I want to emphasize that I didn't purchase this book for every day cooking - I wanted something for those special nights.  I'm not complaining about expensive ingredients, or how long they take.  There's just no substance, nothing that will wow anyone.  I have found possibly 3 recipes that I can use.    For the average cook, this book is definitely a no.  You're not going to spend 5 hours on these recipes.  If you don't like caviar or oysters, again a no.  At least half of the recipes use one or the other, if not both.  For a good cook, one who enjoys spending time perfecting a culinary delight, there are many other good "couples" books out there, and many with much more variety.  I can't recommend this book as a cook book, but maybe as a nice coffee table book.  
 Exactly what my title says - how can a story with so many great monsters be so darn boring? Not to mention a Jack the Ripper plot?  It sounded great to me! I was wrong. Somehow Kelly Armstrong makes monsters in this book and their lives a total SNOOZE FEST.   First of all - her werewolves don't eat humans! What's the point of being a freakin' werewolf? Second - Her vampires only feed on humans once a year?  LAME!!!! Third - It felt like the entire book was just one big plan - harldy any action.  Characters spent way to much time having breakfast and making plans. Werewolves - HAVING BREAKFAST AT HOTELS! Fourth - She provides little to NO background story for the characters. Just when Armstrong starts to explain an interesting back story - she sends the characters to have breakfast at a diner or hotel. It's an obvious ploy to make readers purchase sequels. Ridiculous. Boring. I will not be reading one of her novels again.  It's a shame that such a great combo of monsters - that's why I bought it - turned out to be one of the least interesting books I have ever read.  Canadians like Armstrong shouldn't write horror novels - they're just too darn nice - and it shows in these peaceful and pointless monsters in "Broken" 
 Blame myself for not reading a more thorough description of it!  Is not what I thought it would be 
 I suppose I'm going to be alone in these reviews in complaining loudly about Ellis's stylistic sloppiness.  I recall a particularly amusing section in the introduction in which he describes Jefferson's message in the Declaration as "a recipe for anarchy," and proceeds to note that a government which "attempted to operate in accordance with these principles would be committing suicide."  Yes, Joseph, a government attempting to implement no government would be doing itself in.  Is this what passes for lofty criticism these days?  I picked up this book in an effort to become more interested in--and more fair to--Thomas Jefferson.  I went in believing him to be a cold, conniving man whose life was a long exercise in "do what I say, not what I do."  This book did nothing to change that impression; if anything changed, it was my opinion of Ellis, of whom I'd had somewhat higher hopes.  His writing is not nearly good enough to cover up his attempted slights of hand in excusing Jefferson's worst characteristics; in my book, "psychological agility" isn't distinguished from hypocrisy--it IS hypocrisy.    The book's tone reminded me rather startlingly of the modern theory texts I was once forced to read; full of unprovable suppositions and distinctions without differences.  
 But not quite. While I wouldn't say this was a terrible novel, I also wouldn't say that it was in any way memorable. Because of the wonderful dramatization on the audio cassette, I passed an afternoon at work more  pleasantly, being entertained by the acting skills of the readers. However,  if I'd been merely reading a text version of this story, I wouldn't have  finished it because the plot did not interest me enough to deserve my full  attention. The characters are too typical of a mystery novel, the prose  style unremarkable, and the ending not too exciting 
 Here are excerpts from Avery Cardinal Dulles' review in "First Things" (Oct 2005). _________________ The overarching thesis seems to be that in all these areas social change makes it possible for Christians to overcome the blindness that had previously afflicted their moral vision. The doctrinal change, in Noonan's estimation, is in many cases an about-face, repudiating the erroneous past teaching of the magisterium itself.   More than half of the book deals with slavery...Jesus, though he repeatedly denounced sin as a kind of moral slavery, said not a word against slavery as a social institution. Nor did the writers of the New Testament. Peter and Paul exhort slaves to be obedient to their masters. Paul urges Philemon to treat his converted slave Onesimus as a brother in Christ. While discreetly suggesting that he manumit Onesimus, he does not say that Philemon is morally obliged to free Onesimus....   ...[T]he popes were far from silent. As soon as the enslavement of native populations by European colonists started, they began to protest, although Noonan gives only a few isolated examples. Eugene IV in 1435 condemned the enslavement of the peoples of the newly colonized Canary Islands and, under pain of excommunication, ordered all such slaves to be immediately set free. Pius II and Sixtus IV emphatically repeated these prohibitions. In a bull addressed to all the faithful of the Christian world Paul III in 1537 condemned the enslavement of Indians in North and South America. Gregory XIV in 1591 ordered the freeing of all the Filipino slaves held by Spaniards. Urban VIII in 1639 issued a bull applying the principles of Paul III to Portuguese colonies in South America and requiring the liberation of all Indian slaves.   In 1781 Benedict XIV renewed the call of previous popes to free the Indian slaves of South America. Thus it was no break with previous teaching when Gregory XVI in 1839 issued a general condemnation of the enslavement of Indians and Blacks. In particular, he condemned the importation of Negro slaves from Africa. Leo XIII followed along the path set by Gregory XVI.   ...In A Church That Can and Cannot Change, Noonan gives only a few glimpses of this complex history. He correctly notes that the Catholic magisterium in past centuries never made an absolute condemnation of slavery as such. But he contends that John Paul II reversed the traditional teaching. In support he quotes a statement of John Paul II in 1992. Speaking at the infamous "House of Slaves" on the Island of Gore in Senegal, from which innumerable slaves had been exported, he declared: "It is fitting to confess in all truth and humility this sin of man against man, this sin of man against God." Noonan adds: "What this confession did not remark was how recently the sin had been discovered." But if we look up the quotation, we will find that the pope is here speaking of the slave trade, which had repeatedly been condemned. Far from changing the doctrine, John Paul is explicitly reaffirming the position of Pope Pius II, whom he quotes as having declared in 1492 that the slave trade was an enormous crime, magnum scelus.   Noonan has one further argument for doctrinal change. In 1993, in his encyclical Veritatis Splendor, John Paul II took, from Vatican II's pastoral constitution on the Church in the modern world, a long list of social evils: "homicide, genocide, abortion, euthanasia and voluntary suicide . . . mutilation, physical and mental torture and attempts to coerce the spirit; whatever is offensive to human dignity, such as sub-human living conditions, arbitrary imprisonments, deportation, slavery, prostitution and trafficking in women and children; degrading conditions of work which treat laborers as mere instruments of profit, and not as free responsible persons." Where Vatican II had called these practices "shameful" (probra), John Paul II calls them "intrinsically evil." In the same encyclical the pope teaches that intrinsically evil acts are prohibited always and everywhere, without any exception.  Did John Paul II, by including slavery in his list of social evils, effect the revolution in Catholic moral theology that Noonan attributes to him? It seems to me that if he had wanted to assert his position as definitive he would have had to say more clearly how he was defining slavery. He would have had to make it clear that he was rejecting the nuanced views of the biblical writers and Catholic theologians for so many past centuries. If any form of slavery could be justified under any conditions, slavery as such would not be, in the technical sense, intrinsically evil.   According to the logic of Noonan's argument, whatever holds for slavery would have to be said for deportations, subhuman living conditions, and degrading conditions of work. But could not degrading or subhuman conditions be inevitable, for example, after some great natural disaster in which mere survival is an achievement? Individual deportations of undesirable aliens occur continually as a matter of national policy today; mass deportations could perhaps be necessary for the sake of peace and security. If pressed, I suspect, the pope would have admitted the need for some qualifications, but he could not have specified these without a rather long excursus that would have been distracting in the framework of his encyclical. So far as I am aware, he never repeated his assertion that slavery is intrinsically evil. Neither the Catechism of the Catholic Church nor the recent Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church... speaks so absolutely.   For all these reasons Noonan's case for a reversal of doctrine is unconvincing. Jacques Maritain provided some helpful distinctions in his book The Rights of Man and Natural Law....[C]ertain attenuated forms of servitude, such as serfdom, are not opposed to natural law except in its secondary requirements or aspirations. These lesser forms of servitude...cannot be eliminated except by degrees....These concessions do not seem to me to be a reversal of the original teaching but rather a nuancing of it. 
 This book is a waste of money and time.  Blind hate and propaganda driven by ideology and a false sense of history 
 I bought this book because i thought the idea was brilliant.....a dude selling all his junk and traveling across country visiting the new owners of his former possessions.    I was extremely disappointed with this book.  I was really hoping to read a chronicle of this guys travels across country meeting the strangers who bought his old possessions and how it changed their lives.  All we get are  quirky ebay descriptions of used junk, and the disappointed customers who bought them....many of whom didn't want to be apart of his project.  I was expecting a contemporary 'On the Road', but all I got was a mini blog about a college student's old junk.  It did inspire me to mail the book across country to a friend who might appreciate it more than I 
 There isn't anything in this book that you won't find in Warren Buffett's annual letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (available for free at the Berkshire Hathaway website).  If you've not read those letters then I suggest you get right to it - they clearly lay out Mr Buffett's approach to investing and are written in a very easy to read, humorous and homely style.  This book pulls many of the highlights from those letters together in one place and lays out some major tenets and themes that could be said to make an investment "Buffett like".    If you're not familiar with Warren Buffett and have not read his letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway - then you will likely find this to be a good introduction to Buffett.  Anybody else should probably steer clear as there isn't anything new here. 
 What a waste of paper.  Some people should abstain from writing and Pinnock is one of them 
 By this time Piers Anthony is losing the magic that made him so refreshing a read in the first place. There's hardly anything new and even the puns are getting dull. I think its time he moved on to other works. If he doesn't, then his readers will 
 A rather toothless attempt at rewriting Strunk and White, or Chicago into "fun." Reference books shouldn't waste this much space on casual conversation. Get to the point--get Elements of Style, Elements of Grammar, and Chicago rather than this handbook 
 CONS *WON'T STAY IN PLACE I've tried several times to position this correctly and it always slips out of place (and baby is out of view) I even sent away for the extra tether thinking that was the problem but no luck. *WHY A REMOTE? Tell me what use the remote is when you have to press the on button which is located ON the mirror and then if you don't use the remote within five minutes to turn it on it automatically shuts off rendering the remote useless for the remainder of your car ride?  *THE IRRITATING SONG  too short and plays over and over and over (teeth gritting) *LEARN WHAT? I've also noticed in the teaching mode it doesn't light up the right item with what the voice is saying. My poor confused baby will now think a blue car is a boat and a yellow house is a car...  PROS *Now I have $39.99 less to spend on snacks that will hinder me from losing those pregnancy pounds I gained.. 
 The author wrote a book on sexuality, while considerably lacking knowledge about women and female sexuality 
 Hmm, I disagree with most of the reviews for this book.  I thought the photos were small and all looked the same -- I got absolutely nothing useful from them.  Additionally, this book glosses over some of the key things for many projects: turning and starting in a round.  I felt like I learned these stitches in spite of this book, as opposed to because of it.  Looking through  "Crocheting for Dummies" it looks like it would be much better by showing clear diagrams instead of photos and spending more time on things like when and how to turn, and what each stitch should look like 
 I'm sorry, but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film "Dick." "Dick" is funny, this is not. I'm sorry, but Dustin Hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like Kirsten Dunst (or that level of indefatigable cuteness).  Just go rent "Dick" instead. You'll thank me, yourself, and those fine ladies who saved our country 
  Unless you are an immature tramp I cannot fathom how you could enjoy, relate or even read this nonsense. The style and to a lesser extent the story hold merit on a historical basis, but the plot is dated and obscured to the wanna-feel-empowered nobodies of the world. That people think this is a great book betrays how foolish the reading public are; seriously, just stick to what Oprah tells you to read, or better, simply plop down in front of the television and watch 'reality.'   I am not saying this is not an important book; it is. But if you think it possesses literary Quality, read 'Confessions of Nat Turner,' 'Go Tell It On the Mountain,' 'The Invisible Man,' 'Native Son,' and tell me that this book belongs in the same class of fiction as these novels.  Am I biased? Yes, completely, I think that the work of women does not compare favorably to what men have achieved in letters. I mean, "Atlas Shrugged" is one of the most horrid things mankind has produced! But there is the converse....I mean, how many great wives, how many good stay-at-home moms have been men 
 The video certainly has potential, however as someone that has been working out for over 10 years this tape is WAAY too easy. I barely feel a burn while doing the ab workouts, and they are entirely too short. Perhaps if they were three times as long and did all four back to back it would be a worthwhile workout. But I have much better ab tapes that kick my butt with 5 minute segment(notably The Firm abs and Tamilee Webb ab tapes). If you are an advanced exerciser I say pass on this one 
 5 stars for the music, but I bought this and it will not play on any of the 5 cd players I own! Dualdisc is a bad format. Do yourself a favor and make sure you can play these first. Wish I did 
 Miranda Green presented a topic in such a way that it would bore the  average reader to tears.  Too much time is spent on comparing the Roman  point of view to what could actually be the case according to Green.  There  are some highlights worth reading, but overall it is presented in an  unexciting format 
 Basically this book was the author's dissertation. And that's about it. The writing isn't that good, and the "study" as a whole is very limited. In particular she ignores the previous punk generation, and doesn't address the changes in the scene over 20 years. This ignores the fact that as punk became more common, the common problems of the general culture seeped back in  - especially sexism. It could be used as a starting point for young people to enter the discussion, but certainly can't be seen as any kind of definitive text because there are too many holes. I was disappointed because I was so looking forward to someone finally opening up this topic, and had expected something better 
 This is by far the worst detector I have ever had.  Does not detect even close signals.  Had it in for repair twice, still does not work properly.  Gives great false signals and makes a fine [although expensive]door stop 
 The reader expects to see some useful applications of feminist theory to ancient texts, but the expectation is in vain 
 The author and most of the readers are missing the boat.  "Jesus Christ" was never a real person.  He is a mythological character, invented in the 2nd Century by members of secret societies and mystery schools that stretched from Egypt to China, practicing a mythological-religious tradition that had existed for thousands of years.  This is what accounts for the widespread myth of Jesus in the ancient world, plus remarkable similarities between the life and teachings of Jesus, Buddha, and many other Pagan gods.  If you want the TRUTH, read "The Christ Conspiracy" and "Suns of God", by Acharya S.  Ignore any book that takes a life history of "Jesus Christ" as reality.  He did not live in India.  He did not live in the Middle East.  He lives only in MYTHOLOGY 
 A hopeless mess of headlines and confusing comments, very little structure.  No rankings of what you should see and do, no pictures, no useful restaurant and hotel recommendations.  Endless yatter about nothing makes this a boring read with almost no real content.  Absolutely worthless on our Japan trip to Tokyo and Kyoto.  This is not the first time we have been disappointed by Lonely Planet. They cater to backpackers only, usually looking for the cheapest accomodation and meals, and with no value added for the traveller who is short on time but still wants to make the most out of his/her time.  We ended up buying the Eyewitness Guoide which is fast and easy to use.  
 "The Island of the Day Before" is a sad relic from a talented and brilliant author.  Certainly people will go on praising Eco (as they should), but TIDB remains a flacid exercise in overplotting.  Eco has become a sort of literary Andy Warhol - selling his name more than his work.  In trying to achieve a Kafkaesque "portrait of an instant", Eco merely puts on display what was better left as a study or exercise to be burned after his demise.  The Island of the Day Before lacks virtually all of the elements that make a story worth reading.  Indeed, Eco's inversion of the rules of good fiction is the main attraction for his works.  But in The Island of the Day Before, the reader must trudge through all of Eco's autoerotic complexity solely for the sake of that complexity.  Following is a parody of the sort of nonsense that permeates this book:  "Robert opened the door to the cabin, and was confronted with the object of his dread.  From the planked ceiling hung a hemp rope, knotted every three inches with an inverted half-stitch, each pinned through by a tortoiseshell ladypoker scented with ambergris.  At the end of the rope, approximately four feet from the floor, and thus fourteen hands from a point bisecting a line drawn between Robert's right elbow and the cleft of his chin, was a metal hoop.  The rope was fastened to the metal hoop with an overwrapping style, which Robert immediately recognized as the "Bosun's Burgher" favoured by the Patagonian fishermen.  The metal ring was welded to a torus, and the center of the torus circumscribed a small teak box with a brass hasp and seven lotus shaped inlays.  Each of the inlays contained a tiny portrait of one of the seven sybils standing on one of the seven hills of Rome, but only five of the sybils were depicted with their hands upraised.  The other two sybils hand their hands clasped behind their backs.  The first of the sybils with upraised hands was holding a rod, which twisted along its own length, with radial spikes of hexagonal cross section, each of which was terminated by an inverted cusp which was in turn pierced by a crescent.  The ends of the crescents spiralled back in upon themselves, but they alternated, with some facing right and some facing left, and still others, in a trick of the artist's skill, facing directly toward the viewer's navel, no matter where one stood... 
 this monitor makes random beeping sounds so lould that we thought it was the smoke detector. We even replaced our smoke detector thinking it was broken only to find it was this stupid monitor. Do not but this 
 The WORST movie ever made. Thank God I just rented and did not buy it. It Doesn't even deserve 1 star 
 I love reading different type's of memoirs....but this one lacked any meaning.  Even though the book subject is extremly disturbing it was hard to get into the main characters head and really "get it".  
 I purchased this bike rack because I was moving out of state and didn't have enough room in the back of my car for the bike.   I also needed a rack to transport my bike to local trails, parks, etc.  So, I went with Schwinn given the brand name and that it was relatively inexpensive.    I drove from NC to Fla, approx 700 miles, bad idea with this rack.  I didn't have any trouble assembling the rack, only took about 5 minutes and was ready to go.  However, during my trip, I had to pull over on the side of the interstate no less than 5 times to tighten the straps back.  The buckles do NOT hold the straps in place.  This is a real problem if you are travelling on a highway (or any busy road) and you have to worry about your bike flying off the back into oncoming traffic.  Also, even if the buckles hold, The wind drag from the bike starts to pull the brackets right off of the rack frame.  I had to purchase 4 bungee cords and rope in order to secure my bike from flying off the back (and yes, the rack was assembled correctly).  Bottom line, this rack is probably a great value if don't plan on driving more than a a few miles or over 40-50mph, otherwise, it is a a complete waste.       
 Reading throug this mess was like banging my head to the wall.  Niles is undoubtedly one of the most talentless writers in the TSR/WoC branch.  The whole book is on autopilot, characters fall out and then fall back in, but you don't care, because you can't get a hold on them.  The villain and the surprise, even the setting are all obviously just plot devices, I couldn't care less.  The dwarven kingdom has never been sooo boring and dull.  There is no sense of time, doom and loss, and the whole is impersonal.  Skip it and you won't miss a beat [in the series] 
 This has to be a joke! How could've stars like Brando and Nicholson agreed to appear in such rubbish is beyond comprehension! Brando with the worst irish accent you'll ever hear, and Nicholson trying to play the clarinet!!Do the fans a huge favour and delete this horrible movie 
 Another disappointed customer.   I have very thick, coarse, wavy hair and trying to manage it is a nightmare! Before using Fekkai's Luscious Curls lotion, I was using Aveda's Be Curly Lotion and Matrix's Curl.Life contouring creme. Both of the latter products work very well with my hair. I don't like to blow dry my hair (too time-consuming), so I just air dry it. Without blow drying, whether I'm using Aveda or Matrix, the results are great! My hair is smooth, shiny, and less frizzy.  I had never used Fekkai's products before, but decided to give this one a try. Everything Luscious Curl Enhancing Lotion claimed to do, didn't do for my hair. In fact, it actually made my hair worst! It became stiffer, drier looking, frizzier. In addition, my wavy hair, (usually bouncy and alive), became flat and dull. Also, I didn't like the scent of this particular curling lotion. It was very strong smelling and made me nauseous.    Because of my very poor experience with Fekkai's Luscious Curls lotion, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I think I'll stick to the Aveda and Matrix curling lotions, since they are much more compatible with my hair. 
 This book lacks technical details. This book talks too much about planning and management.  I would rather have a book with more step by step instructions on how to accomplish different tasks. This book talks more what Exchange can do and less on how to do it 
 Educational advice from an unrepentant Weatherman/bomber of the '60s.  Not worth the trees destroyed to print it.  Avoid unless you are a rabid socialist 
    A Virtuous Woman is a book by Kaye Gibbons and is about a woman named Ruby Pitt who meets a guy named Jack Stokes one day when he spots her sitting at a picnic table. She was much younger than he was and was raised much differently than he was.Ruby was a widow but ends up married to jack.Jack was so in love with his wife through everything they went through even when she was diagnosed with cancer.They were opposites and when Ruby dies Jack is lost without her.They seemed to have an unusual relationship in my opinion. It was actually really hard for me to keep reading each page as i went on.It just wasnt a story that kept me wanting more!and that is why i gave it only 2 stars. i didnt even want to finish the book and that is why i think it took me so long to read it.It really dissapointed me seeing as how i loved Kaye Gibbons first novel, ELLEN FOSTER.i think that another reason i didnt enjoy the book is that there were too many characters to keep track of and it made the book a bit confusing.i really didnt like the transition of chapters either. it was a bit unorganized.There was no action in this novel and i'm sad to say that i dont reccommend it to anyone really 
 This book's argument is largely that fewer laws and regulations unfetter business, and business is the engine of progress and wealth. What the author refuses to consider is that lawless businesses freely pollute at will, as the number of toxic waste sites in this country shows.  The author would put us back in the time when raw sewage freely poured into rivers, smokestacks freely belched poisons into the air, and when children had the freedom to work in factories and mines, regardless of age.  Nothing in a business's concern with the bottom line would have ended these practices without federal regulation.  A useful antidote to this book is Unequal Protection: The Rise of Corporate Dominance and the Theft of Human Rights - Thom Hartmann;  
 I was expecting a top-notch review of all those root beer collectibles and advertisements out there. The writing was of poor quality, and the root beer tasted like crap. This book definitely does not meet my requirements  for books about root beer advertising. It was  disappointing, I really needed some information about A&W collectibles  too 
 The beginning held my attention well enough, but about halfway through the book I gave up and skipped to the end. Excellent characters and interesting research, but Fiammetta and Bucino drown in a web of plot lines. More like a few episodes of a TV show than a movie. 
 I saw this one in the theater after a friend of a friend convinced me to see it with him (he was seeing it for a second time.) After the first ten minutes, I wanted to leave. If you like formulaic and predictable movies that attempt to convince dumb American youth from small, hick towns that they actually have a future beyond their local Wal-Mart or becoming mince-meat in Iraq, then this movie is for you!  However, if you like movies that actually challenge you to think, don't waste your time with this one 
 I think I paid way too much for this extremely slim and small book.  This paperback book measures approximately 3 inches by 5 inches.  About 1/10 of an inch think.  I paid over $5 from Amazon.  The pages can easily be torn by a toddler or preschooler.  It's just way too small to read to several children at once.  Everyone is complaining that they can't see it 
 it would be a very irritating and unbelieveable read.  I read this book after knowing it is mostly fiction to see what all the hype was about.  The writing style of this book is annoying and difficult to read.  I ended up skipping over much of the content because it was repeated over and over.  I know this is supposed to be for emphasis, but I just found it indulgent.  The lack of correct punctuation was distracting, too.  Had I read this when the book first came out, before everyone knew he lied, I would have found it hard to believe that most everyone in the book relapsed but he was completely fine without the help of AA.  Although I have not attended AA or any similar support groups, I feel that this book sends a poor message to people with addictions, that they are perfectly capable to handle their recovery on their own, which in most cases I am sure they are not.  I found the other characters in the book to be much more interesting than James Frey, and I can't say that I felt any amount of sympathy or connection to him as a character.  Maybe that is what he wanted since he supposedly feels so horrible about himself....but I am sure that now he has made a pretty penny pimping a fake story he isn't feeling so badly anymore 
 I ordered Found 1 and 2, I expected some cute,sad,and sometimes heart wrenching reading material. I was very surprised to say the least. If the description of the book had include the phrases "excess profanity" and porn material enclosed" I would not have ordered them. I think you should warn readers that these books are XXX rated. 
 There are a lot of names here, but very little information - only one sentence on my family, which I already knew.  I expected more information or at least a source to go to for more background.  OK for generic research  only for rare names 
  Ironic that a novel by a writer who despised penny pinching and greed would have his novel published in such a way that to make a few more bucks the publisher makes the book literally painful to read.   The text is simply too crammed on the page, following lines of text is awkward and the lack of spacing simply makes the book painful to read.   Theres other editions of the book that are cheaper and properly spaced. What a disappointment this edition is. Shame on Signet for this ridculousness 
 I got this as a present about two years ago, and I have had mixed feelings.  I like it, but I get really frustrated because the program is buggy.  I cannot create a standalone executable, and the program has random bugs.  Also, it is very hard to create proffesional-type games.  Be aware that the machine you run standalone programs on has to have a video card, regardless of whether you use it or not.  In conclusion, good idea, but very buggy 
 I've always been a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks, and I couldn't wait to read Dear John. Well, there was no reason to rush. It starts out okay, but then just gets more and more depressing. The main girl character is annoying and you hope that John will find someone who deserves him, instead of just pouting over her for most the book.  I cannot wait for another Nicholas Sparks book, but only because I want to know that he hasn't lost his touch, and that this novel was just a fluck 
 I have been using Turbo Tax since 1998, I use computers every day, and (as an engineer) I am used to using difficult applications (Pro-E, Mathcad, UG, etc). This years edition of Turbo Tax Deluxe was the worst Turbo tax I have ever seen (& I usually like it very much). I purchased in January and had to update 4 times. One update took 6 hours (some of us live in the boonies and broadband is not an option). In addition, the application brought up menus and selections that were not applicable (farm income at the PA State form). When I tried to delete the entries (at the Federal level as instructed) they would not. My 1 business expense entry kept getting duplicated ("copy 2" and every time I deleted it, it would reappear on the next pass through. Every time I entered the "State" tab, it acted like I was never there before with a "Start State" button that always lead me through all the same questions (It did retain my answers from prior visits). Where was the "Continue State" button? I also noticed that using the "back" button and then moving foreward again caused never before seen dialogs to occur, even though the same "foreward" choices were made. Once I backed up to check something & then moving foreward caused my state tax status to jump from +$46 to -$1548!! Upon backing up I saw that some of the check boxes regarding the sale of my home were unchecked. I did not check them, but rather backed up two more screens, then moved foreward again the two screens and the boxes were again checked! One more foreward click and my taxes again returned to +$46. One of the years I liked best was when there was a "checklist" so you could see where you had been and what was already addressed. This years State was definetly worse than the Federal, but even that was a dissapointment. I did complete this years filings & submitted both online, I hope I don't get burned! Turbo Tax!-- Please improve for next year or it may be my last year. You realize that at 59.95 + 39.95 filing + my time + aggravation like this year, and an accountant is looking attractive. If you are on the "inside" you probably know why this is happening...outsourcing code gen to India, not  outsourcing code gen to India, programmer cut-backs, programming application changes, archiving application changes, project management issues, whatever. Just realize that there is a problem & fix it 
 This book is a very good comination of two of the greatest works by William Faulkner.  The Sound and the Fury is carefully written using stream of consciousness refering to a sibling of the family.  Even the very last sentence can easily take the reader back to the very first sentence.  It is beautifully written, as well as As I Lay Dying.  As I Lay Dying is written in many perspective's of each person in the family.  The full story is obtained through reading through each person's mind and opinions and happenings.  A suprise ending adds to the punch of this book.  Both of these novels (combined into one book) are stories that critics and others seem to love, cherish, and remember for a long time 
 Like many of the readers, I agree that Ms. Evanovich seems to have run out of ideas.  The series could be written by a twelve year old.  Just give them a checklist- blow up car, eat donuts, feed Rex a donut/grape/piece of pizza, eat donuts, vascilate between Ranger and Joe, eat six tastykakes.  You get the idea.  Ms. Evanovich did expand the plot a little with this book, though.  She added in Ranger's shower gel to the list.  It was only mentioned every other paragraph.  Might I add that I have never smelled a shower gel that lingers quite like his supposedly does.  Seriously, the books went downhill after the sixth installment.  If Ms. Evanovich cannot expand the plots and allow more character growth rather than rehashing the same events over and over, perhaps she should consider ending the series.  
 I am only giving this product such a low rating because of the shipping.  The product costs $29.95, and shipping is $22.49 ... Doubling the cost!  This is the product we used to flavor the popcorn in the movie theater I worked in during high school.  I adore it 
 Looking at the reviews here, it seems that a lot of people can relate to the author's experiences. Basically what that tells me is that there is a lot of bad parenting going on these days. For example, when I was growing up, I never talked back to my parents or slammed my bedroom door in protest to something they did or said. In fact, I never even THOUGHT about it. If I had ever done such a thing, I guarantee you it would've never happened more than once!! Mind you, my dad was not a cruel man and not really very strict, but being disrespectful (like the kids are in this book) was something that was simply not tolerated.  My mom recently told me a story - the first time my parents took me to a restaurant when I was little and I started screaming and carrying on like most kids do, my dad took me out to the parking lot and beat my a**. After that, they never had any problems with me in public again. I guess there's nothing like a belt to make a misbehaving kid see the error of their ways :)  When I first started reading this book, I thought some of the stories were pretty funny, but in a sad sort of way. As I kept reading, I began to think that this guy was simply unfit to be a parent. Hint: If your kids act this way, you might try a little thing called discipline instead of letting your kids walk all over you 
 This book is about a ung boy named bud and is liveing with a bad family that is mean to him after a while and they lock in a shed one night and he desides to run away.When he runs away he sleeps under a tree in front of a libary that serves beakfeast and so on.Then after a couple nights he leaves the tree and trys to find his father.after hours of walking a man picks him up and helps him try and find his father 
 This book is absolutely flawed in its arguements.  Schlesinger ignores the context of the times; he ignores basic truths; he is jaded in his outlook.  By all accts., Mr. Schlesinger is a New Deal Democrat who tries to firmly tie in the New Deal Democrats into the Democrats of old.  This is not feasible as the Democrats of old and the New Deal Democrats had differing perspectives and ideals.  He reaches and stretches with the intent of the Democrats in the Age of Jackson, that they were always for the laboring classes, when this is not the case, especially in Southern Democrats who were aristocratic in nature and outlook.  They could not comprehend the plight of the ordinary laborer, as their world view was quite skewed.  Further, divisions that were slowly emerging between Northern and Southern Democrats, primarily over the slavery issue, are discounted and Schlesinger merely goes back to his jaded perspective that the Democrats were the champions of the common people.  Schlesinger imposes his own view of politics and parties on politicians from the Age of Jackson.  There are other works out there that are 100 times better on the Age of Jackson that this work, such as The House Divides: The Age of Jackson and Lincoln, from the War of 1812 to the Civil War edited by Paul Wellman and Lewis Gannett or The Era of Good Feelings and the Age of Jackson, 1816-1841 by Robert Remini.  However, I will give the man credit where it is due, he does his research.  Pity he doesn't know what to do with it 
 I just received this DVD as a gift for Christmas, and from the looks of the cover image(s), my girlfriend and I were definitely looking forward to watching it. Wow, was I ever dissapointed. Don't get me wrong...it isn't a waste of time to watch this movie, it's just not what I was led to expect. For one, the beast on the cover looks pretty damn cool...well, it's not. In the movie it's pretty lame. As a comedy, this movie wasn't all that bad. It was definitely the comedic moments that kept this movie alive for me, as it definitely wasn't scary at all. This is a good one to rent if you feel you've seen everything in the video store, and you're willing to watch this with an open mind. Oh, yeah...do you believe in the power of the human soul? (Whatever that is supposed to mean... it's said about 10 times throughout the movie 
 This is a good book to have if you know nothing about nutrition and want to learn some of the basics. You can collect all the basic information here through general Internet research. True, it's nice to have it all in one place in a logical format, but I really expected much more detailed advice for a book targeted specifically to endurance athletes than 'you need to manage your carbohydrates over the length of the event'-type advice. Not worth the money in my opinion. 
 I am a fan of novels curtailing the lives of the glamorous, but this was disappointing.  It had a promising start, but then just went nowhere and ended suddenly in a terrible mess.  Save your money; I wish that I could recover the six hours of my life that I wasted on this novel 
 Luce's authenticity as a source on Why India comes from two things: being married to a Gujarati woman and five years spent in the late 90s in New Delhi  and traveling around India. Don't be duped by the title for the gods or lack thereof has nothing to do with Indian economic growth. When one starts to read through the entire books, certain themes keep recurring: Western elitist tendency to cloak communism under Socialism, sympathy for congress party, brahmins and hindu elites are bad for India, Military strength is unncessary, etc. etc.  The two key individuals that have enabled Indian resurgence in the last decade and half receive barely any mention: P.V. Narasimha Rao (first South Indian PM, who plucked an unknown career bureaucrat named Manmohan Singh and empowered to what's necessary to improve country's finances)and N. Chandrababu Naidu, who made economic development "cool" among otherwise corrupt and uneducated politicians.  I was unimpressed with the ending as it reads more like a wishlist or commie manifesto (share wealth, improve schools, etc.). Lot of data points without unique unique insights. What was the point of the interview with Amitabh Bachchan 
 While I usually enjoy books of this particular genre, Betty J. Eadie's "The Ripple Effect" was disturbing.  She describes the death of her baby daughter from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in heartbreaking terms.  The scene in the book touched me deeply - until I happened to describe it to an expert on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, who said, "What she is describing is physically impossible."  Who EDITS some of these books anyway?  Who PUBLISHES these books without at least doing enough preliminary checking of the facts to see how plausible the events described within really are 
 I was very intruiged by the premise of this book, as both a research source and entertainment.  I was especially interested in how the author would approach the effects of the Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune on Impressionism, which is often ignored by art historians.  However, while this book appears to be exhaustively researched at first glance, I had several problems with it.  The author offers no new information, arguments, or theses to offer a new perspective on Impression.  Instead, he simply fills the reader's head with MORE information, most of it superfluous, to support preconceived popular notions of Impressionism.  Secondly, his two "main characters," Manet and Meissonier (who I got the feeling was being continuously mocked throughout the book), are NOT IMPRESSIONISTS!  Seriously, I know Manet influenced the Impressionists and is considered the father of Impressionism, but he refused to exhibit with them for a reason, and I don't think he would particularly appreciate being included with them as default.  Futhermore, I have to agree with another reveiwer that we get no sense of the personalities of any of the people presented in these pages, including the author.  It wouldn't have killed him to make a judgement call.  Finally, I have to warn art history lovers that this is mainly a history book.  King does talk about art, but only tangenitally--he doesn't analyze it or make it a central part of this book.  How a person can have a book about the influences of Impressionism and not about art I don't know, but there you have.  For a really great book about the influences of Impressionism (and all art at this time period) that brings a fresh perspective to the subject, I would recommend ART, WAR, AND REVOLUTION IN FRANCE by J Milner 
 I think deep thinking people tend to be unhappy because they're not living life.  They're idealizing and rationalizing life.  Some of the concepts here may be good, but reading this book will leave you feeling empty, even if you agree.  It's better to spend the time living your life than reading these kinds of deep books 
 Another badly-researched fantasy. Wolfe may understand the principles of modern, Neopagan magic (she seems to) but she clearly doesn't understand the basics of Celtic Pagan symbolism. Misleading and innacurate 
 I always judge music, not by the first few auditions, but whether or not I listen to it in the future.  As in the case with Tosca's latest release, Dehli9, a year after I bought it, it is gathering dust.  This does not detract from the quality production value and the sheer talents of D&H (Dorfmeister and Huber).  However, I am still listening to Tosca's masterpiece, Suzuki, on a regular basis for the past 5 years.  I expected Dehli9 to be another graceful yet complex work but after the first few listens, I was bored with the music.  Most tracks are nothing more than lounged-out versions of deep house music.  Me and Yoko Ono is particularly irritating (and don't get me started on the repetitive vocals).  This piece would be better served as an instrumental.  Wonderful, one of the strongest tracks, still has a jazzy, commercial feel to it, almost like it belongs in a shampoo commercial.  This CD is not the blunted, abstract music we have come to love from Tosca.  I thought the 2nd CD would be bonus, unreleased tracks or a "Dehli9 remixed" EP.  Alas, I was again disappointed by discovering this was a collection of Rupert Huber's experiments on the piano.  Honestly, the music was quasi-nighmarish...better suited on a Silent Hill or Resident Evil game soundtrack.  I have only played CD2 once, never to grace my player again.  In all fairness, this would be a good work to educate the uninitiated to the world of lounge, downtempo and trip-hop.  However, you would be better served by skipping this uninspired work and head to the good stuff, like Suzuki and Opera.  Hey, even the Honey EP gets better marks!  Maybe there will be a "Dehli9 in Dub" in the future?  It can't be any worse than the original...or can it? 
 The positive side is that Brown helped me understand more closely the differences between the various books of the New Testament.  However, I disagree with previous reviewers who say "Brown looks at these major communities from the traditional point of view" and "Brown is sometimes too quick to accept the face value of some early traditions".  He certainly does not accept traditions at face value, and this is evident from the very first page, where he says "Browning's fidelity to the tradition that John was the last of the apostles may have been too simple".  He assumes that the Gospels and Epistles were not written by the traditionally assigned author, nor are Jesus' words literally his.  He goes on focus on all the differences in emphasis from one New Testament book to the next, propose that the tradition which "emerged as orthodoxy" was not just the one held by powerful people or a "historical accident", but was the "fittest".  I was hoping for a book that would lead me to the truth, not into contradiction 
 What a slog it is trying to get through this book. I'm nearly there (I've read 3 or 4 other books since starting this)... the reason for my stubbornness in finishing it is that it came so highly recommended by friends, and the mostly rave reviews it's got here. Ignatius Reilly, the main character is interesting enough (that's why I gave it 2 instead of 1 star) but that has a lot to do with the fact that the rest of the cast and plot is so boring, I find myself flicking on the pages to see how far I have to go before the story gets back to Ignatius again. I keep thinking "OK, the side splitting stuff must be coming up soon"...there are humourous passages here and there but nothing to merit the accolades it has received here nor winning the Pulitzer Prize. I'm at a loss to explain its popularity 
 There is certainly a need for secondary literature to describe a complex standard such as the CMMI. This book does a reasonable job to accomplish this. As it has been stated there are certainly weaknesses. For example the ratio between actual content and number of pages is in some areas pretty bad. One citation an the start of a chapter is nice, two is an over load. In order to gain a fair understanding of the CMMI standard is not sufficient and neither is this book. However, "CMMI Distilled" gets you a step closer 
 Mr Babbin should note at least some of the following facts. The (unelected) Bush regime supports the integrationist EU. The UN General Assembly does represent the world's nations. The US state has consistently promoted the nuclear proliferation of its favoured allies - Israel and Pakistan for example. The author's technique is the McCarthyite smear - those who disagree with him (that is, most of the world's people) belong in an asylum.  The reason why most of us think that the Bush regime is arrogant is simply that Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld show the contempt for the decent opinion of mankind displayed by Mr Babbin. 
 The song for this episode is violent. In one of the songs, What Do You Do with a Scurvy Pirate, this is what Austin sings:  What do you do with a scurvy pirate? Load the cannon up and fire it!  In other words, he's telling Uniqua he's gonna shoot Pablo and Tyrone with a big gigantic cannon. Although that might be funny to watch if you're an older kid like me, it's kinda disturbing if you're a three-year-old 
 It's wonderful, in a way, when a person writes a book whose predictions turn out to be completely wrong.  (Less wonderful when people keep buying his nonsense!)  A review of this book can be very brief -- just two points need be made:  1. There wasn't a great depression in the 1990s (to the posters who say there was a "recession" in the early 90s, I say: the unemployment rate in the US during the real Great Depression was 25% at its peak.  It never cracked 6.5% in the 1990s.  A mild recession does not a depression make, nor does it justify the title or apocalyptic tone of this book.)  2. Had the US adopted Batra's recommended policies -- dramatic increases in trade restrictions, etc. -- there WOULD have been a depression.  One of the central causes of the real Great Depression was the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, which increased tariffs dramatically.  Batra proposed similar measures in this book.  In other words, in order to prevent a depression that never came, Batra argued that we ought to adopt measures that caused an actual depression in the past 
 You're kidding, right? This man, who hates Jews rabidly, and the state of Israel moreso, dares to cast stones at the Wahabbies? (Yes, I spell in jest.)   To my mind, his views are cut from the same cloth. Anyone who reads this book can see that clearly.   It is more Islamic hatred for the "other" albeit draped in an attack one of the most extreme elements in Islam today. Funny thing is, there are no bad words here for the Ayatollah Khomeini, evil man. That's because the author reveres his teachings, which were in no way shape or form moderate!   
 Facts are facts; I presume the facts in this book are accurate, if for no other reason than the editing/vetting process should have eliminated any inaccuracies. However, the author's perspective in evaluating and analyzing the facts is slanted to the point of being almost completely one-sided, lacking almost ANY objectivity. The author's perspective, regardless of his actual age, seems to be fixated in the late '60s--early '70s, where police and the like are ignorant, goose-stepping pigs, and institutions and the government are enemies of the people. The author's lack of objectivity and fairness makes this book of little merit 
 If you didn't like the first book in this series, you won't like the second one either.  Same goes for the third book.   
 Very dissapointing DVD - had great expectations given the cast - the storyline and manner in which it was directed was dismally poor - do not buy this film! 
 While easy enough to read, if the exact same pages were enclosed in a Harlequin Romance cover, I wouldn't know the difference.  I'm extremely surprised this is a "best seller". Maybe I should take up writing because I can't possibly be worse than this.  Ok, it's a good enough story but wow, it's predictible and boring. I read it completely in 2 days, and I'm a reader that savors pages so it takes me a while. I wasn't intrigued, I wasn't on the edge of my seat, and didn't shed a tear 
 Beware! The Dover edition is NOT the wonderful Wilbur poetry translation. It is a lumbering, stilted prose translation based on an 18th century version. The play comes through, but barely. Since no translator was listed and so many reviewers indicated that this was the Wilbur version, I ordered this for my theatre class to read -- disaster! Spend the money on the Wilbur -- it's worth it. 
 An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal 
 Even a week ago I would have said this is book is probably the best popular introduction to the subject. Now that the New York Times has effectively called into question every word published on the subject by its reporter, Judith Miller, I feel I should warn folks to read the book with the NYT's admitted failures in mind. It's not clear how this scandal relates to the information in the book not associated with Iraq's bio-chem weapons programs, but those sections at least are thoroughly tainted by the evolving story of how Iran/Chalabi/White House/DoD collaborated to manipulate public/government opinion by feeding Miller disinformation 
 Yesterday, I bought this item based on the 4 to 5 star reviews here and elsewhere. Unfortunately, this product was a disappointment. It doesn't deliver much bass or treble, and like the other reviewers have said, it's a nice look, but your ears will get sore after they are used for a short period of time.    Luckily, I was able to take them back and get a refund. To go with the pink iPod nano, I recently bought a pair of Sony Pink earbuds (10LPPI) and not only are they confortable, they deliver a nice sound for a cheap price. For the time being, I am going back to them and the Philips behind the neck headphones.   JVC can do better 
 GGK is one of my favorite authors, so my disappointment with Ysabel was especially acute.  Knuckle whiteneing plotting has been replaced with repartee that is, to put it gently, less than Cowardesque.  And the story evoked the one word that is to be dreaded in the fantasy genre: silly. If it hadnt been a Kay book, I would have dropped out after about 80 pages.  As it was, I stuck with it and felt only mild interest at best.  I never want to pigeonhole an artist, but I hope Mr. Kay now returns to the mists of legend 
 Supposed to be great. Critics loved it. So original. I thought it was boring and annoying. A collection of short stories about unlikable people, a lot of gibberish that was intentionally unintelligible. Which is fine for a while, but an entire book is too much. I really disliked it. I applaud any attempt to do something completely different, so I give it two stars instead of one, but jabbing knitting needles into my eye sockets would be different too, and I wouldn't like that much either 
 I got this as both a book and an audio file.  I had waited to read it and was surprised by both the enthusiasm of the content and its author, but also by how he snuck in some odd biblically unsound thoughts (e.g., I gasped when he suggested Christ went to Hell...what Bible passage evidences this?).  I agree with how he suggests the enemy is out to deceive us and keep us asleep...but wonder if I go further how much more Eldredge will slip in of his own peculiar biblical misintrepretations.  Where were his editors when this was being written?  Why take sensible good sections and mar them with oddities?  I havent read all the reviews here but as one of those "conservatives" frequently mentioned in them I have to admit I may not even finish this book for fear of what else Eldredge has slipped up on.  I did appreciate his story about Daniel and the "delayed" angel...but am left wondering if I need go deeper into researching that as possible misintepretation too.  What a shame this book is turning into such a questionable venture for me.  We are at war as the author suggests and we must guard the source material well..the Bible well.  So far...I may join others and ditch this valiant attempt to energize Christians and return to the Word itself.  I wonder if I can get a refund 
 This woman is an ornithologist and "behavior expert" on parrots. Yet she indulges in the worst possible parrot husbandry. Letting the bird attack her husband when he's trying to be intimate in their bedroom? Letting the bird lunge at her family/friends when they try to open the fridge? Indulging in and encouraging mate behavior? No wonder I had never heard of her among the respected avian academic and behaviorist community (Barbara Heidenreich, Dr Susan Friedman, Steve Martin). Do yourself a favor and read one of their books, not this self-indulgent, narcissistic memoir where Dr Burger seems intent on showing the readers how exclusive her bond is with Tiko (even to her husbands' detriment), and how vitally important she is to the bird. I wonder if she'd even WANT this bird to live a balanced life and have close relationships with other people? (I think not). Frankly, I think she should do some behavioral studies on herself and her own self-serving motivations. 
 Looks like Hewitt got the color wrong: his prescription is relegating the Repubican Party to the areas of only *part* of the former Confederacy.  And even that part is shrinking 
 I had to read this book for my college history course in World History.  The book gave good factual events from an American who had gone to Russia during the five year plan in Stalin's regime.  This book is an autobiographical account of an American man's life and marriage in Russia, yet I did not enjoy the deep amount of factual literature that was implemented into the book, since the author did not let the reader become intimate with his personal life or feelings.  I felt that this book was more of a textbook than a novel.  However, I believe that professors will most likely assign this book for their students, especially for the topic of the five year plan, due to the amount of historical and factual content embedded into the story 
 The Sun will rot this chair in two years!! 
 I received this soap free with an online purchase. I have never purchased soap from Lush and I don't think I will after my experience with Ooh La La. The scent is pleasant enough, and the color of the bar is this stunning deep purple (kind of like a grape!), but it doesn't feel like soap when I'm using it. It kind of smears a purplish film on me and then when I rinse it off, my skin feels very tight and dry. I've been unable to get any lather from this bar, although admittedly I do have very hard water where I live. I read that previous reviewers complained about how long this soap lasts. Like with all Lush products, it's imperative that you not leave it in the shower or tub and let it dry completely between uses. I've used the bar four or five times and while it's noticeably smaller than when I opened it, I probably have about 90 percent of it left. 
 It would have been a better short story, but even then it wouldn't have been very good. The ending is totally ridiculous. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief up to a point, but really....   
 If you've read many writing guides, this one will be of minimal help.  It's a collection of old articles and interviews, most preceeding the 2002 publication date by 1-3 years.  There's nothing here you can't find on-line or in a book with more specific help 
 Used the jump rope maybe 3-4 times and the handle broke off, you would expect a quality jump rope for the price but don't count on it. Then again it could have just been mine 
 If you expect quality metal, do not waste your money on this one...All songs sound the same, the vocals are terrible, the guiter work is mediocre... Of course I enjoy the likes of Metallica, Megadeth, Overkill, Sepultura etc., and this is arguably one of the worst Metal CDs I have heard 
 This work is a mildly interesting collection of semi-familiar "tales." It is so poorly written that it reads like a first draft.  Where was the editor 
 Peter Matthiessen joins a friend on a journey to remote Nepal in the early 70s, essentially to search for the bharal (or blue sheep) and the elusive snow leopard.  Pretty soon we realise that, for Matthiessen, this is a far more personal journey as he comes to terms with the recent loss of his wife and explores his own faith.  So, on the one hand you have a spiritual journey, recounted with great knowledge and conviction alongside a naturalist's diary of the many flora and fauna discovered along the way.  On the other hand you have Peter Matthiessen taking 300 pages to moan about porters, sherpas, his shoes, lack of leopards, missing his son (don't leave an 8 year old to go exploring only a year after his mother dies!) and the snow.    If you are interested in Nepal and/or Buddhist and Eastern philosophy then this is quite possibly the travel book for you.  If a humourless adventurer with questionable parenting priorities is likely to annoy you then I would advise trying a different book 
 Naturally, I was quite excited when I first heard that a new book about Hekate had been published. While there is plenty of material from academic publishers, there's really a great need for a book aimed at the Pagan audience. The book I would like to see would be written by someone with a good grasp of the primary sources and some familiarity with ancient Greek religion, and would contain suggestions for how to honor Hekate both in a traditional manner, and within the context of Wicca and other neo-Pagan religions. Let's just say that "Crossroads" ain't it.  First off, the author has not done his homework. He accuses "conventional" scholars of ignoring or misrepresenting Hekate, but the only name he mentions is Edith Hamilton. Apparently he is not familiar with the wealth of information printed in books and academic journals from the 19th century onwards, which is inexcusable since much of it is still in print, reprinted or even available online. Robert von Rudloff and Sarah Iles Johnston are listed in the bibliography, but Crowfoot has only bothered to read "Hekate Soteira", which has a rather narrow focus, while leaving out "Restless Dead" which would have been better suited to his purpose. He quotes Krauss, but only as Krauss is quoted by Iles Johnston.  As for the primary sources, Crowfoot draws much from the Theogony and the Homeric Hymn to Demeter (which he mistakenly attributes to Homer). The problem is that he fails to put things in their proper context. While he often gets the basic facts right his interpretation is just as often wrong, because he lacks knowledge of ancient Greek religion and culture. For instance, Crowfoot is obviously not aware that myth and cult don't always agree. He also doesn't deal well with seemingly conflicting stories, such as those dealing with Hekate's different genealogies. Instead of realizing that different myths can illuminate different aspects of a deity's nature he attempts to create a nice, neat, picture which is just not impressive in a book that claims to be a "ground-breaking" work.  The bibliography is a joke. Crowfoot appears to work under the assumption that all sources are created equal, and as a result much of the information in "Crossroads" is taken from web pages credited to "Unknown"...  In conclusion, "Crossroads" is not historically accurate, does not present any revelations, and the claim that it should offer a correct interpretation of Hekate is outright laughable.  
 These speakers crackle horribly!!!  I sent them back & had new ones sent to me 3 TIMES, and they were ALL like that!!!  It is a cool product, toobad they don't work!!!  
 This is a truncated help extension of what's already coming with the product, it works as a "how to" configure things inside IIS, poor in explaining concepts and what it means, you have to already understand the subject fully then depend on this guide as a one place how to, this is not what i was searching for 
 This is another wooden, easily solved Krentz book.  What has happened to the author who wrote such classics as Absolutely, Positively or Trust Me?  These last few years have been nothing but one formulaic, clunky novel after another, with tiresome characters and easily-predicted plotlines.  I want the excitement and energy of her ealier novels, not some rehashed pulp with her name attached to boost sales.  I hate to say it, but I think I'm about ready to stop reading Krentz and look elsewhere for my romance jollies.  Don't waste your time with this book--go back and read some of her stuff from the nineties & see what a really well-written, exciting, and romantic novel can be like when it's done as well as Ms. Krentz can do 
 I just purchased these headphones and I'm not at all happy. They have a cheap plastic look & feel, the sound is worse than what would be included with a $20 Walkman. The noise cancellation feature works...as long as you don't mind replacing ambient noise with the annoying hiss of white noise that the headphones produce. I'm not a negative person and have no gripe with Panasonic, I'm just calling it as I see it 
 This book was sooooooo boring.  I kept reading it only in the misguided hope that it would get more interesting.  It has an unlikeable and annoying main character.  The writing style is overly simple, and literally NOTHING happens.  The reason that she and her mother "fall out" is never explained.  Don't waste your time.  
 Very disapointing! Too much off topic information. It has only some information on devils, demons and the nephilim, and nothing at all on the return of the nephilim. Strange when you consider the title. I do not feel good about this purchase or the misleading reviews.   PS. I don't know why "Son of Bigfoot" shows up on my reviewer name.       
 Madonna's best was during the early and mid-80's.  This album proved that she jumped the shark by 1987 and has been famous for who she is ever since.  
  Idrove a car around three-quarters of the DR, using this book everystep of the way for nearly the entire trip. But many times the authorjust wrote a lot of nonsense. Places he describes aren't anything likethey really are, like he just asked other people to describe them andwrote what he heard from people who forgot a lot and gave him badinformation. This book is no good. 
 I bought this book when I was locked into a 1-year lease with a roommate that was driving me nuts.  So nuts that I didn't speak to her for a month at one point.  Unfortunately, this book left me unsatisfied.  Later, I found two books that changed my outlook on different types of people and my interactions with them.  The first was "Please Understand Me II:  Temperament, Character, Intelligence" by David Keirsey.  It is an introduction to personality type by the man that took Carl Jung's ideas on the subject and developed them much further.  Filling out the book's questionnaire and reading about my own personality type was like having my life story told by someone that knew me better than my best friend or sibling.  Identifying the personality types of others I knew was incredibly revealing, as well.  The second book, a natural companion to "Please Understand Me II," is "Survival Games Personalities Play" by Eve Delunas.  This book reveales the dark flip side of people's personalities.  At some point you've probably said about someone you know that "He wasn't himself," or "She wasn't herself."  Eve Delunas' book describes the shadow self we and others inhabit when stressed in one way or another, and how to deal with those of each distinctive personality type in their own way.  If these books only helps you to understand why that jerk you know is driving you crazy, it will be well worth the purchase price.     I couldn't recommend these two books more highly.  I'd recommend reading them both, since they each cover subjects that the other does not 
 Garbage - don't bother to buy or read this 
 I'm not a kid, I just don't feel like creating an Amazon account.  I don't normally review items, but this time I felt compelled to.  I would give this single zero stars if I could.  It's basically just a bunch of monotonous whispering over a forgettable beat.  It's so forgettable, I can't even remember exactly what it sounded like, other than it was really bad.  Thank God.  By the way, I did not buy this single, nor did I waste my energy downloading it.  My friends and I were subjected to listening to it in a movie theater 3 times while we were waiting for a movie to start.  We hated it, yet we could not escape it for fear of losing our seats.  We're now going deaf.  Can we sue Paris for punitive damages?   
 I bought this book about 5 years ago because I thought it would have help me out to approach  to new music, but it didn't.  It's unbelievable that one of the most important music publications could have done such a thing.  This convinces me that Rolling Stone magazine is not a publication about music, but just a publication about best selling records and artists, which are not always the best ones. I just can't believe that this editors commissioned a Pop reviewer to write about Metal, Art Rock and Progressive Rock bands.  What were they thinking? (that is if they were actually thinking). There should have been at least 12 (hopefully more) reviewers divided by genres. I would've give it one star if it wasn't for the fact that at least it gives you a "decent" list of the albums by an artist. Overall I think this is not a good purchase 
 It was my reading book for a subject called "Community psychology". Maybe it is because I am from country (Poland) which had hard time with communists and socialists and this book has to offer nothing more than bunch of pseudo-scientific theories and some "liberal" babbling. There is no social science background, most "research are based on some strange  theories (mostly Marksism). If you want to learn something usefull about social psychology and phenomenons concerning it read "Social Animal" by Aron. This  book is laugh, not science 
 Any sound psychologist would want to "shape" the lives of girls as well as boys,to shape them into adults,but this writer wants us to see girls and women as eternal children,who need over  protection,never need to face real challenges,or real life. He doesn't seem to realize many girls need coraling in not only  boys.Instead he sets up a system where expectations are low for  girls,so parents might put less effort into a girl's education, aspirations and talents.Speaking of talents,he believes females and males have very distinct differences in the talent pool. Males analyical,females emotional intellence and verbal. How can a parent help their girl along if they believe she doesn't or shouldn't excell in hard science and maths. His obvious mysogamy is only too noticable,he doesn't want girls to excell or even try their hand in areas he feels are more  easily understood by boys. I have never read such a harmful book in my life.This psychobable will only prove how he is determined to work against females and trap them in small areas of achievement. Poor book,poorly written,works off of spotty brain research and sterotypes 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 "Highlights" of this book:    parents who believe that they cured their son's rebellious behaviours by playing Christian music in his room while he was at school;    a man who, not having had parents who prayed for him, turned away from God's call to the ministry and subsequently suffered the break-up of his marriage and the death of his child;    the time Mrs. Omartian taught her son to stop lying by lying to him (see the Case of the Broken Window and her use of equivocation);    Mr. and Mrs. Omartian's belief that they can "pray their children through" colds and the flu but must consult a doctor for more serious illnesses;    the assertion that we can forbid the Devil access to our children's lives by praying, to include praying that they not become homosexuals, or fat;    Mrs. Omartian's belief that her children freely accepted Jesus when they were five years old.       And there is much more.  I submit that too much of this book consists of anecdotal evidence, gross generalizations, wishful thinking, and wilful ignorance of plain facts for it to be useful to serious inquirers 
 As neither a conservative or liberal I was interested in what the book would say and how it would document and factually support its arguments.  As an ex-college debater I think I can say with some authority that this book does not do what it claims to do.  If you were to rely on this book in a formal debate you would lose.  Let me give you 5 examples of why I come to this conclusion.  1)	Documentation is thinner than appears.  Chapter 8 on healthcare has 20 endnotes.  But 12 of those footnotes are duplicates often citing the same single page in its source.  So the book presents 8 total sources on the topic.  But of the 8 remaining sources 4 of them are editorial/opinion pieces on the topic.  So, at best, the chapter offers 4 fact sources for a discussion of national health care. 2)	Undocumented quotes and poor quoting practice.  A large number of statements attributed to people and research institutions without attribution.  Page 354 ". . . illegal aliens used 10 billion more in government services than they paid in taxes in 2002 according to a 2004 Center for Immigration Studies . . . "  No endnote.  You have no idea of what the sources actually said and where and when they said it.  Also often you will see one person quoted in another's book.  Again you don't know what the source actually said, when they said it, and what else they said. 3)	Straining at gnats.  Page 156 ". . .the more traditional and evidentiary teachings of creationism/intelligent design (vs evolution) . . ."  Although this statement is something of a sidebar in a discussion of education, such a sweeping and factually incorrect statement without even a footnote is just amazing.  This is not atypical. 4)	Confusing fact with opinion.  As I mentioned in 2 a large number of Mr Jackson's book are opinion pieces.  Although the books he sources may all be fact filled, looking at the publisher list (Crossways Books, Andrews & McMeel, WallBuilder Press, Kregel Publications, Prima Publishing) indicates vanity press and self published sources.   5)	Failure to update.  Very few of Mr Jackson's statement extend beyond the 2002-03.  As such his discussion about Iraq and the war on terror seemed particularly dated 
 As a parent of a colicy/active baby, I've went through several different books, looking for help. This book was not helpful. It was basically nothing more than you'd find in a magazine article. It doesn't have any real solutions. Instead I'd HIGHLY recommend "the Happiest Baby on the block" especially the DVD version. This was unbelievably helpful to me and I just wish I had found it sooner 
 I enjoy Carolyn Hart's mysteries, but Laurel is getting very annoying and boring.  I enjoy the references to other mystery writers and the rest of her characters are usually well-written.   One other minor complaint,  please stop the cutesy pie allusions to Annie and her hubby when they're  about to "get intimate."  Puhleeze, it's just too juvenile for  words 
 This book starts out slow and dry.  It didn't get exciting until Pat Garrett started to take over the story.  This doesn't occur until about midway through the book.  Don't expect this to be a screenplay for the movies Young Guns and Young Guns II.  The book isn't that exciting but it does introduce you to an interesting character profile of Billy the Kid.  Personally I feel that the first half of the book is fiction that is read for pure entertainment and the second half covers the real story of the Kid.  I would recommend this book if you are interested in the Kids story and you want to read every angle of his story 
 The follow-up to Crossfade's self-titled debut is...well, it just not as good. In fact, I hated this album.  The only good songs are "Already Gone", "Invincible", and "Drown You Out."  I tried to like the rest, I really did.  But after listening to the album numerous times, I couldn't helping feeling like i wasted my money.  I expected so much more from Crossfade.  Seemingly all the songs have the same recurring theme (the word "pain" is used in several), and the tone of the songs just doesn't flow very well.  Several songs have a number of different melodies, stopping and then starting again.  It seems as if the band was experimenting and didn't know what kind of sound they were looking for, and the album suffers from it.  BOTTOM LINE:  borrow the album from a friend, then download the songs.  Don't waste your money 
 I'm surprised no other reviewer noticed! Why did Penquin place Ronald Colman and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. prominently on the cover? In this reviewer's opinion, they must secretly realize that the wonderful 1937 classic film vastly outshines the printed word. I found the  story to be poorly written and hard to follow. Its' style is too formal, too flowery and too wordy!	If I had not seen (both) versions of the film, I could not have followed the "action". I constantly referred back to mental images of the movie to orientate myself. A review of "PZ" boils down to a basic truth: While most agree that the book is usually superior, occasionally the movie wins out. "PZ" is a prime example. ("Strangers on a Train" is another!). As for the so -called sequel, "Rupert of Hentzau"- don't even bother, unless you are an Anthony Hope fanatic. Reviewing the book makes one appreciate-once again- that wonderful film fadeout as Ronald Colman rides off over the hill. Since it happens to be available on amazon, click on the movie reviews. Therein will lie the essence of the wonderful adventure story of "The Prisoner of Zenda" 
 Gardner, an English professor, decided to take the (first) monster from Beowulf, and flesh it out into a full-blown character.  Beowulf's Grendel lasts about 5 minutes.  He terrorizes the Danes for 12 years--breaking into their mead-hall by night and eating selected warriors--for no other reason than that he is evil (descendant of Cain) and hungry.    Then Beowulf and the Geats show up, and, in good Clint Eastwood fashion, Beowulf dispatches Grendel bare-handed--tearing off his arm and shoulder and sending him bleeding home to die in his swamp.  This takes longer for me to write than it does to happen.  In short, in Beowulf, Grendel is a bit player.  Gardner gives him a childhood and a psyche full of angst and neuroses that would make Hamlet seem straightforward and decisive.  The book, having not much subject, is vastly overwritten--many too many adjectives, and many too many attempts at Anglo-Saxon "kennings" (pithy two-word constructions like "world-rim-roamer").  The character of the Dragon is interesting, if overwrought.  But Grendel himself is simply teenagerish: narcissistic, constantly complaining over nothing, excruciatingly self-aware and self-important.  Beowulf is great poetry but a dull plot.  This book is dull poetry and an inflated, equally dull, character.  Gardner, by the way, was emboldened by the commercial success of this to write several other novels.  Pity.  As a critic, he was great.  As a novelist, wordy and empty 
 The author has her narrator("Cinnamon") spend most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating Scarlett,in a game of wish-fulfillment one-upmanship. Even though she's calling the shots,as it's her book, Scarlett still comes out miles ahead. Perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society,but there WAS once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism-even if misplaced-just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies,such as "Ivanhoe" presents.The story may have been one-sided,but it's the side MM chose to tell,and there's kernel of truth in the "myth" of the Old South,as in all myths.   Margaret Mitchell has nothing to fear from this silly so-called "parody",which is really a subconscious-or not so subconscious,in fact-effort to knock from her pedestal,that epitome of heroines-Katie Scarlett O'Hara and the wonderful Melanie Wilkes.As if Rhett would ever give any other woman a serious thought-he was obsessed with Scarlett.That's why he turned to women like Belle Watling.And to imagine Mammy killing the male babies,when she had been devoted to Ellen O'Hara from Ellen's childhood.Thank goodness this book isn't a pimple on the fanny of the classic GWTW,because what it is a a travesty-and not even a well-written or engaging one at that.GWTW will still be read and loved for all time,like the classic it is,when this book is selling for a quarter at garage sales.I didn't even pay that,thank goodness-the woman gave it to me,and I read it and burned it with the rest of the trash.I'd give it a negative star if there was such a rating.Ludicrous and laughable-try again,Ms Randall,and try to get over the jealousy of Scarlett and Co. Again,Margaret Mitchell need not fear,LOL 
 THIS WAS THE WORST DK BOOK I EVER READ THE ONLY GOOD PART WAS IGNEOUS ROCKS.I LIKE THE OTHER DK BOOKS BETTER THAN THIS ONE  [...

 I've been focusing on some prizewinning books as of late, and I thought this would be a necessary prelude to reading Ford's Pulitzer Prize winnning "Independence Day". Ford has insights into what suburban life is and the desire for comfort and mystery in protagonist Frank's life. Frank's struggle to wrestle with the loss of his son and his marriage presents an opportunity to peer inside his mind and see what makes it tick. What you think of this book will depend on what you think of Frank as a narrator. His desire to evade deeper meaning and personal responsibility was maddening to me at times; others will find this a profound truth in the book. I also found him to be longwinded and I had a hard time rooting for and identifying with him as a character.  Slogged through this book and at the end, I don't think it was worth it for me.   2 star 
 I received this as a gift and loved it at first.  But after using it just 3 times one of the support poles snapped when we were putting it up.  I was bummed too because I loved it so much.  If you do buy it, be careful when you handle it - it's not as durable as it seems 
 I don't ordinarily write reviews, but I feel the need to steer people away from spending money on this book!  This was a horrible waste of money, and of time spent in reading the first third or so I read before I quit.   Patricia Gunn Allen is not simply hooked on Political Correctness (which I could deal with).  She substitutes it for decent scholarship and for writing ability.  After the pointless detours into the legends of her own New Mexico Native American clan and 21st Century Physics, the attempt to relate the "myth" of Pochahontas to the Legend of one of the Kngihts of the Round Table (I think it was Gawain and the Green Knight, but I'm honestly not sure) did me in.  I wanted to know something about Pocahotas -- the Woman!  Or, as the title of the book says, the Medicine Woman, Spy,  Entrepeneur and Diplomat!  And that is what I could NOT glean from this book at all. 
 This book covers most areas of engineering, as advertised.  However, I find it doesn't have enough depth to allow you to solve real world problems in a field of engineering one is familiar with, while at the same time, doesn't give enough background to allow you to make good use of the formulae in fields that you may be new to.  In other words, it is written somewhat obtusely.  That's fine if one just needs a refresher of what one has learned before or elsewhere, but makes it difficult to use in a new area 
 I checked out this book from the library for a history project, but I found the information and analysis in this book too biased for use on a research paper. This book is an attack on the Clinton administration and communism, not a history book. The book fails to incorporate the current domestic and global conditions in China, and rely too heavily on common beliefs of the "evils" of the communist theory. Of course, history has proven that communism is bad, but he fails to understand, there is a reason why the government in China is still in place today. The author fails to understand the thinking, history, and cultures of the Chinese. In his suggestions of how the United States should act against China, the author makes a clear statement that the ends justify the means, and indirectly states that it's okay for the United States to be immoral to eliminate any competition. In a world where people constantly criticizes our arrogance and ignorance, his suggestions confirms the criticisms about how we believe we are the best, and everyone should follow our example without a true understanding of the situation.  Ironically, we are the country that emphasizes diversity, but we are also the country who forces others to be just like us even though our model might not fit for their country 
 Ethan Canin is a great short story writer, but when it comes to novels, he misses the target.  His short stories are great because they are brief, and are told through actions and conversations, not sentimentality and excessive introspection.  Blue River, like For Kings and Planets, are undisciplined works, perhaps too ambitious, with overwrought language and too much filler material.  A much better story with the same theme appear in the Palace Thief, called Batorsag and Szerelem 
 The concept of the book is to reveal the errors of Islam, and the author manages to this to a certain degree. Unfortunately he also reveals his own flat-tyre Protestant theology! Comparing words in the two religion's main Scriptures is indeed important and interesting, but the author falls into the "Bible-bashing-mode" so typical of many protestants.  He does not know and does not quote any of the Church Fathers' interpretation of crucial passages, and therefore he fails to make his case agains Islam and its literal understanding of spiritual life. It is a pity, because the author is well-intentioned and enthusiastic. But he talks too much about himself and his friends being "spirit-filled", and he never manages to get beneath the surface of the Christian Theological arguments against Islam. 2 stars for trying to do it anyway. Read instead St. John of Damascus' "Writings" in the CUA series. 
 Over the top attempts at wit seldom work, as this volume proves. I like dry humor, sarcasm and off the wall references, but this is just dumb 
 Not only does the new music change the mood and quality of critical scenes, it's tantamount to watching old Batman episodes. As soon as something develops, in comes the cheesy music... The added scenes were poorly produced which is why they didn't make the original cut...The interviews seemed contrived.  I'm not impressed.  The older version supersedes the new 
 This book reflects a reality in Israel to which you - the reader - are an unsuspecting party: a battle for the soul of Israel between religious and secular, conservatives and liberals, friends and enemies of the state.  From my perspective - a recent Oleh in Jerusalem - this book could not be more skewed to the political and social left.  In every chapter, assuming there is potential, the author finds a way to skewer observant Jews, accusing them of everything from warped sexuality to outright racism.  One example is an account of the Shas Party's anti-Russian campaign, presenting them as an expression of religious Jewish Israels..... without ever explaining that the Shas party is the expression primarily of very religious Mizrahi Jews and does not even remotely appeal to the greater Orthodox community.  Statistics are also highly inaccurate: bandied about is this strange statistic that 500,000 Russian Olim are non-Jewish, when in reality it is closer to 330,000 and includes those who consider themselves Jews but do not meet the halakhic definition of such.  Russian immigration has plummeted, recently, from 100,000 per year during the nineties to something like 3,500 per year, now.  The author is pitching one more stone in the camp of pluralistic, pro-Palestinian liberal Israelis, hoping that you'll join in the quest to remould Israel in the cast of liberal American wishes.  Do yourself a favor: don't bother with this one 
 If this is the "best book out there on Charlotte Mason" and has "the most practical application" of her ideas, as other reviewers have stated, then I'd have to say that Charlotte Mason is confusing, because this is a badly written book.  I picked this up wanting to learn about Charlotte Mason's philosophy of education and what it looks like in the home school.  I returned the book with a bad taste in my mouth.  The author is VERY flighty, throwing out random ideas that are not well-explained or thorough.  Many of the chapters, including those entitled "Composition" "grammar," and "spelling," are only two pages long!  She randomly describes Mason's ideas for a scant paragraph, and then throws together some "How-To"'s that are bewildering.  After reading this book I can say that not only do I not understand Charlotte Mason, but I have little desire to because of this author's bad work.  This is NOT a book for those who aren't already Mason fans, nor for those who need detailed help in applying her philosophy 
 This item has no spoken dialogue.  Disappointed... 
 Has been a fan of the new series on Sci-Fi and has seen little of the original. This item does sound good but the price is a bit hard to swallow. I sorta think they are going in a good direction with the release of the beginnings boxed set. They should just concentrate on releasing boxed sets like that for each individual Doctor Who having all the episode they were in. I would gladly pay over time for sets like that no matter how long it takes for them to be released instead of all these jumbled realease that try to get your money now when they will come up with something better down the line if they can 
 I spent all day yesterday reading "I'm Watching You," but I regret having done so.  First, there are way too many characters (about 20) to keep straight.  Second, [...]  Third, the last 20 pages wrap up everything very quickly, giving necessary background information which should have been incorporated more smoothly.  Fourth, Kristen (the heroine) is stupidly stubborn, insisting that the murderer "will not drive her out of her house."  [...]  No, Kristen will not leave.  (Nor apparently will she buy shades).  Even when she has to have a 24 hour police guard, plus the hero (and later, his father) keeping watch,  Kristen will not leave her house.  This stupid  contrivance exists just to put her in danger.  I got very tired of the many times that she fought off various people who wanted to kill her.  To complete her status as a character who is Too Stupid to Live, is her uninformed assumption about the seriousness of the effects of surgery.  (Yes, I bet you can figure the effect of this too).  A gifted artist who is now a dedicated, articulate, principled prosector never has this assumption verified, even fearing it will end her engagement to the hero?  Yeah, sure.  Yes, "I'm Watching You"  is a page turner, but I found it to be very unpleasant.  Even skipping the explicitly violent parts, I found this book increasingly nasty.  [... 
 In a time of heady progress in biochemistry and pharmacology, along comes a clinician to tell us once again that addiction is a state of mind that can be cured by correcting skewed thought patterns. In fact, the neuroplasticity of the brain responds to addictive drugs by altering the function of existing neuropathways. Addicted people are different from normal people by virtue of dysfunctions along the serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine "pleasure pathways." The attitudes expressed in this book are at least 15 years out of date, and likely to be of limited use to anyone attempting to free themselves from addiction.    
 Don't get me wrong with the 2 stars some songs here are really good.  Traffic UR Adagio For Strings Nyana  Those songs are just great and the best off the album. But songs like  Walking On Clouds Sweet Misery Love Comes Again Forever Today  can only be enjoyed so little times but they are good though.  No song here is annoying in the beginning and I see a lot of 5 stars and either they are just suckers for Dj Tiesto or they wrote the review as soon as they got it.  Cause after months of having this you will see yourself skipping to songs just to hear the good stuff.  Dj Tiesto shows he does a good job working with vocals but for a number 1 Dj I expect to be hearing his stuff for a long time before getting annoying  Verdict: 2.8 out of 5.0 Not bad for the first 20 listens but damn I could have enjoyed it much more 
 For me, this book was too general to be of any help. The best I've read so far is FROM REEL TO DEAL 
 This book has nothing to do with its title.  It is more reminds me book written by the HR manager to company employees on how not to behave in public places.   
 I personally am not happy at all with this item, very small not the same as pictured ( the one I got is bright yellow, really flimsy ) don't think it'll last very long. I'll keep it, not worth sending back, my Corgi seems to like it ~ but its a bit small even for her, I think it's life will be short. (not well made 
 As soon as I saw the first and last name of the author, I was suspicious of a radical, African dragon-fire response to Ruby Payne.  And that's what it was.  A few logical points now and then, but the wrong spin put on those few points.  Payne's book was well-thought out and had evidence that was obvious and believable.  Jawanza Kunjufu does not want to accept an educational standard set by the successful in America.  His plan would not be good in Africa, but will lead to third world standards for everybody in America 
 This novel should remain forgotten in the dim past.  It's a period piece, all right.  Blatantly antisemitic -- and I don't think the author was making a comment on his characters in that regard; I think it was the author speaking.  Boring in stretches.  Long stretches.  I finally gave up and heaved the book across the room.  Out of curiosity, I read the author's Butterfield 8 a number of years ago and, trust me, it's worse. 
 This wasn't a novel. It was a blueprint. And might as well be considered a history book now. 
 When one walks into a movie theater, they expect to see a movie.  When one walks into a pizzeria, they expect to be served pizza.  When one plays paintball, you should expect to be hit by at least one paintball.  So, one could draw the conclusion that when one reads any of Neil Gaiman's Sandman series, you should expect to be pulled into a bizarre world where your heroine (or dark figure leading the show) happens to be the actual Sandman ... right?  Apparently, the answer is closer towards the "no" theory than one could expect.  I understand the concept of building a stage and allowing readers to see the entire universe, and not just one small figure, but that isn't why I purchased this series.  I purchased it for the sole reason that I enjoyed the first two in this collective series.  I find the character of the Sandman to be one of the greatest literary figures in graphic novels today.  His words will entice, his patience will amaze, and his strength will force you to think of Superman as the weakest man alive.  The Sandman is intelligence, boldness, and heroics all boiled together into one shaded character.  He is the epitome of "cool", if one were to phrase it that way.  Yet, why would anyone who loves this series think that without the main character, the central focus of the show, would a series be able to survive?  If I had started with this collection, I don't believe I would have gone any further.  I know, I seem to be an odd voice in this collection that seems to have garnered award after award for possibly the dullest story ever dreamed by Gaiman.  For those fan boys out there that are drooling over the ingenuity of "A Midsummer Night's Dream", I would say - not rudely - but get over it.  Sure, there were moments of fun and inspiration, but for the most part this story seemed to go on longer than needed and gave this avid Sandman reader a chance to catch up on some well deserved rest.  I had seen Gaiman twist the story of Shakespeare earlier in one of the early collections (I think it was when the Sandman was talking with his "friend", Hob Gadling), but I didn't think he would dedicate half a collection to the birth of an idea.  Again, I am not knocking the creativity of the piece, because I saw the premise well, it just felt overly-dramatic coupled with an overall sense of "blah".  It was too much for this reader to enjoy.  I wanted the fantastical coupled with sinister, and before you say it, this just didn't have it.  Sure, there were creatures, but they did not come anywhere close to what I witnessed in the first two collections.  I just missed the tone that Gaiman had captured with his creation in the first two collections; obviously this was a completely different step.  How did I enjoy the other stories?  I thought that "A Dream of A Thousand Cats" was decent, but again lacking that panache that lingered from the first two books.  "Facades" was utterly fun, but diabolically confusing.  Who remembers Element Girl?  To me, it just seemed too outdated for the rest of the series.  My personal favorite was "Calliope", a truly frightening tale of imagination that reminded me of why I am such a big Gaiman fan.  It was dark and spooky all at the same time.  It was the epitome of what the Sandman represents, then we are left with nothing more a ramshackle of other stories that don't fit the bill.  They were a hit or miss with me, as I have read, it seems to be the case with other Gaiman fans.  I wanted, and desperately needed, more Sandman.  I wanted my character back.  I wanted something to breathe life back into this short collection.  For those of you wondering where most of the pages remain, there is a huge development of the "Calliope" story at the end which nearly takes up 20 pages.  This was a waste of time and space.  Obviously, this was the weakest link pertaining to the series.  Overall, I cannot suggest this book to friends or family.  If one asks which collection they should start learning about our heroine, the Sandman, in Gaiman's eyes, I would tell them to stay clear of this collection.  Dream Country may be giving us a hit of what is to come, but for me it felt tired, bored, and over inflated.  While "Calliope" will pull you in, "A Midsummer Night's Dream" will confuse you to the point of insanity, or at least give you a good nights rest.  Dream Country was weak, and it is obvious with the fact that there was what I like to call "filler" at the end of the collection.  If one doesn't have anything worth saying, don't waste my time.  This collection will anger any fans of the series that loved the first two.  Read through this one quickly, and get to the next.  I promise ... it will only get better from here.    Grade: ** out of **** 
 A red star!?!?  I bet this won't sell well in eastern Europe. 
 The story is fairly typical, but the dialogue is stilted and unbelievable. There are few surprises, and the characters are forced down your throat with ham-handed attempts at empathic situations which end up making you indifferent to their fates. Also, this book was edited by an illiterate person. There are numerous misspellings and the grammar in several parts is extremely sloppy 
 Check it, So I got my new headphones I had been waiting 2 weeks (free shipping deal) for and when I opened the box, I was like, sweet, these look pretty tight.  Then I went to put them on, ya know, test them out, and the darned things would't fit over my big dome. I went to adjust them and i was like, they can't be adjusted! I went to lift them up and Oh snap... them things snapped!! I got mad and threw them against the wall, packaged them up, and sent them back. I still havent received my refund.. 
 I've read most books about Scott Peterson, and they were all pretty interesting and informative......This book was loaned to me, I did not spend a dime on it, nor would I.  Dalton makes many claims (occult, etc) with nothing to back it up. If they were investigators, couldn't they have tracked down  all of these "supposed" leads ???? A partial license plate number should be enough....many "supposed" witnesses don't have names...the ones that do never testified....what's that about??  If they were credible, don't you think a suppeana would have been issued ???? Especially by the defense????  I can see why he was fired from the defense team.... Anyway, that aside, the writing is terrible, nothing is consistent....suffice it to say----you've been warned. 
 The plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many.  Why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach case, when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is? We know where the precious document is : another useless quest. People are murdered by the half dozen, the characters are outrageous, most of the time improbable, and I felt the semi-erotic swimming episode totally stupid, not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it. I have read much better books than that. Sorry.. 
 The party of hate just don't get it. Their obligation to preserve, protect, and defend this nation takes a backseat to their personal and political pursuits.... they foolishly and relentlessly attack and undermine the very policies and institutions that have made our country a beacon of liberty and prosperity. They've wasted decades vehemently slandering conservatives as "extreme" and "dangerous"-conservatives who make it their life-long mission to stand up for the rule of law, a growing economy, small government, and a strong "@$$ whipping" military... This author still dosn't see (because he's blinded by HATE,) the true danger-or what we need to do about them... I already know what needs to be done to protect the future of this country, for my children, my children's children, and yes, you libs'... You may not want to admit it but since September 11, 2001, it was clear to the world: AMERICA IS AT WAR... so get out of the way and AT LEAST let the military protect us from your stupid interferences and terrorist who want to harm us... you are doing more harm than good and it is clear (crystal) that we have not been attacked since 9/11 thanks to our troops... (Do you think you can go about your days if the war was here, right now? Think about that one.) Quit trying to tie the President's hands with pointless, pathetic, political arguments. It's a lot of talk, but you ain't sayin' nothin' 
 I didn't like the book Freak The Mighty. I just like it at all. It was a book that I never would have read if it weren't for our class Literature Circle. I didn't like it because it was a book that didn't have a good plot, and it jumps around alot 
 THIS TIME AROUND, A COP [DANIEL BERNHARDT] INFILTRATES A PRISON TO INVESTIGATE THE ONGOING EXECUTIONS OF THE INMATES AT THE PRISON. SUDDENLY, HIS COVER IS BLOWN AND HE FINDS HIMSELF FIGHTING TO SURVIVE IN THE KUMITE. THIS MOVIE IS SO BORING. THE ACTING IS BAD, THE FIGHTS ARE CORNY, AND THE SCRIPT REALLY SUCKS. VAN DAMME LOOKALIKE DANIEL BERNHARDT IS JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A MARTIAL ARTIST THAT KNOWS HOW TO FIGHT, BUT SERIOUSLY HAS PROBLEMS ENTERTAINING AN AUDIENCE. FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, WHY COULDN'T THERE JUST BE ONLY ONE BLOODSPORT MOVIE?  WHAT'S THE POINT OF THE SEQUELS? FROM WATCHING THIS MOVIE, I ALMOST DON'T WANNA SEE PART 2 OR 3. EVEN IF YOU ARE A MARTIAL ARTS FAN LIKE MYSELF, YOUR BEST BET IS TO AVOID THIS ONE ENTIRELY 
 after the scary and funny "return of the living dead" i couldn't wait to see this one,know what? turns out i could have waited to see it because this is the PITS!!!!!!!! how could they have blown this movie so bad!! not funny,not scary,and not worth the price!!!!!!!!! stay away!!!!!!! 
 Like many of the readers, I agree that Ms. Evanovich seems to have run out of ideas.  The series could be written by a twelve year old.  Just give them a checklist- blow up car, eat donuts, feed Rex a donut/grape/piece of pizza, eat donuts, vascilate between Ranger and Joe, eat six tastykakes.  You get the idea.  Ms. Evanovich did expand the plot a little with this book, though.  She added in Ranger's shower gel to the list.  It was only mentioned every other paragraph.  Might I add that I have never smelled a shower gel that lingers quite like his supposedly does.  Seriously, the books went downhill after the sixth installment.  If Ms. Evanovich cannot expand the plots and allow more character growth rather than rehashing the same events over and over, perhaps she should consider ending the series.  
 Let me just say if a movie gets it premiere on the Scifi Channel is doomed from the start. An who the hell thought that having Corey Feldman as a mad scientist is a good ideal.Having Cory doing anything is a bad ideal. Any ways Corey attempts to recreate the formula and bring the puppets back to life,all the while the head of a toy corporation has made a pact with the devil in hopes of bringing forth chaos and destruction on Christmas Eve the help of the formula. Naturally she attempts to steal the formula. Basically towards the end we get to finally see the lame match up between the toys. For some reason they decided to change the look of the original Demonic Toys but keep the same look of the Puppet Masters ones. Eithier way, the new look is horrible. Despite what attempt at horror they try to deliver, they come off simply as an annoyance.Probably the most intresting aspect of this dribble would be the upgrade they made to the Puppet master toys receive towards the end. What could have been a fun cheesy ride of a film turned out to be a long segment of some lost Are You Afraid of the Dark episode on Nickelodian. This is just made for TV trash. horrible cast,acting,directing and script, do not even bother a second on this crap.

 The Starker recording of the Bach cello suites is perhaps the best music ever made. They appear on RCA and Mercury. BUY the Mercury, not the RCA recording. There is a big difference 
 I say this because Jackie doesn't usually do wired Kung-Fu and this movie utilized that. It also utilized the sped up frame rate to make the fighters appear more skilled. Now that being said, the martial artists really are quite skilled. They really are pretty quick. They really can do most of those moves. It had some OK though special effects assisted fights, but this movie wasn't really about that. Jackie Chan was trying to break into "real" acting in this movie. I wouldn't buy it if you are trying to watch him fight, and if you buy it for the story....well that's your choice I guess 
 His chapter on Christian Science says it all.  He didn't adequately  research his subject and leaves us all the poorer in our understanding of  Christian Science's significance as one of the few religious denominations  established in North America.  He spends too much time doing a hatchet job  on Mary Baker Eddy and minimal effort on the very public and significant  religious teachings of Christian Science 
 As in most books from Cooksillustrated recipes already appeared in their other publications - nothing new 
 I will continue to read the series, but I must say it could have been enhanced had there been some glossary of the nautical terms used so profusely.  I would have expected nothing less mind you, but unlike having a good dictionary for other words, there were many terms to be found nowhere.  It can make for some rugged reading.     Still, the book is worth the effort.  I am just not sure the full enjoyment is available to those who are not intimately familiar with sailing and with sailing a vessel during the Napoleonic era.    And who am I to judge a book?   Because I spent money to buy it 
 i love jane austen and i really enjoy period pieces. but the main character was the WORST actress i have ever seen in my life. she was boring, weird, ugly, and never changed her expression. i dont kno how anyone could love her. i could barely understand what they were saying. a terrible film. i hated it. 
 I read this book after coming across it on a "most important books ever" list. I found it very hard to get through. Approximately half-way through the book I found myself counting down the pages until I finished it. This is not a book to read if you're looking to be entertained, however if you're looking for a good bit of culture/history I would think this would be a decent pick. Some of the passages involving the main character and his love interest are very well written and beautiful to read. In fact, I re-read some of the passages again just for the majestic quality of the author's writing. As a college junior with little knowledge of or interest in African culture I did not enjoy reading this book, however I may try again in the future to see if I can get more out of what others have deemed a very important and worthy novel 
 If your looking for something beyond gradeschool math (read:algebra/geometry)then I wouldn't recommend this book. The formulas would be usefull in modifying from an already set or measured value (tire size,mph,mpg) but would not be usefull when trying to design, analyze or mathmaticaly model anything. Use of English units nice for laymen.  I was dissapointed at the lack of truely usefull equations, most seem to be shuffling of equations.  Conversion tables are nice however 
 Jay Kordich "the juiceman" is the bat s^%t crazy guy from the infomercials!! In fact, it is quit frightening how he is always yelling (probably to be heard over his juicer).  My question is why drink the concentrated fructose that is in juice when you can just eat the fruit and get all the fiber and  "flavinoids" and whatnot without drinking concentrated forms of sugar.  Juicing is  dead, eating right is the way to go, and by the way, a greasy burger once in a while is great too 
 This is no better than the old fashion rabbit ears. The "powered" portion of this antenna does NOTHING to boost the signal. I found this item to be almost useless since it does not pick up any analog signals very well at all. As for the digital signals, you will have to adjust the antenna whenever you change the channel.  If you spent your hard earned money on a HDTV, why are you going to buy a junkie antenna? 
 This is the most terrible, emotionally offensive film ever created. After watching this movie, my eyes began to bulge from my head and limbs began to fall off. Watch this movie if you like the feeling of having your organs ruptured.   
 Looks super cool, right?  With bag cleaners, all you have to do is remove the bag and put in a new one. With this, you have to realize the suction isn't working (the barrel will not be close to full). Removing the barrel is easy, but you have to spill everything all over when you open it to dump it. Then, you have to remove & clean the sub filter...very dirty jobs.  The brush head is too tight and doesn't drop down to the floor level properly, so the brush isn't even in contact with the floor most of the time.  Avoid this until they get the kinks worked out.  UPDATE My wife called their customer service. They said that it wasn't supposed to be stiff and immediately shipped out a (refurb) replacement. It's working fine, though is does have a small bit of stiffness.  I'd change to 3 Stars if I could.. 
 The focus of the book seems to be how to try every snake oil solution first, add in a lot of prayer and then seek help from qualified ABA therapists. It is informational and a good read - for what NOT to do. Try - 'Overcoming Autism' as your first book - Lynn Koegel and Claire LaZebnik. I give it two stars since it doesn't really educate how to approach autism so much as how NOT to approach autism 
 I bought this cd because I'm a great fan of Cox, but I was a bit disappointed when I heard it. It's the kind of easy listening that even my parents don't play anymore. Of course, there are a few tracks that I do like, but I prefer the technomusic Carl Cox plays most of the time... In my opinion, the cd isn't really one piece of music, as I am used to with mixed albums. It's just a compilation of tracks put on a cd to make money in an easy way 
 I have the Proper Care and Feeding of husbands and I enjoyed that book.  Woman Power is full of blank pages for you to write your thoughts and ideas. I think it is a waste of time unless you just LOVE to journal.  If you took the useful information and took out the blank pages the book is about 2 chapters.  My advice is to put your money to better use at Victorias Secret.  Your husband will get a lot more out of it!! 
 I was tod to watch this film from a co-worker and I was jsut dissapointed. I could not believe I wasted almost 2 hours watching this trash. The story was very confusing with it going back and fourth through time. There are many pointless storylines and charactors. The acting is overdone that it's not believable. I like the actors in the film but they where jsit placed in the wrong movie 
 I've read all of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until I reached Hard Truth. After writing so many intellligent, suspenseful stories, Barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime. Murder's not nasty enough? How about the murder of children? Still not gruesome enough? Add incest/rape/torture...you get the picture.  Ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains, but really, who cares? The kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal. It's like bad language in humor--in general, it's just a cover for bad writing.   In Hard Truth, Barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness, in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable: the charm and intelligence of her main charcter, the well-reasoned defense of nature, the lush descriptions of each story's setting. I found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable. I give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character (a recently paralyzed ice climber), but otherwise I'm sorry I spent my time and money on it 
 The other readers pegged it nicely: this book is self-loathing and superior. I read this when I was fourteen and, fourteen years later, found myself rereading it when I cleaned out my closet. I can't believe the arrogance and myopia of its WASP narrator. This book is internalized homophobia coupled with upper middle class snobbery at its worst. No doubt if the author was born in Nazi Germany sixty years ago, he would be Hitler's right hand man in his pink triangle quest to oppress homosexuals, or at least, those too limp wristed and "icky" for Andrew Tobias' liking. I'm aghast other readers are recommending his book for those coming out of the closet. 
   I really thought this book had promise.  I liked the character of Edward in Hamilton's previous books, but "Obsidian Butterfly" made him look like a wimp! Giving the guy a "family" and a "personal life" after having him spend years as a cold and calculating hitman was so not the right thing to do.  Why didn't Hamilton have Anita fall in love with him, too?  After all, she's got lovers from a variety of different species! I couldn't even finish this book; it was so disappointing.    Another serious problem I have with the Anita Blake series is the lack of vampire hunting, as listed on the front of each novel: An Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter Novel.  It's quite the misnomer these days.  I wish Hamilton had stuck with Jean Claude (my favorite character) and created more scenarios around him and other vampires.  I probably will not by any more of her books unless they feature Jean Claude and/or actual vampire hunting 
 The sound quality on this CD is so poor that I could not enjoy it. I know it was recorded live, but I've heard excellent live recordings. There's no excuse for this 
 PLease consider how many books there are out there before you pick up THIS one.  Though you may be a fan of suspense or romance, this has a plot that has managed to be predictable, dull, and pretentious all at once.  The story is a basic spy story, and the little romance is obscured by slang which has no place in today's literature.  The author tends to describe things in a way that could take paragraphs (if not pages) to explain.  The only reason to go near this book is for a school project or in class assignment.  Otherwise, ther is no reason to read through this "classic".  
 I can't beleive how utterly desgusted i was. this story was awful. The plot of course is nice like always because it Pirates of th Carribean but the book is so easy to read and not written very well.    I'de just stick to the movie.  Nothing against the Pirates of the Carribean in general. It was the perfect thing to read if you missed the movie and was just catching up to find out what's going on but the book just deffinitly wasnt worth it at all otherwise 
 just a few facts about this book- from someone who knows, i live in victoria and know the priest from the book. michelle is a real person-but she is crazy and the doctor just wanted to make money off a book. this is what the priest from the book told me anyway. although if you are from victoria and reading this book it is kinda creepy when they talk about thetis lake, the malahat, rossbay cemetery, and the secret tunnels under victoria, well not so secret, all victorians know they're there 
 ordered and reordered, it kept showing up busted, and i went through consumer hell to return it.  actually, i'm still in consumer hell.  sometimes amazon blows 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 Aleister Crowley and company, including his favourite pupil, Frater Achad (Charles Stansfield Jones) were nothing more than mere charlatans who made a name for themselves in occult circles. This is just another in their endless array of manipulative books that were meant to attract and control the gullible--preferably the rich gullible--who had nothing else to do with their lives but to seek someone to have power over them. Conversely, Crowley and Achad had nothing to do with 'their' lives but to seek to have power over others: a perfect fit! 
 My taste runs to P.D. James and Martha Grimes.  I picked this up hoping to find a new series.  It reads like a Harlequin romance with a body in it.  Everything aches - eyes ache, voices ache, the gaslights ache.  Hardened policemen speak in voices husky with emotion.  And everyone but the villain is so blindingly good hearted as to be disgusting.  Throughout the story the author keeps building up to a horrible impending disaster - something so much worse and more terrifying than a cave-in.  The disaster turns out, surprisingly enough, to be a cave-in.  Absolutely tedious. 
 Alice Randall's original concept for "The Wind Done Gone" was for it to be a parody of "Gone with the Wind" in the style of "Shamela."  I haven't read "Shamela" (or "Pamela," which it is based on), but from what I have gathered, "Pamela" is a story about a virtuous woman who scorns her employer's advances, while in "Shamela," this woman is turned into a whore who was playing her employer all along.  If Randall was trying to make a story like that, then she succeeded.  If "Gone with the Wind" was a world of strong, intelligent, good white Southerners and their stupid but kind-hearted black slaves; then "The Wind Done Gone" is a novel where those white people are shown to be morons and fools who understand little and are really controlled by those they thought they ruled (unless they're gay, like "Dreamy Gentleman" and "Beauty" - then they're nice people).  In this sense, "The Wind Done Gone" succeeds.  Unfortunately, Randall was so busy ripping down the characters of "Gone with the Wind" that she forgot to create her own.  I totally agree that Cynara/Cinnamon/Cindy is a Mary Sue.  Unfortunately, she's not a very interesting one.  She spends most of the story whining and moping about how she is so beautiful yet no one will ever accept her because she is black and she can't believe her parents betrayed her and on and on and on...  The only time she does anything is when she leaves R. and enters into an improbable menage-a-trois with a black Congressman and a black woman who reminds her of Mealy Mouth (Melanie).  By that time, I could care less.  With a boring heroine (and that's particuarly insulting, considering what a complex heroine Scarlett O'Hara was) and a story that goes nowhere, this book doesn't have much.  I didn't buy that any of the characters of "Gone with the Wind" would act as they did in this book.  The idea of Scarlett taking blame for something Cynara did, Melanie killing a slave out of anger, or Gerald having sex with Mammy is preposterous.  However, if Randall had managed to make an interesting story, I would have forgiven it.  Unfortunately, she didn't.  The only character who really benefited from any revision was Lady (Ellen O'Hara) but the revelation that she had black blood seemed to only make an unclear point.  This book is good as a curiosity, and nothing more.  
 Okay, maybe I should have read the laundering instructions, which say to machine wash and then "drip dry" - but who makes BABY items that can't be machine dried? How many parents have the time to line-dry delicates?  The upshot is that this fell apart - melted in the dryer and got fluff all over EVERYWHERE - the first time we ever washed it. If you need something you can throw in the washer/dryer when it gets dirty and not worry about sorting, this is NOT your product. Grrr 
 Just one of the many lies i n this book overlooked (????) by Douglas Brinkley was Kerry supposedly in Cambodia in 1968 and  havinga telephone conversation with Pres. Nixon. HINT: Johnson was the president in 1968, not Nixon.  To read this book 'TOUR OF DUTY', you'd swaer that Kerry was a real life Rambo when in fact, Kerry was more concerned with carrying around 8mm cameras and old fashioned and heavy Smith-Corona typewritters layingt he foundation for his future presidential campaign.  In another regard, what happened to that BIG DRAFT KERRY said was goingt o happen in January 2005? And the reduced social security benefits? And the Herbert Hoover economy? These were just some of the lies that Kerry repeated over and over and over during his failed presidential campaign in 2004.   But what really happened? There was no draft and 2005 is nearly over. Our seniors got a raise, not a cut in social security benefits and all economic factors show that the economy is doing just great thank you.  Are you all glad that Kerry got whipped last year? Say yes.  [... 
 I have read the previous 11 reviews on this book and they all have one thing in common; NOT ONE of them says that they have ACTUALLY repaired  or even taken a watch apart by using this book.   The first 20 pages are easy to understand, but after that too many special tools are required and I can't follow it. After reading the parts of this book that I do understand, I don't see how just ANYBODY could repair a watch by using this book. It seems to me that this book was written with the intention for it to be used as a TEXTBOOK for a watch repair tech school or for watch repairmen to refer to in their trade.    If you're looking for a book that EXPLAINS how a watch works and what makes it tick but not intended to be a repair book, well, you won't find it in this book. For half the price of this one, try 'Instant Expert: Collecting Watches'. 
 Like Sardines packed in a tin, 6 of lovely Carole Lombard's lesser Paramount efforts are crammed on to two DVD-18 discs, so you get a nice cheap disc..which reflects how much respect (no less appreciation) Universal has for Lombard.  The films range from mediocre to OK. None of them great, none of them bad. The prints have not been restored, and look OK, but this is what Universal has to do when they are selling these films as a budget item.  Don't expect the incomparable high quality you get from Warner Bros. on these releases....the prints they were taken from are worn out and just plain bland.  in life, Lonbard was on fire. On these DVDs, she merely fizzles out 
 Well, I read through about 60 five and four star reviews before I gave up on trying to find somebody who was willing to tackle the problematic ending of this novel. Let me start off by saying that I was loving this book all the way through Part 5. The cliffhangers were great, I loved the authentic Southern voice King breathed into each of the characters. He had crafted something so good. And then he didn't treat it with the care it deserved. Part 6 was weak, seeming inconsistent with the characters and the tone of the book.  The problem is you have characters that have displayed heroism in every other circumstance suddenly choose cowardice. Paul, Brutal, Harry, Dean and even good John Coffey all decide there is nothing left to do but go through with the motions. Is it their failure in this decision that leads to Paul's unhappiness, his "damnation" as he states?  This book starts with a message of tremendous hope. There are miracles. God works through the most unlikely of instruments. But the book concludes with near despair, that God permits all the bad things to happen and responds that "He doesn't care." What a careless way to conclude-completely sapping out of us the hope that the rest of the book has enfused us with! It is affronting to a spritual mind. Obviously God does care, pouring out grace and miracles so often that we've labeled them commonplace, and commissioning messengers that mankind kills. Paul Edgecomb is such a great heroic character throughout the book, King treats him so poorly in the denoument. It pains me to say it, because I feel like I am chastising a wise old friend. Yet he need not look to the heavens for the cause of so much suffering, but deep inside for his own shortcomings in saving an innocent life 
 These goggles suck.  I swim an hour a day every day and not only do they scratch if a fingernail touches them, but they fog up in 5 minutes, fit terribly, are hard to adjust, and cause irritation around my eyes.  They leak water  and the different nose pieces are just a joke.  They go from tiny, a little bigger than tiny, huge, and then extra huge.  They don't fit!  What a waste of $15.  I've had similar success from goggles one can find at the grocery store.  They are only  $5, and they fog up and leak the same as these. 
 Robert G. Allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer.  If you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like I did, he will send you several junk emails a day.  Unsubscribing doesn't work, and trying to block the sender's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time.  The funny part is that the emails aren't even coded properly.  They always show up as just a bunch of html code.  Would you really take internet money-making advice from a guy who can't even code html properly?  Anyway, his spamming practices are completely illegal and it's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him.  But that shouldn't come as any surprise considering that mister Allen has been in trouble with the law before.  He's had several run-ins with the IRS, lawsuits against him, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I would also stay away from his Nothing Down real estate methods.  Many of those practices are illegal, and the president of the Nothing Down club in Atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it.  For more info on Allen, visit johntreed dottcomm, click on Real Estate Investing, then click Real Estate Guru Ratings.  Bottom line, don't trust this guy and don't buy his books. And if you're reading this Mr. Allen, take me off your @%#&*$ mailing list!! 
 Though I am a huge U2 fan, I was disappointed by this book.  It is clear that it is written from a very ambiguous 'post-modern' Christian viewpoint, and this is echoed on every page of the book.  The author's agenda of reframing Christianity in the 'po-mo' world is so obvious and incessant that it ruined all the other aspects of the book.  To end in a cliche way, "I still haven't found what I am looking for" 
 We read this book for our book club, and the overall feeling was that it was a quick, easy read, but very predictable and a little over the top.  We all agreed that we wouldn't be passing this book on to friends to read as we did not enjoy it that much 
 Lamp puts out very good, non-flickering light.  However, it is cheaply contructed with the lens cover easily dislogded.  For $100, this is unacceptable 
 I bought this book thinking it was another great chick lit, especially given Sarah Jessica Parkers review.  I rarley put a book down before finishing it, but this was so slow it was painful.  Don't bother! 
 In this HST compilation we are presented with a collection of over one hundred writings, all dated throughout a short period of the 1980s.  Almost all of it is rambling prose and soliloquy.  Because there was never any explanation of the context, intent, or setting in these writings, one can not easily understand it nor get any inferred meaning out of it.  He could have noted the circumstances of the places and people that he was writing about.  Instead this was just slapped together, lumped it into one, and dumped on bookshelves.  A lot of his opinions come off as if he is on a self-righteous pedestal.  He also liked to frequently note, that this or that famous person he was writing about was "a friend of mine."  In writing, once a person's name gets to a certain point he can convince a publisher to put out his work out no matter how awful onto the market, even if it is self-aggrandizing ramblings that no one can relate to nor benefit from.  So-called Gonzo journalism is mostly for those who couldn't write their way out of a paper bag.  HST lost his touch about thirty years ago.  Take him out of the oven, he's done 
 Where are the red turkeys for things that are dangerous? This thing was Designed by an idiot that never rode a bike. There is No rake to the small front wheel. Kids go over the damn handlebars. The designer should be sued 
 I am very disappointed with this book!  Where are the pictures of some of the recipes?  The price of this book, there should be photos of how to do something not bad drawings! I found the intro to be a waste of paper also, those pictures in the hard to see yellow/orange print could of gone behind the text.  I have yet to make anything from this book that turned out, which is wierd because I can make the stuff from Gourmet Magazine with no problems!  I especially do not like reading a recipe that is turned complicated because they have to be over the top with the wording!  I cannot believe I paid for this book!  
 Seems like they sold too many of the first volume, and have produced a second just to try to rake in a little more. Hardly any of the tracks on this album are funk, and as for Queen being the opener... it speaks for itself. To me, funk is typified by an active bass line, compelling beat and sharp guitar or brass; any or all of these are lacking on most of the tracks here. What you get instead is a collection of slothful, disparate songs, hardly conducive to dancing. Save your money 
 I only have one word to describe this video, BORING!!!!!!! Don't waste your money!!!  That is, unless you need a video to put the whole family to sleep 
 Twenty years ago, Michael Jackson was recognizably human, and although he was already considered to be slightly eccentric, he was the most beloved pop star on the planet.  And this album, even though it seemed harmless enough at the time, marks the point where things started to fall apart for him.  The infamous Pepsi Lite commercial shoot where he was seriously burned was part of an ad campaign coordinated with this album's release.    It was the last album made by the Jacksons/ Jackson 5, and the only one (so far) with all six brothers on it.  The album was rather hastily put together to fill a contractual obligation.  Michael contributes a couple of songs: the truly horrifying ballad "Be Not Always" and the danceable "State of Shock."    "State of Shock" was a collaboration with Mick Jagger, and it is now best remembered as the finale of the Live Aid concerts in the summer of 1985.  Mick did it as a duet with Tina Turner (and their wardrobe reveals went much better than Justin Timberlake's and Janet Jackson's did at the 2004 Super Bowl.)  And I think I have digressed, but that's OK because the other songs on the album are all done by the (then) less famous and (now) less notorious Jackson brothers.  These are assorted mid-1980s R&B pop numbers, nothing memorably good, nothing memorably bad.  The most enjoyable song, "Body" features the most obscure Jackson brother, Marlon, and also features an enjoyably moronic chorus which goes, "Girl I love your body, so won't you come home with me!" or words to that effect.   
 The installation instructions require you to tighten the fitting to the point that you break the little black intstallation tool.  Once the tank is empty it can not be refilled unless the station has an adapter.  I have not found a station with one yet.  You can not get the adapter off the tank with out the tool you broke.  They dont sell the black tool and it's designed so nothing else fits.  You have to purchase the whole fitting just to get the tool.  Another $17.00 down the drain. After my third one, I finally fabbed a tool out of a bolt head by grinding the head into the right shaped triangle.  
 The book explained the concepts of the subject well enough, but the number of typos in the problems and in the answer key led to many hours of frustration. I was often under the impression I was doing something wrong, only to find out the givens in a problem had incorrect prefixes, or some other error 
 Isn't it fishy that this book was reviewed by 3 people, each within 2 days of the other, posting nearly the same glowing "review" (5 stars of course) and not one of these 3 reviewers have voiced an opinion on any other book, at any other time before or after this book? How cheezy.  Like the one "real" reviewer, I also thought this book was textbookish and read more like a term paper for a community college class, only with about 80,000 too many words 
 I read this book as part of a book discussion group I had joined and it was so wretchedly lackluster it proved to be the death knell of me ever going back to the group. This book was half-baked, boring, and grievously devoid of even the tiniest bit of interest. I can't even give it credit for having any sort of vocabulary beyond the comprehension of an average twelve year old. The characters were so flat that I didn't even finish it. Later I heard from the other book discussion members even the title was a let down as Morgan never actually passed away (`twould have been a fitting end though - much like converting a testy horse into glue, something of actual use.) I've never read any of Anne Tyler's books but after this little gem I doubt I'll ever pick up another. 
 Don't buy this product.  It has been nothing but trouble.  It will reinstall it's driver every time you reboot, which will cause conflicts (you will be like WTF).  Also, the hardware will only work when connected to the USB port you originally used the installation disk with.  I hate this piece of junk and will replace it ASAP.  Perhaps there is something I am ignorant of in terms of networking, but I don't expect to have an MSCE to use a simple NIC.  This product is flaky at best 
 Creationist A: Boy, am I getting frustrated.  The evolutionists have an incredible amount to evidence that's really hard to refute.  I mean, WE true believers know they're wrong, but to the general public, let's face it, the evolutionist case just looks too good.  They got TONS of science on their side. What can we do?  Creationist B: How about this. Why don't we get someone to write a book that says there are complex biological features that could not evolve because the parts they're made up of couldn't function alone.   CA: But haven't we already tried that dozens of times in various ways?  I mean, the evolutionists have always said that looking at complex end products doesn't tell the full story.  And you gotta admit, that makes sense.  I mean, the whole point they make is that biological features evolve in a slow, step by step process over huge spans of time, one small change at a time. In the meantime, they say, the transitional forms could become extinct, making it seem like a complex form came out of nowhere. Like I said, this is frustrating.  CB: You're missing the point.  I know a guy who's a biochemist.  He can write up something using all the technical jargon.  He can even get into things like genetics and DNA and all that stuff and make it sound really convincing. I mean, it's not gonna fool biologists or biochemists but let's face it, THEY aren't the ones we're trying to fool.  We'll call it "intelligent design" instead of "creationism" .  We'll try to make it sound like it's something new.  People won't know what to think. When they see it on bookstore shelves, a lot of people might just think it's actually a legitimate science book.  What are they gonna do?  Go out and take advanced university courses in biology and chemistry to find out for themselves?  They're gonna think it's real.  CA: I get it. You just want to deliberately create confusion among the general public by writing over their heads, even if you know what you've written is garbage.  CB.  Precisely.  CA: Very sneaky!  I like the way you think.  Let's just hope those people don't bother to look at other sources of information.  They might just find out this ID stuff is baloney.  CB:  Shhh!!!  You'll give it away!! 
 I was very curious to see this movie because, I read an very good review on the movie, I think it said something like "if this movie does not make you stand up and be pride, then you do not need to stand", or something like that.  But, this movie was not complete.  What did Sonny do with his life after he left jail?  No one knows, because the movie was not completed.  DO not waste your time buying or seeing it 
 My senior year i had to pick this book for an economics project... bad choice. I do like how there are boxes placed every so often with little stories/parables/facts etc. thats pretty nice i'll say, but the rest is repetitive bi***in, depressing, whining information that does interest me in the least. i think i'm better off going and reading some harry potter books 
 This is an all-metal exterior scale that operates through a spring loaded bowl that pushes on a metal lever that is geared to the indicator. The overall exterior construction is pleasant, with a nice appearance and a few sheet metal screws located to easily allow access to the mechanism. Unfortunately, the mechanism itself is set up such that it indicates gross amounts reasonably well, but fine amounts poorly. For example, if you want to quickly see if you have about 2 pounds of potatoes, the scale is great for that. On the other hand, if you have 8 ounces of grain on the scale and you'd like to add another ounce, you won't know until you've added too much and the indicator finally overcomes the built-in friction necessary to move, at which point it will show that you've added a few ounces. There's also a kink in the mechanism at 2.5 lbs which the unit has to overcome, again blocking fine gradients from being measured in that area to an even greater extent than around other points on the scale. Overall, not a unit I'd recommend. 
 Save you money! This isn't really suitable for anyone who cares what their children read. Much, much better can be found elsewhere 
 This sheet is cheap, ugly, and scratchy.  Instead, buy a portable crib sheet, they fit perfectly and are available in lots of colors.  They are softer and more durable 
 This book is soporific.  I fell asleep every time I picked it up.  The opportunity for a meaningful and dynamic book was there but the promise was never kept.  Boring!  It is unlikely that I will read anything else by this author.  Give it to someone you don't like very much 
 This book is what I'd call repetetive and boring. It's not the type of book I'd read if I had no other choice. It was recommended to me and every time I turned the page, I hoped it would get better. But it was basically the same story almost every time. The same idea that racism is hard. We know that. This book states that more times than is necesary. So unless you are terribly interested in Vietnam or black history, I suggest you read something else 
 The index in the version I have is completely inaccurate.  What's more, to obtain errata you're required to enter a code on the publisher's website.  This code is not stamped on the book but is on the packaging which I unfortunately threw away before I noticed the index was completely inaccurate.    Save yourself the headache and get a different version 
 I bought a huge set of these, some from Amazon and some from Marshall Fields. Unfortunately, the plates and smaller dishes began to show tons of silvery/gray marks from silverwear almost immediately. I was so dissappointed that I asked at Marshall Fields and the employee said that the glaze is not thick enough on the stoneware and that she had heard similar complaints from others. The only way to get it off (and not even completely) is to scrub them for a long time with "BarKeepers Friend" or a similar powder. I thought I was going to have this set forever, but I'm now shopping for something new. I'm almost embarrassed to serve company with them. The plates are quite big and rather heavy. But the shape of the bowls and cups are nice. Too bad 
 I'll be sincere.I didn't read all this trash-book.Someone lent this trash-book to me, some years ago, here in Brazil.This book is so bad, that I didn't finished it.In fact, I read less than 10% of this biblical-garbage. This was a best-seller some years ago, in many parts of the world, including Brazil and USA. Today the best seller is Da Vinci Code.A trash-book so absurd, as this trash-book. Every time has its own trash-best-seller. About a century ago eugenics was fashion.Later came communism, fascism, nazism, ufologism, etc. This bibliolatry is a good book only for morons or atheists.If you are an atheist, this trash-book is a good way to debunk the bible. 
 Rob Zombie has lost a few steps when it comes to good music. There are only two or three tracks on here worth listening to. At least he's making good movies. I guess he spread himself too thin 
 I bought this for two reasons: because I wanted to learn about LBOs, and because I had heard that the journalism was good, and was hoping for something like 'The Right Stuff'.  The cover of my copy blurbed 'unflawed' writing, and 'all the suspense of a first-rate thriller'.  The last is true only if your expectations of a first-rate thriller reach no higher than Michael Crichton.  The writing is a plodding 'you are there' journalism-school pastiche of the New Yorker: Gulfstreams are sleak, CEOs are silver maned, side-kicks are bantams, lawyers look like they model for GQ, etc. Investment bankers bark, curse, are struck by inspiration, work off grudges and wave their lingams around at the sort of comic book level Stan Lee would scorn.  I finally realised, after slogging through the first 200 pages or so, that 'Barbarians at the Gate' is, in large part, essentially porn for aspirational middle managers.  There is no-one in this book whom I would want to know, unless I were a sociologist.  But I don't even trust the sociology, because the psychology is so superficial.  I did learn something about the process of LBOs, and for that a star is in order.  I didn't particularly enjoy learning it. 
 Yes, that's right.  This worked for me for only one day.  What a disappointment 
 how bad can she get???? i loved so many of her books....but this one was bad...dont bother....read her older ones.."Echoes " is the best book of hers...i loved it.... 
 This is one of those CD's that are good for one song.  "Remind Me" from the Geico Caveman commercial where he is in the airport and sees his poster on the wall.  It is clear that Royksopp has done much better with their newest CD "The Understanding" it has at least 3 good songs.  I like Royksopp when they actually create music instead of certain cacophonous filler material. "Remind Me", "Only This Moment", "What Else Is There?", and "49 Percent" are their best works, 3 of which are found on the CD "The Understanding". They are pretty good, but if they really want to impress, they should continue writing songs like "Only This Moment" and "What Else Is There?". "Remind Me" is cool, but I was disappointed with the rest of the boring stuff on the "Melody A.M." CD 
 tried making some hard candy and it started to caramelize at the 230F point - not good!  i'm going to buy another thermometer from another company 
 I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the "female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part..." Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick. 
 In the Long Ago Far Away, I remember reading some of the Anita Blake series, but being no fan of mysteries or detectives I let the series fall by the wayside.  If a writer is truly great, then I can stay rivited even if the subject isn't one of my favorites.  I adore Faeries, to the point of practicing a post-modern version of Faerie Faith with no rules and no boundaries (and hence no obsessive traditionalism).  Ms. Hamilton now has fairies with no rules and no boundaries.  None.  Zip.  Nada.  Yet somehow, this is the inverse of liberating.  Oh, I am not surprised.  I have something of a fetish for well-written negative reviews, and reading some of the erudite, articulate attacks on Ms. Hamilton's writing have been illuminating.  I am fully aware of the direction taken by Anita Blake and I knew to expect it with Meredith Gentry.  So essentially, mixed blood fairy girl (1/2 Unseelie, 1/4 Seelie Brownie, 1/4 mortal - or some approximation of that mess) without the immortality gene runs away to escape torture at the hands of the Queen of the Unseelie Court, her Aunt Andais.  She becomes a private investigator in Los Angeles.  Auntie sends a few of her bodyguards to retrieve the wayward Princess Meredith and bring her back to the Court, where the Queen will make Merry an Offer She Can't Refuse.  Part and parcel with this offer comes the requirement to have sex with the Queen's Guards until she conceives, because a child will guarantee Merry the Throne.  Merry's competing with her cousin, Cel, who is under the same orders to produce a child.  And that's about it.  From some of the reviews here, I expected a lot more sex.  There are a few near misses and a few actual sex scenes, but they're nothing special.  The kink quotient is quite mild, comparatively speaking.  Even the scene that involves tentacles peters out to nothing.  It seems that, if the character is unattractive or undersirable in any way, Meredith will be spared sex with this fiend at the last minute, in the most contrived way possible.  Merry, apparently, doesn't take any for the team.  The most diffecult thing about reading Laurell Hamilton is the way she writes.  Her vocabulary seems very limited and the writing is quite repetitious.  Whenever someone bites/something stabs Meredith, the pain is described as "sharp and immediate."    "Burning and instantaneous" "Terrible and abrupt" "Stinging and urgent"  I'm not even trying.  Along with this limited vocabulary, Ms. Hamilton writes very much in passive voice.  Is, was, were, has, had, be, been, etc.  Dialogue is also stilted and awkward, with normal diction sometimes ignored to give a character an opportunity to say something "witty."  Characterization isn't a strong suit either.  Meredith is a little dull, but most heroines are.  Her sex partners all have nearly identical personalities, and I wish there had been some variety in the way Ms. Hamilton chose to describe them, rather than a run-down of features and attributes.  So why did I read it?  If I knew all this in advance, why did I even drop a dime on it?    I enjoy erotica, and, as previously mentioned, I'm a faerie fan.  I expected the writing to be terrible, but bearable enough for a few moments of shallow enjoyment.  Then I expected to come here, slap down a single star, and go on my merry way.  If at all possible, I am even more offended by the fact the most of Ms. Hamilton's ideas were good, but she blew it by not following through, or by failing to explore character emotion, or by making the plot secondary to the sex.  To have ideas that are actually interesting and then to drop the ball is even worse than having no good ideas at all (Anne Rice's "Beauty" series, *cough*cough).  But I can't give Ms. Hamilton one star, because the ideas were there, shining just below the surface.  The idea of fairies as celebrities in the mortal world . . . the concept of a fairie exodus to the United States . . . old gods becoming fairies . . . etc, etc . . .  So the book gets two stars, and it could have garnered more if Ms. Hamilton had her priorities straight.  1. Ms. Hamilton, you are a grown woman.  Mention the business parts of the male chracters by name please.  Obscuring gential terms with "him" and "himself" makes you look sqeamish and unsure of yourself.  If you want to write something with a little heat and intensity, clarify the act, please.  2. Thesaurus.  3. If you want all the sex, make the non-sexual parts longer so that they represent a plot.  4. Why is everyone so rampantly heterosexual, and horrified at the idea of homosexuality?  These are fairies, not humans.  Why would they possess our prejudices?  5. Let Meredith sleep with unattractive characters now and again.  Refusing to do so makes her seem like an elitist snob.  Enough complaining.   Look at the reviews and see if this is a mess you want to wade into.  I've started the second book, but after the first "sharp and immediate" there, I've set it aside until my annoyance ends.  If you want a modern fairy tale, try "Tithe."  It's considered YA, but it's far more satisfying than Merry Gentry's world. 
    O.K. I didn't buy the book, but I searched for reference to "immortality", which, as I suspected would give a very concise philisophical snapshot of the author. Lets see now, he speaks of the "demographic" problems associated with longer life and lower firtility. First obvious flaw in his reasoning is that we would be marginally active and retire for the last 40 to 50 or so years of a radically extended life(or 1000 years or so). The premise is rediculous because the goal of adult onset gene doping would be to extend health and vitality. Immaging a world in which you could live to 150 years or so with the strength and clearity of a 40 or 30 year old? Are you going to just "sit down in your rocking chair"?      Even going with the worker ratios, in Japan for instance that he speaks of, only 2 for every 1 retired, we could adjust the theory that social security operates-if you retire at age 65 with indefinite life span, you should collect for just 20 years-go back to work, start a business. Go back to school-learn something new-all better ideas than just infering that we should just roll over and die because redical life extension might cause some potential "problems" with systems put in place when humans were suffering and dying at young ages.     Also, "age differences" between the developed world and the underdeveloped world. Yes, there will be definate philosophic differences but they exist for other reasons rather than just "older women"(refering to aging populations that will have a slight increase in female to male ratios) in the North and "younger men"(refering to a higher male to female ratio in younger populations-as well as selective gender bias) in the South, or underdeveloped world. Maybe the influence an older, somewhat more femine population in the West might be a moderating influence governing our policies with regard to the rest of the world? Just a thought. But-waite a minute! Life extension will be available to the men as well as the women, unless we find more men just wanting to "roll over and die".        Mr Fukuyama seems to be saying that changing anything that "makes us human" is wrong.       I have a question to pose to him and any of you out there.      What is so good about being "human"? Lets see, we are a vehicle for the "The Selfish Gene" which only cares about its transmission from one temporary entity to the next-and after the age of reproduction-who cares? Right? So we are disposable!Birth-Shcool-Work-Reproduction-Death. Right about when we start to begin to live, the genetic time bomb begins to visabley manifest itself.       Like Francis, I was born in the middle of the "Baby Boom" generation. I am looking forward to human intellegence being able to preserve precious consciousness indefinitley. I have always known it would happen and I have a better than 50% chance at seeing this. This was considered impossible 30 years ago and I (and others like me) would state this and be shrugged off. What is really of concern to me is that now, we know it is possible but that some believe we should just "roll over and die"! Rediculous! We should persue radical life extension and also encourage near zero total birth rates so we can escape the Birth-School-Work-Reproduction-Death senerio!  
 This book never finds its plot, and like a sitcom passed its prime, jumps the shark repeatedly in an effort to distract the reader from this potboiler drivel and at the same inject forward motion into the book. This might be one of the worst books I have ever read. Which is really too bad, because the premise- women with their own language and bond- is very promising 
 Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...  But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of "The Partner" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks 
 A fan of the Notebook, I was dissapointed to see that Sparks has hit cruise control. There we no surprises here, and the depth of the characters could be measured in centimeters - especially the doctor, who is very one dimentional. I think it wouldn't have taken him that much more time to flush out the story, but, well, he didn't.  It doesn't mean I won't keep reading him, I just hope that he gets  his bearings back. So far, the Notebook is still my favorite 
 Who is her editor?  The main character self-analyzes to the point of nausea. We got it. We do not need the author to explain to us what she is trying to say.  I felt, as the reader, that the author did not trust me to "get" her own work. It would have been a much better novel had she given her readers more credit. Not to mention, if she grew up in a cold family, with no experiences to open up her sexuality and sensuality, I did not buy that one boyfriend would all of a sudden be a panacea to a lifetime of suppression. 
 Filled with insider gossip and scatter-shot observations on the sexes, this is not exactly a work for the ages. In fact outside of the catchy title, I wonder who reads this stuff besides other chatty insiders who have made a cottage industry of feeding off one another like intestinal mites. So why did I read it. Well, I got it free, it's well written and I was "seduced" by the title-- okay, it was by the nubile cover that comes across like 1940's noir I used to sneak past my mother. In short, it was strictly a glandular decision and not exactly a flattering one, proving I suppose some testy thesis about men buried somewhere in the 300-plus pages. And that's the book's main problem. I don't know any more about how the author feels about these issues than when I started. I guess I was expecting something stereotypically masculine, like a cogent train of thought. But then, I suppose that just proves some equally testy thesis about women buried somewhere in the same text. In my fantasy life, I dream of voting out of town not only the whole greedy Clinton-Bush, Repubocrat axis, but the incestuous political culture that feeds off them. Most definitely, it's about driving out all those within martini-mixing distance of Pennsylvania Avenue. After setting down this book, my fantasies ran wild. 
 I was surprised at the extent of the author's blasphemy. He seems to think he can read the mind of God. He seems to claim that he knows what God wants, how God communicates and so on. If I didn't know better, it seems like he's claiming to be a prophet. I can think of better religious books.  I'll give him two stars because I assume (hope) he's good intentioned 
 This book was written in 1921.  Read by my grandmother, mother, and now myself.  My Grandmother gave me her copy. My mother always said how she would have loved having a lunch box with compartments like Elnora's.  My grandparents were pioneers in Southern Alberta and times were tough and money sparce. School was not free and it was hard work getting there.  This book shows us how to focus on what is important and what it takes to get there. Though Elnora is fictional, there were thousands of young women trying to get educated in that time period. Thank you Gene for a beautifully written story of triumph and love 
 Cons:  Defect: the backlight does not work.  Shortcoming: has Palm OS 3.1, an early version for Handspring Visors. Neutral:  (expedited) Shipping time: 5 days Pros:  Price  PS: Vendor customer support contacted me and provided a replacement unit with a working backlight, free of additional charge :) 
 Unfortunately the book didn't uncover any "secrets" whatsoever as the title alludes to.  The information contained in this book is very basic.  I found one major problem with the text in that it encourages "component depreciation".  My research and understanding is that this was clearly outlawed in the US in the 1980s.  When I contacted the publishing company for clarification, no one would answer this simple question.    If this book was filled with high quality ideas, I would have overlooked an error or two and given this book 4 or 5 stars.  But that wasn't the case as I've only been in the real estate game for a short time and already knew most of what is contained in this text.  All in, this book isn't even worth the $5 +shipping I paid for it used... 
 I returned both that I ordered because the playmat was not included in the item as advertised. I am very unhappy with the item's advertising 
 The new edition (vocalist Stu Block) has killed the perfect vocal line-up w/ his ridiculous, overkilled "80's power metal" screams.  It just doesn't fit & it ruins the few songs w/ potential on this release, which is a far cry from the last one anyway. There's nowhere near as much melody in the music & pitifully few vocal harmonies, further widening the gap from Oblivion. I keep listening ... hoping it'll grow on me & I'll somehow eventually get past the new festering puss-sore, nails-on-a-chalkboard style vocals, but it just ain't hap'nin.  Fortunately for the band tho, it would seem I'm the odd man out b/c all these other reviews seem to be raving. I sincerely hope no one else is as disappointed as I am. These guys have so much more talent & ability than comes thru on this cd. Better luck next time fellas 
 The CD came as promised and in the condition promised.  I'm very satisfied 
 If your brick walls are the immigrant generation, do yourself a favor and get a book specializing in that country's research rather than this one.  Despite the 2005 copyright, the majority of the advice would have still held true a decade ago.  And the emphasis on early American record issues is a real minus for those with later arriving ancestors.  Despite the introduction's suggestion, the problem-solving techniques alone weren't worth the lack of examples in my problem areas.  However, if you've been working on your genealogy for decades, need a refresher, and are working on your DAR application... you might love this book 
 I can't find anything good to say about this book.  I agree that it's tedious, boring and a waste of money.  I put it down and picked it up and then asked myself 'why', closed it up and put it up.  I was going to sell it here but everyone else who tried to read it beat me to it.  It's not even worth the $.01. 
 I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN IT ARRIVED IN PIECES.  THEY DIDN'T PACK THIS WELL AND I HAD TO SEND IT BACK.  I WAS IMPRESSED BY THE FREE RETURN POSTAGE. I DO WANT THIS ITEM AND HAVE REQUESTED ANOTHER.  HOPEFULLY IT WILL ARRIVE IN ONE PIECE THIS TIME.  THEN IT MIGHT BE WORTH MORE STARS 
 I'm sorry, but this is honestly one of the worst movies I've ever had the displeasure of witnessing.  I purchased it after reading ambitious reviews that cited this movie was what mainstream horro should be. In reality, it's nearly everything that's WRONG with low-budget films.   First off, the camera work is horrible. Secondly, I've seen more convincing actors in elementary school plays. I mean, these actors make Keanu Reeves look like Denzel Washington. And finally, the story was absolutely horribly done. I admit, the premise itself had some promise--But the way it was executed completely took away any interest factor I might have had.  Plain and simply, this film was unwatchable. I turned it off 65% through it. And I would've turned it off earlier but I was hoping for some beacon of hope to appear on the screen.  If you care at all about quality, in any sense, DO NOT GO NEAR THIS PIECE OF TRASH 
 I originally chose this title because it was cheaper to add it to my order and get the free super saver shipping then paying the minimum shipping rate. However I can honestly say that I would have been better off if I had just paid the extra dollar as I would not have wasted my time reading this garbage.  Lets look at the title shall we "10 Secrets I Learned from The Apprentice". First of all I am highly skeptical that the author learned these 10 "Secrets" from the television show. More likely the author just wanted to write a book with some sort of tie in to a popular television show in misguided hopes of making some money.  Well guess what, the book is selling for scraps now. So if you want to learn how to end up in the metaphorical bargain bin of whatever your chosen profession get this book. If you want Apprentice like advice for business read one of the books authored by Trump that have made it to the best seller lists 
 I loved The Secret Life of Bees but I found this book to be formulaic and uninteresting.  Its difficult to like any of the characters, especially  the main character, and much of the scenes with the monk are sexually gratuitous. It has as much deapth as a Harlequin romance novel.  The relationship between her and the mother was a bit more dimensional but only slightly.  All in all, a poor follow-up to Sue Monk Kidd's break out bestseller.  Don't waste your time.  
 I have derived many hours of pleasure from this author. My favorite is Ivanhoe. I wouldn't recommend this one, though. It is boring and confusing 
 Plain and simple, yes this thing is a comprehensive document of the early years of 10cc, BUT the re-mastering job on this release is abysmal.  The slightly less completist versions that Repertoire have done recently have MUCH better sound 
 Let me start by saying that although I have not read Dr. Pollack's book, I did attend one of his lectures discussing "The faith of biology, the biology of faith."  Thus, this is more a comment on Dr. Pollack's explanations of his approach to this critical issue than a comment on his book.  Dr. Pollack seems to take a rather interesting though confusing standpoint on humanity and its search for the meaning of existence through science and religion.  He seems to argue that science and religion are somewhat linked in their striving for human nature, although their insights are different. However, Dr. Pollack was not clear on how this two insights are diferent (or the degree of extraneousness).   Also, I got a little confused on his discussion of the "unknown" and the "unknowable."  Obviously, this is not an easy reading, and anyone attempting to understand this book should first try to focus more on the human side of life rather than on the spiritual or purely scientific side, which Dr. Pollack seems to leave unclear 
 This book is too big an attempt by the famed Harvard biology professor to try to cover "everything". If we compare Mr. Wilson's "total map" with Mr. Ken Wilber's attempt on the same kind of synthesis. It will become obvious that Mr. Wilson fell short because he puts an "Environmental Policy" category where a "Spirits/Psychology" one is more appropriate. How can any integration attempt misses such important inner subjects?! I guess Mr. Wilson decided that he will stick to his iconoclastic scientism view rather than being open-minded. We, as readers, should be aware of his bias. There was a Newsweek bookreview article titled: "Why Wilson is Wrong" published in 1999.  
 Okay, I'm a fan of roasts.  At least I was back when funny people were doing the roasting.  And I'm a fan of Shatner.  At least I was back in the day when I was a 12 year old Star Trek fan.  I looked forward to this video...it seemed like a slam dunk purchase.  But this isn't funny.  It's a conglomeration of nastiness and schoolyard "humor," which might only be funny to young teens, and only because they're looking for a way to rebel.  Gay jokes?  Stupid gay jokes besides?  Is this what American humor has become?  I am not a prude (my favorite comedian is Bill Hicks, ferchrisakes...no Pat Boone, he) but this was not funny, mostly, but simply crude.  The part I most appreciated was when one of the couple of roasters with any wit about them turned to the other comedians and said "pee-pee ka-ka jokes: very funny stuff, guys."  The worst part about this is that now I sound like one of those old geezers:  "Back in my day, we knew what comedy was!"    Shatner, it must be said, is a pretty easy target.  But most of the humor in this DVD misses that target.  It is lame and juvenile and embarrassing 
 I was looking for a book that discussed the milk controversy in depth. I found this book to be silly and a waste of my time and money. If you are looking for a well-researched discussion on this topic, read The China Study 
 A bit of context: I am an intermediate photographer recently introduced to digital SLR through the purchase of a Nikon D70.  I am well-versed in general photographic knowlege and the theories behind color management and light in the context of digital photography.  I purchased this book hoping that it would help me to understand enough about color management to at least start asking the right questions about how to apply color management to my setup.  I became so frustrated with it that I've had to stop reading it several times just to collect myself.  In no particular order, the book is flawed in the following ways:  * It is not well written.  I stumble over poor writing more than the average reader, but this book simply had too much akward prose and was overly conversational.  Unfortunately, this poor writing was more than just a distraction: important points were frequently lost to unclear writing. * Full of marginally useful examples.  The author provides step-by-step instructions for numerous software programs (and a few pieces of hardware too) that are completely useless for those of us who don't have the software (or hardware). * Many "tips" revealed to be unimportant.  One of my biggest pet peeves was that on several occassions the author provided lengthy explantions of processes, features, or concepts, only to wrap up his discussion with "but all of this isn't really important, so you don't need to worry about it." * Poor organization.  The book could have benefited significantly from a reorganization around those tasks that the average reader was likely to try to do.  I found myself finishing the book still unclear where to even start thinking about my color management setup, and with basic questions still unanswered. * Meaningless examples.  The author provides (some very striking) images in support of his ideas, but many are not directly related his points (single images with captions like "Professional photographer X uses color management to make sure that the colors he sees on his screen are the same as those on the final print")  I give it two stars instead of one because there is some useful information in the text -- it's just incredibly hard to find amid all of the clutter 
 I was forced to read this book for school and literally fell asleep a few times reading it. There is no excitement or adventure in the storyline and reading it just makes you feel more drowsy with every page turn. Who wants to read about a self-centered jerk who barely gets any better throughout the course of the book? Not me! If there was a list of the worst books ever written this would remain the chart-topper for eternity!!!!!! 
 Johnson lumps in "the gay lifestyle" with "alcoholism, drug addiction, sexual perversion, and any number of terrible problems that can afflict a family" (Pg 172). If you find this appalling, then avoid the book because there's a lot more of this.  If that doesn't bother you, then you might find some inspiration here. Clearly many have. If you prefer anecdotes/stories to bullet point advice on how to pick yourself up, this is the book for you.  But to be on the safe side, if you're looking for a role model in dealing with homosexuality in your family, do look beyond this author. While many believe that homosexuality can be "cured" with prayer, it is more widely held (by the medical community amongst others) that this is not a condition that can be cured any more than blue eyes or black hair. Be sure your approach doesn't do lasting damage to your child and your family.  
 It usually takes me about a week or two to get through a paperback. I've been  struggling to read this every night in bed for two months. It's boring and uninteresting. I quit 
 "Fascism, what it is and how to fight it" is presented as a work by Leon Trotsky, but is in fact an assemblage of excerpts from various of Trotsky's writings, collected and ordered by Sara Lobman and printed by the Pathfinder Press.  The original source for each passage is cited in a footnote.  Other footnotes, apparently written by Ms. Lobman to make Trotsky's references more familiar, give historically useful facts such as "The Jacobins were the revolutionary petty-bourgeois forces in the French Revolution of 1789."  As a short introduction to Trotsky's thought, it can serve its purpose provided one is already versed in Marxist rhetoric 
 Her work is unreadable.  It's too bad she abandoned what she had accomplished with Erosion so many years ago.  She is good at convincing people of her importance and so no one will tell the truth about her work.  If someone does, that person risks being thought of as a bad reader.  But there is nothing to nourish the soul in her poems. Nothing to contemplate.  They are not even interesting technically. The passionate defenses she generates always make me think of "protesting too much."  Her work is like reading impenetrable critical essays.  And even critical essays can be written for pleasurable reading, with ease and style.  American poetry has gone down a wrong road by following her example 
 I find this video tape of Eminem very boring, I thought it will had more to it, well for the price it was not much because you could had see the music video he did on mtv or vh1.  It mostly that, you see music video on this tape, well if you are a fan and didn't saw some of is previous music video go buy it but if you want to know more about Eminem well that tape is not for you.  I thought it was more a documentary with music video, I thought Eminem will talked about his music video, his music, his life but no you just see his old and more recent music video and that's it.  I think this video tape is not worth the price I pay 
 My God, Chuck Klosterman has confused himself with the supposed subject of his own book!!  What a narcissist!!  The fact that such a weak and unimaginative writer has a column in Esquire says much about the low level of contemporary American public discourse.  Avoid this one 
 I bought this book based on the blurbs, and the fact that I enjoy an occasional Steven Covey - type read.  This sure wasn't one of them.  I started the book once and put it down after reaching the third point, thinking that maybe this wasn't simplistic pap written in an incredibly juvenile fashion, but that maybe for whatever reason my head wasn't into it.  I took it on a recent vacation, thinking that with my mind unfettered, etc., perhaps I might be more open to what the book had to say.  Wrong.  This is a terribly written book, with a hokey, herky-jerky style by an author in need of some creative writing classes, spouting the most basic of tenants as if they are something new.  For Pete's sake, basically this fellow took Zig Ziglar and put in a clever twist of the 'Time Bandits' style confrontations with famous characters. I noted with amusement that all of the characters basically had the same sort of dialogue. When Anne Frank has the same speech patterns as Solomon and Harry Truman, I know I'm reading a really bad book.  Comparing this to Og Mandino is an insult to Og.   This book is to motivational literature what 'Bridges of Madison County' was to fiction 
 I am a big fan of Dick's. His short stories are his strength, his imagination is superb, but this novel is peculiar to say the very least. I am well aware that a major criticism of his body of work is the uneven writing. Sometimes he soars, but at other times it feels as though he wrote a book in a week and stuffed it in an envelope and mailed it off to the publisher without giving it another thought. This is just such a book. How it won the John W. Campbell Memorial award for the best novel of 1974 is beyond me. It would never get published today.  The beginning is classic Dick: a famous man wakes up in  a flophouse after a murder attempt on his life and finds that he doesn't exist. No records, no biography, fame all gone, a pocket full of money, that's it. But from that point on the story lumbers from one encounter with a ditzy woman to another. It's all rambling filler that has nothing to do with the story. The policeman in the title doesn't show up until halfway through. Granted, the story picks up a bit at that point, but then it loses its focus again and the ending is a rush job if ever there was one. The whole thing turns out to be a drug induced figment of his imagination. How disappointing is that? That's as bad as  those Star Trek time travel episodes where everyone goes through absolute hell, they should all be traumatized for life and suffer from terminal PTSD, but then the loop is completed and it's as though none of it ever happened. Arghhh!   If you think Dick was one of the great Sci-Fi masters of all time, read this book, but keep it in context with his corpus of work (i.e. somewhere in the bottom half). If you are just starting to read Dick, skip this one for a while. But by all means read his short stories. Some of them are keepers for all time.  
 After two hours of watching it, I still don't know what it was about.  Yes, the scenery is fantastic, but a National Geographic film would have done more.    I applaud the acting of Milla Jovovich, and Nastassja Kinski.  But, the kudos reviewers have given to Peter Mullen would have been better deserved if this were a silent movie.  I hardly heard anything he said and there are no English subtitles offered on the dvd.  As for Wes Bentley, that's acting?  He kept the same expression when he was having sex as when he was having a gun pointed at him, or a co-worker being blown to "Kingdom Come" (that's a pun based on the movie).  He makes Clint Eastwood look like Laurence Olivier.    The film is supposedly based on a Thomas Hardy book, but very loosely based, and the scriptwriters should have at least used Cliff Notes to have learned more about the story and the character development.  They obviously fell asleep after the first couple of chapters and made up the rest.   
 Others have written reviews of the book.  I'll keep my comments to the narration.  Michael McShane's performance is TERRIBLE.  He constantly sounds out of breathe.  His cadence is wooden.  His Spanish pronunciation is terrible.  His accents are atrocious.  Please get a new narrator for the next Dale Brown book - hopefully this one will be better 
 The application of the Golden Rule to our everyday lives is something that we can all agree is good.  John Maxwell does a good job or defining the golden rule, its worldwide acceptance, and how we can apply it to our everyday.  It was more like a walk down memory lane; to a time when a teacher or mentor first explained the concept to us.  However I do have a few concerns with Mr. Maxwell's book.  First there might need to be a better job at researching Fletcher thoughts on Relativism...in his book he labels Fletcher as the father of mordern day Realativism...quoting (or rather misquoting) Fletcher's statement that love can justify anything.  I am in not postition to defend Fletcher, for I am not that familiar with his work, however he does not just use the term love.  Rather he uses the term Agape Love, coming from the ancient Greek...the highest and purest form of love...one that God would have for us, a term any minister or pastor of the Christian Faith would know very well.  Second after page 86 the book get repediative and seems to get off track.  This links to my last issue with the book and why it gets a bit off track, as it turns into an advertisement for Mr. Maxwell's corporation, the last several pages are nothing but adverstisements asking you to visit their web site for free character quiz and then taking you down a road of Buy...buy...buy our products.  Not what I expected and was somewhat disappointed.  In short taking some know concepts, putting a somewhat of a new spin on them and then publishing to add another book to the list of those authored.  Part of the disappointment is that I know this book could be better 
 I mainly bought this album because I was going to see them on this tour.  In fact the gig I was at was the opening show on the tour.  Again, the band uses their patented formula basically creating the same album over and over again.  I find most of this album to be very average.  Actually after listening, this album is not very good at all.  The majority of the songs are cliché ridden in both music and lyrics.  There are a couple of catchy tracks most notably "Safe In New York City" which is a bit different but most of this album is cock rock at its most basic.  Probably one of the bands weakest efforts 
 I have never put down a book (actually, I have, once) I Have never left a series  unfinished I am leaving my third decade I have read this book one and a half year ago. No one goes anywhere and they go slowly. I Will probably finish the series when i get to be around seventy, so I can say that I've finished it and go in peace with myself and maybe get Mr. Jordan's hidden message, which I seriously doubt.  I am also posting this on book one, so no one goes unwarned, as the series started off pretty well.   Shame 
 On its own merits, Stone's book deserves only one star, but because it has brought Socrates to the attention of a wider audience than he otherwise would have it gets a second star.  Maybe Stone learned Attic Greek in order to write this book, and maybe he didn't.  Nothing Stone wrote in this book required analysis of primary sources or any depth of knowledge of Attic Greek, in contrast with the truly scholarly work on Socrates, which often turns on the evaluation of subtle stylistic and linguistic evidence in the ancient sources.  Stone's methods are those of the advocate, the special pleader, and the polemicist, which of course is what he was for his entire journalistic career. He was clearly not a scholar, in spite of his pretensions.  He would have fit in quite well with the clever Sophists Socrates had so much fun arguing against, and so little respect for.  Perhaps Stone had a grudge against Socrates because  Socrates would never have taken Stone seriously had the two ever  met.  Socrates would no doubt have taken Stone apart just like he did everyone else he encounters in Plato's Dialogues.  The idea that Socrates could have used a "free speech" defense at his trial in ancient Athens is preposterous.  The Athenian democracy quite frequently fined, exiled, or put to death its citizens for the flimsiest of reasons.  One has only to read Thucydides to learn this.  There was no First Amendment in  ancient Athens.  Athenian law was whatever a jury said it was on any given day.  It was for good reason that pure democracy as practiced by Athens developed such a bad reputation that it has never been seriously tried since.  A good antidote to Stone's screed is the paper by Gregory Vlastos called "The Historical Socrates and Athenian democracy", which appears in his book "Socratic Studies".  Vlastos also wrote a critical review of Stone's book in The New York Review of Books.  It should be noted that Vlastos identified himself as being Leftist in his personal political views, but didn't let that interfere with his scholarship.  And I doubt that he ever let KGB agents take him out to lunch 
 The book was supposed to be a translation, but the author has ended up publishing her biases in the garb of presenting it in narrative form. A quick search on the author reveals that she is a controversial character and that Encarta removed her contribution after investigating her scholarship.   As someone interested in learning about Hinduism, I was looking for someone who could just give me the facts instead of a polemicist. The book was a huge disappointment. I wish I had known about Encarta yanking her piece on the grounds of poor scholarship before I embarked on reading her "translation. 
 I wanted to love this toaster, I really did, I read all the reviews and was convinced that this would be a great working, long lasting toaster.  I bit the bullet, spent way more money than I wanted to, and ordered this toaster. I like the way it looks and I like that it doesn't 'pop-up', you can check the toast anytime that you want and return it to toasting with the cool lever.  However, I wish I returned it. It is slow, it is a pain to plug in before each use (must be unplugged when not being used), and worse of all :  it does NOT toast evenly!  Top is burnt, bottom is not even toasted at all, or one slice is done perfect and the other slice is like it was never put into the toaster. This toaster would be a waste of money at $9.99, it should be illegal to charge $200. for it.  That said, Amazon's price of 200. was a better deal than William Sanoma's at 299., but I am still sooooo disappointed in this purchase.  Upon re-reading the other reviews I find that the people that purchased 'refurbished' models seem more pleased with their purchase.  Leads me to wonder if upon 'refurbishing' they are making them better somehow 
 I have lived in and travelled to Cuba several times over the past 45 years.  The author presents descriptions of Cuba: collapsing buildings, cockroaches, hunger, the young wishing to flee, her lover's father imprisioned and yet, never once does she ask or wonder why people are so poor and desperate.  How the author can be so oblivious to the suffering all around her and its causes (lack of human rights, due process, freedom of the press, freedom to associate, freedom to think) is sad, even pathetic.  So you have to wonder how Alfredo, the author's boyfriend, could love her unless he is a necrophiliac.  She must be dead from the neck up.   In the book, she menations an American who is looking for weed.  The American tells her that she acts normally how he acts when he is stoned.  How fitting.  I couldn't bear reading past the first 100 pages.  The crime is that trees were cut down to print this drivel.   
 This got to be the most egotistical and arrogant book ever writted. The author in about every paragraph, uses words like "I", "me" and when refering to another person and himself, he always puts his name first. Bhagwati loves to name drop, he lists people he has met as if its a popularity contest. Bhagwati's writting will confuse you and annoy you. Throught out the book he loves to advertise the papers and studies he has written, they have no relavence to the topic at hand except maybe to help him sell more books 
 I was extremely disappointed with this book. The author seems more interested in self promotion and only scrathes the surface of the subject matter. In my opinion not worth the money. 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 This movie felt long.  The special effects and filmwork were pretty bad.  The acting was even worse.  The voice-over actors were bad and the subtitles were generally too fast to read those and watch in Japanese.  I'm a fan of this genre of movie usually and I thought this would be a good one - but this is one to pass on, especially considering how much it costs 
 I don't own this clock, but I do own one of it's sister clocks, the Tambour Style Mantel Clock, and it did not change for DST now that the date has changed.  Even though I've owned my clock for all of a month and a half, River City Cuckoo Clocks does not consider this fact to be a defect.  Since I would assume that all their radio controlled clocks have the same electronics, I would be very wary about buying this clock 
 I like to read (or listen to) non-fiction- but not tedious, weighed down non-fiction.  I have recommended (and at times purchased) this book to numerous friends.  The book is enlightening, engaging and exceptional. A book to be relished (pun intended).  Regretably, I cannot say this for the author's next effort. I think Cod is one of the most fascinating, enjoyable books I have encountered.  One great book 
 Seems like it. A collection of random and often pointless thoughts loosely glued together by the authors disjointed text 
 I hardly know how to begin. First, I guess, the history: the Franklin Expedition provided one of the most enduring mysteries of arctic exploration. The fate of the crew was finally determined when some of their well preserved bodies were found on the ice and autopsies done. Bad bear meat seemed the main culprit -- in short food poisoning. This is not to discount the suffering that must have been their lot when their ship was trapped in the ice.  But this book! It's probably 600 pages too long, and yes, I did wade through it, but I found myself constantly wondering why I was bothering. The plot thread into the "thing" on the ice and Francis Crozier's  mental ruminations became, for me, tedious in the extreme. The constant descriptions of the suffering of the men, the slide into the depravity of cannibalism, the whole "what's out there?" just became burdensome. And the mysterious Eskimo girl with no tongue? Please! I suppose that when someone devotes enough time to a book to write over 700 pages, you almost owe them a read. I kept thinking "it'll improve," right up until the end... when it didn't.  Reviews say Simmons is an eloquent and beautiful writer. Maybe so. But not here. Not for me in this book. The size and heft of the novel make it great for a door stop or to press flowers in. It's not one that you'd want to re-read 
 These are not the greatest.  Thought they would be great to have on hand when guest come.  Not so.  They were not what I had expected 
 The person who wrote this cookbook obviously likes everything fatty and unsweetened. I found this cookbook useful only if I changed just about all the recipes by reducing the fat content by half, and doubling the amount of sugar.  My daughter didn't know this and baked some cookies using the original recipe in the book. They were disgusting! They weren't at all sweet and extremely fatty. Yuck!  I use the corn bread recipe all the time, it's excellent if you know what needs to be changed. Do not add any butter at all (the recipe tells you to add 2 tablespoons), and add 3/4 cup of sugar (the recipe tells you to use only 1 tablespoon). 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 More and more, all the industry wants to do is tell you what it is you are supposed to like, and ridicule anything we might consider to be a guilty pleasure, and if you indulge in such a thing, you are 'shallow'.   Music has evolved past this attitude, and no one believes in this naked emperor anymore. And oh yeah, their politics is so mixed up, they don't even know what they believe anymore. I was a subscriber for eleven years, my renewal notice came, and I couldn't come up with one good reason to send it in 
 What a terrible DVD. I'm no pessimist, this was recorded horribly. Either Shannon Hoon's voice is awful or the recording was. I suspect it was the latter. I will admit, I'm not a hardcore Blind Melon fan, but I'd downloaded some of their songs like mouth full of cavities et al..and was very impressed. I read the previous reviews and took the gamble of buying the DVD. What a mistake. I also bought Alice in Chains Unplugged which is excellent. If you want to see a grown man wearing makeup and flaling his hands like an octopus while shreeking to the crowd buy this. Otherwise save your money. 
 Whether you agree or not with Revel's views, and in large part I think I could be persuaded (by a more reasoned argument), his presentation carries the whiff of desperation that accompanies all ideologues and partisan hacks.  This book is no doubt very popular with people who already share its worldview. I came across it looking for a reasoned and reasonable presentation of viewpoints not necessarily my own. What I found instead was a book full of logical fallacies, ad hominem attacks, straw men, and the worst of the rhetorical games that can be played.  If you want a cheerleader to get you pumping your fist in the air a la Rush Limbaugh or Al Franken or Michael Moore or Bill O'Reilly, then this book will be great for your enthusiasm, if not necessarily for your intellect.  If you're looking for a thoughtful exploration of the nature of America, her standing in the world, and the reflexivity of that relationship, look elsewhere. If you find it, please let me know, I'm still looking 
 I was looking for a real thriller, and thought I would try one by David Baldacci. I had read a very favourable review a while back, and I have also seen and enjoyed the movie version of Absolute Power.  After reading reviews at Amazon, I picked Last Man Standing. However, I was really disappointed. For me it wasn't thrilling at all. Several times I had to force myself to pick it up again to continue reading. For me, a good thriller is a book you can't stop reading, even if it's getting late and you really, really should try to get some sleep instead of continue reading.  Examples of great thrillers I have read are: The Firm by John Grisham, The Day After Tomorrow by Allan Folsom (nothing to do with the weather-related movie of the same name) and Angels and Demons by Dan Brown.  But Last Man Standing was quite the opposite. Sure it had its moments where it got exciting for a while (the final shoot-out for example), but those times were quite rare.  I've been trying to figure out why I didn't like it, but I can't say I know why. I do think that a lot of what happens in the book is quite far-fetched (especially the reason the hero Web London froze during the ambush) and that the characters are pretty one-dimensional, but that's not enough of a reason. Both The Day After Tomorrow and Angels and Demons have plenty of far-fetch twists and one-dimensional characters, but they were still exciting reads. I can't come up with a definite answer as to why I didn't like Last Man Standing - I simply just didn't care for it.  Writing a negative review like this will probably earn me a few unhelpful votes, but I think it is important to also review books you didn't like. Otherwise you risk getting an unbalanced view. However, I do admit that it is much more fun to review books you really liked.  But to finish, if you are looking for a good thriller, skip this one and try one of the other three I mentioned above. 
 With due respect for anybody who has the fortitude to actually write a book, and even more so an active police officer, this is the biggest load I have read in a long, long time.  The author, figuring if a little gore is good, a lot of gore is better, and a boatload of gore has got to be great. All the timne trying to convince us that by dropping a few real names and a lot of local L.A. folklore, that this book is somehow steeped in reality.  In a 20 page span, we have poor souls killed by shoulder mounted rockets, pit bulls, snapping turtles, a jaguar, a sword cane, and of course the usual assortment of mac-11's, nine milimeters, colt pythons, shotguns, and assorted automatic weapons.   This story goes from the implausable, to the impossible, to the ridiculous faster that a Code 3 Crown Vic.  That being said, I hope the author makes a boatload of bucks, his book gets made into a movie, and he lives the Hollywood dream, because when all is said and done, I like it when a non-pro hits one out of the park 
 To learn what Cramer knows about recent swindles (now, after the fact) or what financial products Cramer "sells", read this book. Cramer does a great job of beating you down, then offering to be your personal savior. _____________________________________________________________ So this is what I had to say about Cramer a year ago, and now I'm a total Cramer junkie.  His radio show (...) is the best source of timely, unbiased, practical information I have found in 20 years of investment AND IT'S FREE.  Jim is right most of the time, but he also is the first to admit when he has made a mistake.    Thank you, Jim, for giving me the courage to fire my broker, improve my investment performance, and save $25,000/year in fees 
 Waller is usually awesome...but I think he missed it on Puerto Vallarta Squeeze.  Not that I wasn't entertained, because I was...in a mindless sort of way.  The book is a made-for-tv script just waiting to happen! But mediocre Waller is better than most at their best....so buy this book....used if possible 
 I'm not sure who's at the helm of this operation but I'd be willing to bet they don't get Outside too often. Not to be too cynical about it, but I just don't find this mag to be as USEFUL as it was before. If you like LOTS of articles on who the coolest extreme sports stars are, how they got their abs, and what gear they're wearing, subscribe NOW. The magazine looks amazing, the photography is top notch and they still manage to come up with a thorny article on the environment periodically. But for my money, it just feels like the editorial staff has been plucked from New York image mags that do one thing really well - SELL. I read National Geographic Adventure, and unlike Outside, I USE IT for information because it has CONTENT 
 The book provides believable and sometimes fascinating information, and the author is to be commended for getting this hard-sell published. But the writing is stilted and surprisingly flat considering the writer is a professional music journalist with a growing list of book credits.   If the reader is looking for evangelical fervor - and a writing style that can inspire - they will not find it here.   As is always advisable to those who do seek to turn someone on to music - give that person the music of Big Star. Don't give them this book. 
 After the brutal, elemental Plastic Ono Band and the sublime Beatle-worthy Imagine, Lennon & co. crashed into every who's who list of 70s leftist politics and culture with their own brand of obnoxious utopian idealism. The result was this album, a sprawling political polemic thats as tedious to listen to as it is depressing. 1972 would spell the end of what was a very promising solo career -- in a sea of drug abuse, paranoia (some apparently justified, Nixon WAS after him), and marital bickering, Lennon's confidence would be worn out. He would grow cynical, disillusioned, and tired, and the effects can be heard clearly on his next record, the well-written but confidence-shattered Mind Games.  The first half, a studio effort containing some impressive names (Clapton, Hopkins, Keltner and Preston to name a few) is split between John and Yoko tracks. The promising opener, the ruthlessly extreme "Woman is the N----- of the World," is probably the only essential track on the album. Other notable tracks are "Attica State," a disturbingly naive hard-rock response to the Attica prison riots (Free the prisoners / Jail the judges / Free all prisoners everywhere/ All they want is truth and justice / All they need is love and care). It still maintains a bit of shock value. Another is "John Sinclair," a semi-perfunctory folk protest song with a effective repetitive hook. The clumsy throwback rocker, "New York City," is harmless and fun.  Most of the other material is comprised of horribly didactic diatribes on whatever was itching John and Yoko (in the latter's defense, "Born in a Prison" and "Sisters, O Sisters," may be two of the most listenable songs in her career). "Sunday Bloody Sunday" tackles the Irish troubles in what is a remarkably poor effort at a street-wise anthem. "The Luck of the Irish" is even worse - a wretchedly plain duet with John and Yoko, the former playing school teacher, and the latter rambling on about leprechauns, Irish spings, clovers, Blarney stones, and just about every other cliché imaginable. Another duet, "Angela" is passable material.  That's the album. On its release in 1972, Lennon added the live half as a free supplement. However, on CD issue, the album is billed and priced like any double album.  But even the seemingly harmless live half manages to put a stain on Lennon's legend. The story is that Lennon showed up at Zappa's door one morning, introduced himself, and proposed a stage appearance at the Fillmore (where FZ was recording his Fillmore album). The material would be available to both on future agreement. So Lennon and the Mothers appeared on stage together, and with Zappa's recording equipment and musicians, recorded a show at the nigh-penniless Zappa's expense.  Lennon and Spector took the tapes, edited out the Mothers (who, at one point, joined in chanting "We're going to put Yoko in the scumbag,"). John and Yoko claimed writing credits for all of the Mother's jams, including "Scumbag" (actually Zappa's sophisticated epic "King Kong"). Zappa tried to contact John and Yoko, but the two wouldn't return his calls, and even refused to give him any royalties. He never forgave them, and shortly before his death, released the tapes unedited on the Playground Psychotics album.   So, there you have it. An unfortunate period in Lennon's career. Not worth the price of admission, and strictly for completionists only 
 Knowing that Karen Armstrong has written books on every world religion, I wonder if she is the author of perhaps too many topics.   In her introduction she compares Muhammad to Gandhi without offering an explanation... Let's at least start with the basics. Gandhi?  Ghandhi was in a political disadvantage and used non-violence to bring about a radical change. Later in Armstrong's book she states,"No radical social and political change has ever been achieved without bloodshed, and, because Muhammad was living in a period of confusion and disintegration, peace could be achieved only by the sword." This is one example of her many contradictions.    How was the meat of the book? I would have preferred more source quotes, more historical moments- less interjecting of personal ideologies. She often made statements that assumed her readers were brought up as Christians, and seemed to side with God in her claim that the enemies of Muhammad had perverted the true order. She also made mistakes that led me to question her reliability as a historian. For example, she inferred that the Qu'ran is written in chronological order! (The Qu'ran is ordered from longest to shortest chapters).     Her book does not strike me as being historically accurate, but is an attempt to show Muhammad in a positive light- every attack Muhammad made on the Quraysh, Jews, and non-believers was pro-active defensive measures... reminiscent of George Bush's "pre-emptive strikes".   I enjoyed a few passages when Armstrong's personal interludes were kept down to a minimum and the history of a fascinating man and time and place unfolded. It's quite an accomplishment for someone to carve a nation from warring tribes in a harsh and unyielding environment. But for the most part I felt like I had to read between the lines. Definitely not a historical book.  Falls into the category of polemics.   
 there are two tunes you can dance and they sound familiar. "FAME" by Irene Cara, 'DISCO INFERNO" by tramps "WHAT A FEELING" by Irene Cara from the movie "FLASHDANCE" its a dance  where your body spins around the floor with your back like a toy called: TOP or a YOYO. There are 2 songs you may dance to enjoy I mentioned above 
  	The book Hubbert's Peak: The Impending World Oil Shortage is about the economy and the impact one scientist had on the world with his predictions.  Hubbert's theory stated that in the early 1970's oil production would reach its highest level. He was doubted my many scientists, but when it came true scientists used it to look at what the future holds for oil production. It is expected to hit this decade at some point. This book describes the origin of oil and development over the many years. It also describes several different oil fields and the prosperity of them, and the different types of techniques and bits used to find oils by scientists. Each scientist has different methods of finding the oil fields, and they use data sets to record the sites and sizes of them. It provides an overview of what the future holds for oil production, and what different kinds of energy we can resort too if needed to avoid the economic troubles lying ahead. 	I thought this book was overall pretty boring. I wasn't  entertained or hooked on it, and it didn't make me want to keep reading in the end. I found it very confusing most of the time, and it had a lot of information to try to digest all at once, such as numbers and equations. It wasn't the kind of book I really get indulged in, and want to read more of, or cant put down.  	I would recommend this book to those who like to read books about our economy and what's going on in different industries. This book is easier to read for adults, as it contains advanced material that could confuse younger children. For those who enjoy reading advanced books about our economy or oil, this is an excellent book. 
 As an insider for one of the firms highlighted in the book, I can say, without fear of contradiction, that the authors spin their stories to  provide the highest possible shock value.  Of course selling more books is  their goal.  Unfortunately, presenting a fair and balanced report often  falls short of that goal...so just leave out the contradictory evidence and  go to press.  In all my years in the industry, I have never seen  consultants independently "destroy" a company.  However, I have  seen many, many poor business decisions that were made by corporate  management and blamed on others 
 I CAN ONLY SAY, HOW DID SHE GET ON THIS ALBUM??? THE PRETENDERS VERSION OF THIS SONG IS HORRIBLE!! SHE IS SO OFF KEY. IT RUINS THE ALBUM!!!! OH ITS HORRIBLE 
 Shortly, i had no negative feelings about the work of this humidifier. The only problem was  that while it was really quiet most of the time at certain periods it started to roar - pretty noisy. it woke me up one night. but it didn't happen often.  Then, after 2 weeks, it stopped working. Probably that roaring was the sign of some existing deffect. I sent it back to amazon and ordered a new one, not Honeywell this time. 
 Hole in pocket, not completly sewn. Charcol heather shrank 2 sizes. Blue shirt pocket was placed almost under the sleeve 
 My 3 1/2 year old son enjoys this book, and I'll admit that the illustrations are great, but I find the text of this book lacking.  For example on page 40, the text reads: "I'm supposed to be played with," he decided"--is this even correct grammar?  The choppiness of the text, lack of flow, and overuse of exclamation points makes the story a disappointment to read 
 I am a professional pastry chef and I found that most of Mr. Malgeri's recipes are avaiable in many other books ...in other words they are neither unique or unusual ...and many of the recipes are just not very good representatives of their "TYPE"...I would not recommend this book.  I would recommend "The Good Cookie" by Tish Boyle...better  recipes and better writing 
 It's impossible to review or rate this book as it's not available.  Many of my devotional readings reference this book...but sadly I've not read it due to unavailibility.  What can I do to help get this back in print 
 I'm very disappointed at the amount content in this Book.  Sun posted a Java style guide that was essentially the equivalent, but free.  Equivalent in terms of topics covered while there were some noticable difference such as variable naming.   One of the redeming qualities of the book though is that it can serve as a coding standard thus saving one from tidious chore of deciding on your own standards.  In the end does it really make that much of a difference as long as everyone on your team is following the same standard?  Best part of the book is the title.  
 What kind of an experiment was this cable watching thing supposed to be? The guy goes on a hike and imagines he comes back full of some eternal "wisdom" and then sits down and watches TV for 1700 hours straight, and comes to the conclusion that the 1700 hours of TV watching were not particularly rewarding...! give me a break! well duh-of course watching tv for a month straight isnt rewarding! Its amazing that people sit down and write big books making these sorts of obvious points. In the end mcKibben succeeds in shining a damning light on our culture - not through his "experiment" but by publishing the book. A culture, where people can pretend to be clever intellectuals by making the kind of social experiments and delvering the kind of half baked "insights" as McKibben does, is in serious, serious trouble 
 Who would Jesus bomb?  Who shall we bomb next in the name of Jesus 
 I ordered this item on August 26th and it is now September 24th.  Where is the CD??????!!!! 
      Although I agree with several of Mr. Stamper's recommendations (legalizing prostitution, decriminalizing drugs), many of his assertions are straight out of the "I-Hate-America" handbook.  All white, male cops -and even many black ones - are racsist, homophobic, women-hating thugs.  What we need is a kinder, gentler way of policing.        Mr. Stamper had a brief career as a police officer before his real career of supervisory bureacrat began.  He "confesses" that in his rookie year he was on his way to becoming one of the bad cops before he was set right by a straight-shootin' DA.  It was apparently then that his liberal sensitivities kicked in, and soon he was a supervisor (all the better to control the average Joe).        The unfortunate thing about this book isn't the stories he relates, or even his recommendations (some good, some not so good), but the haughty way in which he relates it.  Conservatives, Republicans - BAD! Liberals, Democrats - GOOD! (except for unions - bad!)  If this book were written with respect not only for the majority of rank and file cops, but for the other half of Americans that Mr. Stamper obviously disdains, it may have been worth the money.  As it is, if you are to the right of Hillary, take a pass on this one 
 Probably not a good book for anyone interested in greenhouse gardening in the Northern US or Canada. The book dwells mainly on the use of unheated greenhouses during the season when northern gardeners would have their plants outside. Nothing about over winter greenhouse use (snow, subzero temps).  However, if you are interested in how someone in the UK utilizes their greenhouse, then this is the book for you.  
 There ARE some good ideas in here. Unfortunately I just couldn't get past the fact that it is such a thin book with a lot of rehashed stuff. 14.95 is a lot to pay for a magazine, even if some of the ideas are OK. Also, Ms. Stewart doesn't seem to feel the need to test her recipes out first. When following ANY of her recipes, allow a little extra time for recipe adjustment. 
 If you want to read about scientific facts this is not the book for you.  The scientific underpinnings of this speculative book are briefly mentioned and not elaborated upon in much detail.  It's better to just read his paper on the somatic marker hypothesis (which is disputed by the way).  Without a background in neuroscience it is difficult to evaluate his ideas in a serious way, and anyway he asks for introspection (a la William James) from the reader more than anything else 
 First, this looks to be an excellent book -- if -- you eat eggs and dairy.  If you follow a plant based diet, this is not the book for you.  There are handful - count maybe 5 - recipes that don't have eggs and dairy.  It is possible to substitute Earth Balance for butter and tinker with egg replacers for the eggs, if you want to bother.  For some reason I thought that because it has Buddhist roots it would lean more heavily on plant-based baking.  
 I watched this despite bad reviews because I really wanted to see Baryshnikov in a feature film like this.  And he does a great job.  I'm wondering why Hollywood never offered him more roles like this over the years, since he's really quite good at it.   Despite the chemistry of the actors, the movie is just very hokey and pointless.  They try to make the story interesting by alluding to the extent of corruption within the U.S. government, but I think that's all common knowledge these days and not really that shocking anymore.  I was amused throughout the movie that the CIA and Russia were upset about losing 2 million dollars, because I kept thinking of scenes in Austin Powers when everyone is laughing at Dr. Evil for thinking 1 million dollars was a lot of money...    In short, this movie was just kind of juvenile and nothing extraordinary.  Baryshnikov fans should be pleased though 
 I wish Mr. Sparks would find the voice he wrote with in his earlier novels. That flow and voice I understood so well. At First Sight felt like I was reading a deadline novel. Just words, no insight, didn't make this reader think at all. Sorry, just the way I read it. 
 I bought this dvd for my grandson because he loves airplanes and trains.  Too much commentary and very little action shots of trains and airplanes.  It did not keep his interest, a total waste of money 
 I don't want to say that this is a boring Mafia book. But if you are looking for the action and drama in the "Godfather," then go read the "Godfather" or rent the movies. However, Gay Talese's reporting skills has never ceased to amaze me. "Honor Thy Father" is just another proof 
 As a university professor of human resource development and an Anglican brother, The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent is pure drivel and has no redeeming value whatsoever. If you enjoy new-age fantasy, get a copy from your local library otherwise do not waste your money. If you are serious about spiritual growth you might read works such as The Rule of Benedict: Insights for the Ages, or the best selling book on spiritual development of all time.. it's called the Bible 
 Collectors interested in hearing the authors read their own stories might enjoy this production; but if you want to appreciate the stories for their own sake, steer clear of the audio version.  The decision to use some of these authors as narrators was a huge mistake.  Jill McCorkle's dreary monotone could sedate a grizzly (don't listen to "Theft" while you're driving). James Alan McPherson is essentially unintelligible.  He does a poor impersonation of Demosthenes having a bad pebble day.  If you really want to hear these stories read by someone, give yourself a break: buy the book, and read it aloud.  You'll do a far better job than this crew 
 This book is well-planned and discusses drugging your child for various reasons, including the gamut from sluggishness to hyperactivity.  I was convinced that the author actually intended to present a multi-modal plan for dealing with "the symptoms that are often known as ADD."  That is, until I read that his idea of exercise is a little wrestling with Dad (no kidding) and that he is aware of no evidence that diet affects brain chemistry.  Most of the symptoms of ADD read identically to those listed for hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar.  Low blood sugar involves some lethargy, but is also characterized by angst, irritability as well as hyperactivity.  Hypoglycemia is also a condition that is , ahem, not known to exist, but every physician knows how to administer the wrong test for it.  Athletes call the exercise-induced hypoglycemic period "recovery."  Alcoholics pour a drink.  Smokers light up.   Others just crash or drink coffee.  Wow.  And to think that Speed (oh, Ritalin) can help with that.  Homework burden cutting into your videogame time? Can't sit in your chair during school?   Talk back to your parents?  Rough play with your pre-school friends?   Zone out and play with a toy too long ?   Stick out from the herd ?    After all of the well-written prose, this book is just an attempt to legitimize the increased prevalence of Ritalin.  Modern psychiatry is about writing life-long prescriptions, and now they have a way to start as early as age five.   Now, if only there were prescription for those pre-school years ...  
 Teri Hatcher is one of my favorite actresses. I think she is honest, and charming. But this book reveals too much about her insecurities and inadequacies at age 40. It has funny life stories mixed in, but the rest is just an account of how inadqeuate she feels and has always felt. Its sad. I think those thoughts would be better shared with a therapist. 
 This book is not very well suited to those who want an introduction to health policy and services.  If you have some background in the field, it will probably be too basic to help you very much.  I had no such background when I began using this book in a graduate course in health policy, and while most of the text is understandable, it is generally not very interesting and/or helpful.  I suppose it's a good thing that the book and chapters are brief, however it leaves out a lot of details that I felt would be beneficial towards understanding a very complex system.  When statistics are used to exemplify a point, they are generally pretty dated.  Even if a new edition were available though, I'd read through a chapter or two in the library before investing in this book 
 Very average book!  Frei doesn't go down as one of my favorite sports writers. Loves to sensationlize rather then just tell a great story 
 The only good thing about this book is the seaside atmosphere. The seaside restaurants were enjoyable. The storyline was acceptable but not my favorite 
 This book describes a world that most business people do not inhabit.  It is stuffy and irrelevant.  Business etiquette is based on business situations that constantly evolve.  There is no evidence here that the authors have any idea about the reality of the work environment.  Business etiquette is not about place settings at the White House or how to address diplomats when you have them over for dinner.  It about putting one's associates and guests at ease when the atmosphere is social but the agenda is business.  A much better book is The Etiquette Advantage by Post 
 This book is a real letdown.  As other reviewers noted, he wasn't running a typical hedge fund strategy.  He just bought and held tech companies, either public or private.  And he did this during the .com boom. He had the sense to wind down the fund before the crash. Gosh, he made a lot of money. As I think he himself says, never mistake talent for a Bull market.  You don't find out much of anything about his approach, because I don't think there was much too it.    The chapters jump around without much coherence. He seems to be building up to a point, leading to a big 11 page section that entirely in italics, in case you were going to miss it.  We have higher margins than the developing world, so the trade deficit doesn't matter.  That's it.  One of the least interesting books I've read this year 
 Rob Lowe is mildly okay as Ben Mears, but his performance goes nowhere near David Soul's angst ridden, really convincing portrayal from the 1979 original. Donald Suterland is disappointing, and I don't think it needs to be said that his performance is less than spectacular, even absurd. He's no James Mason.   Rutger Hauer gives a better performance than this series deserved. His portrayal of King's Barlow is more accurate than the Nosferatuesque Reggie Nalder, but somehow this seems to work to the film's detriment rather than benefit. Rent the original film, or miniseries. I had high expectations, maybe that they'd build on the original a little, but it's just rushed, badly acted, trying too hard to be modern, and in general, a waste of time 
 There's no one complete song on this album. I was fooled and hope my advise may prevent others from falling in this trap. I love Pink Floyd and hoped to listen and see they perform but nothing like that happens in this DVD 
 This is maybe a 4 Star book - IF, and ONLY if, this is the first book on Jack Welch and GE you have picked up.  If you have already read "Jack" skip it.  There is nothing here that hasn't already been said elsewhere. I was disappointed how little "new" information was presented in this book.  If you are looking for something on the topic of controlling your own destiny this title is somewhat misleading.     
 I purchased this book hoping that it would clear up my confusion about LOST - but quite the opposite. This book is so poorly organized, I may as well be using it as a driving map for Italy. Purchase the other Ultimate Unofficial Guide to LOST, this one sucks 
 ok, to everyone who gave this 4 or 5 stars, GET REAL!  at most this is 3 stars, but only because of the funny samples, which really dont count as songs. there ARE a couple of good songs and a couple good "half-songs". dont get me wrong, im a HUGE sublime fan.  if you really love sublime like I do, buy this, but dont make it a top priority, maybe buy it used or something.  like the others say, sound quality sux, production sux.  this is really like a novelty cd, not a real album.  trust me, no matter what the other guys say, NO-ONE listens to this cd regularl 
 George Soros is something of a house-hold name, not in every home across America like Martha Stewart of course(post-ImClone), but especially in those of the Upper West Side of Manhatten or Park Lane in London or indeed to anyone who has Bloomberg.    Soros' Quantum fund and the rebranded Soros Fund Management LLC are currency speculators and have made billions on currency speculation burning the currencies of developing nations such as Thailand and Malaysia in South East Asia in 1997, and indeed pocketing $2 bn on the devaluation of the british pound on black wednesday 1992 when the UK exited the ERM.    However, the 1990s wasn't all about making money, it was about losing some too. In fact, over $1.4 bn was lost in Russia after the August 1998 financial crisis.    It seemed that the Russians didn't like Soros very much so last winter they surrounded his Open Society Building in Moscow before sending in private security firms to ransack its offices.  Since then, Soros has sinced announced the Society will become 'autonomous'  So what was Soros to do after all of this excitement. Well, at the same time as funding opposition parties to George W. Bush before the 2000 election, and funding charitable/philanthropic projects (you gotta love those tax breaks), he thought he would write a book proclaiming impending global economic meltdown.  However, it seems that Soros is not as good at writing books as destroying the economies of developing nations.  In fact, his book is the biggest load of old bollocks I have ever read in my entire life, and I read Harry Potter & The Philospher's Stone.  After struggling to contain my boredom at the opening....questioing whether this guy was for real, I totally gave up when Soros introduced 'his theory' of reflexivity in the capital markets....re-flex what?

 Lynda C. Welch states the introduction that the purpose of this book is to present factual, intuitive, and spiritual evidence for the existence of a primordial Norse goddess."     And indeed, Ms. Welch does make references to what would be considered respectable sources of information, including Jakob Grimm's Teutonic Mythology, Snorri Sturlusson's Prose Edda, and Hilda Ellis-Davidson's Northern Goddess, to support her ridiculous conclusion that all of the Norse goddesses can be lumped into the Maiden, Mother, Crone mold of the Wiccan Goddess.  Of course she calls it the "primordial Norse goddess" and that these aspects are "Grandmother, Mother, Daughter", Fjorgyn, Frigg, and Freya respectively.  This work is particularly contrary to the work that many of us who follow the Norse pantheon have been doing in trying to sieve out the functions and lore of the individual goddesses of the Norse pantheon from what little literary evidence has survived from the pre-Christian period in Northen Europe.  Her opinion of monotheistic religions from the very start is hostile, and she perpetuates the claim that Asatru is a racist religion.  The bibliography is definitely the highlight of this book - it lists some very good primary and secondary sources for the study of Norse mythology (avoid the Llwellyn titles, of course).  But overall, this book is not worth the paper it's printed on 
 As a person who loves the dating/relationship genre, let me assure you that there are MUCH better books out there.  This book repackages the techniques usually recommended to salesmen--mirroring the other person in order to build rapport, and "speaking in their language."  And that's exactly what you'll be doing--selling a falsified version of yourself in a marginally effective and pretty awkward way.  (In spite of her exuberantly triumphant intro, Tracy Cabot is now divorced.  I imagine it was hard to sustain this manufactured "bond" for very long.)    If you really want to learn about love languages, "The Five Love Languages" by Gary Chapman is much better.  It will teach you how to truly interpret and sincerely relate to expressions of love between you and your boyfriend/girlfriend/partner.  And if you want to make a man fall in love with you, "Why Men Love Bitches" by Sherry Argov is hands-down the best.  It takes the also-fabulous prinicples behind "The Rules" (which have worked for me beautifully) and makes them practicable for the modern and/or professional woman.  (I highly recommend The Rules--loosely interpreted--as well).  You can read any of these books in 2-3 hours.  I have read the latter two more times than I can count.  If after reading Why Men Love Bitches and The Rules, you haven't solved your dating problems, you probably need to read "He's Just Not That Into You"--which is not about dating as much as it is about recognizing the excuses women make for men when the truth isn't what we want.  (Gems include "No, he's not too busy to call you.  Calling you takes less time than going to the bathroom.  If he's into you, calling you is the bright moment in his otherwise busy day.")  This should definitely help build the correct mentality for expecting--and getting--both interest and great treatment from men.  And, finally, "What Southern Women Know About Flirting" has some tips and ideas that will help anyone, but particularly those inclined to play the "Damsel in Distress" card.  This one's just the icing on the cake 
 One minute training is being based on max heart rate, the next it's based on your lactate threshold.  There are just too many contradictions throughout the book 
 UGH! This book was awful - even for a summer beach read. I would not waste my time again on this book. Cute concept, cute characters, but zero plot. BORING! 
 This is definitely not a book for those who really wants to learn mass transfer and unit operations. The author only skims through the important concepts and the examples are either over simplified or irrelevant. The example questions are full of mistakes and the answers provided are wrong. For the studious chemical engineering student who is interested to understand the important concepts of mass transfer, stay away from this book. This book totally mess me up. Now I am using Transport Processes by Geankoplis, which is in my opinion, more direct and conventional, and easy to understand than Cussler, who writes the textbook like a story book!! The Mass Transfer section in the book Transport Phenomena  by Bird also do better justice to this subject even though it is more suited for graduate students. My advice: Don't use this book if you want to grasp unit operations well 
 This is a moderately well-spun book about the "No Spin Zone." Should be called the "Know Spin Zone" since really nothing in it is objective.  O'Reilly is a case-study in the typesubjective journalism that is prevalent in the media these days and the book shows this.  In other words it's a must read for everyone with the ability to see through it.  If you can't see through O'Reilly's bias then this book is poison 
 I would have given it one star but it deserves two for the last chapter which was quite good. Overall the book in my mind cannot even be compared to Notes From Underground which is a true existential work of art. My bias I believe comes from prefering an existential character to be more intelligent than the average person, not just simply more apathetic such as The Strangers main character. I found the book to be very boring. This is just my opinion, and many people find the book great and I have no quarrel with that 
 Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..?  And talking about the end...could it be more simple?   Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else 
         With all the fuss being made over - An Inconvenient Truth - the movie and book by Albert Gore Jr., it is appropriate to review his 1992 book: Earth in the Balance. This review will cover two key aspects of this book: his so-called couple between carbon dioxide and temperature; and his extremism. 	Gore discussed the carbon dioxide (CO2)  - temperature relationship on page 94. He showed a graph of temperature  and atmospheric CO2 concentration plotted versus time over a span of 160,000 years. With the exception of one point, his graph comes from chemical analysis of two mile deep ice core samples from Antarctica and Greenland, which is valid and exciting scientific data. Gore has called the data behind this chart as the most compelling evidence of a correlation between CO2 and temperature change. 	Both variables exhibit a saw-tooth profile. The graph for each variable is of a similar shape, and appear to move somewhat in parallel. Based on such a chart Gore  made the claim that CO2 concentration and temperature have moved in lockstep over this period. The word lockstep is far too strong for a simple visual correlation. The implication is also made that the change in CO2 concentration precedes the change in temperature, and hence is the cause for the change in temperature. However, it is impossible to tell this from such a graph. Indeed one could just as easily claim the reverse.  	The behavior of these two variables represent the change in each variable due to the changes in other major variables, particularly the orbital parameters of planet Earth as it travels around the sun. Yet Gore is basing all of his conclusions on his eye-balled correlation. 	Further, this data is highly compressed and displayed over a space little more than two inches in width in his book. The basic time unit is estimated at 2,500 years per point. A single tic on this graph--say 1/32nd of an inch in width--would represent 2,500 years of history. Thus a mere 1/32nd of an inch would represent the huge number of weather events over 2,500 years, averaged to a single point. 	The second problem with this graph is the last point shown. This is not part of the scientific record. Rather it is one scenario projection, out of dozens of scenarios, of the future CO2 level. This step is particularly egregious as this point brings the graph height to seven inches, on a graph that would only be two inches tall otherwise. This is pure distortion and misrepresentation. 	This critique is a perfect example of Gore gaining some validity by "cherry picking" valid scientific data, but simplifying it, extrapolating it and misrepresenting the situation until it literally has no meaning. 	On a second subject, some of the writings by Gore are quite disturbing. Several quotes are examined. * In the first quote he equates the dangers to the environment to the dangers of nuclear war. "Nuclear war is an apocalyptic subject, and so is global environmental destruction." 	Can this be a truly sound judgement of the state of the environment after years of the EPA, after years of automobile fuel and exhaust improvements and after billions of dollars of environmental control investments in all our utility and manufacturing industries? * The next quote broadens the doomsday view to the ecology. "Today the evidence of an ecological Kristallnacht is as clear as the sound of glass shattering in Berlin." 	Again can this be viewed as a precise, sound and fair diagnosis of the ecological situation? In this quote he equates Americans' use of natural resources with Nazism. He goes on "...the environmental crisis is so serious that I believe our civilization must be considered in some basic way dysfunctional. "... In this terrible century... we have witnessed some especially malignant examples of dysfunctional civilization: the totalitarian societies of Nazi Germany under Hitler, fascist Italy under Mussolini ... in psychological terms, our rapid and aggressive expansion into what remains of the wildness of the earth represents an effort to plunder from outside civilization what we cannot find inside."  	Yes, in Gore's mind, our society's embrace of what he calls consumptionism, resembles Nazi Germany society's embrace of totalitarianism. * Next he contrasts the richness of nature to the emptiness of industrial civilization. According to Gore we live in an "inauthentic world of our own making. "Life can be easy, we assure ourselves. "We need not suffer the heat or the cold; we need not sow or reap or hunt and gather. "We can heal the sick, fly through the air, light up the darkness, and be entertained in our living room by orchestras and clowns whenever we like." Further into this quote he observes this false world was created by people to distract people from their psychic pain. He asserts that the world of leisure, air conditioning, industrial agriculture, modern medicine, and home entertainment is not good in itself. "It is but a fleeting sideshow." Finally he claims that only by somehow awakening from such in-authenticity will the cycle of psychic pain and environmental plunder be broken. It is not quite clear how Gore, who grew upo in a hotel, earned credentials to decide what is authentic in life and what is not. 	Gore seems to have come up with the following modus operandi. First he will proclaim an unprecedented environmental catastrophe is at hand. Next he will indicate only a handful of ignorant and unqualified dissenters oppose this assessment. Finally he would indicate that such dissenters are preventing him from moving ahead to solve this problem. 	As noted above Gore has a strange streak of extremism in his makeup. He clearly is not happy with our society. He equates environmental activists to resistance fighters. But does not this group of  activists include eco-saboteurs? Clearly Gore does not limit his concern to just the environment, but declares that we are in a midst of political, informational, inner-spiritual and deep philosophical crisis. He, I believe,claims to be the sole author of his book and to have put his heart and soul into it. He seems to believe in his book and all its comparisons of our society with Nazi Germany's or to the former USSR's. All of the above quotes and comments have earned him the extremist tag. 	No where has this been better exposed than in a 1995 column by Tony Snow. In this essay Snow contrasts statements by Gore  to those of the Unabomber. Snow noted that the vision advocated by the Unabomber sounds much like that stated in Gore's 1992 manifesto. The difference between the Unabomber and Gore is that Gore wants to achieve this via massive government bureaucracies, while the Unabomber would achieve this through mail bombs.	 	Al Gore's penchant for alarmism, inappropriate interpretation and outright misrepresentation in 1992, is surely food for thought as one reads his latest book or sees his movie 
 First, despite what the socialist apologists tell you, Walter Rodney almost certainly was killed by a bomb he was holding in his lap while plotting to bust some co-conspirators out of prison.  Only afterwards did his fellow socialist party members concoct a story about exploding walkie-talkies.  Come on.  It exploded in his lap for goodness sake.  Mark Hoffman tried that defense and it didn't get him anywhere either.  Second, championing the cause of the poor, which Rodney admittedly did, is not the same as actually helping them, or even more important for HEUA, being a perceptive scholar.  Rodney's book is riddled with distortions, fallacies and unsubstantiated premises.  One glaring example.  Rodney pays practically zero attention to Mediterranean Africa.  For him, only sub-Saharan Africa is the "real" Africa.  Why?  Because his natural ethnic affinity for the area.  Nothing wrong with that, but then again, you shouldn't title your book "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa" but rather "How Europe Underdeveloped Sub-Saharan Africa." Rodney has engaged in thinly veiled racial rage and socialist dogma to rail against a bogeyman, a straw man, or almost anything other than the truth: Africa's problems arise from its residents, not from outside forces.  And spouting Marxist dogma isn't going to change that fact.  It was known 25 years ago; it's known a fortiori now 
 This CD has one objective - push a leftist agenda. It's themes are awash in "class struggles" and pushes everything from the perspective of the persecuted poor. It even has a short piece on considering the food's point of view when eating meat. This is the worst sort of leftist propaganda trash, and we do our children no favors by bashing everything and everyone that might not be one of the downtrodden.. 
 Lots of errors; little real insight; repetitive; written like a college paper. Too bad, because the idea for the book has great possibilities. But what's presented here is often pedantic and sometimes sophomoric. (Dainty June and her on-stage cow have lesbian overtones? C'mon! 
 I borrowed this book from the library thinking that it was worth reading.  Boy, was I wrong!  The grammar and run-on sentences drove me nuts.  I put it down after I read about 5 pages and returned it to the library the next day.  How does crap like this get published?  What the hell was her editor thinking letting all those headache-inducing run-on sentences end up in print?  What does Terry McMillan have against punctuation?  I would not recommend this book.  In fact, if it was possible to give less than one star, I'd give this book half a star at most 
 I was unable to play in my car CD player, so only choice I got is to listen at home using my home DVD player. 
 I've never understood why this is mandatory reading in british literature classes. First of all, it's not written about Britts, it wasn't written in English, tho some argue it's a "really old form" of English, and the story is hardly original as the author of it (unknown BTW) merely stole old epic Germanic poems, twisted them, used some christian revisionism in the text to remove the pagan religion of the people the story is actually about and then slapped it altogether. I don't care how great the translation is, the text itself is garbage which is probably why the author is unknown. No one ever cared since it stunk so bad. The fact literature snobs think this is something special or even remotely unique should speak more about them then it. The ONLY thing this has going for it is that it's really really old. For whatever that's worth 
 Derrida, the renowned French postmodernist and author of, among other things, "Writing and Difference", is at it again in his latest effort, "Adieu to Emmanuel Levinas." His work is designed to cast great doubt on  the classical notions of truth, reality, meaning, and knowledge. The goal  is reprehensible, but Derrida can usually pull it off. "Adieu to Emmanuel  Levinas" is thus a major disappointment to all those fans of outmoded  deconstructionist French philosophers.  The book suffers from being far too  personal, and lacks detail. Anecdotes abound, but they are, in toto, not  particularly interesting or helpful ones, mostly along the lines of  childhood vacations to the beach and the like. As for the few attempts  Derrida makes to actually deal with PHILOSOPHY, detail is sorely lacking.  When a reader comes upon phrases like "the hermeneutics of orangutans,"  he/she really deserves to have some idea what the author is talking about.  Sometimes you just want to read about eschatalogical polemics or  signifier/signified interrelations, but you won't find that here. Seen in  this, or any other light, "Adieu to Emmanuel Levinas" falls pancake-flat.  Spend your money on something that makes sense to somebody other than the  author. I am sad now and it is Jaques Derrida's fault 
 The book is nothing more than a large ego trip from one of the most vile man in politics. Limbaugh has recycled his on air rant and raves into text.  There is nothing new here.  How a failed top forty DJ becomes the mouth piece for the republican party speaks a lot about conservatives.  Treat yourself to Viagra instead.  
 Unless you really want a tiny, cheap version of one of the most important books ever written, you should do yourself a favor and get a different edition.  This one is an embarrassment.    Almost any of the other editions (except for the miniature edition that also sells for $4.95) is a much better choice than this turkey.  If you are going to take the time to read an English translation of a 2,500 year old Chinese classic, you really should do yourself a favor and get a better edition 
 The definitions and thesaurus cross referencing are very good. The user interface is quite honestly shameful. Software companies got away with this years ago, but there are now accepted standards for windows user interfaces (e.g keyboard short cuts are missing). Integration with Word 2003 is weak. Numerous bugs and exceptions and very slow 
 I've read tons of information and have researched into Jaqueline Kennedy Onassis' life and found Anderson's book to be almost fiction at times.  He starts the book in a dialogue format and continues to use dialogue throughout the BIOGRAPHY.  I found myself asking, "How does he know the exact words that Jack and Jackie said to each other when they were in private".  The book is narrated many times and it just didn't seem to be authentic.  It was a good story, however and it would be nice if the book was 100% accurate.  I just like to know that when I'm reading a biography, I'm reading Non-fiction...not FICTION 
 I bought this for my son who has had a few scratches on some of his games. He followed the directions, and the game doctor put a perfectly circular scratch all the way around the disc-completely ruining it.  Kids being kids, didn't give up and tried another disc, again, completely ruining the disc- the kind of scratch this will not get out.  Ps the "resurfacing fluid" is primarily distilled saline.  Try that first with some muscle behind a soft cloth, you have a better chance saving your games!  Customer Service is hopeless.  I would warn anyone to NOT buy this product.  Perhaps I got a bum machine, but Digital Innovations will do nothing to rectify the situation. I had to leave a star.  The system wouldn't let me leave zero 
 Another enjoyable read, quicker than most because you don't have to think. It's not much of a mystery, and the Siamese cats really have little to do with its solution but provide a clever title. Mostly they give Braun a chance to ooh and ahh over the inexplicable ways of cats. It was many books ago that Koko actually provided a useful clue to his host, Mr. Q, the genial bachelor billionaire who is every tame girl's wish. Mostly this is a tale from Moose County, 400 miles north of anywhere. If you don't know what I'm talking about, this is certainly not right place for you to pick up this series.    Brrr is celebrating its 200th anniversary with Scots, a giant cake, bland good will from everyone, and Qwilleran's second historical disaster radio show up on stage. That's pretty exciting, too, when we get to hear the whole script. Oh, sure, there's a bad happening or two in town, but don't let that put you off for they occur well out of view. There's also good times with Q's good friends, and a subplot about an old lady, her fabulous antiques, and her mercenary granddaughter. There's no significant development in the relationships among any of Braun's stock characters--you know who I mean. To top off a pleasantly fluffy read, Braun appends two of Q's favorite delicious recipes. A quintessential summer beach read, guaranteed to pass a few hours pleasantly. 
 i'm a nora roberts fan, so picking up a book of hers to read is something i look forward to. after reading "born in fire", i was eager to find out what kind of romance the cool and collected brianna would find in "born in ice".  brianna is a young woman who is uncomfortable with conflict, and because she grew up in a household where her fiery sister maggie and embittered mom maeve were always battling, she developed the ability to keep a calm facade in the face of a storm. she has done a good job of disciplining her emotions to the point where they can't create further conflict, even if she burns with anger inside. she's very family oriented and longs for a husband and family of her own. after being jilted weeks before her wedding a decade before the timing of the story, she thinks she'll never have what she dreams of.  she owns a bed and breakfast in a small town in ireland where she is the perfect hostess. she's always hospitable to her guests. she's a gifted artist in both the kitchen and garden, two places she loves to be. although she's surrounded by folks who love her, she's still lonely.  and then comes grayson, the american writer who pops in for a couple of months to write a novel as inspired by the scenery and ambience of ireland. he's one who lives in the moment, ignoring his past and unwilling to plan the future because of the commitment and responsibilities such an action would create.  the characters compliment each other well. they're both generous and both suffering from childhoods where they didn't feel loved. she's comfortable with the idea of laying down roots but he's not. that's where the conflict comes to play.   and that's kinda where i've got a problem with the book. this is supposed to be a guy who doesn't want emotional ties, yet early in the book he's already willingly becoming emotionally attached to her. there simply wasn't enough resistance from him for me to believe he was really afraid of settling down. there was very little if any sexual tension here, and not enough situations to warrant sexual tension. a couple of encounters of kissing and then they were in bed. and even then, it seemed like he wasn't really fighting himself for being there. there simply wasn't enough of an inner conflict within him. it all seemed like lukewarm resistance.  and brianna was simply a saint. i would have liked to see her emote a little more. i understand that she was written to be an ice princess of sorts, but i don't think roberts did a good job of depicting her as a character who was a carefully contained boiler. at times i found it difficult to believe brianna could exhibit any kind of real passion with grayson.   there were alot of slow moments in the book that made me wishing i was already near the end. i will say that the ending was sweet. also, it was great seeing how the relationship of maggie and rogan progressed from "born in fire".  i'd recommend this book to anyone who likes reading about the vividness of a writer's imagination, as roberts did a great job with grayson in that respect. however, if you're looking for a "can't put down" romance novel, this ain't it 
 right the people i work with love this band and album so really i was pressured into buying this album..so i bought and i thought i was going to be blown away due to the hype from my friends but in reality this sucks more than the mudvayne album i've just reviewed terrible distorted guitars bad production off key singing, half baked lyrics the only good thing is the cover and maybe one of the singles are vaguely average apart from that the rest sucks...don't be fooled by the hype by the press this band sucks so will babyshamble 
 My cannon died the day before my daughters birthday so I ran out and tried a bunch of cameras in the morning and bought one.  Although this camera is 6 mp, my 3.0 Cannon took much clearer pictures.  I have had this camera for 9 months and I am sending it in for the second time for repair.  First the power button stopped working, and then on Easter (something about holidays) all of the functions of the buttons switched.  When I pushed delete, the menu came up.  Even the mode selector wasn't working.  It was reviewing the pictures in all three modes.  I will say that sony support online is very helpful, but I need something more reliable.  I am done with this camera 
 This book it not so good for ordinary people. Its moore fore more advanced investors 
 Like "Jurassic Park", this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters. My reasons for such an accusation: 1. Crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts. And while these can be quite interesting, they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline (Dan Brown, for instance, is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity). As a result, the book comes off as slow and stumbling. 2. The plot isn't all that interesting to begin with. (Vengeful gorillas? Talking gorillas? Misanthropic gorillas? Come on.) 3. The book's ending is utterly terrible. 4. Cricton's writing is weak, and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing.  Sorry, Michael, but this book just didn't do it for me 
 What a shame. This book seemed so exciting when I ordered it. But this author doesn't understand musical theatre. He doesn't really know the art form; he just knows a bit about it. So much of the book is so condescending and so dismissive toward a lot of oustanding musicals. And there are so many small factual errors that I have to wonder if he's really seen some of the shows he writes about. Was there no one to proof this book? Did no one reading it know that there is no Oscar for "best soundtrack"? And in addition to factual errors, Singer also fudges the truth from time to time to support his pre-existing conclusions. He doesn't seem to have much respect for the art form, and from what I can tell from his book jacket bio, he's never worked in the musical theatre, so he has virtually no interesting insights into how musicals work. Though there is a bit of useful info in the book, there are far better books than this. Don't bother 
 People of all groups, ethnicities, religions, and races commit cons, steal, and such.  To paint a whole ethnic group, Gypsies (Romani folk) with the same broad brush as the few among them who commit crimes is no more valid than to call all whites "oven tenders" because of the Holocaust or call all corporate officers "embezzlers" because of Enron or to call all men as rapists because a few have done so.  These sorry characterizations merely illustrate how twisted the slanderer's own views are.    While the grain of truth is that some people of all groups might con other people, the larger truth is that all groups have their share of criminals and no group has a monopoly on virtue.    Marlock clearly has written a book that is quite racist and wrong in spite of the grain of truth that some few people are indeed criminals.    Marlock tries to cover his tail by saying that he does not mean "all" Romani folk but then he goes on to make it quite clear that means "virtually all" but can't say so, without legal liability issues.  It's pure CYA and then he goes on and on with his racist slanders.    Yes, cons do exist and this book describes many of them.  No, they are not "Gypsy crimes" but just crimes and are committed by people of all ethnicities.  Too bad he doesn't just stick to describing the crimes and never mind discussing his racial hatreds.  Marlock's agenda is clear.  If he only wanted to protect innocents from crimes, he would not focus on a single very-small group of people.  The number of Romani people in this world is miniscule compared to the number of criminals in the world so his focus on Gypsies illustrates his true agenda here is merely to demonize a tiny, relatively-defenseless group of people.  The Furer's Reichspropagandaleiter Minister Dr. Goebbels would be proud of Marlock as one of their own, I am sure.  
 Review? Review?! Quality and really caring about providing a product the customer will actually be happy and proud to own is being replaced with making a fast buck. I dare to say that many Anime fans are also science fiction fans. My best example is what 'they' did to Star Trek. Just milk the fan for their money. Do the least 'they' need to do as the fans are already hooked. So, the Australian version of this has an English dub option? Why isn't it on the USA - Canadian release? Doh! If anyone buys this half-product they are feeding the greed and careless attitudes of those in charge of delivering this type of rubbish. The only one's who may have a reason to own this release is the true collector. Even then it's a rip-off not to have an English dub available. What a shame.. 
 This author needs to take two classes at whichever university she teaches: (1) instructional design and (2) writing concisely. This book has quite a lot of good information, but it is all buried within convoluted fluff.  There are many other books on research methodology that (a) do a better job of explaining, (b) include more comprehensive rules for research, and (c) don't take up so much of your valuable time with fluff. I recommend you look at those other books -- especially if you are a professor who is choosing a book for your students 
 My review is basically a review of the reviewers. In particular I am going to pick on the reviewer who wrote "A substantial and objective view of a Latin American Legend..." February 9, 2004, Matthew Dubuque. Because of that review I decided not to buy the book. (I haven't read it but based on the reviews I've changed my mind about purchasing it). Most reviews listed here whether critical of Castro or critical of his deriders, have really missed the point. It's all about ignorance.   Centralized Power What many fail to see is the problem of centralized power found exclusively in the hands of the State. How many times have we heard about how even if Hitler was bad, he had the trains running on time and brought back an economy from the ruins? God forbid something good should happen in a person's life and the government doesn't get credit for it. The friends of Liberty are few indeed. Cuba, at least in our Hemisphere is an example of centralized power destroying life and lying about its success even if it is successfully argued that the individual should take a back seat to the communal good.   Politicians If in fact a "conservative" "appointee of Margaret Thatcher" wrote this book it betrays that even the Hawks like the right in the UK and US are way off when it comes to Cuba. If it was "written by an appointee of the free-market heroine Margaret Thatcher" that gives credence to the view that there isn't much difference between political conservatives and modern political liberals: they go about arguing for different roles government should have in a person's life but they both want government in a person's life. They aren't too far from the likes of Castro.  Castro and Latin America To say Castro is deserving of praise like that given to Simon Bolivar shows how much ignorance there is of Latin America in the United States. The common view here is that all Latin Americans are either lazy, deserve their governments, come from naturally corrupt countries, and can only be saved by the strong man. It is interesting that those who hold similar views in the States don't prescribe such a government in their own hometowns- different rules for special people, I guess.  Further proof of the mass ignorance in the States about Cuba in particular is seen in the reviewer's statement: "Coming from a decisively Thatcherite background, the author's commentary is neither distorted by the hysterical whiners in Miami nor is it merely pinko propaganda." I can assure you that the Miami whiners are anything but: many have recreated their lives as Americans never to return to Cuba (without any major complaint), never involving themselves in politics or in some cases holding very liberal and pro-government views. Those who have complained and taken action (such as attempting to overthrow the Castro regime) the US has dealt with forcefully. Many of those active whiners now serve life terms in Federal prison for their actions (so much for the US's claim that it fights for the freedom of the oppressed worldwide).  The other more peaceful "whiners" in Miami have reasons to protest. Their family members have been: shot by firing squad, drowned by Cuban coast guard, attacked by US coast guard, tortured in Castro's prisons, divided by both the US and Cuban governments, and so on.  Another point of ignorance is the claim that Fidel lost many of his men by massacre during the revolution. This is not the case. The real major bloodletting took place once Castro came to power. Typical of all tyrants, he purged many of his own clan accusing them of conspiring against the revolution (challenging his power, reasoning and/or techniques). Plus, the vast majority of Cuba had no idea who Fidel Castro was. Castro merely appeared stage left, made his entrance and delivered the speeches. The "revolution" against Batista and Cuba's past was largely an action of the political class (those already in power) which of course Castro was not a part of.   Literacy  Literacy rates never are guaranteed by the government. In Cuba there is no way to cross examine the claims of government as the press does in a free society- such as questioning the claims of a government that states another country had a weapons of mass destruction. Just look at the US. Its literacy rates were highest in the world up until after the Civil War. Decade after decade its own government has kept records showing that the more government involves itself in the education of its citizens (increased spending) the greater the illiteracy (at least since the 1950s). Most students here today cannot even point out their country on a map and know very little about economics (a greater reason for their willingness to depend on government and hate the rich).   Blockade? The blockade is another point of contention. The word blockade first of all is a malapropism. There are no war ships blocking the ports of Havana. The embargo against Cuba is a joke. The first supporter of Cuba is Washington. The relationship between Havana and Washington is more that of two former lovers who criticize (directly and indirectly) one another's current lifestyles and actions- calling each other names but also ready to stop the actions of outsiders to the relationship lest it create the impression that the outsider has a stake in the former lovers' relationship- than the relationship of two archenemies. If you don't believe me, take a look at Washington's willingness for regime changes all over the world, its reluctance to take action against Cuba or allow others (the outsiders of the relationship) to take that action and its cozy relationship with Cuban military along Guantanamo base/border.  Prenatal Care, medicine, and homelessness If a mother misses a visit to her doctor in Cuba I wouldn't doubt the doctor visits the mother the next day. Undoubtedly since the State is ever present in such a system in every person's life, either the doctor or the mother have a political role in that relationship. And if either fails the State (list Castro here) the State will most assuredly fail them in respective their natural liberty (prison awaits). I doubt that mother would care about doc's visit knowing that the visiting doctor lacks supplies. (I know, its Castro's fault or the embargo's fault. Why can't it be the people's fault? When will they rebel?) This is nonetheless the case even in the US. Soon we will see our dear friend the Nanny Government knocking on the doors of all poor neighborhoods making sure that mothers get their prenatal care they deservedly need for the nurturing of future robots (I'm sorry, I meant to say patriotic citizens). Keep in mind that the medical doctor in the US is in fact an agent of the government. Try getting some medicines you need without a prescription. Said medicines are approved by the government, tested by the government and monitored by the government.   I am also certain that in Cuba there are no homeless because, well, there are no homes to be homeless from. Take a look at photos today of Havana and you'll see why some Cubans might want to be homeless than to live under the roof of a soon to be condemned structure.   After reading this book and writing all the things Dubuque wrote it is hard to believe that one can honestly state that the book is a "balanced examination...".. The reviewer also goes on to say that he goes to the island twice yearly on licensed visits. (Governments love to help one another regardless of their official declarations concerning one another.) The reviewer explicitly states how government supports his trips to Cuba which in turn create his view of Cuba. He states that his visits are "fully authorized", no doubt, with the Treasury department's rubber stamp, Havana's offering of tourist traps and his safe flight back to the US, causing his rose colored lenses to sit firmly on the bridge of his nose as he tells us what he has seen in Cuba 
 Try The Little Book of Yoga Breathing: Pranayama Made Easy instead of B.K.S. Iyengar's book and see for yourself.  Scott Shaw's book is an answer to any introductory pranayama and worths it's weight in gold.   Following are two techniques: Alternate Nostril Breathing (Anulom Vilom Pranayama with no breath retention) This pranayama (control breathing) is done with alternate breathing from the left and right nostrils for cleansing of Nadis. (energy meridians). Seated in a convenient posture, start off with slow inhalation from the left nostril first by closing the right nostril with the middle of right hand thumb ,and after fully filling the lungs, (not the belly breathing) breathe out slowly from the right nostril by closing the left nostril with the two ( left hand middle and ring) fingers. Now breathe in from the right nostril by closing the left nostril in the above manner and exhale from the left nostril by closing the right nostril with the right thumb. It completes one cycle.  Do this for three minutes for two months then gradually increase to 5 minutes.		  Do it two hour after eating  or drinking. (Do it on empty-stomach) Do not eat for 15 minute after you are done. Better to lie down for five minutes after you are done.  If you limit practice to maximum of five minutes, it will be the best.  The very first sign you will experience is lightness in the body and clearer thinking.  The practice of this breathing for a period of three to four months can open up thirty to forty percent of the heart arteries' blockages. This pranayama alleviates all the diseases of the body, leads to the state of joy, enthusiasm for living , fearlessness, peace of mind and deep meditation.  Benefits:		 -Hair will regrow within two months of practice.   -Body will go to it's ideal weight by itself. -Face becomes bright and luminous. -Lost vision will return. -Removes fear/anxiety of any kind. - Aligns both hemisphere of the brain for full brain functionality - Creates a deeper sense of well-being and harmony - Helps alleviate migraines and headaches and frazzled states of being - Works great in situations where you find yourself anxious, board and need grounding -Blockages in the arteries of the heart are removed and the arteries become clean, making circulation unimpeded.  Ujjayi Pranayama  1. You can do this sitting, standing or walking anywhere anytime.  2. Inhale slowly through both nostrils, keeping the throat slightly constricted so as to make a gentle sound that will help you to feel the breath in the throat. The sound will remind you of ocean waves washing up the beach. Concentrate on the feeling of the breath moving in and out through the throat.  3. During inhalation do not allow abdomen to bulge out, let the chest expand.  4. After completing inhalation slowly exhale. (Either by both nostrils or by left nostril) During exhalation chest should go inside and abdomen should remain steady.  Remember :-  1. While doing Ujjiayi air should touch the throat.  2. Breath must be mentally locked in chest area. (Do not do belly breathing)  3. After practicing it for few days, knowing your limitations, keep the ratio between inhalation and exhalation 1 : 2.  4. In easy Ujjiayi Pranayama, inhalation and exhalation can be practiced by both the nostrils.   Benefits: This simple practice has a subtle influence on the whole body. It calms the mind and has a soothing effect on the nervous system. Ujjayi is very useful for people with high blood pressure as it slows down the heartbeat. It has subtle effects on the flow of life force in the astral (energy) body and helps you to be aware of its movement within the sushumna (astral spine) 
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist [...] fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 I wish I would have read these reviews before purchasing this movie.  I cosign with everything everyone else is saying.  I too remember what this movie was like when it first aired.  Not only have the scenes been edited or deleted but the order of some scenes were altered as well.  I love this movie but I am disappointed in this dvd.  The dvd is supposed to have added features, not features taken away.  I should have known it was too good to be true, it was only $7.50!!  If it isn't broken.........ya'll know the rest 
 Lies, half truths, spin and glitz.  Of course there is some truth sprinkled in.  Self promoting TV stars are more interested in being self promoting TV stars than truth. Theres just not enough time for both. At best it's entertainment, at worst it misleads the children.  And finally they are all biblically illiterate.  So be careful...especially with TBN. 
 I too have serious doubts about the events in this book.  This does not sound like the Corps I was in, the events are universally gradiosing, no eyewitnesses are offered, no documentation or supporting data is offered, and there is some jargon that doesn't fit.  Anyone who reads this book should also read Stolen Valor by BG Burkett to understand how to critically review this and any other military book 
 While I liked parts of this book very much, it needed editing.  The sequence near the end in Venice was pure agony and I came ever so close to giving up.  However, having read so many pages it seemed a shame not to finish the book.  While the last few chapters helped to redeem the book, all in all the book disappointed, including the apparent tee off for a second volume.  Assuming there is a sequel, I'm not likely to purchase it 
 Jim Hightower has become another spokesman for the unhappy left. This limousine liberal who lives in Texas and poses blue collar, is now complaining about "trailer trash rednecks" who have taken his country from him. Since when was this Hightower's country? Yet so many misguided people are giving this book four or five star reviews. Why does this even deserve one star? Just like all the other liberal socialists, Hightower complains about dog-eat-dog economic corporations, the religious right, and capitalism. He has decided not to support Bush in the war on terrorism against Osama bin Laden, Zarkawi and his evil thugs. How dare he do such a thing.  And second, who has stolen this country. NO ONE! I am sick of people saying that Bush stole the election. Rubbish! Bush may have not won the popular vote in the 2000 presidential election but he won the electoral vote. Gore may have won the popular vote but he did not win the electoral vote. The presidential candidate who wins the electoral vote wins the election. That is what our founding fathers decided. Bush did not steal the election.   And about the Republican-controlled Congress. Congress is ruled by Republicans not because they stole their way there. But because they were elected by the people. The American people decided to elect Republicans in Congress. There is no way that the Republicans have stolen the government. It's nonsense!   Please take my advice and don't waste your money on this trashy book. Go to college and get an education in political science. I would only buy this book if I wanted something to destroy. But I would not buy this book because I am not giving Jim Hightower one cent of my money. And also because this book is not worth one cent of my money.   
 This book is full of errors and the subject matter presentation is far from an introduction. I used this in an intro class and it was one of the most useless textbooks I have ever bought. If it is a required book, do yourself a favor and buy some additional reading material 
 Seagal shows no signs of stopping his domination of the direct to DVD bad action movie market with his 40th film in about three years.  They keep showing these babies on cable, and after recently catching this, I was more shocked than from the last Seagal flick, a similar fare (title unimportant) from only a year or two past.  It must be seen to be believed.  If you ever saw any of Seagal's classic bone-crunchers of the late 80s and early 90s, which while ridiculous, at least had some good production values and some level of technical competence, then you can appreciate how bad, how shameless, how...unbelievably shameless it all is.  I really think with the way these films look and the way they're presented...he should just have his own weekly TV series on primetime, with the same plot (ex-CIA guy, blah blah blah, grunt groan snap).  These films really look like bad primetime shows about...fat, ex-CIA 'operatives' who come into all kinds of violence one way or another.  There is a slight measure of fun, some self-reflexivity to the work, the filmmakers knowing that anyone morbid enough to watch knows exactly what a Seagal films is...but then, these movies make Out For Justice look like John Huston.    You can while away some time watching how fat Seagal is, how he continues to adapt the long, leather coat (I like how they embrace his now trademark hands-over-the-belly fatman stance on the artwork), how he is unable to do the most basic stunt (anything involving a jump, or lifting his leg greater than 20 degrees).  He was constantly using stand-ins and stuntmen for everything over 10 years ago...now it's comical.  The tricks they employ to literally hide him from scenes is fun to watch and note.  The extreme close-ups so his massive, tanned face engulf the screen, and always with the long coats (the coat is always on, even in the occassional medium shot of the expanding, receding star).  Yes, he's been fatter, but Seagal isn't going to wow anyone with a fight scene...since, well, he doesn't appear to be in the fight scenes (save for aforementioned tanned closeups).  Perhaps those mob ties are not gone, because he is working at an alarming rate as if to satisfy a debt to someone culled from one of his earlier classics.  There is nothing to discuss.  Seagal can only be applauded for this campaign, the man is making tremendous money with no concern for shame, dignity, etc.  Plus, he's a renaissance man, touring with his band, being a lamai, and releasing his own energy-spiritual product thingees 
 This book provides an interesting perspective on C.S. Lewis that you won't get in other books.  However, I was disappointed by the writing style and the content of the book. It seems to be targeted towards a juvenile audience. Much of the book is simply a retelling of other Lewis biographies. There are many typographical errors. I was also surprised at the way Gresham constantly maligned others in Lewis' life.  Another disappointing thing about the book is that only the last few chapters are dedicated to the time period that Gresham actually knew Lewis. He speaks with great authority on Lewis' entire life, interpreting events before he was born as if he was there.  If you are expecting a well-written and enjoyable book about C.S. Lewis, this book is not for you. I found the book tiresome and hard to follow 
 I purchased this book when my husband was diagnosed with kidney cancer last summer (June 2006). I was hoping for some real insight into the process of healing and opening oneself to the channel of healing. I found the book very disappointing. There was nothing in it that inspired my husband in any way nor gave us any insight as to how to investigate the process of opening oneself to the miracle of healing. I was miraculously healed of Multiple Sclerosis in November of 1975 and have conducted many retreats and workshops on "Self Awareness and Healing" across the United States. I had hoped that Adam might have some further insight into the healing phenominan and that I could gain further insight in order to help my husband and others. I read the book aloud to my husband and he,too, was disappointed in the content of the book. I learned nothing new from this book nor found it to be particularly inspirational. My dear husband passed away in October 2006 and received the greatest healing of all, death. He is now in the presence of our Lord and is where I want to be someday 
 Yes, there are worthwhile portions of this book, such as the author's dissection of some of the idiocies of "free market capitalism" and the "children of Abraham." Nevertheless, the book could have been so much better.  First, I must heartily agree with those who have criticized the book's poor organization. Where was/were the editor(s)?  Second, the book does go on at unnecessary length about Princess Diana. Furthermore, although Wheen is certainly aware of "Mother Teresa," who died days after Princess Diana, he gives Ma T (who is, as far as I'm concerned, one of the most over-rated public figures of the 20th century) no more than a passing mention. Now Ma T is a subject ripe for the sort of treatment the author gives to Princess Diana. However, not a word about Ma T's grotesque warehouses of the sick and dying, not a word about the vast sums of money and other contributions collected by her organizations that were obviously not actually used, and not a word about her perverse ideas on suffering, for example: "I think it is very beautiful for the poor to accept their lot, to share it with the passion of Christ. I think the world is being much helped by the suffering of the poor people."  Third, although Wheen does deal to some extent with the anti-scientific fraud of Creationism (he doesn't give it enough attention, in my opinion), he does not deal with the "Shroud of Turin".  Fourth, the relatively few pages on "right-wing conspiracy theories" seem like lip service. There is so much more that he could have mentioned. He could have mentioned that the Birchers still would have us believe that President Ike was a "conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy." He could have mentioned the persistent efforts to (ahem) whitewash slavery (part of the heinous liberal plot to defame the white, Christian South). Recently, one of those efforts, the booklet "Southern Slavery as it Was" found itself into classes at Cary Christian School in Cary, NC. He could have mentioned the ongoing attempts to promote the obvious lie that large numbers of Americans were being held prisoner by Vietnam for years after the return of the POWs, and that there was an elaborate government coverup to hide the existence of these prisoners. You can still find assertions that there are still US prisoners in Vietnam. He could have mentioned those things and many others, but he did not.  Finally, he seems afflicted with the "Must Have BALANCE!" disease that crops up in so many pundits. Hence the section devoted to the crimes of various (gasp) heinous leftoids. Much of this section verges on being outright ridiculous. For example, he goes into high dudgeon over the dastardly anti-Americanism of Noam Chomsky, who, among other crimes, was insufficiently critical of the Khmer Rouge. Wheen conveniently fails to mention that the US government, for no discernible reason than to spite the government of Vietnam, *who were the ones who overthrew the Khmer Rouge*, "...became tacit supporters, for nearly a decade, of the Khmer Rouge, despite their murderous regime. The United States government continued to recognize the ousted regime as the legitimate occupants of Cambodia's seat in the United Nations" (Arnold R. Isaacs in _Vietnam Shadows_). Most of that period occurred during *Republican* governments in the US, but it wouldn't be convenient to acknowledge that. Wheen also gets self-righteous about something Michael Moore (a favorite whipping boy of American Fascists and their useful idiots) wrote that is obviously a comment on the savagely murderous absence of any sort of selectivity in (...)choice of targets. Wheen conveniently neglects to mention that Ann Coulter openly expressed the wish that the planes had hit the New York Times. Coulter has also openly advocated the persecution of "liberals". In fact, *far* more prevalent and dangerous than any heinous leftoids are the legions of poison-pen and poison-tongue right-wing propagandists, backed by vast amounts of right-wing money, who constantly dump their raw sewage into American society. No, it wouldn't do at all to acknowledge that particular unpleasant truth about "life in these United States." This books's glaring faults significantly outweigh its small virtues, in my opinion 
 Networks are since a couple of years object of intense research in several different disciplines. One reason therefore is certainly the outstanding article by Watts and Strogatz, Collective dynamics of small world networks, Nature, 393:440--442, 1998. Unfortunatelly, this book can not continue the high level of this article. Actually, it does not really provide much more information than the article itself. I would suggest to read the article cited above and either decide for another book or to look directly in the literature and read the origninal articles.  To summarize, this book is not terribly weak, but one can clearly sees that it swims on the current 'complex networks' wave without providing enough justification for its existence. Of course, if you do not have access to the original literature and just what to have a general overview of complex networks and what be done with them, you may consider buying this book 
 No, I'm not going to dignify this by elaborating further.  This is just a link in the chain of (giggle) "historial fiction" that currently accounts for DaVinci Code, etc.  It's all been said before, Michael.  HO-hum... 
 I was assigned this textbook for my high school Sociology class that I took as an elective in the last semester of my Senior year.  I had gone into the class expecting an intriguing, thought-provoking subject that led students to ask the big questions about why people and society are the way they are, and that the textbook would help guide me along the way.  Unfortunately, I was pretty dissapointed, to say the least.  Let me add a disclaimer saying that I am a firm Independent; I'm a college-bound kid who dislikes political and ideological squabbles and believes both the Right and the Left have equal merit in their own ways.  That being said, the reason for my rating is that, as my title suggests, the author's opinions and biases shine through quite blatantly, much of it appealing sharply to the Left wing of the ideological spectrum.  While most textbooks simply give you facts, with maybe some interpretations to help you form your own conclusion, Henslin has the negative tendency to editorialize, using word choice and selected statistics (not to mention his own "personal observations") to paint certain aspects of society in a good or bad light as he sees fit.  This is a very inappropriate, and I might go so far as to call it dangerous, thing to do when writing educational material to be taught to youngsters.  As an example, take a look at his chapter on economic theories, in which capitalism and socialism are both given analysis.  The problem is, when socialism is mentioned, Henslin spends a significant majority of the time in which it's mentioned explaining the goals and the lofty ideals of it, and little time mentioning its inherent drawbacks (which all ideologies have).    The whole rest of the chapter, however, is dedicated to capitalism; more specifically, how capitalism basically is so totally exploitive, greedy, and concentrates power in the hands of the tiny few, with the phrases "exploitation," "greed", "believe greed is good," and "elite" dropped here and there.  Add further excerpts implying that American democracy is little more than a puppet show controled by rich business interests who sway the government, and it's not hard to see how someone impressionable would learn to unflinchingly hate the whole theory in general.  This is NOT what a textbook is supposed to do.    Henslin then spends much of the time talking about class, race, gender, etc...as was to be expected.  The problem here is that, again, he editorializes, rallying around whatever the oppressed group of the time may be and almost relentlessly guiltmongering against whites, men, and people in classes that can live comfortably.    The chapter about gender is a particular treasure trove for this sort of thing; near the beginning, Henslin writes a particular gem referring to gender in the workplace, which goes something along the lines of "Imagine that two women are talking when they are supposed to be working.  When the male boss walks by, he would most likely tell them to get back to work.  But what if it were two men talking?  For instance, if they were talking about sports, would he be more likely to join in on their conversation instead of telling them to get back to work?  This is just one of the inequalities that women face in the workplace." (not a verbatim quote, but that's the basic gist of it).    And it just gets better from there, some of it based off of true injustices that happened in the past and do still happen today, but a lot of it off of generalizations and editorials that I, as a young male, found quite offensive.  When my class finished with that chapter, I felt as if Henslin was doing everything short of saying that I was going to roast in Hades for having an XY chromosome.  Extremely one-sided, with the guilt and blame poured on heavily.    I could go on about how the book gives readers guilt trips about how people in our own supposedly-prosperous nation and around the world are living in poverty while we comfortable-living ingrates sit on our butts taking part in an exploitive culture driven by self-interest, but I've already gone on long enough.    Suffice to say this much; this book's biases are dead obvious to anyone who is truly objective-minded enough to notice it.  It's kind of a shame, because I truly believe that Henslin had good intentions when he wrote this, and I do believe that, like many liberal-minded people, he has a genuine concern about the injustices of the world and a desire to see it change for the better.  But that doesn't excuse the fact that opinionated language, finger-pointing, guiltmongering, and editorializing play a major role in getting this textbook's points across.    A schoolbook is supposed to present cold hard facts to students with an absolute minimum of bias, so as to respect them enough to form their own beliefs and interpretations; not indoctrine them with the exlusive ideas of a narrow ideological philosophy.  I'm almost disheartened that this book has gotten so many rave reviews singing its praises about it's objectivity and enlightening messages.  Then again, as much as I hate to perpetuate stereotypes, this is mostly read by college students, and, on the political spectrum college kids are often...well, you get the idea.  I wouldn't really recommend this textbook to any educator who wishes to maintain a proper balance of opinion in the classroom.  If you do end up reading it, though, be prepared to take your grain of salt to class with you.                         
 I purchased this product at a B@M retailer (my first mistake?). The unit is attractive. The coffee function works as advertised.  Upon setup, I discovered that the espresso function was inoperative. I had to wait until a weekday to contact the Krups customer service. They were not particularly responsive, but ultimately agreed to pay for shipment to their center, and, upon verification that it was inoperative, they would replace it.   One month later I received the replacement. Upon setup, the replacement did make espresso. However, the next day the espresso function again failed, this time with different "symptoms" (initiation of the pump, then failure with blinking liht and display. I again contacted customer service, and now they offer a $10 refund of shipping (The return label function is "inoperative at the moment), with shipment of another replacement item upon confirmation of shipment.  Krups refused a refund. The retailer, of course, will not refund, since I now have a replacement. So I am now well into my second month of ownership, with no espresso!! (And, my warranty is ticking away....) MY best possible outcome appears to be months of hassles, assuming I ever receive a functioning product... 
 I wish that there was a way to have actually stated on the rating drop-down "0 Star"  The VERY first give away that this book was complete rubbish whaat when Mr. Hudson referred to himself as a "warlock".  It was downhill from there.  When speaking to Anthropology classes studying religion, magic and witchcraft, this is my example of a "do not buy". 
 First off, I have never thaught I would give Gilgamesh anything less than five stars. However, I recently received Andrew George's translation (the more reccent translation in the Penguin Classics series) and earlier today got my hands on a copy of this edition and decided to compare them. I found this edition very incomplete (George's is currently the most complete form) and like another reviewer said an unneccisarilly long introduction (at least for a translation that short). So while I do recomend Gilgamesh to everybody I would not recomend this (N. K. Sandars) translation and would instead recomend the one by Andrew George (unless you want more myths from Babylon and that area in which case I would recomend Myths From Mesopotamia by Stephanie Dalley her translation while not as complete is still one of the best I've read) 
 The set up for this novel is interesting, if a bit easy to anticipate in the first half. The father: stoic and crushed by his love for a flighty, mentally ill woman. The mother: beautiful, ravaged by her own mental sickness, seemingly self-obsessed and consumed by superficial things. The brother: distant and angry. The daughter: spunky with a desire to rise above it all, hungry for the love of her brother and father. I was never--not once--surprised by any of these characters until the father found an interest in the occult in the middle of the book, and by then, I just didn't buy his his sudden turn. Lots of things happened, but by the middle of the book, I kept thinking, when is something going to happen that moves me?    Part of the reason that so many events with the potential to elicit great empathy from the reader fail to do so is that the book feels like so much backstory, so much summary. We rarely get to be fully present in the past moment with the characters, and because of this, the characters feel very distant and stiff.  But ultimately, this book frustrated me because of the awkward, contorted prose. Look--I'm fine with fragments and run on sentences, but when there is no rhyme or reason as to why so many are being used, they lose their impact and importance. The sentence structures in this book are beyond affected, and they really take away from what could have been an interesting story. I quit reading 2/3 of the way in, I will admit. However, if I feel nothing by then, there is a problem 
  The book is misleading as a lot of the stuff she uses to make her food I don't consider to be scratch. I was disappointed in the book although some of it was good 
 LOS ANGELES STYLE ROCK/POP/COUNTRY ROCK.  This is moe.'s sixth or seventh studio album, depending on if you count Meat. It was produced by John Siket, who has also worked with Phish.     This CD is 73 minutes long, but there is a 14 minute period of just silence.  It is embedded in the final track.  The song Opium is about 6 minutes long.  It is followed by the 14 minutes of silence and then about 2 minutes of an alternative take of Captain America.  Because of this gap, and because I don't really want to hear Captain America more than once, I knocked my rating down a star.  Many of the tracks sound like copies of other bands.  I think that most of these don't play to moe's strenghth.  There is the LA country/rock sound, similar to Eagles on Captain America and Can't Seem To Find (which is probably the worst song moe. has ever done).  These two songs are also on the live CD set, L and also drag it down.  Tamourine sounds like it could have come from JJ Cale and Tgorm sounds like a Bruce Hornsby song.    So Long sounds like early Smashing Pumpkins.  But, I think this song works because it more along the lines of what moe. does best.  Then there is the completely useless cover of the Australian new wave band, Big Country's In A Big Country.  It wasn't a great song in the first place, and moe.'s version is even weaker.  This isn't a bad album and there are a few very good tracks on it.  I just don't think it the best that moe. can do.  And, the best tracks on this CD are also available on the live CD sets, so I would get those instead 
 I was really disappointed with this book.  It was syrup-y sweet and too perfect, as another review said.  I was really looking forward to reading this one after finishing the first one, which was GREAT.  I hope Sisterchicks in Mexico is better! 
 In the immortal words of Gene Autry: How can anyone be right, when everybody's wrong?  Mr. Garea's (Amazon's Spotlight review) thoughtful, well written critique on the Heisenberg portrayed in Mr. Rose's book is "compleat" (yuck yuck), and there is nothing I need to add.  Mr. Rose's slashing attack on Mr. Heisenberg is too simplistic, fails to take into account the impact of the political, economic and moral collapse of Weimar Germany on the German people, and plays too heavily on what Mr. Rose sees as 400 unchanging years of Germanic totalitatian culture.  Heisenberg's harshest critics, the Nobel Laureates Lenard and Stark with their Newtonian cause & effect "German Physics" (as opposed to "Jewish Physics" ie relativity & disputes about quantum mechanics a la Einstein and Niels Bohr), they were the ones falsely tied to a vision of Germanic Culture.  Not Heisenberg.  Where I part ways with Mr. Garea is in Mr. Garea's tounge in cheek portrayal of a Werner Heisenberg qua James Bond (maybe not Sean Connery or Roger Moore--more like a Timothy Dalton or George Lazenby) from Thomas Powers "Heisenberg's War: the Secret History of the German Bomb."  Whatever else he was, Mr. Heisenberg was no smoothie--a common denominator for Bondness.  However, I am convinced by Mr. Powers's thesis that Mr. Heisenberg did retard Germany's development of the atomic bomb.  No, Heisenberg did not "fake" math calculations or create false evidence, but as Mr. Powers carefully documents, Heisenberg did work hard to create a false impression of the feasibility of creating an atom bomb.  Of the different opportunities that Heisenberg had for pushing development of a German A-bomb, none could have been as fortuitous as the June 1942 meeting with Albert Speer.  Speer had just been appointed Hitler's honcho to get the economy on a war footing, and develop some answer to the allies increasingly relentless and unanswerable bombing missions.  Additionally, the Nazi regime needed to do something about the military reverses at Moscow.  If Heisenberg wanted to build an atom bomb, Speer was ready to fund one.  Instead, Heisenberg gave a deliberately obtuse presentation about the atom bomb.  Heisenberg was well aware that a reactor would create the fissonable element 94 (plutonium), but instead spoke generally of "transuranics."  This conscious fogging of the science intentionally left a false impression on Speer's science advisor, a physical chemist named Lieb.  After the meeting, Lieb (incorrectly) believed that only U-235 could be used for a bomb, and that there was no viable way to separate U-235 from U-238.  Heisenberg knew better--plutonium could replace U-235--and how much fissonable material was needed for a critical mass: about the size of a pineapple.  Finally, Heisenberg told Speer that perhaps a working reactor could be built in 1942, but a bomb could not be built before 1945.  These dates are key for two reasons.  First, the dates are outside the parameters that Speer needed, and second: they were also damn good guesses.  Mr. Fermi created the world's first sustained chain reactor in Chicago in December, 1942 and the US blew up the first bomb in July 1945.  Finally, if Heisenberg really wanted to go all out on a German bomb, there was Speer ready to write the big checks.  Instead, Heisenberg & his people asked for piddling amounts of funding to continue basic research--so small that Speer promptly lost interest in atom bombs.  The importance of this June 1942 Meeting, and the difference between what Heisenberg knew and what he told Speer is lost on Mr. Rose.  Heisenberg did consciously retard German developments of an A-bomb, if only by deliberately creating several key false impressions--not exactly the stuff that wins hearts of Ursula Andress, Jill St. John or even Sophie Marceau, but it still counts.    Nevertheless, how should we account for Heisenberg's inconsistent actions both during and especially after the war?  Mr. Powers suggests several reasons, but I do not believe he gives enough creedence to Heisenberg's (and most Germans) fear & distrust of Soviet Russia.  Many individuals in the West initially excused Nazi excesses in the name of restoration of the economy (if only taming rampent inflation), and creating a bulwark against Stalinism.  One of Heisenberg's key co-workers was a (now former) communist sympathizer who returned to Nazi Germany after two & a half years in a Soviet prison, with a forced bogus confession of being a Gestapo-Trotsky-Bukharin spy.  Something needed to be done about Stalin.  Moreover, post WWI Germany featured seemingly endless rises and collapses of Governments.  At the time, it was not unreasonable to believe that Hitler's thousand year reich would be replaced in next year's coup by the Christian Democrats, or the Weirmarcht would throw out the Nazis, and continue a secular (as opposed to Nazi racist paganism) military dictatorship.  The post WWII alibi of the "good germans" was not only that they "didn't know," but that "someone" needed to stop Stalin (not to mention the crap about building the autobahn, but we digress).  Finally, Heisenberg's seemingly inconsistent statements after the war are probably a combination of his foolish pride (OF COURSE he could have built a bomb--if he REALLY wanted to), and his awkward speaking style.  This last point is more of an impression--but Heisenberg was a physicist, not a politician or a public speaker.  He could talk about science with exactness--but outside of that realm, he left much to be desired.  In short, I am convinced by Mr. Powers's arguments and the breath of his documentation.  Mr. Rose needed to pay closer attention to Powers's book, and the documentation used by Powers.  As a final note on both this book and Mr. Powers's book--indeed, since Heisenberg's death in 1976, any book about Heisenberg--an important source as to Heisenberg's postwar views is the 1967 book "The German Atomic Bomb," and a battery of extensive personal interviews, all by David Irving.  Mr. Powers merely cites this source--an undisputedly important source--without comment.  Still, as a historian, there is no question that Mr. Irving's reputation has taken a beating.  See, for example, "Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial" by Richard J. Evans.  Mr. Irving has recently been sentenced to three years imprisonment in Austria as a "holocaust denier."  What all Mr. Irving's personal beliefs, credentials, and current legal woes add to the discussion of Heisenberg's activities from 1939 to 1945, I do not know.  I have no idea what Mr. Irving's views were in 1965-1967, when Mr. Irving extensively interviewed Heisenberg and wrote his book--and if Heisenberg was aware of those views in giving such time and access to Mr. Irving.  I only mention this as an additional piece of the Heisenberg puzzle that may (or may not) mean anything.  Be that as it may, the bottom line is: Read Powers's book, and not this one.  And Amazon is damn lucky to have thorough reviewers like Mr. Garea 
 this is another story that I don't know if I like it or not because Amazon.com never sent it too me.  this has happened about 4/5 times.  While usually I have no problem getting movies, sometimes I do.  sending them e-mails doesn't seem to work.  If they didn't have the best prices for movies, I'd leave 
 Having been a young boy in London who lived first hand through the regular bombing of his native city by German bombers and "wonder" weapons like the V-1 and V-2, John Cornwell's "Hitler's Scientists" is his attempt to consider the morality of scientists, Allied, Soviet, Nazi and others, before, during and after the great world wars, and into the Cold War and the War on Terror.  Getting away from simplistic "Hollywood" depictions of scientists, Cornwell considers the, "presence of pressures, temptations and compromises, involving spouses, families, fear of loss of opportunity to do science; desire to receive academic recognition, resources; conflicting loyalties, towards academic discipline, colleagues, institutions, student bodies and Fatherland."  And generally he succeeds.  He does however, by way of omission and improper contrasting, paint many of the scientists who worked on the American atomic weapon program as villains.  For example, he cites the case of Rotblat, whom in my extensive reading of Los Alamos history, I had never heard of before, as a case of a heroic Los Alamos scientist.  Rotblat quit Los Alamos once it was determined that the raison d'etre for the Los Alamos program, namely the fear that Hitler would have the bomb first, was unfounded.  Allied intelligence determined the war would be over long before the Germans could possibly assemble a nuclear weapon of mass destruction (WMD).  For this quitting, Cornwell calls Rotblat courageous and heroic for going against the powers that were.  May I take it by this reasoning that Cornwell considers the non-quitters as non-courageous and non-heroic scientists?  In prior pages along these lines, moreover, Cornwell factually states that the use of the atomic bomb against Japan had, and continues to have critics stating that Japan was on the verge of defeat.  He never mentions the history that as US forces approached Japan island by island, the Japanese defenders would die almost to a man, and that US casualty rates were atrocious and getting worse.  He never mentions that Japanese commanders, after the first atomic bombing of their nation, attempted a coup against their emperor in order to press on the war.  Instead, he despicably connects the arguments of the German scientist Haber, who developed and personally deployed poison gasses in World War I, to those similar arguments of the Allies who claimed the use of atomic weapons shortened the war and saved lives in net.  It's true that (actually practicing the sterilizations they preached) Americans were the leaders in eugenics around the 1920s, and that the Nazis borrowed many of their racists ideas from the Americans.  And it's fair to connect these scientists.  But it is not fair to connect Haber in one fell swoop with Allied scientists.  Haber's first wife committed suicide to protest his poison gas war work, and yet he pressed on unhindered going to the battlefield himself, and even when suffering increasingly under the rising tide of Nazism because of his Jewish ancestry, he still pressed on.  He cared about poison gas and would deliver it to his masters regardless of their politics.  On the other hand, I've read biographies of Oppenheimer, Teller, Lawrence, Fermi, Feynman, Wigner, Meitner, Gamov, Ulam, Sakharov, and Einstein who wrote to President Roosevelt about the risks of atomic physics from Nazi Germany, as well as many books on the Manhattan project familiarizing myself with Groves, Szilard, Bush, Connant, and many others.  These people debated the building and use of nuclear weapons.  While some, like Teller, pushed for even more powerful H-bombs, some, writing a letter to President Truman, asked that the US only demonstrate these devices to the Japanese, while others worked hard to promote international control of these bombs--Teller, beside his ambitious and personal drive for H-bombs, had the Soviet threat in mind.  Had we quit work on atomic weapons when the "heroic" "who-in-the-hell?" Rotblat quit, would the Soviets, who were abreast of our atomic programs thanks to their many misguided British and American scientific spies (typically scientists who believed in balancing world powers) have quit?  I doubt it.  Then what might have happened to the world when only Stalin had the bomb?  Simply replace the name Stalin with Hitler for a quick back-of-the-envelope answer.  Cornwell doesn't consider these thoughts.  More of the same can be said about Cornwell writing on Niels Bohr.  Citing Niels Bohr's letters about his encounter with Heisenberg in Copenhagen, Cornwell paints Bohr as a lying scientist with a guilty conscience after-the-fact.  You see, the historical record shows that Bohr and Heisenberg met over several days, surely discussing atomic physics weapons work--German work included--yet the historical record shows that Bohr had no problems during the last evening of Heisenberg's visit, playing music and having a good time at his home with the German physicist.  If Bohr could be so accomodating, then surely, Cornwell reasons, Heisenberg didn't reveal anything scary about German atomic bomb work.  Why then, Cornwell questions Bohr, did Bohr report to Allied forces the urgent need for an Allied atomic weapons program?  Was it for reasons other than the defeat of Hitler?  Was it for science, for political gain, or some other disingenuous reason aside from fear of Hitler?  Bohr, Cornwell cites after all, wrote with seeming guilt years later that perhaps he had overreacted, and thus had helped create the Allied atomic weapons program.  Does Cornwell consider the case that perhaps Bohr was friendly to Heisenberg beyond their long history to spy on Heisenberg about German physics over Mozart and spirits?  No.  And given the overwhelming progress of Hitler's Nazi war machine sweeping across Europe and steeping these nations in blood, was it not better, if not just plain natural, for Bohr to have chosen to believe in his worst fears when even his own nation would soon knowingly be invaded?  Perhaps Bohr, like other wise people, hoped for the best but expected and planned for the worst.  You won't get these questions from Cromwell.  To this end, I recommend to the reader the biography of Ulam, who figured out how to make H-bombs work for the Americans.  He'll tell you how many scientists and their families died under Hitler, and what the émigré scientists were thinking while they worked on the Allied atomic bomb as they lost family under Hitler as well.  These people were not Habers, but thought about what they were doing and did what they thought was best.  Sadly, where I do agree with Cromwell is that science does not necessarily lead to enlightenment.  One has to look at the man or the woman, their nation, their academic pressures, their ambitions, their opportunism, and many other factors to see that a scientific education often doesn't correlate to benevolent, egalitarian morality.  I wish it did when I think about the Iranian atomic scientists working on their weapons under a rising tide of Muslim fundamentalism which believes that it's okay to kill even Muslims to kill infidels, even to kill the world, because Allah will sort them out, for the sooner Muslims get to Allah, the sooner they're in paradise.  I'm grateful though to be a citizen of a nation with an enormous stockpile of atomic and hydrogen bombs because something inside me tells me the Iranians in particular and Muslims in general aren't that MAD.

 As previous reviewers have commented, this is a very good overview of the CMMI. The authors work in the industry, and have done an admirable job presenting the nuts-and-bolts of this enormous topic in a straightforward fashion. But if you intend to use it as a tool, like you would Paulk's book on the SW-CMM (SM), DON'T BUY IT YET. The editing in Appendix B renders this book useless to me (I need it as a tool). When I compare the constituents of the Process Areas in Appendix B to the CMMI (CMU/SEI-2000-TR-018), there is erroneous duplication. E.g., "Commitment" in PMC reads exactly like "Commitment" in Requirements Management PA (it shouldn't !). Ditto for Co in SAM, Co in MA, and the subsequent Maturity Level 2 Process Area commitments. The same erroneous cut-and-paste was made for the Abilities, DI, etc. The Level 3 PAs have the similar problem, erroneous cut-and-pastes from the RD template. I cannot use this book as I'd intended because of these errors, so I have to lug around the large heavy SEI tech reports instead 
 I read The New Money Masters after the Market Wizards and the New Market Wizards. When I saw "winning investment strategies of: Soros, Lynch, Rogers, etc etc on the front cover, I immediately bought it. Like any trader who jumps into the market without a plan or thorough study, I lost this trade. Train tried to portrait what's in those masters' minds but he failed. Even worse, his writing skill had been too bad for me to finish reading the whole book. Well, how am I supposed to expect something great from a 379 page book that carries 147 pages of appendix 
 It is hard to imagine what the American songbook ever did to Rod Stewart that he would decide to degrade it like this, not once, not twice, but three times.  Stewart's decision to approach these shop-worn standards ranks up there with Napoleon's decision to invade Russia during the winter, it is staggeringly ill conceived.  The problem, of course, is his voice.  The selection of material seems ideally suited to showcase his limitations as a singer, which are countless.  For starters, he has almost no range at all.  Next, his raspiness has no inherent beauty, and these are songs intended for beautiful voices.  By their very nature, the selections are vehicles for skilled singers, their simplicity allows excellent performers to interpret and express individual perspective.  Stewart, because he is a rock and blues singer, never learned the fundamentals of singing and certainly never developed a mature, expressive voice.  He scratches along the surface of these listless vehicles with the charm of a man skating over ice with sandpaper strapped to his shoes.  Banks of strings and fabulously misguided collaborations, (Dolly Parton!), do not mask but highlight what is wrong with this project.  Bear in mind that I like Rod Stewart; he's from Scotland and he's the prototypical Brit blues belter.  If you want to know what he's actually good at, dig out your copy of Jeff Beck's first release, Truth.  Stewart delivers some of the best blue-eyed twelve bar wailing ever recorded.  But that's the problem.  On Truth it was the cigarettes, whisky, and swagger in his voice that made him great - it wasn't about singing technique - it was about authenticity.  Here, the focus is on singing, and his limitations are embarrassingly spotlighted.  Albums like this never get made unless the performer already has name recognition that guarantees sales, nightmares of this stripe could never stand on their own merits.  To be avoided at all cost.  
 ...just like Hollywood and just like the music industry which, I guess, is the point.    John Travolta, playing on his character from Get Shorty (and, to a lesser degree, like his character in Pulp Fiction and Swordfish) is Mr. Cool.  This time he's trying to make it big in the music biz.  He discovers a new talent (artist Christina Milian) and works his way through an assortment of characters that are more types and cliches than real characters.    A brand name cast and yet no one makes any more than a dent on the personality radar.  The dialogue seems forced, funnier on the script than on the screen and most scenes feel posed and sterile.  Most of the actors appeared as bored as many celebrities are outside of their media personae.  Aside from a few interesting moments, only one speech toward the end made by Cedric the Entertainer redeemed the film.    It's like a big commercial (which, I suppose, is any Hollywood film).  Certain musicians get shameless plugs (Steven Tyler and Aerosmith, included in the film), various movies get shameless plugs (including, in a not so disguised fashion, Get Shorty), certain Hollywood landmarks (e.g. the Mann Chinese Theater) are plopped into the film like a tourist video and even the L.A. Lakers and the Staples Center get a plug.    It's an attempt to play on the irony of making a film about making a film or, in this case, making a musician.  So we watch Travolta as Mr. Cool navigating the landscape of the music industry to give Christina Milian her sudden and instantaneous rise to the top of the charts.  The ending is so horribly cheesy I felt as if I was watching American Idol.  Watchable, but barely.  The Player covered this terrain so much better.  
 My girlfriend is reading this book, I've only skimmed it briefly.  I do detect a tendency on Pearce's part to be anti-scientific, and to make claims without giving evidence.  In any case, who are the  "Kirkus" reviewers that the other reviews lambaste?  Seems odd  that they are represented only by their detractors.. 
 not as good as Celtic Woman or Hanley Westenra ... I would say not half good. I can say they have great talent, but artistically ... wrong managed.  Stopped watching after 30 min 
 I order a book (interplay)from this person about 5 months ago, and I still do not have my book. This person still not even giving me back my money !!!!!!!! 
 This is not a good book as it's "anazlyzed" but someone who transcribes, can play transcriptions but has no clue as to how Jazz is really formulated at all....rockers do not know how to teach jazz except to copy it and that's what this book is all about, guesses.  Not a valid book 
 This novel deserves 5 stars.  I was given 44 Scotland Street as a Christmas gift. I assumed it was a "detective story" given the author's previous well known work. I was very pleasantly surprised to find the book was like nothing else I have ever read.  I have lived in Scotland and have visited Jenner's department store in Edninburgh, as well as some of the other landmarks mentioned in the book. I can assure readers who have not been to Edinburgh that the descriptions and the characterizations are very real, for example, the rivalry between Edinburgh and Glasgow.  Although it may be difficult for non-Scots to fully appreciate certain elements of the book, the characters can be found practically anywhere and in any time. For example, the narcissistic Bruce and the class-conscious Sasha. I would highly recommend this book to anyone and especially homesick Scots.  I can hardly wait for the sequel 
 Why would anyone need a DVD changer?  It's not like anyone will put in 5 movies and then plop down on a couch and watch 10 hours in a row without wanting to get up.  Plus, it will not automatically play the DVD's.  You have to interact with it.  It takes time for the player to pull up the menu and then you have to tell it where to go (watch movie, scene selection, special features, set up, etc.).  The system will not automatically jump from DVD to DVD.  So why does anyone need a DVD changer?  The reason to buy a DVD/CD changer is for the CD function.  You can put in 5 CD's, press play and walk away.  You get a DVD/CD changer so you have a CD changer and it also plays DVD so you don't have to buy two different systems.  THE PROBLEM WITH THIS SYSTEM IS THAT IT IS MISSING ONE OF THE KEY CREITICAL FEATURES FOR GETTING A CHANGER IN THE FIRST PLACE.  This unit will not play in random mode across all of the discs.  Random mode only works on one CD at a time.  The whole reason to get a DVD/CD changer is to plop in 5 CD's, put it in random mode and get hours of music without having to do anything else.  Other than this gross error, it is the best DVD/CD changer on the market.  It has an HDMI output (which you only need if you have a newer HDTV) and it plasys almost every kind of DVD and CD made.  The best system to get is the Panasonic system if you have music by Roger Waters or the Grateful Dead.  It has an HDCD decoder for better sound and CD's by many groups come with the HDCD encoding. Then, Onkyo, Denon and Yamaha all have systems that will play CD's in a random mode.    DVD/CD changers are going out of style (because why would anyone need an DVD changer, and CD's are slowly becoming obsolete).  It used to be that every electronics company offered a couple of different models of DVD/CD changers.  Now, big names like Samsung, Pioneer and Philips (the inventor of CD's) don't offer even one.  Panasonic has just obsoleted its remaining model.  Now what you buy are DVD/VCR combos and DVD recorders 
 I read "Veronica Decides to Die", after reading "The Alchemist," "Eleven Minutes," and "The Zahir." The previous two I enjoyed tremendously, even through "The Alchemist" didn't strike me as original and groundbreaking as the people that recommended it to me had described it. Had I not had such high expectations, perhaps, reading it would have been more rewarding of an experience. Getting to the point, "Veronica Decides to Die" is yet another novel where he's reinforcing the theme that rules all of his books, the importance of appreciating life and treasuring each moment in life as the precious gift it is. It gets tedious at times, and I won't be the first to point out that the incessant borrowing of ideas is another obvious shortcoming. He introduces psychological disorders as a sort of a rebellion against society, as always, over-simplifying things in order to draw the reader to the "natural" philosophical conclusion. The problem is, this time Coelho doesn't quite succeed. 
 The Criterion Collection, a continuing series of important classic and contemporary films, is dedicated to gathering the greatest films from around the world and publishing them in editions that offer the highest technical quality and award-winning, original supplements.The foundation of the collection is the work of such(real) MASTERS of cinema as Renoir, Godard, Kurosawa, Cocteau, Fellini, Bergman, Tarkovsky, Hitchcock, Fuller, Lean, Kubrick, Lang, Sturges, Dreyer, Eisenstein, Ozu, Sirk, Bunuel, Powell and Pressburger.  The Criterion Collection must feel embarrassed for wasting  a tremendous amount of time in this glorious package to glorify the most incompetent of all filmmakers. I did not watch any of the extras, but I hope you can find there those hilarious TV- clips from the 70s with Welles crying like a baby...."Oh...They only let me do the movie I wanted to make in Kane.... 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 this guitar sucks don't be mad that's just what i'v heard in these reveiws. but of what i'v heard i would not waste money on this i would more likely get another one i'v seen it's item number is #638760 and it's really nice and has good reveiws and read this  From Toysrus.com & Amazon.com  From the Manufacturer The deluxe electronic guitar is 31" in length. It has 1 pick guard, output jack for external amplifier, 2 additional strings, 1 vintage-style single coil pickup, amplifier with 5 watt output and strap. Volume control, tone control, on/off switch, input jack, headphone jack, DC jack, 10 feet cable, carrying strap and carrying case  and it's the same price as this one, i don't know if it's just me but i would not buy this for a kid.. and i am a kid so i know what kids like and i really want this other one for christmas, so that might be just me but i don't kno 
 didnt care for this book.  Good information, but presented poorly.  I think there are better textbooks out there now that present information clearer and in less words and without crazy equations 
 First: The original Magic Flute is in German. This version is NOT !!  Second: The audio is not Dolby Digital, not even Prologic... Bad quality Third: Bad image quality....  I do NOT reccomend this version of Magic Flute.  I do not frequently review items I have bought, but I decided to review this one because everytime my kids ask me to watch this DVD, I remember what bad choice I've made... 
 I purchased this book because I am a new dog owner and because Cesar is so helpful on his show I thought the book would be too.  It's basically a story of his life.  Who cares?  I was looking for detailed ways to get my puppy to stop jumping, barking at the cat, get house broken, etc.  NOT a book talking about where Cesar grew up and how he came to America at the age of 21.  This book does nothing to help new dog owners train their dog.    In one section that tells you what needs to be done to break bad habits but doesn't explain how you go about breaking the habits.  For example, one chapter starts off saying "If you're dog does this how do you talk to them?  Do you yell?  Do you treat them like a baby?  Obviously you know this isn't working but you don't know how to talk to the dog to get results."  So I kept reading to find out how I should talk to and discipline my dog.  It never tells you how to go about talking to your dog.  Instead it talks about energy in dogs in the wild and human energy.  What difference does that make?  I have a boxer, not a wolf.  And as for discipline?  How is one supposed to discipline their dog?  Obviously you don't want to hit the dog or verbally abuse it but it never tells you what the proper discipline technique is.....just to discipline your dog.  It also says a lot to make your dog calm down before you feed them, when you get home from work, when you wake up, etc. so it's not acting like a raving lunatic and obeys you.  So please tell me how I get them to calm down?  It never tells you.  I was very disappointed in this book and wish I spent my money on another training book.  If you're looking for a book to help train your dog DON'T GET THIS BOOK 
 I was excited to read this book, and then  I read the first paragraph. This book is a horrible bore. But I have been forced to read it for summer reading. If your not required to read this book, Don't. 
 I've never taken an economics class in my life.  I'd always heard that economists spoke a different language than everyone else, and in some instances, lived on a different planet than everyone else.  After reading the very enjoyable "Freakonomics," I decided I might be wrong, because if "Freakonomics" was an example of what Economics is all about, then it was fascinating.  So I went in search of a book on Economics that would also be accessible to the layman, and came across "Hidden Order," which only reinforced my earlier stereotypes.  Despite a great opening chpater or two, I put the book down after 5 chapters, as each one became more incomprehensible than the last.  I have no doubt there is some very good information in this book.  Unfortunately, it's written in a mixture of English and "Economics-ese" -- just when you think you're close to understanding what Friedman is trying to get across, he throws in a chart and some terminology that makes everything incoherent.  On top of this, many of the examples and explanations he uses make absolutely no sense...at least no sense to anyone who lives in the real world.   Perhaps this book would be useful to someone who has taken an Econ class or two, but if you haven't, you'll simply find this book frustrating.  Thank goodness I checked it out of library and didn't have to pay for it 
 As curious as I was about this movie it had me dazed. The 'Good Shepherd' always struck me symbol for Christianity. Shepherds look after their flocks so the sheep can be killed and eaten. What's good about that? Fortunately, sheep don't have the intelligence to be paranoid. With Bourne Identity movies under his belt, Matt Damon has a good pedigree to play spy movies. Is this one a killer or dead on arrival? With a budget of $85m, we've got Oscar-winning actors, writers, cinematographers, and more stars than flocks by night ever get to see. Pet project of actor-turning-director, Robert De Niro, "The Good Shepherd" tells a story of the CIA from its early days, weighing in at just under three hours. The scene before the opening credits is the one which the whole movie revolves around once that's miss you won't get it. This is a shame, because it's a tantalisingly mysterious and artistically shot.  This movie is told from Damon's point of view, its scope is epic, and covering the years from 1939 before the CIA was even a speck in President Truman's eye, to 1961 and the Bay of Pigs. We see the founding years, the London Blitz, post-war reconstruction in Berlin, and increasingly intricate machinations as the Cold War gathers pace. Angelina Jolie doesn't feature in much of the movie, but when she does, she' get into character very well. It's enough to make you wish she would put down her excellent humanitarian work long enough to take on more of the challenging parts for which is so eminently capable.   Robert de Niro (got to love him), in the director's chair, is sadly the weakest link. Although he handles it professionally, almost magisterially, he lacks the experience to slowly build momentum, convey gradual moral decay, or make this the Godfather standard-bearer of CIA films. He's done a fine job - just bitten off a bit more than he can chew. What he deserves credit for is attempting a classic depiction of one of the world's most important institutions and pulling it off with considerable dignity; if not quite the artistic flourish that he would have aspired to, given that his mentors are people like Francis Ford Coppola (who is the executive producer). With sufficient dedication, it is easy to imagine De Niro pulling off an Oscar for direction in a future film: his grasp is very broad, and all it needs is a little tweaking. 
 oh please, however catchy the beats are do not call her music hip hop,for some one who has been listen to it for years, calling her music hip hop is an insult 
 I bought this frame to display pictures of my newborn daughter on my desk at work.  I didn't really have high expectations for it, because it was so inexpensive.  As soon as it was turned on I had the following problems:  1) Five seconds after I turn it on, it always says "USB Connected!"-- and I don't have a USB cable inserted into it!  This also freezes the device.  I found a way around this by selecting the memory card to read from within this initial 5 seconds or turning the frame on without any memory cards inserted.  2) I cannot copy files over to it as described in pages 33-35 of the manual.  My computer does recognize the USB device, but when I try to copy files over to the frame, I get a "path is not found" error.  3) I thought I could live with the above 2 problems if it could JUST SHOW MY PICTURES.  So I used a card reader to load .JPG files onto a CF card at 400x300 resolution. When, I plugged the card into the frame, these files show up as "Invalid" when I try to view them.  Emailed Coby with the 3 bullet points above, got a response 30 hours later saying:   "Coby Tech Support to me 5:25 am (3 hours ago)   Hello,  We have received your inquiry. It appears that your unit is defective. Return the unit to the retailer for an exchange."  What an inconvenience and disappointment.  I will be buying a different product 
 Unfortunately, this was one lackluster flick.  The Last Picture Show was great; Texasville just did not get off the ground. Too bad.  The cast was capable of something far better. If I had the DVD, I'd put it out where a garbage truck could run over it.  To put it out of its misery 
 Unless you are already an extreme right-wing fanatic, this book will make you puke. Who has caused a more extreme decline of morality in America that George W. Bush, the ultra-right Republicans who control that party and, therefore, the Congress, and the phony, hypocritical right-wing "Christian" movement, whose leaders are about as un-christian as you could possibly get? This nutcase makes Ann Coulter seem like a flaming liberal 
 I thought this book was very informative and easy to understand, good for anyone who has no clue around a kitchen 
 This was more like little tidbits from magazines that had been compiled into a book.  If you are looking for something light-hearted yet still gives useful information, read Vicky Iovine's "The Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy".  Thank goodness I only got this as a gift because it is not worth the money.  
 The book is not even statistical by scientific standarts. It is a vague collection of observations that tend to change every year. This book has lost more money than it has made for people. If you want to get serious about trading read Toby Crabel, read Linda Rashke. You don't like to pay money for their books? Don't expect a $30 book to tell you about making money. It takes thinking, hard labor and teachers like Toby Crabel 
 This book provides a cursory treatment of a deep subject.  At barely 250 pages of main body text--and they are small pages at that, set in a generous type--there is no room to go into detail on much of anything.  You will learn, perhaps, what a dataflow diagram or an IDEF0 frame is, but you will certainly not learn how to create or manipulate them, or much about how to use them, or their relative strengths and weaknesses, beyond the casual sentence or two about any given model in this book.  And, look, I love diagrams, but it seems like every third illustration is this book is a reprint or an absolutely trivial variation on the author's "EA Cube" overview diagram.  You can see it on the front cover--it's not exactly as complicated as the human nervous system.  Once or twice would have done it for me.  Shallow?  I slosh through deeper puddles on a rainy day.    But the shining feature of this book is the "case study" of a company adopting the particular flavor of Enterprise Architecture that Scott Bernard is trying to sell, something called EA3.  He follows this ficticious company through the entire course of the book, costing a substantial fraction of the already meager pagecount.  What would you expect such a case study to entail, dear reader?  Maybe some process diagrams, data entity schemas, architecture documents...you know, an ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE for the example company?  Sadly, the joke is on us.  None of this is forthcoming.  The "case study" consists almost entirely of descriptions of meetings where everybody talks about the wonderful things they're going to do with this new enterprise architecture, followed by more meetings where everybody congatulates each other on the wonderful things they've just done thanks to enterprise architecture.  Like the rest of the book, there is just no "there" there.  Actual models?  No room!  Sample documents?  No time!  Any business school or MIS student who tried to hand in this pollyanna sales pitch as a "case study" would only get an F because the grade scale doesn't go to "G."  Perhaps the only value in this book is that, if read critically, it will teach you a great deal about why "Enterprise Architecture" has such a poor reputation in certain sectors of industry today.  I really think that a lot of EA is about self-aggrandizement on the part of IT professionals, who think the entire business should revolve around their pretty diagrams and three-ring binders.  We in the IT community need to get our minds right: we are here to support and enable the business, not impede it or, worse, subordinate it to its tools.  If something like Enterprise Architecture is good for business, then we need to find ways to do it that don't involve saying to the people we are supposed to be helping: "Wait!  Stop what you're doing and redefine everything you do according to MY methodology!"  Read the first five pages of the "case study" in this book to see the new CIO do EXACTLY THAT.  He should have been laughed out of the boardroom.    
 Gucci Mane. It's hard to believe how wack this album is, but I'm going to try and justify my opinion in this review. Let me state from the beginning that I wanted to like Gucci Mane going into this release. As a fan of Jeezy, and after hearing many people compare Gucci's style to Jeezy's, I went into this release expecting an emcee similar to Young Jeezy. I admit to having a certain soft spot for trap-rap, and was expecting, at the very least, mediocre rhymes about hustling, cooking, and chopping backed by some top-notch production. Dissapointing is an understatement.  Gucci Mane is similar to Young Jeezy in that he has a very slow, droning flow, and often raps about, well, crack. The differences between Jeezy and Gucci Mane are very obvious to the trained ear; while Southern rap haters may write them both off as the same emcee, fans of Jeezy can easily pick up on Gucci's flaws. First, the charisma is rarely there. Gucci sounds very bored behind the mic, and rarely puts any energy into his rhymes; you'd think that all his legal troubles, and the desire to be on a major-label would've made Gucci hungry, but he sounds so uninspired throughout most of the album. Although this may sound blasphemous to most hip-hop heads, Gucci also lacks Jeezy's depth; yes, Jeezy DOES have depth. While Jeezy can offer us tracks like "Sky's The Limit," "Soul Survivor," "Dreamin'," and "The Inspiration," Gucci doesn't bring any of that to the table. While Jeezy is also all-hood, at the very least, he can bring forth some of the negative aspects of it. Despite the fact that Gucci was mugged, murdered someone out of self-defense, is involved in a beef with a rapper selling over dozens more than him, and was nearly sentenced to life in prison, it's still all good to Gucci.   The production is also very, very poor; something Jeezy certainly can't say. While Young Jizzle has a million-dollar budget, and an all-star cast of producers on both his albums, Gucci Mane, whether due to limited budget or just poor beat selecting, does not have this same support on this album. With better production found throughout, this album could've at least been booted up to two stars; as it stands, the only beats that even sound half decent on this album are the Nitti-produced "Go Head" and the simplistic, yet hypnotizing "Trap Starz." These two tracks also bring out a bit more carefree approach in delivery from Gucci, showing that, had he been presented with better beats, he could've also stepped up his rap game.  I've never heard Trap House, so I can't judge Gucci on that. His sophomore album, if it really does show growth as others have suggested, has motivated me to continue keeping my distance from it. I won't suggest that this album doesn't have room to grow on me; after all, I gave The Inspiration a two-star review, and it has since become one of my most-listened to albums over time. Gucci Mane, no matter how much I may appear to be hating on him in this review, still has potential; given a better soundscape, I know he could release a better effort than Hard to Kill. While I won't doubt that I could end up liking this six months down the road, it still doesn't change the quality of this album at the time being. 
 Ancient Sanctuary throws lots of unique cards at us.  First, Fairy decks start to rise from the junk pile in the corner of your room.  Zombies finally have an 1800 attacker.  Machines have a mean burn monster.  The rares are something else.  Soul Resurrection is a Call of the Haunted except the monster goes into defence mode.  And it's only a rare! There is also Blowback Dragon, who like his brother, Barrel Dragon, has the same effect.  Instead of destroying monsters only, Blowback destroys ANY card on the field.  Zaborg the Thunder Monarch is also a plus to this set, destroying any monster on the field when summoned.  I got this 5 set and got Gear Golem, the Moving Fortress, Enemy Controller, Draining Shield, Zaborg the Thunder Monarch and Avatar of the Pot.  In other words, buy it.  This is worth the money 
 Grisham's worst book by far.  90% of the story is preaching to the reader that homeless people just have bad luck and are good guys.  It would be ok if that was woven into a good story, but it is not.   For great Grisham read The Firm and The Partner.  For very good, read Runaway Jury and Pelican Brief.  All of these are page turners.  Street Lawyer is a stomache turner.  Really bad.  What happened 
 I was forced to read this drivel for a graduate photo program. God I wanted to kill myself and quit photography by the time I was finished with it. If you want to read great photographic essays try Bill Jay's work. Amazing, insightful and filled with a sense of humor 
 Unfortunately, instead of an thorough analysis of the genesis, justifications, and problems with overarching property rights, DeLong acts as a mouthpiece for other property rights activists.  DeLong covers some of the same ground as Congressman Richard Pombo in his 1996 This Land Is Our Land, simply emphasizing anomalous examples instead of practicable solutions.  DeLong's denial of the externalities resulting from uninhibited development leave his analysis unbalanced and ill-founded.  DeLong's politics overcome his analysis.  This book is similar to his condemnation of industry for their recognition to the denial of carbon dioxide emissions.  (...)  His political agenda overwhelm his rational 
 I started to give a review in "deconstructionist" fashion - blather on about architecture surpassing old notions of "in" and "our", of reason giving way to the Neitzhien Uberwill, of absurd interpretations of text, relative yet "ultimate" truth and the unholy trinity of angst, subconscienceness and desire.   I was afraid, though, that it would be taken seriously by students (quote unquote) of post-modern "thought".  The danger of deconstructionism is undeniable. When literature and music are culturally interpreted, ethics are situational, when one speaks of slavery as freedom or humanity as inhumanity, we are lost in a sea of intellectual flotsam.  The personal connections to fascism - Heidegger, Paul de Man, Blanchot, Bataille - can be overlooked. The intellectual similarities can't: The supremacy of  will (Nietzsche) over reason and logic ("homogenising"), an obsession with emotion and political discourse, the celebration of the group over the individual (identity politics) and the idea that truth is what the critic, dictator or prophet says it is. Deconstructionism is, needless to say, popular among folks favoring modern "intellectual" movements with fuzzy tenets.   Here, he speaks to us eliptically (of course) as he partakes in the familiar one step forward - two steps backward approach. But if one follows Deconstructionism, why can't HIS writings be interpreted as an S&M fantasy or a desire to be a Greek Orthodox priest in drag?  How do we know what he really means since he suggests that we often write exactly opposite of what we mean?.  He writes of God, death, solitude, life and sacrifice BUT in a new voice of existentialism and doubt.  He employs vague, self-defined and self-referential terms which  effectively shield him from serious study.   Derrida, for all his rampant explicating, gets hot under the collar when his own words undergo the deconstruction challenge.  Few have questioned his writings since (1) many are impossible to understand and (2) they may or may not mean what they say. What began as a new approach to literature has evolved into the language of intellectual totalitarianism. No one denies his extensive knowledge of Western literature; what galls are the bewieldering interpretations and his ironic attempt at building a new ethos based on syllogism.  As another reviewer stated, take it slow, read several times, search for meaning even when there is none 
 I have to admit that I did like the book, in terms of the writing style.  However, the ending was so abrupt and unbelievable.  I wanted to know what happened with their relationship after those first five minutes back together.  Also, I think Matt should have ended up with Holly, since he spent more time with her than the heroine of the book!  Are we really supposed to believe that he's in love with Josie after everything he did with Holly?!?!  You can probably tell that I was annoyed by this book A LOT, but it was funny 
 These are, for the most part, slight pieces, a somewhat haphazard collection mostly lacking thematic unity. By slight, I mean that Shermer did not provide me with much new information or many new insights into old information.  There's an account of his experience impersonating a variety of psychics; an attempt at a Darwinian interpretation of the mutiny on the "Bounty" which adds nothing, really, to what's been known for years; a thirteen-page essay called "Exorcising Laplace's Demon" in which Laplace appears only in the final paragraph; a series of top-whatever lists gathered from here and there for no very clear reason. And so on.  I would have saved myself a good deal of time if I had gone straight to page 173 ("The New New Creationism") and left it at that. This piece provides a ten-point rebuttal of the Intelligent Design argument that is useful for those of us who don't know much about this latest metamorphosis of creationism.  But by then Shermer's credibility was so damaged that even this piece I approach warily. Shermer the skeptic is so error-prone that his unintended effect is to make me skeptical of everything he says. His introduction indicates that many of these pieces have been previously published. This I find astonishing. The first chapter alone contains so many serious grammar errors that had Shermer submitted it when he was a high-school senior, at least where I grew up at about the same time period, he would have forfeited his diploma.  I'm not a scientist, and so when I find a science writer telling me that malaria is transmitted by "a virus-infested mosquito" (try "parasite" and "infected"); that helicobacter pylori is also a virus; that "flagella" is singular, I have to wonder what other nonsense is getting past me. Evidently fact checkers and proof readers have gone extinct.  In general, Shermer's essays lack structure, focus, and creative insight. To be an essayist is to be a type of poet. An accomplished essayist - Oliver Sacks, for example -  takes an idea, a fact, an observation perhaps, and in elegant, graceful language explores it, expands it, teases it out until we are astonished and delighted by the insights, the connections, and by a new way of seeing our world. This is an art, and Michael Shermer, sadly, is only a fledging artist 
 This is Prof. Annas' second contribution to this series, her first being A Short Introduction to Ancient Philosophy.  This one does not measure up to the first.  Some of the weaknesses of "Ancient Philosophy" are more evident in "Plato", while the strengths are lacking.  My first beef with Prof. Annas is trivial, but annoying, and that is her insistance that the traditional English language usage for the third person impersonal discriminates against females.  In order to counter this supposed disrespect of females, she creates opportunities to plunk down a "she" or a "her" where a "one" or "it" or "he" would normally be expected.  An example:  Annas writes, "Someone who wins the lottery, for example, may well not be made any happier by just having the money.  Unless she puts it to intelligent use, the money may do nothing for her, or even ruin her life."  So, we were talking about the relationship of money to happiness, when suddenly the topic changes to gender politics.  Why not just say, "Unless the money is put to intelligent use, it may contribute nothing to happiness, and may even ruin one's life", and leave gender politics out of it?  I purchased this book in order to learn about Plato, not to deal with Julia Annas' feminist complexes.  She is excessively agnostic about the order of composition of the Platonic dialogues, dismisses with little discussion the internal evidence for a sequence, and its implications for the reconstruction of a picture of the historic Socrates.  My complaint is not that she disagrees, but that she doesn't discuss the issue, which seems to be an important one in studies of Plato.  And she really doesn't get to the meat of Socrates' irony and method of inquiry.  She devotes an entire chapter to sex and gender issues, only to then dismiss Plato thus:  "By this point, studying Plato has little to contribute to modern feminist discussion:  his starting points and many of his assumptions are too remote from ours for him to be a profitable partner in debate for very long."  If that's true, why did we just spend an entire chapter, 14 percent of a very short book, on the subject?  The remainder of the book is taken up with superficial discussions of Plato's views of virtue, the soul, and metaphysics, and ends with a rousing statement of the obvious:  "For in the end, his deepest message is not that we should believe in Forms, or the importance of virtue, but that we should engage with him, and with our own contemporaries, in aspiring to understand these matters."  I finished her Short Introduction to Ancient Philosophy stimulated to read more.  By contrast, reading this book left me with the opposite feeling, that reading more by Annas would be frustrating and a waste of time. 
 Normally, I find it hard to put a Sue Grafton book down once I get started. Not the case with "S". I did not enjoy the plot about Violet and her abusive husand.  The main character Violet was too much of a stereotype - boobs, red hair, just a boozing slut over all.  I didn't get the whole thing about her brother and why he disliked her. The ending wasn't clear either. I did like the development of the relationships with the young girls exposing jealousy and how it ruined relationships over several decades. Most of the characters just weren't that interesting overall.  I missed her interactions with Rosie the restaurant owner and her neighbor, the handsome 80 year old baker Henry. Usually, there is an interesting man in the picture too - not here.  I would vote pass on this one. 
 I strongly disliked this movie very much. It was educational, and I guess you can't criticize true stories, but the ending was terrible. It should have gone on to explain where the bodies were buried or where they were out or what happened to the rest of their extended family? I did not like this movie at all 
 This book crossed my path three times.  First was my undergrad thermo course, as a prescribed text.  I thought it was a little wordy but the verbosity did not contribute to my understanding.  The more they tried to explain the concepts (e.g., on Kelvin's and Clausius' statements of the second law of thermodynamics), the more confusing they became.  Needless to say, I didn't do too well.  That, however, is another story.  The second time was in my masters studies, and I was the TA for an undergrad thermo course (go figure).  I used this book for used examples and exercises for my students.  But it still didn't change my opinion on it.  Locating anything on thie text would take forever because one would have to peel through layers of words.    The third time, and also the last (hopefully) is in my Ph.D. programme.  I was flipping through the pages on the advanced topics (Maxwell's relations, Clapeyron's equation, etc.,etc.).  Their treatment were simply too trivial, and, with the lack of depth, I promptly put it back to the shelf.  Moran and Shapiro are, no doubt, authorities on thermodynamics, and I respect them very much, as experts in their area.  In their writing, it is quite clear that, they assume understanding can be achieved by loading concepts with words, the more the merrier.  In my opinion, if is more effective to go through the major concepts succinctly and formally, and go through their implications in more detail.  I think, this book fails utterly it this respect.  On the merit of its extensive collection of examples and exercises, I only recommend this book as supplemental.  As anything beyond that, however, the shear amount of diction alone will spell frustration for the novice, and redundance for the adept.  Finally, I think Cengel, and Holman do a much better job presenting the concepts at a beginner's level.  For the advanced topics (sans stat. mech. and quantum), I would opt for Callen, and Hatsopoulos and Keenan (if you can get your hands on it), with the latter as a reference.  Finally, for statistical and quantum mechanics, I would recommend Carter for a starter, and Atkins (Physical Chemistry) will do very well to fill the holes 
 I have bought this cartridge from the store and then ordered them online to save money but it ended up costing me!  I only was able to print about 1/2 the pictures I normally can print.  Will NEVER order them online again 
 This book is a great disappointment.  I forced myself to continue on thru the first 300 pages and now I am getting rid of it.  What of waste of my precious reading time 
 I started the Full series a few years back when I needed an Evanovich fix between Plum books. I loved the first 3, after that I can't say they have lived up to my expectations.  This latest is the worse of all, it reminds of the 180 page romance novels of the early 70's, you know the ones you'd 6 of every month in the mail? Juvenile and unrealistic, sorry Janet but this one is a stinker for those of us used to the great Stephanie Plum novels and even the Barnaby series. Lorelei King does her best, but even a great reader can't help this book 
 DeMille has done a rotten job with this book.  Aspects of the plot(which isn't too bad) are never resolved.  If you must read this badly written book, wait until it goes on sale. 
 After waiting 3 years since Shutter Island for DL's next book, this collection of short stories and a play came as a major disappointment. Might DL have a writer's block problem? Some of the stories are quite good, except ICU, which is a failed attempt at being kafkaesque. But they don't add up to a book. DL should have written a few more for a more solid collection. The play is just plain bad. The scenes based on "Gwen" are so much weaker than the story. Filling it up with the triangle scenes and the doctor/patient scenes doesn't make it a real play. It is still just a collection of scenes. The dialogues are sometimes miserably juvenile, reminding me of high school efforts at drama. The father/son war of the Gwen-story does not bear being stretched anyway, the man's badness is so overdone, it ought to stay tucked away in a short story. I think the best of the stories is "Gone down to Corpus". That is also juvenile, but in the sense of looking at young people who are feeling hopeless. Convincing, and very "economical", as the cover blurb announces. Economical probably stands for very short. "Running out of Dog" is a very violent and very bloody, well constructed story about another hopeless situation: when hope comes late to a man, it is dangerous. That's the aphorism around which it is constructed. Some more like these, and I would have given more stars 
 This book is good on Italian Fascism, weak and even defective on other fascist movements, especially National Socialism, and contains a 33 page misprint, the worst I have ever experienced. Taking these topics in inverse order, I will start with the fact that my copy had a 33 page misprint.  After page 456, the Bibliography suddently starts, then ends, page 489 starts next, and then the Bibliography starts over again. Early on in the book, I detected a definite bias on the part of the author against fascism in general and National Socialism in particular.  The portions dealing with National Socialism were clearly defective, omitting to mention some of the early authors of the ideology and giving misleading interpretations of other developers of the ideology of National Socialism. The author's main strength is with Italian Fascism and he should have limited the scope and title ! ! of the book to that arena.  The Italian Fascist subject is covered thoroughly.  If you are interested in Italian Fascism and don't mind missing 33 pages of text, I would recommend the book 
 Some good ideas on driving innovation, but in hindsight, some of the cited companies haven't passed muster if one tracks their long term business performance.  One of my favorite quotes from the book - "At Enron, failure - even of the type that ends up on the front page of The Wall Street Journal - doesn't necessarily sink a career".  Yeah right!  This kind of thinking puts one in jail 
 Feldman's "well-researched" book is a classic human development book, written from a rich white man's view. He does very little to express race and gender as anything but biology. These two things are sociological constructs in addition to being somewhat biologically based. In my world, half-truths are still lies. This book has a lot of pictures of people from different cultures, with different phenotypes, et cetera. It does not walk the walk or talk the talk of a socially responsible take on human development and psychology. For instance he uses Freud to speak of gender roles- a man who named an entire stage of human development after the penis. Just a poor read overall. It felt like going back to high school biology class. Not much more than a survey book 
     Having heard great reviews about this book, I chose it for my book discussion group. Bad move ! It took half the book for the author to quit whining about Annie and get on the road.  Then all he seemed interested in was women and sex.  The destinations were not brought to life.  If he had spent half the time describing places that he put into describing women, it could have been a decent book.  I never expected, from the concept of this book, that he would be such an incessant whiner about Annie, Annie, Annie.  In my opinion, Annie made a very intelligent choice when she decided not to go through with the wedding.  Don't waste your time with this one.  
 Undoubtedly, felons who commit heinous crimes deserve to be sentenced to death. There is no argument there. In my view, child molestors, murderers and rapists have forfeited their legal right to live in our society. It should be stressed that a gruesome deed must not be justified under any circusmtances; if a malefactor has had a difficult childhood this cannot excuse let alone justify his actions. This is irrefutable! As is well-known, psychopaths are usually cunning, insidious, manipulative, narcissistic and charming. Moreover, they are unable to feel guilt and remorse. Rehabilitation is effective in some cases but in most cases it does not work. Notorious felons are known to relapse into criminality upon release. Psychopaths can often deceive their psychiatrists because they are manipulative and shrewd. Therefore, capital punishment is the most effective punishment next to life sentence 
 A very attractive kettle but the plastic holder on the lid broke off in a matter of a few months.  This is not a particularly sturdy kettle.  Not recommended 
 If I had know that this was a small book with only 22 pages and not about the For Better or For Worse family I would not have bought it , not worth the $8.95 
 Even Bob's many building talents could not deal with this problem.  We could not be more disappointed.  Like the previous reviews say, it falls apart constantly.  You cannot play with one area without having your child ask you to fix some other part that has just collapsed or doesn't fit properly.  This was a waste of money.  I expected better given that the actual character vehicles are a lot hardier and can withstand alot more play 
 Emotion and Evolution were CD's with a bit of an edge to them.  Her gutsy rhythm section and the simple guitar work on those albums gave her voice room to soar.    I think they were Martina's best work.  The single "Anyway" promised so much, but from what I am hearing on this album, it sounds very over produced.  It has range and polish . . . but no depth  . . . sorry all, but I am disappointed.   I believe she has gotten too involved in the production 
 According to the IMDB this movie is the first one specifically made for PC downloading...it shows.  Without any creative vision at all; horrible lighting, acting and editing and a confusing, muddled storyline, INCUBUS is everthing a bad horror movie should be.  Tedious.  Stupid.  And just not worth it, folks 
 I'm a retired attorney. I enjoy crime novels and the movies that bring them to us visually. However, this movie simply is a pain to watch, IF one enjoyed the drama of the book. The book "Blood Work" is very detailed and the solution to the "who done it" is very well hidden. I won't bore you with details but if you want to know how the movie compares with the novel, read the review by "km southern" dated Oct 19, 2004, that is available below. She is right on. The movie has so many flaws that even without having read the book upon which it purports to be based, it is a poor choice 
 Superficial coverage and questionable advice. Book is aimed at total novices...if you've used a Mac for a while, you probably know this stuff. And DO repair permissions to avoid problems: Apple and most Mac techs will tell you so 
 LOL!  Christ!  What in God's name was Patterson thinking?  I read this book because I've been trying to check out new authors.  I fell in love with John Sandford's "Prey" novels recently, and on impulse, I picked up Hide and Seek since Patterson is supposed to be so great and I'd heard so much about him.   Boy!  What a disappointment and what a bad first impression!  The book read like one of those Lifetime Movies of the Week.  Basically Maggie Bradford is this woman who has had nothing but bad luck with men.  Husband #1 Beat her, she kills him in self defense.  She later becomes this world class singer . . .even Barbara Streisand pops up in the book to praise her music.  She finally finds true love. . .he dies suddenly.  While this is going on, we get to find out about the second main character a world class athlete named Will Shephard who just happens to be a psycho. . .and yes, you guessed it, she ends up marrying him.  The book is told from two perspectives: 1st Person when the book is focused on Maggie(she's telling you all about her crappy life), and then it switches to 3rd Person whenever the book focuses on Will.  I won't go any further I don't want to spoil it for people unfortunate enough to get around to reading this trite, contrived, soap opera novel that is utterly laughable.  It's sad when the main character is an abused woman and you just don't care about her.  AT ALL.  Oh, and Patterson, what's up with the 100 or so 3 page chapters that this book has?  
 Early on the author tells how he proved to concept of "learned helplessness" through his experiments where he administered electric shocks on caged dogs until they gave up and just lay there and whimpered.  I threw the book away at that point.  This "scientist" shouldn't be rewarded for his senseless cruelty that proves nothing.  We don't support your science, Herr Doctor Seligman!  Get the book from a library if you must, but don't reward him for his "experiments."  It could have been your dog this moral idiot experimented on 
 OK, this is where I got off the SY bandwagon once and for all. Jet Set Etc. was bad enough, but this was the pits, and I wasn't going to sit around pretending that these languid, aimless ditties had any worth (of course with the usual caveat - The Diamond Sea is amazing). This was a once great and powerful band whose creative faculties had utterly dried up, and this is from a huge erstwhile fan. So I just tuned SY out of my life for over a decade, til a friend recently lent me Sonic Nurse and I found they had inexplicably found a new lease on creative life. Anyway, the 2 stars are for Diamond Sea, the rest of the album is sonic (and lyric) garbage 
 This DVD is a good way to see what Houdini looked like.  That's it for the positive side of this review.  The story is ridiculous, Houdini does no magic and only one escape.  That escape is so poorly photographed, however, that it appears as he is doing nothing more than rolling about on the ground to escape the "wet sheet" tie that was used in insane asylums at the time.  This film flopped at the theatres, and it seems obvious why - this is a vanity piece, ignoring the magic and escapes that made Houdini famous 
 This book can be summarized in about 3 sentences:  1.  Don't be egocentric.  2.  Don't be mean.  3.  Don't be dumb.  I'm very sorry I wasted the money on this, and even more sorry that some of the money will go to Ben Stein.  
 I ordered this teapot because at the time it came with a free tea infuser. When it arrived, the teapot was broken, with a large section missing from the side. I returned it and had to pay the shipping to the company to reorder the same item after I received a refund only for the items price. After receiving my second teapot, it was cracked in the exact same spot. I returned the product and complained with no response. I was refunded the price for the teapot, but I am out $10 in the cost of shipping. It seems highly unlikely that two teapots would break in the exact same spot, so I would try a different product. 
 Guess I'm in the minority about this, but this PLAY (NOT a MOVIE) left me thinking that I wasted my money.  I enjoyed Madea, she is a great character.  I never seem to care about the rest of the people or their problems. For me the only thing funny about it was when Madea took the stage, the rest of it was simply boring 
 There is absolutely no information about printer drivers in this book. The explanation about the printing process is so skimpy that you can't tell that it is wrong 
 Pros: Great resolution. Nice packaging. Excellent door stop.  Cons: Stopped working after 3 weeks. Horrible overall quality. No customer support what so ever since I didn't have a receipt (ebay purchase).   Tried contacting the ebay seller for receipt, never got a response now I'm stuck with a 360 dollar dead weight.  Tried contacting pacificdigital they offered a none warranty repair for $199.  Becareful what you purchase on ebay specially pacificdigital products. 
 It's almost always sad and is certainly always instructive to see living myths die. The Woodward of "All the President's Men" was just such a living myth. Like all myths, the Woodward myth does serve a purpose. In this case, the purpose is highlighting our societal belief that the truth is worth fighting for, that uncovering the truth can make a difference, and that a couple of young guys in cheap suits with the right ideas and a little extra chutzpah can even take on the President of the United States...and win. Of course that Woodward never truly existed and the real Woodward has always had to live under the shadow of the myth that bears his name. Honestly, I don't envy...even if he is proverbially crying all of the way to the bank.  What's scary with a living myth, though, is when people confuse the real person and the myth and assume that the carnal hero actually has the powers that the myth suggests. I recall having a conversation with a good friend not long after Woodward published "Bush at War". Although this friend is among the most innately intelligent people I know, is a strong liberal, and was initially opposed to the war in Iraq, she was still caught in the sway of the Woodward myth and reading "Bush at War" had convinced her that the Bush administration was both cautious and thoughtful in its lead up to the war. When I asked her how she could so easily change her mind, her response was that, "This is Bob Woodward...not some right-wing hack." Although I think it's somewhat unfair to refer to Woodward as either right wing or as a hack. I'm afraid that he is much closer to these two appellations than he is to the myth that has been created around him.  The sooner people realize this, the better it will be for all of us. The real Bob Woodward has been veiled for too long by his mythic aura. It's about time that this veil is lifted for all of us to see the real Woodward. I think the Bob Woodwards of the world, real and mythic, are quite instructive. As time passes, I hope the fictional Woodward can continue to inspire young reporters to tilt at windmills...and I hope the real Bob Woodward story helps us realize that both valor and value are fleeting and that you stop being a champion once you've joined the mill 
 The entire book is devoted to most unusual vases which would be used by very few people. The actual floral designs used do not require a great deal of creativity 
 I owned Samsung T809 months ago and I was very frustrated because the bluetooth doesn't work well, sometimes it has connection (bluetooth) but most of the time it doesn't work.  Yeah! it's a good looking cellphone but not a friendly user one. 
 This book is an expensive waste of money. Carefully read all the reviews below and you'll have gotten the gist of the book's contents... about 5 pages of useful info padded out to 172 pages.   Even better, buy and absorb Ian Rowland's Full Facts Book of Cold Reading at ianrowland dot com which will tell you everything in this book and more in straight English without all the pseudoscience and NLP hocus pocus.   Regardless, if you are a poor listener, you aren't looking for a book to improve yourself. And if you think you need a book about being a good listener, you probably already are a pretty good one. 
 I'm not a big fan of Maddox. The beginning of the book is funny and got me interested to read more. I was disappointed to see the rest of the book to be predictable and boring, if not it would be just plain stupid 
 I must be the only one who didn't like this book.  I felt it was written in a one-tone, endless stream of the bad events and bad people in her life.  Not one good thing or good person.  Didn't pack any emotional wallop because she didn't seem to react to the bad things that happened to her.  Now maybe she had to be that way in order to survive, but it didn't make for interesting reading.  It was hard to sympathize with her because she had no reaction herself to all these traumas.  It's unbelievable that she and her sister turned out as well as they did, but I found myself not caring about them and therefore, not caring about this book 
 I'm the wife of the poster above who thought the book was so awesome.  I agree that the book made some good points and offered a ton of good explanations for why it's so hard for men and women to resolve relationship issues.  I also offer a word of warning.  Take the advice offered with a grain of salt.  From what I can see, the author is giving both men and women a way out of acting like adults and taking responsibility for their own actions.  You can't just talk to your spouse or treat them any kind of way and justify it because you feel you've been "wronged" due to clouded perception from fear/shame .  It's not your spouse's responsibility to learn to control these emotions.  Anything your spouse says can be misinterpreted through the cloud of fear/shame/inadequacy/anxiety/guilt and every other emotion you want to toss into the pot.  I am not wrong every time something I say or do stimulates a negative emotion in my spouse and the same goes for him.  This is a learned response that is no one's fault.  If you have this response, it's up to you to control your reaction to it...not your spouse's.  It's also not your spouse's responsibility to read your mind...which is what this book advocates (without saying it, of course).  Any psychologist will tell you that mind reading is BAD.  But if your spouse won't tell you what's wrong out of fear of shame, what else are you left to do? What happens when you're wrong and it's not a fear/shame response? You're left to assume too much when communication is taken out of the picture.  No matter how uncomfortable it is, good communication skills are vital to a relationship.  No, women don't ALWAYS have to nag to get their point across and men don't ALWAYS have to avoid to keep from getting dumped on.  This book reminds me of an infomercial that takes human incapability to the extreme (we just can't help ourselves, brain chemicals and all) and THIS BOOK has the answer!  The book also has a few other surprises at the end. One of them concerning sex.  I could write a whole other review on that alone.  Again, take this advice with a grain of salt.  I've been married for 5 1/2 years and I have to tell you that no matter how wonderful my dear husband thinks this book is...none of that is gonna fly in this house.  I think the author had good intentions and there is some good information given, which is why I gave the book 2 stars.  But in my honest opinion, I say, save the money that you were going to spend on this book and put it toward a copay for a good psychotherapist 
    ... if you wish to clutter your home with silly objects in vitriolic color combinations.  
 Worthless. Motor is loud and heating not noticable. In 10 minutes hot water became luke warm 
 After book 4 the series begins to meander around.  Characters are constantly side-tracked into meaningless, boring tasks.  The first 200-300 pages of this book are basically a re-hash of the previous books only excitement (Rand's capture and escape from the "bad witches") seen from different characters perspectives.  This is an example of what writing becomes when the author obviously has no idea of where the story is going, and there obviously is little or no editing.  The author must being paid by the word count and not the content.  The story seems to get written into little boxes, and has to be written back on track again and again.  I no longer have the patience to actually read each page.  I find myself skimming through to find some useful information or a single point of action.  The characters have also stalled out with Rand spending most of his time talking to him-self while the world goes to hell.  His big secret plan to quickly deal with one of the forsaken (started in the previous book) continues to drag on and on and on.....  This series had a good basic story.  Unfortunately you have to wade through crap to try and find it.  I'm beginning to wonder if the series will ever end 
  Yes, this is the great PBBB's 3rd album, but it's not the CD you should be buying.  This domestic CD was released in 1989 and has never been remastered.    The import 2CD version of this title (backed with the PBBB's 4th "In My Own Dream") is the one to get.  It was remastered in 2004.  Ditto for "The Paul Butterfield Blues Band" & "East West"; the 2004 import 2CD is also remastered (and sounds incredible) and the domestic CD's are not.  Why WEA and Elektra have not made these four remasters available domestically is a mystery.  Don't waste your money on these inferior versions: Get the imports 
 This has to be one of the worst productions in the history of music.  There comes a time when a person should really take a long, hard look to see if it is time to hang it up. For Babs, that time has come.  The good thing is that I have the answer to her introspective undertaking - STOP SINGING NOW!!  
 This was the first book by this author that I had started to read. Perhaps, that was my first mistake. I truly did not like this book -- the characters, the plot, the overall language in the book -- all disgusted me. I could not bring myself to finish the book. If the rest of this author's books, are anything like this one, I think I will be avoiding this author's work 
 Connie Willis has done 100 times better with humor in Bellwether.  Thankfully, the book is short because not much ever really happens.  There are minor surprises and discoveries along the way but I hoping something  exciting would happen and was disappointed 
 This book was required reading my first year in college. It eneded up consuming the entire year in a depessing and dire atmosphere. Every class we talked about the book, it's themes, it's techniques.  Never once did anyone dare to say they disliked the story. How could you say you disliked a personal story about the Holocaust and the ending in which she relays to the entire world that she is homosexual. You couldn't voice an oppinion against this at the risk of being "A Nazi" or a "Homophobe".  I'm risking that to tell every person here that this story was terrible. It was about the author harassing her Holocaust surviving parents over and over again about their terrible ordeal. They wanted to have it in the past, over with, gone, and forgotten. The memories were too hard to dredge up and frankly they were none of their daughter's business. BUT the author Sherlock's the information and writes this book. She then said in the end that she was homosexual when this information had nothing to do with the story. The entire book was a way to "come out" with all the stress on her parents and none on herself.  This indeed was a sad story, but because of the desparate and self centered needs of the author. It's easy to have a best seller when you make your subject matter a taboo subject to disagree with.   Read it if you want and form your own opinions. This is just mine. 
 We recommend not buying this game, unless you don't mind a buggy version that is not supported by Hasbro and can't be fixed.  Hasbro has decided not to support the game and the patches at the website are no longer available.  Save your money and wait for the next one, hopefully bug free 
 I was saddened after reading this collection of articles.  These authors display some of the most dreadful examples of eisegesis I have ever seen.  Throughtout history people of all stripes have attempted to use Scripture to justify their view or cause and this is yet another example.  An honest objective study of history, Biblical languages, along with a simple reading of the words of Scripture prove this book to be nothing more than wishful thinking on the part of another group who earnestly seeks legitimacy from Christianity 
 This book should have been marketed more for casual readers or non-biologists. I bought it after only reading the dust-cover info. and the table of contents. My mistake. If you need a book for a biochemistry class related to abiogenesis, this is not your book. Besides the lack of detail in the processes of life formation, Hazen mentions way too many names. It's nice to know the names of the major players but he throws out so many that I'm tempted to think the honorably mentioned paid him or he wrote this to pay off a debt to them. Read it and you'll even get to learn the names of some of the grads and undergrads that worked in various labs. Boring! Hazen creates too much drama with the details of setting up an experiment when he should be dealing with the results. He tries too hard to make science sound fun and cool, when realisticaly those reading this book will already have a passion for science. The only biology educated folks that should buy this are undergrads that want to know what research is like.     
 'A Different Universe' really is a complete waste of time. Most of the anecdotes are dull. The book has no direction, and you can find all of the 'science' and more in the three and a half page article:  Laughlin and Pines, PNAS vol. 97 pp.28-31 (2000) 
 The New Page edition of this book is a true piece of cr*p! Every single page has multiple typographical errors, obviously deriving from shoddy proofreading of the text they scanned. I thought I could deal with it, but it reached the point where it was distracting, so I ordered the Dover edition instead. I was an idiot not to get that one in the first place. Don't repeat my mistake 
 I hate to say it.  This book provides very basic information that lacks depth and the insider viewpoint I expected.  The limited info that did scratch slightly deeper than the surface centered on the cities of Phoenix and Tucson.  Other cities such as Flagstaff, Sedona and Winslow were barely mentioned.  I found this book of little real value to someone serious about Moving to Arizona 
 Long-time Waits fan here, with several of his albums being on my all-time favorites list. I owned this album for nearly a year, before I traded it in. It took me a while to figure out why I always wandered out of the room after a few songs and forgot about it--because it s--ks. The lyrics  either are incoherent, just strung together (eg Get Behind Mule), or veer off into the cringingly sentimental (eg House Where Nobody Lives, Chocolate Jesus). The music mostly drags, when it's not downright grating. He's lost it. You can't blame him for not knowing it, I guess. But it's long past time to write him off--since Bone Machine. (The stage works Black Rider, Alice, and Blood Money, show a consistent weakness--a lack of focus lyically as well as musically, not to mention a lot of low fi recording. I had a similar experience where it took me a few years to realized why I kept skipping tracks on Black Rider--because it mostly su-ks--and treaded it.)   He peaked with the Island trilogy. My personaly favorite is Frank's Wild Years. Before the far-out sound, he also produced a lot of real poetry along with his jazz-club shtick. Now his writing seems almost like senile mumbling. And his thematic concerns hvae descended/ degenerated into the likes of loving family life. Is there any chance of a renascence? (Not as yet based on a sampling of Real Gone.)   All the kids who have caught onto the Waits thing need try to think a lot harder about these songs and compare them to songs on Rain Dogs and Swordfishtrombones. Back then even when the references and language were oblique, or obscure, they developed a story or an image or a sentiment. It built from line to line--developed an idea, with continuity.  Now it's mostly a string of stylized cr-p, using the vocabulary he developed all his life but to no end. 
 I was very disappointed, after having just read Life After Life, a book I found particularly uplifting.  Since I find mirror gazing, and crystal balls, on the same level as Ouija boards, I didn't find this book  especially awe inspiring.  As a matter of fact, I struggled to finish it 
 THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT THIS PUBLISHERS EDITION NOT ABOUT THE BOOKS CONTENT ITSELF.  If you want to know about the content--- be aware that this book is copyright free and in the public domain and you can actually read the entire text free, online, if you are curious about the content of the book and what it is about. I am a person who prefers a real, bound book in the hand to reading on the computer screen or printing off a book onto computer paper.  I learned about this book as it is popular with homeschoolers using the Charlotte Mason method.  This book weaves science content into a story format (narrative format).  About this edition of the book--buyer beware!  I am very annoyed. I saw that Amazon sells three different publishers' versions of reprints of this very old book, before I purchased the book from Amazon.  Of course I am mad at myself for making a mistake, but I am also not happy with the way Amazon markets this Kessinger Publishing's version of this book.  I have had issues in the past with facsimile reprints of antique books sometimes being very hard to read. I took time to research this. I wanted whichever publisher's version has a readable font that is clearly printed.  The way Amazon presently has this item (book reprinted by Kessinger Publishing) set up on their webpage, I thought I was looking inside this book. Imagine my surprise when the book arrived and the printing itself is horrible! I can't stand to read this! Upon double checking this now, I see I made a simple mistake--if you don't want to make the same mistake that I made please read on...  It appears that this Kessinger Publishing version is a facsimile reproduction of the original. The old font type is hard to read. But the more problematic thing is that the ink is blobby and uneven. Specifically, I mean that some parts of the letters are missing (there is white space) while others are blobbed so that the letters don't look as they should, they are black blobs in some parts. I would prefer a book whose text is clearly visible. A modern font is also usually easier on the eyes.  I am very annoyed as this is not even the cheapest price edition of this book which is currently in print! Come to find out there are cheaper versions with nicer and easier to read font!  I am upset with Amazon additionally as the way they have this set up to "look inside this book" brings you to the edition published by the publisher "Yesterday's Classics" which has what looks to be a great font, a nice, clear, modern font and a good printing job. (Also today I received a different book purchased from Amazon by the publisher "Yesterday's Classics" and it is a wonderful printing job and a a nice binding to boot.  I will be returning this book to Amazon. Too bad I have to pay the shipping to return it to them! 
 Perhaps I'm spoiled by Dave Baum's great books but I found this book very frustrating.  Some of the bots are interesting but I was unable to build most of them because they require extra parts that don't come in the Lego Mindstorms RIS.  That'd be OK if the book told you what extra part syou need but I'd get 70% done and find myself short 6 #3 elbows (or whatever).  True, he lists the needed parts before each bot, but he doesn't tell you which ones aren't part of the RIS.  Baum does.  Also, the pictures in the book lack contrast so it is hard to see details and the "steps" aren't specific.  Buy the Baum books instead 
 What a disappointment - the reviewer who mentioned the difficult-to-use switch was right, it was a poor design choice.  Needlessly heavy too, with poor balance 
 we bought this kitchen set for our daughter for christmas. thinking since it was little tike it would be the best buy and would stand up for a young child. i have bought little tike before. but I'm not sure I will again. the refrigerator door doesn't even come close to fitting. the oven door is warped one side doesn't close. it repeats the same phrases over and over. the tape from shipping left ink on the doors. we were very disappointed with the whole kitchen set 
 "River Run Red" is a retelling of tired old lies.  In 1871 a Congressional investigation cleared Nathan Bedford Forrest not only of his alleged involvement with the KKK but also reinvestigated the "Ft. Pillow Massacre" and found that were that while there was evidence that there were isolated incidents along the riverbank Forrest personally stopped them as soon as he arrived on-scene.  If there was so much "proof" of a "massacre" why was Forrest not charged with a crime even after an in-depth Congressional investigation?  Forrest took 39 United States Colored Troops (USCT) as prisoner and, according the Federal Official Records, also turned over the 14 most severely wounded USCT to the Acting Master of the U.S. Steamer Silver Cloud.  These were hardly acts consistent with a "massacre."  Forrest was accused of ordering the burning of Union barracks with wounded Union soldiers inside.  In the Federal Official Records Lieutenant Daniel Van Horn, Sixth U.S. Colored Heavy Artillery, reported, "Lieutenant John D. Hill, Sixth U. S. Heavy Artillery, was ordered outside the fort to burn some barracks, which he, with the assistance of a citizen who accompanied him, succeeded in effecting."  Mr. Ward wrote that, "When Union Gen. William H. Bradford's soldiers, white and black, finally put up their hands, most, perhaps 400 or more, were cut down."  Lieutenant Van Horn also reported that, "There never was a surrender of the fort, both officers and men declaring they never would surrender or ask for quarter."  Who would know better whether or not there was a surrender - an author with no reservations about lying or a Union officer who was an eyewitness participant writing his report only days after the fact?  Since the author apparently could not find fundamental references commonly used by real historians - the Federal Official Records and the Congressional records - we must question how such a book could possibly be considered to be "meticulously researched" unless the author "meticulously researched" only those records which supported his position.  During the War 45 Black men rode with Forrest as servants, teamsters, foragers, scouts, and even as his personal armed bodyguards.  Convinced he would die in battle, the freed them in 1863 and ALL remained with him through the War and beyond.  In 1875 Forrest gave a speech in Memphis to a Black political and social group.  His speech included the following:  "We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, live in the same land, and why should we not be brothers and sisters . . . Although we differ in color, we should not differ in sentiment . . . I thank you for the flowers, and assure you that I am with you in heart and hand."  Hardly the words of "racist mind-set" as Andrew Ward alleged.  It is clear that the "racist mind-set" is possessed by Mr. Ward, not Forrest.  It is irresponsible to promote Mr. Ward's litany of hate without questioning his motivations or methodology.  "The first law of the historian is that he shall never dare utter an untruth.  The second is that he shall suppress nothing that is true.  Moreover, there shall be no suspicion of partiality in his writing, or of malice." - Cicero (106-43 B.C.)

 The book presents translation theory and information on the history of translation.  It lists proverbs with their translations as well as cognates and false cognates.  There's humorous examples of bad translations.  Therefore, after reading it, you will know how to evaluate the quality of a translation without having been given much practice in translating.  If you're looking for a book on translation theory, this will be a fine introduction.  It isn't as good if you need to learn to translate 
 ...are incorrect and that his fractal models are much better. Of course if his models were worth more than the paper they're written on Mandelbrot wouldn't have to write books like this because he'd be cleaning out everyone else's wallets on the stock market. In particular, if it's true that extreme events are more unlikely than most people think then he could easily exploit this with a suitable derivative. But the fact is, Mandelbrot doesn't know anything that countless other traders don't already know. So instead Mandelbrot is forced to resort to telling people how smart he is through his books rather than actually being smart enough to make a killing on Wall Street.  But I am glad I read this book. Having seen Mandelbrot 'on tour' a few years ago I developed a strong prejudice against him. But reading this book has convinced me that my prejudice is entirely justified. He can never just state a fact. Instead he always has a to phrase it as "my work shows that..." or "I demonstrated that..." even if he makes the same claim again and again. If he can try to take credit for other people's work he'll do so. He even managed to find someone to write an introduction for the book who was prepared to refer to the Levy distribution as the Mandelbrot-Levy distribution. The most egregious example of self-aggrandisement has to be the caption to a picture of the Brooks-Metelsky-Mandelbrot set where he mentions that two mathematicians only scaled part way up his 'Everest' of this set and received Fields medals for this work - the implication of course being that Mandelbrot has actually seen the view from the summit. Disgustingly he doesn't even deign to mention the names of these mathematicians.  One time I criticised Mandelbrot publicly and someone responded by pointing out how many peer reviewed papers he had published so he can't be all bad. But in this book Mandelbrot actually reveals to us how he used his social network to work around the peer review system. Astonishing!  I think it's also worth pointing out that there are some interesting ideas in this book and so it's not completely valueless. But I found the discussion of multifractal time methods (which make up a large part of the book) to generate plausible looking but fake price charts to be a bit pointless. I work in computer graphics and use similar methods to generate random surface detail all the time, but it doesn't mean I have a deep understanding of the statistics of random surfaces. It just means I know how to fool the eye 
 This book is very small, so the word "little" in the title is completely accurate. The book is not utterly wretched, but has no new information, and is not comprehensive in any significant way. (Again, it is little.) The illustrations are the books strong point; they are not especially lurid, but are adequate to illustrating the author's points. The problem with them is that for every four or five points needing illustration, there are one or two photographs. The photographs themselves are in color and have good color registry.   If you are in a long-term relationship and are looking for something new to spice up your romantic life, this book is not for you. For content it is pretty low scoring, but the one exception is the last chapter "Health Matters," which is largely common sense, but nonetheless spells out some important health and safety considerations, a few of which are less obvious than others. 
 Writing s{ ,\z }{}xms when you mean s/,$// (as suggested in this book) is borderline idiocy. If I wanted to be needlessly verbose, I would have written it in Java. s/,$// is concise and works in sed and vi too 
 Sorry, but I found this book a total waste of time. I never did like the main character - I found HER boring! I laughed out loud when I read another reviewer say that "this person escaped her life to be a secretary?" - good point! It was just so unbelievable a woman would leave her children without any thought really - and to continue this "new" life without really taking time to search her soul. Instead she befriends even more boring people than herself.As far as the ending of the book goes - I couldn't have cared less what happened to her anyway! After reading it (book on tape) I felt I had totally wasted my time. What a disappointment 
 This book is a great example of why editors are so important.  It seems this author didn't have one. The journal should have been the starting point of a book, not the end product. Instead of giving us the excruciating details interesting to no one but Mom and Dad(he started singing "Waiting for the Girls Upstairs" when his girlfriend was running late, whoopee), I expected some real insights into how Broadway-level theatre is created.  OK, we get that it runs at a breakneck pace and that all the chorus kids think they could get the dance steps faster and better than the real stars.  We get that this author hates it when stars get star treatment and the chorus is left out in the cold.  (He did seem to enjoy the star dressing room when he got it for a couple of days, though, didn't he?)  I can't believe we got so few stories about Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick, Mel Brooks... I mean, come on, Jeffrey, your long-winded description of your last performance of Cats is not what someone buying "a year with the Producers" wants to know about.  Bottom line: this book is like your co-worker's vacation pictures from Niagara Falls.  A complete bore.  
 I purchased this unit about 18 months ago. After the warranty ran out, the unit first quit working with -R media. Then there is an issue with finalizing the DVD, which makes the dvd unusable. Unfortunately, this is after you record your show. Then all is lost. It started making squawking noises like something is very wrong. It never remembered the language or channels. Panasonic never did anything about this. After reading others with these same issues, I would recommend that you buy from another manufacturer 
 I know this was one of Jet Li's earlier films based on the clothing, music, and hairstyles of the characters in the movie, and Jet Li looked much younger. Anyway I was quite disappointed, I am glad Jet's movies have gotten better because this one was........my mouth hung open through most of it. Asians complain about being stereotyped in other people's movies, but there were stereotypes about everyone in this movie and I know I am just rambling on but,,,,,my goodnes........It was pretty bad. I gave it just one extra start just because it was Jet!! 
 I did not like this book very much. The author treats her subjects as if they were some sort of cockroach species under her idealistic American microscope.  It is more accurate to say that this book is an account of how expatriates "survive" in KSA and not a true representation of the nation or its people. It is full of supercilious generalizations and patronizing commentary. It fully conforms to the biased view of Muslim nations presented in the Western media.  I know many Saudis and they are nothing like the examples presented in this book. To the contrary, they are some of the most hospitable and genuine people I have come accross.  If you want the "Fox News" version of Saudi, by all means read this book 
 I read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the Mom in the book. Fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late. So I feared that this movie would not be up to the book. My fears were unfounded, the casting was brilliant and I loved this movie, even though it is tough to watch, I still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and "must watch". That is how good it is 
 The film looks unfinished. The animations are uncompleted and the film struggles to hold a story running.  However; it has some interesting sci-fi features which makes the film worth watching... If you are a sci-fi fan with waaay to much spare time; that is 
 After reading this I could not help but think that this was absolutely pointless.  The opinions and conclusions of the author are based on the jounals and such of one person.  Each point is made with one person's journal entry, or opinion.  The only reliable and reasonable source that she had was the New York papers, which were sent in by thousands of people.  Besides, the book doesn't make any conclusion that any thinking person wouldn't have come up with in the first place.  The book basically says that people were motivated by money to do this.  Well Duh 
 I was really looking forward to this book, since I heard glowing reviews about it. However, I found it to be perhaps the most excruciating reading experience of my life thus far (with the exception of mathematics texts), and I wish I could've given it 0 stars. I don't mind it when authors digress a bit from the story to reflect on a theme or two, but Wilde did it so often it seemed like I was reading a 100+ page philosophy essay on art. I think Wilde is a fantastic writer with an almost perfect sense of wit, and I think he had a good story, but something went wrong when he was writing the manuscript and he ended up making this novel a university lecture for his beliefs 
 I just purchased this book less than an hour ago, but I'm already annoyed.  If you are going to write a book about little known events and heroes, it would be helpful to, at the very minimum, correctly name the subjects of your book.  There is an entire section devoted to the State of Franklin, and it's founder, John Sevier, who (we are told in this book) was nicknamed "Nolichunky Jack."  Uh, no.  He was known as NoliCHUCKY Jack, after the NoliCHUCKY River.  I mean, come on.  Nolichunky?  I'm not even that interested in reading the rest of the book if an error that screamingly glaring is not caught by the author or publisher.  It's like writing a book about Richard Nixon and calling him "Tricky Rick" throughout. Or calling Lighthorse Harry Lee, "Lighthouse Harry Lee".  Argh 
 I thought this was going to be a nice book about fashion and the woman who wears it. Boy, was I disappointed! It is really shallow, reads like something a 5th grader wrote. Seriously! I sooooo want my money back 
 This will only please the most ardent vampire fans.  Why?  It's exceedinly poorly written.  I figured when I watched it it would either be a decent movie or so bad that it wouldn't matter.  Sadly it was neither.  Don't get me wrong, it was bad, but in all of the wrong ways.  For example the writing, plot dialog, character development is basically not there...well they are they're just about as interesting as chalk.  Unfortunately the acting's not bad.  This results in what must be the worst kind of bad movie.  You can't laugh at the bad dialog because it isn't bad enough, it's just flat.  And you can't laugh at the poor acting because for the most part it's acceptable.  It's got gore and blood, but it isn't the least bit scary.  In general my accessment is it is bad in the most painfully mediocre and forgetable way.  if you want sexy evil wait for the remake of Amityville Horror to be released.  Ryan Reynolds may not play a vampire, but that movie had more development in it's credits than this had in it's entirety 
 I found this book somewhat helpful when planning a trip to San Francisco. It has a lot of information about sightseeing, eating out and accomodations. However, it is sorely lacking in visual stimulation including pictures of the destination and maps. I foresaw the lack of a decent map being a huge problem once in SF and decided to get a Lonely Planet guide to supplement this one.   Overall, I found the Lonely Planet SF guide much easier to use and definitely more entertaining to look at. If you're going to SF and need to purchase a good guide book, I'd go with that one. This one will suffice if it is all you can find but if other options are available, think twice before purchasing 
  Just what we needed. Q:What could be worse than a CD of Styx greatest hits? A: a TWO CD set of Styx greatest Hits! Double the swill! I know there's lots of you Mr.Roboto heads who'll hate me for saying this,but Styx were undoubtably the worst band who ever made it big. Overwrought,overblown,and sappy. Just to be fair,though, Tommy Shaw was a pretty good guitarist. Too bad he didn't have better songs to play on. Miserable 
 I just finished reading "Seven Years to Seven Figures: The Fast-Track Plan to Becoming a Millionaire." The book's framework consists of 8 success stories from people who have reached 7 figures in 7 yeasr or less. And from the stories, you're supposed to take away lessons that will help you accomplish the same. Although it only took me 2 days to read the book, I can save you even more time. Just read the "AFTERWORD" section, which is only 5 pages, and you have everything in the book you're supposed to learn. It's a succinct summary of the whole book.  There's nothing new here, no great insight. How to become wealthy? Make a plan, work hard, and follow through. How to become wealthy quickly? Either get a high income job or start your own business AND invest in real estate. THAT, is the gist of the book right there.  Another thing that bothered me about the book is the author's constant promotion of his company and related products. The whole book is one long sales letter advertising his e-zine company and info products & programs disguised as a book. The 8 success stories are akin to the "testimonials" you see online everyday touting info products, with one of the success stories actually going into detail about a copywriting program the author's company regularly promotes. (I know this because I am a subscriber to his free e-zine.)  I agree with a previous reviewer who said that the motivation for writing this book was undertaken purely to increase the author's wealth and popularity by putting the proceeds of sales in THEIR bank accounts. This book was definitely more fluff than substance. Save your money 
 of stupidity! smoke on the water have the most stupid guitar rif of the rock history, boring boring boring, but if you like it ok 
 This book was a big disappointment.  The characters were clumsy and dorky, making the rest of the book not worth the read.  It reminds me of bad dating experiences, which is not at all what you want to find in a romance novel.  The heroine obsesses over dogs and her own insecurities while the hero is immature and not at all attractive, even in a fictitious world.  If you're looking for a good hockey romance read, pick up something from Rachel Gibson instead 
 The sub-header to this book could very well be: "All Work & no Play makes Jack a Dull Boy".   Basically, Tom Stanley's scholarly treatise on American wealth comes down to this mind-ripping, continent-blasting conclusion:   Millionaires, you see:   1) Save more than they spend;   2) Don't spend anything.   That's it. Page after page, chart after chart, graph after graph, anecdote piling up on anecdote, all of it boiling down to the same conclusion: don't spend more than you save. Clip coupons. Hang on to your wife `til Death you do Part. Buy a rambler for 80 grand, and cling to it like a rat clutching a Big Mac in a hurricane.   To wit: if you're a good little Bob Cratchit, and burrow down in your suburban Dacha, drive the Civic, eat Top Ramen, and take your vacations at the State Museum of Knitting & the Fine Arts, you'll die loaded!Sound like fun?   Didn't think so. Look: you've got one life, and after death all bets are off. Sure, you could be hauled up by the angels to Paradise, or it could just be one plate of linguini too many, a nasty flatline and one vast inky void of non-consciousness. Either way, you're looking at one single trip on this not-so-flat Earth, so you might as well live large.   It's true, now: you can haul in major bank in whatever profession you choose: eremetic horror-writer, Wall Street tycoon, Railroad baron, small-town librarian, legal eagle defender of the Criminally Insane, whatever. And you can always outspend it. That is the source of endless tragedy and Dickensian woe throughout the ages, without a doubt.  But there pitfalls at the other extreme. Listen: I live next door to one of these McMillionaires. The guy is this enfeebled little wizened gnome of a critter, used to be a bank Vice President and got bought out because he was a dingus. Total skinflint. Miser. Goes on his own hunting trips and brings back venison, deer meat, which he forces his family of---jesus, I think 12---to eat for months. Lives in a shacky little rambler, buys used Crown Vics from the local police department and bargain basement prices.   The guy, no doubt, is high net worth. But he's also a loser.   This is a guy who didn't want to cough up a few hundred bucks to help build a joint fence between our properties---so there's a fence, even a fence that abuts his property---but beyond my house and demesne, he elected not to build a fence. Instead, he got a plastic Jersey Barricade (orange and white) and went with that. Is that any way to live? Is that really what it means to be a `millionaire'?  I think not. Half the glory of the Age of Great American Consumption is buying stuff you don't need, but want. Desire. Demand. What else is work for?  Find a way to creative bliss, work at something you're good at, that you have a real passion for, and the money will follow.   But for the Love of God, it's only Money: spend it! What is money for, if not to indulge yourself?   Sure, get a pace---plan to the end---set a budget. But how many of you want to be that newspaper column on page A3, the 95 year old dowager pauper who begged for alms on the streetcorner, ate catfood out of a tin, and scrounged for quarters by the bus stop, then was found rigid and cold in the urine-stiff sheets of her dirty bed, sprawled atop a fortune estimated at 20 million bucks? Sound like a plan? I think not. Money may not buy happiness, but it sure as hell can get you a Rolls-Royce Phantom.   "Millionaire Next Door" might have it right in its sociology---and for what it is, Stanley's thesis is meticulously researched, mustered like a well-trained army, and capable of marshalling its teeming forest of facts like a well-drilled martinet---but it's off the map when it comes down to the point of the whole thing: if you've got it, flaunt it.   "Millionaire Next Door" isn't a bad book: it's scholarly, and plods along its own hand-me-down lodestar towards its prophesied conclusion (be cheap! Die loaded!), and perhaps some folks will be astounded to discover there are some real richies down the block who in another day would have been called skinflints.   But as a map to your stars, this one is a little cramped, cribbed, dank, and stinks of mothballs. I think I'll take first class---scratch that, how much did you say that Learjet was going for, again?   JS 
 first of all, they dont even go up TO the thigh!  they attempt to sit right above the knee!!  second, THEY DO NOT STAY UP AT ALL WHATSOEVER!!! I was sooooo embarrassed - i went out with them on and every ten seconds I was pulling them back up.....  I am 5'3" and I weigh about 125....I'm average - these are a joke - price IS too good to be true - DO NOT BU 
 The purpose of this book, according to the author's introduction, is "a moral biography" rather than "a life history."  His point is that there is a "distancing" between ourselves and Washington; that he has become more myth and metaphor than man.  The book aims to connect us today with Washington's character and personality.  The author goes into great depth about the literary works (such as Addison's Cato, Bollingbroke and Filmer) that Washington read, but I feel Brookhiser is reading too much into these and provides no evidence of how Washington reacted to these works.  The effect is to continue the distancing between us and Washington by not discussing the man himself; just the influences around him.    I think also the author misses some very important points.  For example, in the Introduction, the author says "it is not important to Washington's public career...what his stepchildren were like" but then devotes the entire last section of the book to metaphorical fatherhood of the Nation without discussing Washington in the role of an actual parent.  I'm sorry, it is important!  It tells more about his character than do the books he read.  Another tool the author uses to connect us to Washington is to use modern-day examples.  At first I appreciated references to Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich and Ronald Reagan.  However, after about a half-dozen of these it just makes the book seem dated.  This is the first biography of Washington that I have read.  I finished the book not knowing much more about him than when I started.  I learned more about him reading Joseph Ellis' American Sphinx (about Jefferson) and David McCollough's John Adams.  Which is sad; it is clear that Brookhiser had high hopes for this book and gave it a lot of thought.  I just thought it missed the mark and didn't serve its own objectives 
 Although he is a very talented and highly illustrator I get the feeling that he wanted to just whip out some drawings to get it published. There are pages where there is only a head or a small figure w/o reason. Most of the sketches (but not all ) looked hurried not worthy as publishing material. Be aware the sketches are only B/W 
 Rick Moody has talent. "The Mansion on the Hill," the first story in Demonology, evidences this talent extremely well.  To start off with such a funny, poignant and heartbreaking story sucks you right in and makes you wonder what other treats will follow.   Unfortunately for you, however, what comes next is a string of gimmicky, artsy stories wherein Moody writes a lot but says very little. "Wilkie Fahnstock: The Boxed Set" is a song list with footnotes for each title. "Ineluctable Modality of the Vaginal" is one sentence covering 17 pages. Seventeen pages with one sentence! Not even Hawthorne had the nerve to try that. The rest of the stories in this volume either end too abruptly--leaving you asking, "Is that it?"--or seem to have no point other than highlighting Moody's flair for experimentation and literary seriousness.  Now I'm all for experimentation and taking one's writing seriously, but never to the extent that it clouds the readability of a given work. Demonology, however, is cursed with such a cloud. Moody has talent, and I'd read "The Mansion on the Hill" any day. It's just sad that this is the only piece I can recommend from Demonology as a whole 
 I echo the comments of the previous reviewers.  Don't waste your money.  Not only does this book present a tedious repetition of facts and stories already well known to even a casual U2 fan, it can't even get those facts right!  The book states that Bono's father dropped the family off at a Catholic Church before driving himself to another church.  This contradicts the correct statement on the preceding page that Bob Hewson was Catholic, while Bono, his mother and brother were Protestant.  In the same paragraph the Dublin neighborhood of "Glasnevin" is misspelled "Asnevin".  The hearing aid shop from which Bono took his name is misspelled, and perhaps most galling of all, the author can't even get the full name of Larry Mullen, Jr. right!  And this is just chapter one!    I have to agree that this book was simply thrown together to make a quick buck and therefore not worth purchasing.  I would suggest skipping this one and purchasing Bono: In Conversation With Michka Assayas, which includes a pretty good account of Bono's life from the man himself.  
 I have had this pan for less than a year, and the non-stick is already  flaking off, even though we have been very careful about how we use it and how we clean it.  The handle is also getting loose.  I wanted a good non-stick pan that would last for awhile.  It seems like I could have gotten as good a quality at Wal-Mart for how this is lasting 
 I ordered these for my Mom who has several different items of the Corelle Coordinates.  When they arrived, the color was no where close to the ones in the picture.  The picture appears to be a bright, almost fire engine red color.  In reality, it is a dull purplish-red color.  My sister also bought the same set for our mother and again the cajun red was the same purplish-red and not the bright red in the picture.  I can say that both sets did arrive undamaged and seemed to be packed well.  The bakeware itself if very nice to use however, I'm rating it one star since the color wasn't even close to what I expected 
 This is an unbelievably simpleminded book. It is supposedly written for school counselors--but seems to assume that we think at an elementary school level. Save your money--there's a lot better material on the market 
 First of all, I must point out that i am reviewing the second edition of this book. I'm sure the third edition is different, but i think the main points of my review will still hold.  I bought this book because i needed to brush up on my geometry for the California Subject Examination for Teachers (CSET) in mathematics. While it is certainly a well written book (I found the historical aspects of it particularly interesting), its major flaw is that there are no answers to the end-of-chapter excercises! This makes the book virtually useless to anyone not in school wanting to learn geometry in their own time (i.e. not for a class). Whilst i managed to do most of the exercises at the end of the first chapter (at least i think i did), it seemed pointless to attempt subsequent problems as they were quite in depth and there would be no way for me to know whether they were right or not! A big improvement would be if the number of problems were cut down (seriously, it would take years for someone to finish all of the end-of-chapter problems!) and something resembling answers was in the back of the book 
 Warning to all those who are reading this for a school assignment: you may think that an "enriched classic" is simply the text with commentary also included. Not so, with this book. They shouldn't call it an "enriched classic". They should call it "dumbed down for lazy readers. 
 Fast, easy page-turner (I read it in one day) that gives interesting insight into what it may have been like growing up during the Cultural Revolution. Although it is insightful and terribly sad at times, it was way too underdeveloped and never reached its full potential. I wish the writer had gone much more in depth with the charachters and their anguish, love, fear,lives,passions and ambitions.  This was the first book I have read by this author and am curious about her other novels, only because of her positive reviews. However, this book wasn't a "must-read" at all- I would recommend it only if you have an interest in Maoist China and the Cultural Revolution, or a few spare hours to read an entire book.  
 That's really all I can say. I'm stunned that something so amateurish  found its way to the printing press 
 Though her novel does offer an interesting take on the Thoreau's classic, it is shear hubris to believe she attains nearly the level of the subtlety or philosophical complexity of his work. She in vain attempts to impose a  sort of solipsistic notion which runs rampant  through her own weak  idealogy. The protagonist is a lonely lonely individual, perhaps it is a  reflection of the author's apparent lonliness, hence the story goes from  being moving to pathetic.  Thoreau was attaining trascendental escape  through solitude, our author ohh...excuse me protagonist has no other  option except to be lonely, she has fallen into this state through her own  lack of social adeptness.  This lack of adeptness however is extremely well  written, which can only lead me to conclude that our author also lacks  social adeptness.  It seems that if the protagonist was placed in social  environment, her  self-delusions of her intelligence would be so blatant  and transparent that every word she would utter would drip with  condescending venom.   Clearly, the protagonist is an unkown woman, it  seems however the author is happy about such a state and I would imagine in  her own life she desires anonymity, unfortunately in our highly  "connected" world such an attidude leads to confrontation, and  her feeble attempt to escape is only met with derision from this reader 
 All I can say is that if and when this novel is made into a movie, expect a lot of changes. A screenwriter will certainly not go with such a slow, dragging pace. Also, there will need to be many more actual confrontations with Dracula, not just infinitesimal accretions of knowledge boringly gained through research about the vampire. There will need to be more horryfing scenes and far less looking through dry manuscripts. And that pretty much sums up my objections to the book 
 This book nicely discloses the ghost of Heidegger in much of Arendt's writing. In short: forget your 'banal' bourgeois 'jobholder' worries about material things! leave issues of redistribution or poverty to the animals! instead, stick your toga on, leave the slaves and wives indoors and ... let's do manly politics! Arendt should have ditched this hyper-masculinist, romantic Grecophilia after it got us to Auschwitz. Go read Hobbes or Montaigne if you seek a far more humane perspective on life after human carnage (in their 'bourgeois' determination to keep romantic-mystical yearnings out of the public sphere). Physically, this book just about slips inside Arendt's larger monograph on the origins of totalitarianism. I fear it is ultimately where it belongs 
 I had Vol. 3 be Jay-Z's worst. Even though it is a Jay Z album, there are a lot of guest appearances by Memphis Bleek, Talib Kweli, and Amil. Talib Kweli is the best of them and Bleek is an awful lyricist and Amil is a Foxy Brown ripoff.  Jay-Z puts some good material despite, like "I Just Wanna Love U".   Not a good album. Very commercialized. Don't buy it unless you are a huge Rocafella fan 
 I bought these simply because I wanted an easy snack, and the reviews were pretty good. I took two bites and stopped. The second bite was because I really couldn't believe that I disliked something that much.   The odor is pretty bad, too. These smell very medicinal, almost like a commercial disenfectant. Next time you're at a doctor's office try licking the counter, it's like that. Not that I've ever done that, but I can't describe it any other way.  Please try one of these locally if you can, I wouldn't suggest buying them if you can't. 
 Volunteer Slavery is how a freelance writer named Jill Nelson - who had never worked a full-time magazine or newspaper job in her life - was hired by The Washington Post, one of the more ruthless corporations around. Unfamiliar with office culture due to lack of professional experience, Nelson is unable to handle the hostile office politics of the newspaper and eventually quits. All the while, she blames everyone else for her problems, trashes seasoned pros, and details her sex life and substance abuse. Nelson's book is dishonest because she lacks the courage and inner-strength to examine what her "authentic negro experience" was really all about: she was hired by The Washington Post because they wanted to hire an inexperienced minority staffer that would fail. One of the most sinister practices in journalism is when white employers deliberately ignore and do not hire the legions of seasoned, award-winning, and tough minority journalists in this country - whom they know will survive and triumph over office politics - and instead hire green rookies that are easily crushed. Afterwards, white employers can quickly replace them with a white employee and claim, "well, we tried hiring a minority, but.." and still claim adherance to diversity in the workplace. Volunteer Slavery reveals more between the lines than anything that appears in actual prin 
 My cut : you must be really fooled by the pics to buy this book. There are lots of detailed guides online. Not with color pics, but  very helpful. And probably you want some surprise when you play, don't you ? 
 I think that says it all.  Don't waste your time or money 
 I spent a fair amount of time looking for something like this last year and couldn't believe there weren't more options. I finally installed Book Collector from a tiny little outfit collectorz.com) and it works fine.   But here's something that mystifies me: why doesn't Amazon offer something like this? They could automatically add the information on books you buy from them 
 I bought this DVD thinking I could get what my Pilates class gives me right at home.  Boy was I wrong.  This is a horrible example of Pilates.  The sessions just goes through the motions.  They don't emphasize the importance of form and breathing through out each session which is really needed for any skill level.  The transitions are way too fast.  Maybe I am spoiled by having such a great Pilates teacher but this DVD is a waste of money!  
 I have yet to read this book, however, so far the ***** average rating is quite suspicious...  Each one of the three *****-reviewers, does not have a single other review in their profile.  I am at the stage where I am trying to learn as much as possible about spreads' trading, so I would greatly appreciate if someone who actually has real-life experience trading futures spreads and who has also read this book, to do everyone of the rest of us a favor, and post an honest review - please, we need a counterbalance to the nonsense posted by those who are most likely associated w/ the author or his publisher.. 
 This product did not include the second disc of the set, instead including a second copy of the third disc.  This is quite intolerable 
 Sigmund Gorson, a Polish Jew, has written an expose of the numerous historical inaccuracies in the film Shoah. Gorson's article can be found in the library of Central Connecticut State University in New Britain, CT. Among other things, Gorson points out that: 1) Two million Polish Christians were also murdered by the German Nazis during the Holocaust, 2) The Warsaw Ghetto uprising had far more extensive supply of arms by the Polish underground than the token one-gun shown in the movie, 3) The scene where uniformed Polish soldiers shot Jewish women and children is a vicious lie, 4) Overall, more Christians than Jews perished in the hands of the German and Austrian Nazis, 5) True instances of Polish collaboration with the Germans against the Jews were very rare, and were punished by death by the Polish underground, etc. So for those who think that Shoah presents gospel truth, I would advise them to read Gorson 
 I'd heard the buzz (both pro and con) and thought I'd take an independent read. I was dismayed with this book. James Frey has insulted anyone who has gone through a real experience with substance addiction by trivializing the truth of whatever experience he really had. One of the hardest things an addict has to grasp is the TRUTH so that he can take ownership of his actions and take the 12 steps or whatever is necessary to save his life and often the lives of loved ones tangled up in the mess with him. Lies are what enable "slips" and "enabling" and "denial" and those other catch words that describe continued misery and failure. Recovery is nearly impossible without honesty. So, can we look at this man's "memoir" and expect it to offer anything of value? It's poorly constructed, repetitive, and narcisitic. Even if Oprah hadn't exposed him, the writing takes the tone of "whoppers" like Frey's account of the drug house visit in which he "rescues" Lilly. Other reviewers and Smoking Gun have written about the fantastic episodes one by one, and I can't improve on that. Suffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more real than a daytime soap opera.  Story lines in a soap may look like real life to one who is isolated from real life, the same way A Million Little Pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by real addiction. A real addict with typical delusion could be misdirected from a true course of treatment with tragic result. I was left with the impression he thinks institutions and people who help others with substance recovery are pitifully misdirected or inept. Like a joke of some kind. I'm not laughing. 
 What happened?  Her previous book, "The Last Life," was terrific.  The two short novels in this [price] book (big type, too) are awful.  They read like five-finger exercises at a third-rate MFA program -- all characterization, no action or development.  Omit, but buy The Last Life -- it's great.  Hope the author's next will return to her previous level of excellence 
 This device cut the seatbelt completely off in a auto accident.  T-boned at about 25mph and it ripped seatbelt causing the carseat to be thrown.  Thankfully no major injuries.  This device will damage your seatbelt. 
 Frankly I think this 3rd edition should be pulped.  The 2nd edition was authoritative and prescriptive.  If I want to hear or read how people speak now, I only need to refer to my graduate students.  I don't think we need a book that validates the continuing decline of the language 
 Before you get all worked up, let me say that he has a voice, but he really doesn't have a style.  he sings songs way too straight, he makes even Bobby Short sound like an improviser!  He also doesn't seem to be in touch with his masculine side, his vocie is very, well if ying is male, and yang is female, he sounds very yang.  He needs to take some liberties with the songs he sings and then he won't sound so obnoxious, then he needs to take some vocal lessons and try to bring out the ying(masculine side) in his voice.  He needs to hear a few Billy Eckstine lp's.  I don't think he can change but here's hoping he'll take my advice.  As far as you buying this cd it is your decision, this is just my honest opinion 
 This is book was a waste of time for me. While reading it, I stuck with it because I was hoping that it would have an ending that would make it worth it, but that doesn't ever happen. The ultimate flaw with the book is that it pretends as if its offering some kind of revolutionary ideology and it doesn't. It also suffers in that it makes allegations and criticisms, without backing them up, or offering solutions. The book comes off as some sort of weird propaganda, which makes it really hokey. Do yourself a favor and read something else. 
  Strengths:handful of decent tracks, talent is present, cd has clean sounding guitars, vocals and bass drums, every now and then it almost gets exciting...for a few seconds  Weaknesses: they don't seem to know how to change their sound at all, almost no creativity, music is boring and not energetic at all, most tracks are long and exhausting to listen to, could have been much better than what it is    I'm surprised who P.U. is categorized with. Noone else thinks they sound a tad bit akin to TOOL?  I could be wrong...all I've heard from TOOL in forever is their radio stuff, but this sounds alot more TOOL-ish to me than, oh say, Taproot-ish or Endo-ish.  Hard 'n Heavy bass chords, clearly distinctive guitar rhythms and pounding bass drums, that sound just like TOOL. Vocals have that high pitch sound thats too one keyed and too soft for me. All songs seem to run at virtually one pace..SLOW. The music gets boring.   I can't hear where they've broken any real ground or added anything cool, catchy, or different.  I'm just not digging this disc as much as I think I should be.     With a cheap boombox you're likely to miss alot of the low end that makes the music strong and enticing.  So without good speakers, the music sounds even more wimpy and even more boring than with a good surround system.  
 I'm from Villa Grove.  I liked our town better with the siren 
 I was so disappointed in this version! I have a "Joy" from the mid-1950s and one from the early 1980s -- I would chose either old one over this one any day. The print is terrible and the tone is smug and elitist. It doesn't act as a foundation for cooks -- it assumes you already know everything! PLUS, despite my not using it very often, the binding came apart and pages came out (after less than two years.) Find an old "Joy" on ebay and you'll be happier 
 A waiste of money - Don't bother 
 Brad Gooch is certainly a skillful writer.  He researched his subjects meticulously.  However, the title and blurbs on the dustjacket of his book are totally misleading.  The book is more about a few spiritual outposts in America than it is about the spectrum of spirituality across the country.  There are only five chapters:  one about an arcane revelatory path called the Urantia Movement, the second about the life and times of Deepak Chopra (mostly in other countries), the third about Trappist monks, the fourth a collection of miscellany about the Cathedral of Hope, Soulforce, and Jerry Falwell (mostly in Texas and California), and the fifth about Islam in New York.    A blurb on the back of the dustjacket says, "It's hard to imagine a more important subject than religion in America, or a more compassionate, accessible guide than Brad Gooch.  Godtalk is a necessary book."  Another says, "In this period of self-searching, Brad Gooch guides us through spiritual America with intelligence, wit, and sensitivity."  I gave Gooch's book only two stars because I feel swindled 
 This book is a collection of American Rhymes and Jingles from all the ages.  It was written 1966, but many of the ryhmes in it are still around today.  Some examples are How Much Wood Could a Woodchuck Chuck, Mary had a Little Lamb, This Little Pig, and Star Light Star Bright.  This book is very well illustrated, compared to other books of this time period 
 I was totaly disapointed with the ending in this series of books. I felt let down, and like I had waisted my time and money on the entire series 
 I was placed on The Mediterranean Diet by my physician because I need drastic improvement in my cholesterol levels. If you are looking for ways to get started or for recipies, don't buy this book! Although Mr. Wright seems to have a winning reputation and the book is filled with authentic, flavorful recipies it does not relate to heart-based eating. The ingredients include eggs, full-fat yogurt, cheeses, shellfish such as shrimp, and butter. Choosing and buying this book was my mistake; I just don't you to make the same one! You will find it a complete waste of money if heart-health is your goal. Buy The Mediterranean Heart Diet by Helen V. Fisher instead 
 Rather too soon after taking up this book, I have put it down. Mr. Fleming's combative, aggressive tone, his History Channel style, the irritating absence of a separate bibliography and the errors of fact have all contributed to that. I intend to give the book away 
 I'm sorry but I must agree with others here that this was a very slow, confusing BORING book! I've heard about Linda Barnes and was told she's a good writer - not in this book! I think maybe it could have possibly been better by cutting at least 100 pages! (Yes, I put all those extra words in on purpose!) I really do NOT have to know every stupid detail about how she gets from point A to point B! Really! I haven't read (nor will I ever read) any of her previous books so the whole thread with her Little Sister was confusing and ... no necessary. I only gave the book two stars for a great premise. Too bad it was wasted 
 Simply put: the movie is boring.  Clichï¿½ upon clichï¿½ is confirmed and story lines never come together. It seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting. So, a kid dies, which results in the "natural" response of the father: freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son's death. The lawyer has a drunk "friend" and keeps him around, why, no one knows. Some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship.  All in all, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while. I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged. I neither laughed nor cried, I did not gain an understanding nor was I compelled to learn more or take up a cause. It meant nothing to me, which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie.   Save your money, save your time, choose another movie. 
 I wasted time reading this book that I will never get back.  It was repetitive, predictable, and drawn out.  I only finished the book hoping for a twist in the ending, but it turned out the way I thought it would.  Buy this book if you want to feel good about yourself for finishing it quickly, and for predicting how the story goes.  But, I would not waste the time if I were you 
 I have to confess right now, I'm not an audoiaphobe (or whatever it's called).  I just wanted relatively inexpensive headphones to plug into my hard drive so I can listen to music while I'm at work (and block out all the annoying noise around me).  I had the Sony headphones which were similar to the JVC but I ran the ear bud over with my chair and crushed it.  So I thought I'd get something similar but a little cheaper.  I wish I had bought the Sony again.  These are ok, but everytime I move my head, I get static.  So unless I'm sitting very still, the sound quality is not that great.  Of course, when I am sitting still, they're fine and get the job done, but that pesky static every time I turn my head or move is very annoying.  I won't buy these again. 
 After reading this book I felt that I paid some good money for repetition, advertisement and teaching of how to get your company to send you to do some course work.  This is not what I was looking for 
 This has always been a favorite film of mine.  The story is old-fashioned yet fun and the cast is divine.  Despite having the VHS, I wanted more and ordered the DVD.  Beware!  This DVD claims on its packaging to have Closed Captioning, but it does NOT!!  No subtitles in any language,  no line 21 captioning.  Nor does it have anything else.  "Interactive Menus" means scene selections.  This plain vanilla release doesn't even have a trailer. This film and cast deserves better and I see no reason Lion's Gate reissued this DVD with nothing added.    Since I bought it online, I can't return it and neither Lion's Gate nor Artisan will take it back despite the error in labeling and false advertising which is not the fault of the people I bought it from 
 I was not nearly as enamored with this book as most of the reviewers below. The biggest problem for me is that Alice simply was not a sympathetic character. She whines and excuses her bad behavior all the way through. She also covers up for and excuses the deplorable behavior of her near-do-well son. The only sympathetic character was the husband, who I sided with and felt extremely sorry for throughout the entire story. Her trips to the shrink are boring and add little to the story. I also thought that Alice was ridiculously over dramatic about the "secret" from her childhood she finally remembers, and overly dramatic about the death of her parents, as if she is the only person in the world who has ever suffered these experiences. Woe is me! Sounded like a pity party to me. All and all, not a winning story line, although the writing itself was really good. Perhaps I'll try one of her previous books and see if the story is better. 
 Don't waste your time or money.   Should have been a little more romance than cat and mouse.  And, too many characters in this first book.  Setting the stage for the next two books in the series.   It would have been super if it just focus on Cass and Rick Cisco!!  There were alot of depth in the main characters that left you hanging.  Instead of bounceing around with other characters for her second and third book.  The book was a mess and poorly written. I 've never given a author a 1 rating.  Their are others who don't agree.  That is why we can write our own review.   Judge for yourself.   Thank you 
 It claims to be "the saddest story I have ever heard". Well, it is certainly not the saddest story I have ever read. Usually, sad things happen to good, thinking people. It is beyond my understanding how this tepid book can have so good a reputation. No doubt, adultery and the passions that surround it can be a great subject to write a novel, but the problem here is that characters are at the same time plain and unsympathetic. The trick, in my opinion, is that they pass for profound people, when in fact they are void, useless and jobless persons. The florid language in which the book is written gives the impression of psychological depth, but the truth is these characters have not much to search for within their personalities. Edward Dowell, the narrator, is the typical cuckold, unaware that his hypocritical wife is sleeping with another man -his friend, to make it worse- under his nose. Fool. Florence Dowell is a typical hypocrite (funny, they all seemed to me to be the "typical" something, which may tell you how profound I found them), an emotional blackmailer. Her husband gives his life to her, devotes himself to take care of her illness, and she goes and sleeps with a friend. And she's not even sexy or wicked or nymphomaniac. She's just an unfaithful common woman. Pig. Leonora Ashburnham is at the same time proud, detestable, arrogant and fool. She devotes her life to mend the fences broken by her irresponsible, philandering husband, who spends all his money on other women and gambling. Leonora is always there for him. Dumb. And John, well, John Ashburnham... Lucky guy. Rich, seductive, idle, always generous to easy women, always losing money and depending on his wife to talk to creditors. Always with nothing to do but seduce other women, including friends' wives. Pathetic loser.  The funny thing is, everybody knows what's going on but no one does anything about it, and later they all complain and are perplexed. Boring and despicable lives make, in this case, for a bad novel, representative of the worst traits of XX century literature. The ending is exhilarating by way of trying to be tragic and moving 
 The book opens with horror stories about cows and how they are given[chemicals] to fatten them up and keep them healthly.  Then it moves on the chickens and the horrible conditions they are raised in. The third story is about a vegetarian and how much better his diet is.  I already knew that cows and chickens were not the best and were given [chemicals] I don't want in my body, I didn't need the graphic descriptions.  Much of the information was wonderful, the explanation about protein and simple vs. complete protein was very interesting.   I am an avid reader, but I found this hard to follow, and didn't retain the information.  Having to trudge through the chapters made each new page harder to face.  I couldn't force myself to continue to read.  A book isn't a good resource when you can't recall this inforation or dread having to slog through half of the book to find the one paragraph you need 
 I have to agree with another reviewer. This product is not worth the price tag. It claims to have a vanilla scent, and it does, but it is barely noticible. Don't buy this product based on how it smells. As a moisturizer, you can do much better for $23.00.  
 	These are well-written reflections that unfortunately peter off into a feeble conclusion.  Lischer, a Homiletics Professor at Duke Divinity, is generating the kind of literature that Willimon of the same school has made unfortunately popular: well-spoken cultural analysis that sounds edgy but changes nothing.  	The book is divided into four sections.  	The first, Vocation, thoughtfully captures the agony of the preacher who searches for words in a sea of words and often comes up with silence.  However, Lischer gravitates quickly towards an awkward dichotomy between the integrity of Martin Luther King, Jr. and the marketeering of Powerpoint using megachurches, something Lischer writes off as entertainment that belittles the power of the word of God.  Having traveled in the circles of the declining mainline Protestant churches, I wonder immediately if Lischer is not just a former pastor who harbors resentment against the contemporary emphasis on evangelism and church growth.  I wonder if he doesn't feel put down by those who built big churches while he, perhaps more intelligent and profound, was unable to follow suit.  Just a guess that comes from listening to a lot of pastors complain about big churches.  He goes on to criticize cute story-telling (p. 39) in lieu of authentic reporting of the text, which is an enticing way to introduce the book.  	The next section, Interpretation, addresses the issue of hermeneutics and exegesis.  Without really solving anything, he nonetheless gives some clever categories of reading: flat (which considers all verses of equal value with no center), convenient (which reduces the text to practical tips on daily living), ironic (which observes the wide difference between God and humanity).  Instead, he recommends what he calls the generous reading, which is the basis of truly theological sermons (p. 63).  This involves reading with the church (p. 74), not insisting on a single, definitive meaning of any given passage (p. 86), and communicating the experience of the text itself without embellishment.  Now we have moved from thoughtful reflections into the over-examined quagmire of epistemology, and he's not saying anything new.  	In the third section, Narration, Lischer encourages us to drop the outworn, insider vocabulary of the church, which he terms "code," and instead dive into postmodernity (p. 98) and put away the "Grand narrative" to admit that the narrative of humanity is not finished.  We are to use the "focal instance"(p. 110) and "perspectival retelling of the biblical story" (p. 118), or telling the story from the vantagepoint of the characters.  Unfortunately, neither of these escape the fact that the preacher has an interpretive lens and is using it persuasively; it is only a sleight-of-hand to make his audience think he does not.  In a last ditch effort to escape the charge of neutrality, he claims that the gospel narratives do "hang together" (p. 124) and that it matters that Jesus is real, but his only means of convincing us of such is to have us tell the story over and over.  	Finally, in Reconciliation, he tells us the point of preaching.  We are to escape authoritarian language that leads to violence and instead preach for the language of love (p. 156).  Sermons should be narrative rather than argumentative or persuasive.  He tells us that the ministry of the word is "an endless card game" (p. 151).  In the end, it seems that such is what he is playing.  Even while admitting that the language of tolerance is theologically tepid, even while admitting that the influential theologians of the early church and the Reformation were clear and dogmatic, Lischer winds up with little more to say than "Let's all get along."  	To his credit, he says it awfully well.  He's an extremely good writer.  And he can always fault me for not preaching enough of his peace, because, of course, I'm trying to convince you that he's wrong.  But then, he can't consistently argue I should do otherwise 
 FOR THE LATE 1970s, the audio quality is surprisingly poor.  It can barely be called hifi, the sound seems to be intended for a tv set speaker. The costume are over the top and unmasculine for the men. I think that overall, this is a bomb. I would recommend the following DVD:   Mozart - Don Giovanni / Gilfry, Polgar, Bartoli, Rey, Nikiteanu, Salminen, Widmer, Harnoncourt, Zurich Opera (2001)  or with really great singers but from 1950s (still with good sound in colour):  Mozart - Don Giovanni / Furtwangler (1954) with LISA DELLA CASA !! 
 This is a minstrel show. Period point blank. These guys set black people back 20 years. Look at them in "black face" on the cover of their album. They look like al jolsen twins. Then the music they make is insulting to every race color and creed. Any music that makes you feel dumber when you listen to it should be banned. I'm calling my alderman now to start the movement. LOL 
 This book was disappointing in its lack of detail.  It doesn't really get into much depth on any topic and I just didn't learn anything from it 
 after a year of sobriety, including two months of AA meetings in the beginning of that year.  When it was time to drink again, I found his book and read it, and quoted it to my wife to get her to agree to let me drink again, though only beer and wine, of course.  Fingarette is correct: there are very heavy drinkers who are NOT alcoholics. They just drink a lot. If they stop drinking, or cut down, drink-related problems go away.  But if you are a real alcoholic, alcohol is not your problem. If alcohol is your problem, you are not an alcoholic.   I've given it a lot of thought in the 15 years since I made it back (almost didn't) to the sober world 
 Very frustrating book to read.  Far too many words for the amount of information imparted.  Could easily be half the size.  Seems poorly planned/outlined.  Example: Chapter 1 is 7 pages. Chapter 2 is 236 pages.  McGraw-Hill where are your editors and reviewers 
 This toy is a terrible disappointment. It falls apart immediately, is very poorly designed, and ridiculously difficult for a child (or adult)to put together. 
 Skip this book. It's simply an over-glorified advertisement for the store of the same name. Reading this, you can enjoy page after page of "To shave properly, you need this product which we conveniently carry in a range of exorbitant prices." Yes! I do need that sterling silver shaving handle, hand crafted by the finest Elbonian craftsmen especially for me, and I cannot live without the lavender-rosemary-thyme-sandalwood-myrrh-poison ivy pre-shave oil! How did I ever shave before these things? Just buy some shaving cream you like and use a gentle touch if you want a better shave 
 Strangely enough I found my way to this book because a journalist quoted a portion in an economic article. I was intrigued and maybe I had a pre-conceived notion of what it was about.   At the risk of being labeled a candidate for remedial enlightenment 101, I'll be candid to say I found this book too convoluted and mystical. I just didn't get it. I kept trying to be enlightened but found myself disappointed at each turn of the page. At the end of my journey, I was glad to discard the book. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone 
 May be as damaging as out and out lies.  I think Crichton is a fine writer who could have written a great novel about the manipulation of a populace through media and other networks.  Instead we have a hodge podge story that jumps around the Earth as the theses it posits jump around the truth.  One of these that I found most disturbing was the Antagonists statement that DDT was not proven to be harmful.  Maybe so, but the chemical reaction (something that happens quite often in nature) DDT has with some soils leads to DDE which is very harmful to native species.    It reminds me of Bowling for Columbine.  Whether you like Micheal Moore or not, he had a thesis about how afraid Americans are made to feel.  Why do you lock your door at night?  If someone wants to get in, they will.  Moore touches on, but does not get in depth with the pervasiveness of fear in American society.    Crichton does the same while attempting to discredit many environmental groups. He portrays these organizations very well, however, the story never really develops into an in depth investigation of what really terrorizes our society and why that fear drives us to consume, ultimately leading to our very real fear of a society that is one of the safest in the world. (check the FBI website to see how crimes have fallen and show that really we are safer than we were 40 years ago!).       
 The premise, the title, and even the cover art are all misleading - this book does not really explore the world of Internet dating beyond 3 or 4 `dates.' The main character, Jess, is 34, single, and envious of her sister Olivia, and Olivia's perfect marriage and children. As a birthday gift, Jess receives a subscription to an online dating site and manages to go on about 4 dates during the course of a year. Not stunning odds, and not very interesting reading either. Maybe it's just me, but I really thought this book was going to focus more on the dates and less on Jess and her sister. In the midst of the book, the story takes a drastic turn and becomes very `deep' in terms of the storyline; the storyline, which involves Olivia, just didn't gel with the rest of the book and its upbeat attitude. It was as if a large cloud came over the book midway through and it was hard to get the spirit of the book back. Jess does change throughout the course of the year, but with only 4 dates as a frame of reference, her changes are not that believable and neither is her eventual romance. I just thought this book was poorly written (which, aside from its poor storyline, is illustrated by all the swearing). Waste of your time 
 There might be a good idea for a joke - but it just does not come out funny. That's about all I can say about this amazingly overrated book. Seems to have all the ingredients to be good: Great Ohio Desert (G.O.D) - funny, the names of the people - funny, and so on. Came out to be - just boring. Pretentious dull dialogue. Pretentious dull characters. I was reading it in a morbid disbelief, that lasted for more than half of the book. It is very unusual for me to stop reading a book once I passed the halfbook mark - I usually want to know "what happened". It kept me going here for some more pages - and then I decided: nothing of it really happened, does not matter, waste of time. None of the characters, surroundings or events were in any way interesting 
 If you're going to read one of the great classics of literature-and you should-don't pick up this edition.  It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder.  Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning.  If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller.  That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint).  Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues.  This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS 
 After seeing this film, I am pretty amazed they have been able to put what they did on to a dvd. I actually felt sickened by the images I saw and had to turn it off many times. Yes its an interesting documentary but can you imagine how the victims family felt knowing the images of their loved one being violently stabbed were being shown to people? Personally, I think you've got to have a strong stomach to watch it 
 Blowing my Cover is a young woman's memoir of a short-lived CIA career.  The middle and end of the book were intesting (CIA training and post 9/11).  The rest was boring.  Moran actually writes that she was destined for a CIA spy job because she liked to treasure hunt as a child!  Yawn.  Moran never convinced me that she really wanted to be in the CIA or that she was truly "wired" as a spy.  Her motivations for getting out were believable but that doesn't happen until the last 40 or so pages.  I found myself skimming the middle of the book to find out why she ultimately left.  Moran's book has some interesting tidbits about becoming a spy but it lacks passion and emotion 
 If you love the prose style of the professional sociologist, and the self-absorbtion of a marooned sailor, you will love this book 
 Like my title suggests this movie is a vain attempt to take credit from the first movie to sell sub-par music to a new generation of viewers.  The first Heavy Metal obviously had some thought put into the scenes and the pace of the story line.  The artistry was phenomanal in the first movie, much better than the mish mosh of computer graphics and hand drawn animation in Heavy Metal 2000.  The first movie made sure the music reinforced and enhanced whatever scene was being played, the second, well the music really did not add much if anything at all the movie.  To sum up...boring plot, no imagination, and a sound track to not die for.  My advice?  Use the DVD as a coaster and read a good Frank Herbert novel instead 
 My father used Dobson's methodology as a license to strike.  If you wish to die alone in a nursing home, I suggest you listen to those who worship hate and violence.  There is not a day that I don't dream of lashing my old man with a studded belt to punish him in return, and am contemplating not having children to let the cycle of violence end with me.  God bless America, we really need it... 
 This review refers to the translation by William Creasy. Several have tried to bring the devotional classic, "The Imitation of Christ" into the twentieth century and all have failed. I can think  of few  devotional books as morose and melancholy as this one. I have attempted to  read it on several occasions due to its reputation throughout Christian  history but have never been able to draw any strength or comfort from a  work whose message consists of these themes: "Abandon the world and  hate it", "Withdraw from all people into yourself",  "Think often of death and judgment". This is Christianity!  It  sounds like the scribblings of a manic-depressive in need of Prozac and  some long term attitude adjustment!  A real downer. Not something that  would encourage me to continue with my day to day reading and meditation  time. Where is the encouragement and refreshment that one would expect from  devotional reading? How in the dickens is someone supposed to draw strength  from a book that seems designed to rob you of all positive emotions and  hopes? The emphasis here is on everything dark and depressing that one can  imagine. It is my opinion that one would have to distort the message of the  New Testament to an incredible degree to make the message of "The  Imitation" be in synchrony with it. One further point: while the cross  of Jesus is mentioned over and over and over in this, I do not recall a  single mention of the Resurrection of Jesus-which shows how distorted this  is if it fails to see any point worth mentioning to the central mystery of  Christianity, right 
 I know I'll sound like an uneducated dolt, but after you look thru the pictures once or twice, there's really not much else to do.  Don't get me wrong--it's visually quite a pleasing book, but my kids are young enough (below kindergarten) that part of the draw of bedtime is words and rhymes that we do the same way every night.  Sitting in silence and turning pages doesn't work too well with three kids, because they can't all sit in my lap at the same time.  And did I mention there's very few words??  No thanks.. 
 This book is FULL of metaphors.  If you cut out all the metaphors and all the repeating itself, it might have 10 pages of content worth reading.  But, your money is probably better spent elsewhere.  This is what I get for looking for a book on real estate in a brick and mortar store rather than coming online. It was the only book I could find at the time.  There is some good info there, but I'm sure that you can get a LOT more valuable info for your money by purchasing a different book 
 I have to admit, I'm a bit over the pebbles and berries effort to make a faery home, if it's very primitive. Go on fairy houses dot com. If you like what you see then you'll enjoy this book. Fairy Island is a much nicer choice for a book in this type of genre, if you will. In fact one of my favorite books, is "In the Realm of the Never Fairies: The Secret World of Pixie Hollow" by Disney, unbelievably, it's very eye catching. Check out my book list for tons of ideas. Wendy Froud's books are EXCELLENT too 
 I bought this book here on Amazon because of its cover and description but had I thumbed through its pages in a bookstore then I never would have bought it.  144 pages of its 236 total pages are very primitive illustrations and the seal of the individual spirit. Even those only take up half a page each. I would say that well over 60% of this book is just padding.   Other than the few pages that describe the evocation of Orobas I would say that this book stinks and that there is nothing new or useful in it for anybody who has any of the key of solomon texts. 
 The 2001 printing of this book is full of errors.  The author's errata list is 71 pages long.  Get the 2nd printing: paperback with updated CDROM.  I'm going to be returning mine 
 I got this DVD for $1.99 and I still feel ripped off.  The quality of the movie was terrible, the story line was stupid, and the acting was just fair.  Do not waste your time on this poor movie.  Even though there are some stars in it in their younger days (Eloitt Gould, Michelle Piefer, David Caruso), it does not make up for the poor content of the movie.  Cheaply made---DON'T BOTHER!! 
 This book was quite disappointing.  The writing is fair, but very dry. The text is filled with VERY well known stories, and I learned almost nothing I didn't know from other books I have read.  Do yourself a favor and skip this book. Instead read Chernow's masterpiece "Alexander Hamilton," and find a good book on Madison - you will learn so much more that way 
 I hoped I could leave the theatre, but I was hoping it would get better. Here let me put it this way: 3-D sucked Plot sucked Actors sucked Movie sucked PLEASE DON'T MAKE A SEQUEL!!! 
 Yes, I understand this is not a novel, but it is as dryly written as a computer manual.  It's a shame because the story is compelling, true and quite dynamic 
 This is the worst book I have had the mispleasure of reading. The entire book  has no point; moreover, it describes EVERY painfully tedious detail that the main character enounters. Completely irrelevent minutiae is described ad nauseum and in the end the reader is left without any sense of conclusion or satisfaction, instead asking "what the hell just happened?" There is no other way to describe this book other than ABSOLUTELY AWFUL.  Alain Robbe-Grillet, I hope you are reading this: thank you for wasting four hours of my life 
 You are better off getting the Norton Anthology of Poetry.  This book is marketed as a personal selection, yet contains a fairly standard array of poems taken from other anthologies.  Do we need Bloom to select some chestnut by Robert Frost for us 
 is the fact that Black men are married to Black women over 94% of the time and those who aren't are devoted to Black women only.  She's being hoodwinked by mainstream media that shows Black men either with nonblack women or alone.    Black romance is sorely lacking in mainstream media today.  Black-owned media is taking up the slack by publishing novels, shows, etc., that show Blacks together in love.  I guess she missed seeing it. Instead, she's blinded with her one-sidedness on IRs.  I wouldn't recommend the book to anyone.  But if you do read it, please read it with caution 
 Over the years I've had several toasters and all have performed acceptably but this overpriced unit is unbelieveably bad at doing the job. I tried several slices in different positions and all came out toasted on one side with virtually no browning on the other plus the left edge of all slices were burned black. Unless you want it for an "art" display in your kitchen get another brand. I'm going back to my old Cuisinart which has worked flawlessly for years 
 Maybe it was the editing or the translation, but this book was a long and frustrating waste of time.    There was no spark in the writing, plot or characters.  It was as if everyone was either on Prozac or needed it!  I was really let down because the middle started getting more interesting so I kept reading, thinking it would finish strongly, but was disappointed.  Actually, the only reason I am writing this is because I was taken in by the many 4 and 5 star ratings and am pissed off that I was duped!!   
  	The book Hubbert's Peak: The Impending World Oil Shortage is about the economy and the impact one scientist had on the world with his predictions.  Hubbert's theory stated that in the early 1970's oil production would reach its highest level. He was doubted my many scientists, but when it came true scientists used it to look at what the future holds for oil production. It is expected to hit this decade at some point. This book describes the origin of oil and development over the many years. It also describes several different oil fields and the prosperity of them, and the different types of techniques and bits used to find oils by scientists. Each scientist has different methods of finding the oil fields, and they use data sets to record the sites and sizes of them. It provides an overview of what the future holds for oil production, and what different kinds of energy we can resort too if needed to avoid the economic troubles lying ahead. 	I thought this book was overall pretty boring. I wasn't  entertained or hooked on it, and it didn't make me want to keep reading in the end. I found it very confusing most of the time, and it had a lot of information to try to digest all at once, such as numbers and equations. It wasn't the kind of book I really get indulged in, and want to read more of, or cant put down.  	I would recommend this book to those who like to read books about our economy and what's going on in different industries. This book is easier to read for adults, as it contains advanced material that could confuse younger children. For those who enjoy reading advanced books about our economy or oil, this is an excellent book. 
 Given his eye for detail, obviously thorough research, ability to write reasonably well, and obvious commitment as a devout Catholic, this book should be a good read. It isn't. Instead, it is an unfocused mess. It even has digressions that repeat themselves without any intervening material. Did this writer never pass his work beneath the eyes of an editor? If he did, was that editor someone for whom English was a second language? Given the great problems with this book, how does it rise so far in the book distribution world? It's as if a gifted High School student, mentored by a teacher so bemused by the fact that his student knows the difference between a sentence and a paragraph that he fails to notice his student's lack of compositional organization, has suddenly had his second-semester term paper marketed by a bunch of grownups who should know better. It seems to be a trend in the publishing world, but it doesn't change anything: this book does not even rise to the designation of second rate. I am sorry about that, too, because I want to like this book and this author and to buy the other members of the Trilogy. But I cannot. This book is just not worth the money 
 This review refers to the Audio-book. I'm a huge James Lee Burke fan, but I found the reading of this book to be unbearable. I have listened to Mark Hammer read before and have enjoyed his renditions of other authors like Elmore Leonard, but here he just sounds tired, sloppy and unconvincing as a Cajun reader. His performance is unidimensional and lacks any variety. When he attempts to mimic a southern accent it sounds like someone from Detroit imitating Gomer Pyle. Towards the end of the reading, it sounded like he needed to clear his throat. If you want to hear a stellar reading, try another James Lee Burke work "Purple Cane Road" read by Will Patton.  
 This product simply DOES NOT WORK.  I purchased this item about a month ago to back up my software on my old PC (because I was about to buy a new PC).  After backing up all my photos, music, files extra using the trusted drag-n-drop method it seemed as though the files loaded successfully on the hard drive.  I restarted my old computer and verified that the files were on the drive.  Everything seemed ok.  I then went to my new computer to upload the files but it said that the files didn't exist.  It was panic time (because I had already reformatted my old compuer) so I just lost all my files.  I went to WD Support and I was told to only back my files up using their software called Retrospect.  If I used drag and drop, then who knows what will happen.  I was enraged.  External hard drives are supposed to be simple, like portable USB drives, but WD has made a simple process more difficult that it needs to be.  I will NEVER recommend or buy a Western Digital product again 
 I have the wrong book. I needed a book on the I Mac version of Elements 4. I received the Windows version of Elements 4. To me the book is useless 
 I was not into this movie at all.  My mother recommended it to me but it was lame all the way through.  A middle-aged man decides he wants to do something different with his life, so he takes a dance class.  Ofcourse there's a fine dance instructor, a crush is pursued, a wife gets jealous, hires a detective, and *gasp* his crush is found out.  The movie was too predictable and it just wasn't for me.  Not a bad movie, just not my cup of tea.  Richard Gere was cute as usual, which was the only thing that made me watch it to the end, besides wanting to know what a correct quick step looked like since "So You Think You Can Dance" never had contestants who mastered it 
 Anna Quindlen has many gifts, but subtlety is not one of them. Nor is originality. Just about every character and plot device in this novel has been used before -- many, many times before. Oddly, for a hell-on-wheels nagging feminista, Anna Quindlen seems unduly influenced by male authors (and cliches.) She steals much, but understands little.   Let's see, a family saga about a wealthy immigrant clan ruled by a shady, all-powerful patriarch. GODFATHER, anyone? Just as John Scanlan is clearly Don Vito, so is uber-achiever teen girl Maggie Scanlan clearly in the Michael Corleone position. She's all but anointed as his successor -- at thirteen! The only problem is, all the tough moral questions Michael Corleone has to face are carefully airbrushed away for Maggie. The old man is a brute, a bully, and all the usual feminist crybaby stuff -- but it's perfectly all right for Maggie dearest to inherit all that yummy money.    On the other hand, this book also owes a surprising debt to TOM SAWYER. Tom Sawyer and Maggie Scanlan are both the smartest, liveliest, most charismatic kids in the neighborhood. Both are surrounded by dumb, weak-willed sidekicks who exist only to make them look good. Maggie has the blandly obnoxious Debbie Malone, and Tom has Ben Rogers, Joe Harper, and -- dare I say it -- future hero Huck Finn. Tom Sawyer and Maggie Scanlan are both expected to have brilliant futures, if they don't drown, burn, or blow themselves up in the process of having their amazing but never truly subversive teen adventures.    The most interesting TOM SAYWER parallel is in the use of the hero's nemesis or arch-enemy. Tom has Injun Joe, and Maggie has her cousin Monica Scanlan. At first glance a vicious murdering half-breed and a luscious Grace Kelly lookalike might not seem to have much in common. But it seems that compassionate feminista Anna Quindlen hates blondes even worse than Mark Twain hated Indians -- she's just less honest about what she feels!  Look at all the amazing similarities. Injun Joe and Monica both torture the hero in secret, when no one can see them. Both are masters of disguise. Both meet horrible fates that the heroes don't create but -- oh, so sorry! -- don't manage to prevent on time. There's a certain have it both ways hypocrisy in both novels. Twain claims to present America as a land of innocence and hope -- only the Indians have got to go. Anna claims that Maggie and her luscious college girl mentor Helen are going to build "A New World" for all women  -- but first the blondes have got to go the way of the Indians. Ah, Sisterhood!  This tiresome business of bashing beautiful women goes back a long, long way in feminist literature. Poor Monica Scanlan is in good company, along with Hetty Sorrel, Rosamund Vincy, and Lucy Deane. (You can look up these fascinating ladies in the novels of George Eliot -- better yet, don't bother.) It's good to know that, like the nobility of the Bourbon restoration, the feminists of today have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.   Did I mention that the budding romance between Maggie and her shy boyfriend Bruce is handled with unusual skill and sensitivity? It's the best part of the book by far. Anna Quindlen has missed her calling -- she should be writing YA romance!  But of course, that sort of novel would be beneath a Barnard graduate.   
 Polly fell apart in my 5 year old's hands.  She had only played with her about 3 times.  I was watching her play with it and then it just fell apart at the waist.  The hips broke in two and the legs fell right out.  Not a toy for a little one as not only do the  outfits and accessories pose a severe choking risk the doll obviously does also 
 I'm a long time fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries, and have read all the others. Unfortunately, "Hard Truth" does not live up to the quality of Ms. Barr's earlier works. It feels very contrived. It also appears to take advantage of stereotypes against religious groups. This book just does not meet the expectations I've come to expect from the series. 
 I was all excited that I could put any solution i want in it and that it had a scrubber, but when i got it.  It was so hard to put together.  Then the cleaner i put in started to leak. Then the handle part kept on coming apart.  Then it didn't look right.  The mop pads are a joke, they don't just come off when you turn the knob which i can't even do that.  It does not take any mop pads because the swiffer wet jet mop pads are my fave and I had to put velro on the bottom so that they would work on it. And most of all the thing is so heavy.  You have to have some upper body streanth just to move it. The scrubber head is no were near how big it look on Tv.  It was a very big dissapointment not to mention it was my Xmas present to my self.  Black and Decker should stick to power tools and leave the mops up to swiffer.  I love my Swiffer wet Jet.  Best Mop I have ever used.  Wish they would make it so i could use any cleaning solution that i wanted though 
 I have read many of James Patterson's books and have never been disappointed.   This book however, was a big let down.  I almost didn't finish reading the first few chapters because I had difficulty following it, they were choppy and confusing.  After the shaky beginning, it was much better and I found myself enjoying the storyline until the end.  The end was 'stupid' for lack of a better word. Twist, yes, it was a twist, but in a direction that made NO  sense. WHY??  I thought he would give some insight into the purpose of the ending, but he didn't.  
 "No one buys or sells without the MONEY of the beast on/in mind or hand" -- Apocalypse. The correct, in context translation of the classical Greek word mistranslated as "mark" is karagma, which means MONEY.  You won't discover the truth about this in Strong's concordance because Strong's Greek-English Lexicon is an abridged version of Liddel-Scott's Greek-English Lexicon.  Same with the word Mammon, which also means money in the Aramaic language, which Jesus spoke. They did not even bother to translate the word because the Pharisees love money. See the whole context of: "You can't serve God & MONEY, you'll either love the one and hate the other . . . but the Pharisees, who loved money heard all this and scoffed.  The so-called christians today do not follow the Logos-Logic of God (John 1:1) but the trite, anti-Christ/anti-Logos-Logic of "Saint" Paul, who was BLINDED by the light.  Confessing with your mouth that Jesus rose from the dead will NOT save you. Only logos-logic will.  The Truth will rise again. Nearly every great philosopher, leader, or revolutionary has realized that the mark of the beast is MONEY, i.e., that MONEY is an unnecessary-evil stumblingblock for the blind.

 This book is a waste of paper.  Little to no useful information or insight into wedding traditions in Scotland.  Dull 
 OXO has always been one of our favorite kitchen implement manufactures because of their high quality--NOT THIS PRODUCT.  Incredibly, the first time this was used to make pancakes the edge of the spatula blistered and melted.  We tried it on hash brown potatoes with the same result.  A call to OXO customer service elicited their willingness to refund the purchase price only if we returned it--which simply isn't worth the time and trouble.  Maybe it's only the blue ones this happens to?  We're rethinking our opinion of OXO 
 I managed to read The Breaker in one sitting, so it can't have been all that bad. But it was a pretty unremarkable story. There wasn't really much of a mystery to uncover. I had a major problem with the character of Maggie. What was she even doing in this story? Easily the most annoying character I have ever encountered in a book. Making it worse was the fact she practically had nothing to do with the plot.  I have also read The Dark Room by Minette Walters, and found that one to be fairly average as well. She needs to work on her character development. Her writing style has more of a presence than her characters do. I doubt I will be picking up anymore by this author. 
 First off, I'm not a fan of the writing style. It covers so much information and time with little dialogue, or characters for that matter. But that's just the style. The way the story was presented was what I had a problem with.  It seemed like the author had a lot of interesting ideas on what he thought the end times would be like, and he didn't want to write an end-times non-fiction spiritual book, so he just presented it as fiction, but didn't quite know how to do that.   Characters are introduced simply to experience the asteroid plumetting into the earth. Then, they drop off. All of a sudden, near the end, they come back, and now they're like generals or something, or leading some kind of airstrike during the battle of Armaggedon. WHAT?!   This book is a grid, a blueprint for a certain way it COULD happen. It is not a story about people, or a story with a plot. It is just a list of events that read on until Jesus comes.   The only reason I gave it two stars was because it didn't follow the whole rapture-theory at all(that word isn't in the Bible, and even implications of one doesn't say WHEN during the tribulation it would be). In this story, the Christians are here for the whole thing, and everything isn't quite so set and orlderly and expected like the Left Behind series. It follows the premise that throughout the last century or so, we've already experienced the Seal Judgements, and that the asteroid hitting earth is the beginning of a great cataclysm that mankind is about to face.  IF you want a different take and aren't expecting much of anything else, read this, but not if you want a real story with passion or voice.  
 For someone so beguiled by Rand's objectivistic individualism, I wonder how he justified being her sycophant boy toy. 
 I found this book extremely verbose and unorganized.  It would serve as a great reference book for a lab researcher or grad student.  But it's way too technical and dense for an introductory genetics class.  The authors do a poor job presenting the material in a comprehensible way to an undergraduate genetics student.  Not recommended 
 Man, I like real emo bands like the Ataris and NFG [...] I noticed it said something about Knapsack to I bought this and it sucks.  It's not catchy at all.  It has no lyric sheet at all.  That angers me cause I really don't know what Blair Sheehan is trying to say anyway.  But what I can make out it just pretty stupid.  I don't know, I would just prefer real emo like Fenix Tx and Good Charlotte.  Go Wheatus!!! 
   I have never written an online reveiw and never intended too, but this film was so terrible, brutal and boring (which is an amazing combination in itself) that as a service to other people who enjoyed this directors later film "spring, summer, fall, winter...and spring" I felt compelled to issue this warning.     This is perhaps the worst film I have seen in years.  In this film you will see the following: several live fish caught, thrown onto a dock and hacked to pieces with a knife as the flop around, a bird drown in its cage, a woman insert fish hooks into her vagina and yank on the fish line to set them in, a man deficate (shot up from below so you miss nothing) another fish thrown on the floor and having battery cables attached, a dog beaten, women slapped and degrated, and a frog having his brains bashed in as he is slammed against a rock and then skinned.    And in spite of all this sadistic stuff going on, I was bored. This is truly a piece of crap. I will not even address the plot as it is already reveiwed many time. But if you are looking for horror, look elsewhere, every death, man and animal, is shot in a slow drawn out distant way. Not scary.   Is there nudity and sex, yes shot in the same ditracted slow boing way.   I am not sayiny that this movie isn't making some kind of statement, just that the statement is brutal and slow and shallow.   Oh and I forgot to mention the fish that is cut into sushi and eaten while alive, but not enough to kill it, and then allowed to swim away with huge gashes of flesh missing on either side.   I am not some peta vegan liberal tree hugger but the cruelty inflicted (not FX) on the animals in this film just to try to fill up boring gaps in this boring piece of crap is disgusting.   There are better films than this to see, try "vertcal ray of the sun" for instance.   
 The seller made a mistake and did not have the title in stock. They had later sent me an e-mail apologizing for the error and credited my account. 
 If you're looking for a clear, concise guide to delving into the world of the occult, you've found it. Like most of the books in the "Idiot's Guide" series, it's easy to follow and practical. So why do I rate it one star? Because in this case, clear and concise instructions are a negative. It's like a book that gives great instructions on how to become a drug addict. I strongly suggest taking time to consider the dangers of communicating with demonic spirits before taking this leap. It's actually very EASY to communicate with demonic spirits, even without instructions. They WANT to communicate with you, but you can bet it's not to help you in any way! No one dabbles in the occult and comes out of it for the better. I have to assume that most readers interested in this type of book are open-minded. Why not try communicating with a much higher power to get true enlightenment and direction 
 CRITICISM: I doubt that I have ever met any girls sillier than Jane, or more cloying than Anthea. Indeed, I have never met any more cowardly than the two of them put together. They fulfill the worst stereotypes of silly little girls, and I balk at having them be heroines in this story. They cry and worry at their brothers for trying to fight. If they want to stop the boys in the long run, they should learn to speak sensibly, or let the boys go to it and be beaten up a few times, instead of snivelling for mercy to the enemy. Nesbit's narrator has some humorous moments, but is too much of a prude to run with them, retreating instead into sneakily-injected lectures on child behavior.  SUMMARY: Five children meet a sand-fairy (called a Psammead), who is by far the most sensible of the characters in this book. From there, the book devolves into a series of events in the "and then this happened, and then that happened" style.  COUNTER RECOMMENDATIONS: For elementary age fantasy, try any Roald Dahl ("James and the Giant Peach" is quite marvelous, as are "Witches" and "BFG"). Also try Cornelia Funke's "Inkheart" or, if lengthy books are still a bit daunting, "Thief Lord. 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  Malcolm came to our family's home to interview us to try and capture what type of man my brother was.  I must say he did a very poor job.  In all the personal facts written about my brother, the only thing he got correct was the fact that he carried his daughter's ponytail ties in his pocket.  Even though he tape recorded the interviews and took notes, he did not come close to portraying the essence of my brother.  Malcom got names, facts and timelines incorrect.  With so many errors written about my brother, I can only assume he did a poor job with the other fallen soldiers as well.    As for the facts about the battle, he got some of it correct but other areas he embellished or guessed.    I believe there was only one person in my family who read the entire book.  The book was that far off, that it was not even worth finishing.  
 Don't get this router if you plan to play online games like "World of Warcraft" for example. You'll get frequent disconnection for no reason. Otherwise, the router is great for anything else (downloading large files, browsing, checking e-mail, etc) other than gaming. Gamers, stay away from this router 
  The Equidistant Letter Sequence (ELS) Codes are a fascinating subject and possibly one of Man's greatest "archaeological" finds.  There appears to be much to learn yet, but this discovery cannot be dismissed.   Grant Jeffrey's, 'THE MYSTERIOUS BIBLE CODES' is an interesting although flawed look at the ELS Codes, which he has touched upon in some of his earlier books. The cornerstone of this publication is chapters 6 & 7 which address the discovery of the Aramaic name for Jesus (Yeshua) encoded in Old Testament passages concerning the coming Messiah and Redeemer of Mankind. For example, amazingly, "JESUS IS MY NAME" is encoded in the "Suffering Servant" prophecy of Isaiah 53. It appears here and only here.   Twice in the year 2000, I wrote to Mr. Jeffrey. I related how I was a volunteer for a Prison Outreach Program and sometimes utilized his book - making it available to inmates - but I needed clarification on a couple of flaws or typographical errors concerning ELS Codes that he claimed could also be found in some of the Greek New Testament passages.   On page 171 (hardcover) he states that the Greek name for Jesus is located at a 5-letter skip interval in 1st John 5:13, but I was unable to find it in the Greek passage illustrated there. Also, on page 173 he states that the second smallest skip interval for "Jesus" is encoded every 8th letter in Matthew 24:30, which contradicts his later claim on page 176 that the second smallest skip interval for "Jesus" is encoded every 7th letter in John 21:17. These are mutually exclusive statements. I did include a self-addressed, stamped envelope with my queries, but I have yet to receive a reply. I know we call it "snail mail" for a reason, but this is ridiculous!   Jeffrey delights in pointing out how the names of all the apostles and other personages close to Jesus can be found encoded in Isaiah's "Suffering Servant" passage. While it IS intriguing that "Judas" does NOT appear in this passage, Jeffrey neglects to inform his readers that these same names consist of such few letters that they also appear well over 1000 times throughout the book of Isaiah!   Some of Jeffrey's books do contain valuable information and are worth reading. But because he tends to sensationalize and because most of his facts can be found in the books of other writers, it may be advantageous to search other sources first. In his book, 'THE MILLENNIUM MELTDOWN' (1998), Jeffrey stated that the Y2K computer problem WOULD precipitate "a global crisis, the scope of which we have not experienced since World War II....this appointment with destiny cannot be postponed or avoided." THAT BOOK (which thankfully I bought for only an inflated 25 cents in 2002) damaged his credibility forever in MY BOOK!   While I wholeheartedly recommend that you explore the ELS Bible Code topic, I suggest that you acquire 'BIBLE CODE BOMBSHELL' by R. Edwin Sherman instead. Sherman's book is easily the best on the subject as of this date.  Grant Jeffrey opportunistically cranks out nearly a book a year that is second-rate because it never includes an index. ('The Mysterious Bible Codes' is no exception.) Also, each book closes with a proselytizing chapter which (while he may feel it is his obligation to The Great Commission) I find grating. I feel that if the facts are persuasive, they will bring the open-minded to Christ without excessive cajoling.  I read the Bible from Genesis through Revelation every year and still I find much of Jeffrey's contemporary Christian dogma unsupported by Scripture. I don't think he would appreciate that. But then I didn't appreciate my polite enquiries being ignored either. I guess Grant and I have now balanced our BOOKS. (Galatians 6:7 
 I recieved this CD as a present, not thinking much about it since its southern rap  This CD has almost no lyrical talent  The reason I gave it 2 stars, is because I enjoyed the production of some songs that were done by the Neptunes.  Like almost all southern rap now, its got heavy bass but no lyrical talent.  So if your one of those clueless kids that like rap (mainstream rap) I would say you could possible enjoy this cd 
 Whoa...my sisters have this set at their house, which I used extensively last night to cut with. In a word? Terrible.   They have not used them much, and all they had for me was a glass cutting board (I know, terrible). Due to the glass cutting board, I knew these edges, had they been used, would not be terribly sharp.  I made a point of sharpening them on the included steel using the procedure outlined in the manual.  Anyhow, I found myself both struggling and TEARING vegetables when cutting them. To slice red pepper, I was having to pull the remaining portion of the pepper up to tear it off of the piece I *thought* I'd just cut.   Perhaps this is a terribly unfair comparison, as I am used to my Henckels Pro "S" set. But for crying out loud, I didn't think it would be THIS bad.  While I cannot speak for the rest of the Henckels "International" (meaning "Made in Spain, not Germany") line, this set was very much unacceptable. You would literally get a better value buying a Henckels 4-Star Chef's Knife instead of this WHOLE SET. At least you'd get some real use out of it.  The steak knives feel cheap. This is definitely a $60-feeling set, no great "value," in my opinion. I would never, ever, ever buy a Henckels International product after this interlude and will happily return home tonight to my Henkels Pro "S" set...where cutting through ANYTHING is like gliding through soft butter 
 After reading this iconic work, I felt as if I had been ripped off with only myself to blame.  I should have known better.  The book is SOOOOOOO 70's!  I'll give it two stars simply because it's really so out-of-date it's almost campy.    Okay, early oil paintings depicted the upper classes with their "stuff" and the "stuff" of the upper classes.  So?  It's pretty elemental to figure out that those painters had to make a living and they painted for those who were able to pay them.    Duh.  Okay, women were depicted in oil paintings as possessions and, in turn, viewed themselves in the light of the value the possessor placed on them.  Deep and enlightening, huh?  It gets worse.  We get a healthy dose of the "capitalism is bad" philosophy and the hammering that advertising is meant to keep the masses enslaved to capitalism.  Nineteen seventies style collectivism is so boring.  Of course, Berger offers no alternative other than some passing reference to his vague definition of democracy.      Maybe it's just so out-dated, it's no longer relevant.  Maybe it played better to the 1970's.  Maybe we've heard this claptrap for so many years, it's no longer novel or meaningful.  And, maybe, it's because we've matured enough to realize criticism without any offering of alternatives is simply disingenuous and superficial 
 The author had a great idea for a book.  He collected enough 'meat' for about 30-50 pages and then exploded it into almost 500 pages of boring talk, so typical of many historians.    There are a few gems in this book and those few who manage to persevere through the boredom of the text may find it somewhat rewarding.  Had the author written a 50-page book that covers the essence of what he has to offer, this would have been a four or five star book.    
 This can't be Evanovich!  These books stink!  Unfortunately for me, I bought all four of the Full House, Full Tilt, etc.  series all at the same time and have packed them up to give away -- I certainly can't recommend them to anyone I know.  I would like to give this series a "minus" star (negative star?  black hole?), but "1 star" is as low as it goes.  The characters and dialog seem like something a junior high school girl might write for a practice novel and it's something the public should never see.  I LOVE the Stepanie Plum series as well as Evanovich's new book "Metro Girl".  Save yourself some money and time on the Full House series 
 this was an interesting book, but it does not contain hardly any information on women from the south. there are some opinions expressed that show the authors are biased toward the union. so if you are searching for information pertaining to the Confederate women, don't read this book 
 THIS IS THE WORST SOUNDING GUITAR IN THE WORLD. I WAS LOOKING FOR A CHEAP GUITAR BECAUSE I WASN'T REALLY SERIOUS IN PLAYING AND I EXPECTED MUCH BETTER. THE AMP IS THE WORST ONE I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE, THE STRAP IS REALLY BAD QUALITY TOO, I PLAYED ON IT FOR 30 MINUTES A DAY FOR A WEEK AND ITS ALREADY FALLING OFF. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FIRST ACT EVER, THE BRAND IS REALLY CHEAP AND IS GARBAGE 
 If you wish to remain in that happy blissful world of suspended disbelief, where fairy stories continue to charm and inspire, and heroes are held sacred, then by all means never read this book.  "He spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and applied the clay to his eyes, and said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which is translated, Sent). So he went away and washed, and came back seeing." Gospel of John: 9: 6-7.  The intended audience of this work: the permanently cynical (me), writers, and English Literature undergraduates. For undergrads: after mentioning Foucault you quote Polti's structural plot diagnostic in some obfuscated sentence in about your third paragraph of any lit paper and you're on your way to graduating with honors. Heck, you professor won't even read any further and just slap an "A" on the darn thing. For writers: if you are stuck, reading this will send you screaming back to your alphanumeric clavichord faster than a Mustang with a tank full of white lightening and jet fuel.  One of the horrible things about reviewing is you start to think about what you've seen and read. Given man's continued Aristotelian imperative to classify, we also begin to classify written and visual literature. Soon this is distilled to an essence, and soon you read the essence instead of the story. Or the familiar story is re-written in a disguised way, and with such excellent selection of language, you don't care.  Georges Polti made things even worse than Aristotle did, and now there are no new stories under the sun. Instead of a Novel-O-Matic or "Mad-Lib: The Novel" we have Polti's "The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations." Read this and you need never read again, but will always just flip to this most essential of the "Master Plots."  Why 36? Why not. Nice factoring on that handy number, sounds plausible, and didn't Jesus die at 36 years old? Or was it 33? Aren't there "Form Critics" and deconstructionists who hold the Gospels out to be the first novels? Polti hesitates not 
 Really, I hate to use such an overused phrase as the title for my review, but coming up with something clever is really more than this book deserves. You'd think it'd be a safe bet that a book written by people you find funny and endorsed on the back cover by people you find hilarious is going to be a hoot. You'd think that, but you'd be wrong. Instead you'd be left saying, "Jon Stewart, my man, you liked this? Seriously? Are you high? No, wait don't answer that, it's all becoming abundantly clear to me now." 
 These slippers are not a bargain. They fall apart within a few months and then you need to buy another pair again. Don't buy 'em. They're junk 
 I had this book for a curriculum and instruction class and I could not stay awake for more than two pages.  The chapters are extremely long and often repeat the same information 
 I've read some of his pieces online and part of his book and I doubt he's thinking up these opinions by himself. He's just regurgitating what he's heard on the radio 
 Not worth the money. Little explanation of anything especially how he achieved the results he describes. Even the first page is a chart with no explanation. Don't buy if your interested in learning about the Forex. I should have known better with a title like that! 
 I've been an Edguy fan for quite some time, and this EP is very disappointing, to say the least!  If fans want to lower their standards and swallow anything a band throws at them, then go ahead!  As for the fan that made the comment, since when did metal fans become born again Christians?  My response to that is, try having some standards for yourself!  It's not a question of being or not being a Christian!  In my eyes, Edguy has lowered the standards of their music to the nu-metal level, and quite honestly, the band is better than that!  The bottom line is, the music itself is really good, but the lyrics are very bad and distasteful!  Hopefully, this EP isn't an accurate reflection of the upcoming album, but we'll see... 
 Life is too short for this sort of thing. I even gave up on this book listening to an unabridged version on tape. I can't even imagine what reading it would be like with its ultra-dense, paragraph-averse style. Who would have thought that authors were this self-indulgent even back in the 30's!  Skip the entire ridiculously undecipherable book and read the chronology and geneaology in the back! Join the ranks of proud low-brows who have other books to read and enjoy!   
 I was forced to read this, and attend multiple seminars from the Blanchard group.  Our CFO lives by the concepts, and he is running our department into the ground by following them.  The book is mostly fluff and took less than an hour to read.  There is ONE good point that I got from it, and that is when setting goals for people they should be trackable, relevant, and attainable.  I got that message in about 5 minutes though.  The rest anyone should already know -- praise in public and reprimand in private.  No kidding, learned that the first time I got humiliated in grade school.  Skip the book, and polish that resume if you are forced to read it

 Ugh!  Having gone to a small liberal arts college in Ohio and spent much time studying and reading re-tellings of classic fairy tales and myths, I fully expected to love this book.  I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews.  I stubbornly refused to abandon "Tam Lin," but wish I had.  I almost never give away my books, but I couldn't even stand having this one in the house anymore; I donated it to our lending library.  The characters -- the "heroine" included -- are insufferable; if English/Classics majors really spent all their time quoting poetry and spouting dead languages, which is what most of "Tam Lin"'s students do for the vast majority of the book, I would've abandoned my liberal arts college faster than I did "Tam Lin," that's for sure!  I found that I couldn't bring myself to care one ounce about the fates of these characters.  I think I finished only because I wanted to find out which elements of the original ballad the author retained or tried to weave in.  This book does a disservice to the reputation of liberal arts colleges and their students; we are not vapid creatures whose sole focus is to stump each other by finding the most obscure literary quote ever.    All that said, I do think the concept is fantastic.  I don't think it gives anything away to say that the choices made in which book characters replaced particular ballad characters were great.  I just wish that I hadn't despised each and every one of them.  I have loved all of the other "Fairy Tale Series" titles I've been able to get my hands on -- "Jack of Kinrowan," "Fitcher's Bride," "Snow White, Blood Red" -- as well as the relatively new Canongate Myths Series (retellings of Greek myths).  I'd recommend any of those; just not "Tam Lin. 
 This book was extremely difficult to understand. Full of big complicated terms that could have been said in simply easy to understand words.  If all my texts had been like this, I'd never have made it through school.  Not at all appropriate for undergrad work.  It's the only text I sold back, and was glad to get rid of it. A total waste of money. I had to buy another HBSE book just to figure out what this one was trying to say. 
 I bet I'm not the only one who was fooled into thinking this book was a work of fiction.  The cover art looks just like Hillerman's best selling novels.  I liked the lead story, "The Great Taos Bank Robbery", but the  rest were only mildly interesting.  Not worth the price of admission 
 Ok this book is utter [crud]. It starts off ok with an introduction suggesting that something interesting will happen but unfortunetly it rapidly goes down hill. The chacrthers are dull and predictable, there is an awful lot of senseless babbling (talking about painting orasnges orange for 3 pages? oh gosh!) and no rel action. The ending tries to be shocking but is predictable and dull. This is the exact opposite of mice and men. Mice and men is a quick fast pace book with lots of action, interesting charcthers and humour. Thi is [bad]. AVoid at all costs. This really doesn't even desevere a 1 but I couldn't find -999999999999 so this will d 
 Not a single insight. Not a single "aha". Go read something else 
 Diane Stein clearly has a good heart but she is no scholar or theologian. This kind of dabbling in eastern philosophies amounts to a form of racism/imperialism: the assumption of the western new age author that no Tibetan, Indian, or other native Buddhist/Hindu - who would immediately discern the author's lack of scholarly grounding in these ancient religions - is in her readership. Broad, inaccurate statements and erroneous factoids without proper context are retailed as esoteric truths which the author is altruistically passing on.  Sorry. I can appreciate the feminist/egalitarian/debunking agenda, but Diane Stein shows a shocking disrespect in her well-intended liberal condescension and constant essentializing.  Diane, read the late, great Edward Said's "Orientalism" and "Culture and Imperialism" before butchering and packaging eastern philosophical systems! Western readers, please question the source and content of what you read or hear about eastern religions.  
 I guess I'm astonished that anyone would give this book more than one star. While Mr. Moyers clearly makes the profound point that, "half measures avail naught" when trying to achieve sobriety, his current attitudes would seem to convey continuing beliefs that contradict this point.   His "dark humor" did not conceal lingering bitterness, starting with the very quote chosen for the jacket regarding his dad's alleged statement that he hated William C. There is a sad and frustrating mixture of growing insights, stated wryly, followed with what could only be read as continued self pity, resentment, blame and excuses.  The point that Mr. Moyers makes- addictions are a disease and are beyond the scope of reason or direct control once they reach a particular stage is convincingly expressed. The short commercial near the end, to increase public awareness, seems like an afterthought, and indeed, serves to soften the tone of the book.  Even as substance abuse counselor and avid participant of the 12 Step Program of Recovery, I could not help but be bored by the author himself. He seems, still, a tiresome, brooding man, utterly obsessed with his father, still stuck and highly reactive, as evidenced by the constant references to his father's mishandling of events.  He wonders what would have happened if his parents had sought treatment more aggressively for him early on? He speculates about their role in his melanoma-identifying himself as a cancer victim? He manages to be both facetious about his unrealistic expectations regarding his father's performance, alternating with harsh judgments and criticisms that sound ridiculous at best.  His supportive spouse winds up severely depressed, recently, and eating disordered?  Small wonder.  I don't know when I have been more disappointed with, even embarrassed by, what could have been an important memoir. To have had parents and family such as Mr. Moyers has, to have little to complain about beyond being asked to participate in Scouting, is an affront and assault upon the splendid Mr. and Mrs. Bill Moyers.  It is obvious that in picking apart almost all of his dad's lovely letters, William Cope Moyer's attempt to individuate is still in its infancy.  One cannot be acquainted with the character and work of the senior Moyers without feeling the heartbreak that Bill must have felt at reading his son's remarks. Joy at William's enduring recovery may overshadow this sad book, which I believe would have been much better left unpublished, unread. Having an unusual name is hardly a point to be repeatedly made in this highly repetitious and bitter book. If addictions are indeed a disease, they hardly need justification, much less this explaination.     
 Sorry this book has a extremely confused writing style. I don't trust the 5 star reviews at all. This book must be for the way advanced but I'm not a newbie and still have a lot of trouble with it 
 This book is the worst book I ever had since I was born. The author did not do a great job constructing sentences (or should i say did not know how to). His ideas were too vague, his sentences were too confusing and its very impossible to learn and understand American history if one is going to use this book alone, especially if he is not an American who had American history in high school. If you are not American and have no idea of American history and need to use this book, DROP THE COURSE. Its better to drop early than suffer the consequences of failing the course. If there were a -99 rating, I'll give it a -100 
 Reading this pamphlet is one way to spend 20 minutes. However your 20 minutes would be better spent searching online for a book with a bit more "meat" on Japanese carriers 
 I gave this a super bad rating a few months ago - something to the effect of "avoid avoid avoid...at all cost" - which upon review seemed a tad over-the-top.  The things is, as others have reported, this device will take a sharp knife and make it dull. I've never been able to get it to do anything other than leave unsightly scrapes down the length of the blade.   You're better off saving your money for a good steel, which is the only way I've ever been able to keep a Global knife sharp. 
 When Ellen Evans directed this movie she managed to get sex scenes with energy, passion, sensuality, and creativity. Fans of softcore know how rare these things can be. An just how skilled a director has to be to accomplish them. Which make the directors cut of this movie (Which is being sold here) such a mystery. My only guess is that when she was given the chance to reedit this film she wanted a to make a version that she could watch with her 14 year old daughter, or maybe she was trying to get a job at the Hallmark Channel. What ever the reason if you are a fan of the Oxygen Network buy the Directors Cut, if you are fan of softcore get the original version. 
 I think this quote from a review sums this up the best - "As we all know, we have the power to rule ourselves. This being said, what are we waiting for?"  If this were in a book from the world, I would expect a statement like that, but from a professing Christian?  I had control of my life for years and it progressively drove me further and further away from God.  Having control of our own life is the PROBLEM, not the solution.  The solution lies in surrendering control of our lives to the God who created us, not continuing in rebellion against Him.  When I was the ruler of my own life, it led to me breaking every single one of his moral codes that He gave to mankind.  Just look at them (the ten commandments) -   1. I thought I was fine with this one - I didn't believe in Allah or Zeus or any other gods. Of course, I was still nowhere near keeping this one ("don't have any other Gods before me") - there were plenty of other things I put in my life before God. I'd rather sleep in than go to church. I'd rather watch tv than read the Bible, etc.   2. I thought I was fine with this one because I didn't make any silly carved gods or idols. But I still made a god in my image. Every time I would say "why would God..." or "my God wouldn't..." or "I don't think God would...." I was making up a god in my image. Coincidentally enough, it was always happy with the things I was doing, but He was going to get all those other "bad" people. (Also, if you agree with Dr. Schuller that the key to knowing God is self-love and a positive attitude, you're guiltly of breaking this one also)  3. OK, I knew I was guilty of taking the Lord's name in vain and using it as a profanity, which was bad enough, but I was even worse than that. I was calling myself a Christian, yet I lived with my wife for years before getting married, never attended church or even had any idea what the Bible said and basically just living a competely ungodly lifestyle. While using God as a profanity is violating this commandment, what I was doing was taking the Lord's name (i.e. calling myself a CHRISTian) in vain in an even worse sense.   4. I would also admit I was guilty of this one. No matter how you want to interpret the sabbath law, I wasn't putting aside any days for God, they were all for me.   5. Honor your father and mother? Not even close. 'Nuff said.   6. Don't murder? Good, I'm fine on that one - oh wait, Jesus said that whoever hates anyone is a murderer. Got me on that one too.   7. No adultery? I was fine on this one too, I never cheated on my wife. Of course, as I already mentioned, I lived with her for years before we got married. I didn't see this as wrong because I had no idea whatsoever of the seriousness of this in God's eyes. Under God's law the penalty for adultery or any sexual sin was the same as murder. In the New Testament, it is clear that even professing Christians who don't honor their marriage commitments are only fooling themselves. That's because marriage isn't about us. Sure it's a wonderful, beautiful thing for us, but more importantly it was designed as an earthly expression of God's love for His people. Corrupting that gives a distorted picture of who God is which is why it is so badly under attack today, even from professing Christians. Some people think that if you're a Christian, you have to stop liking sex. Not true at all, I love sex. The Bible has a whole book in it about sex. According to 1 Corinthians 7 saying "not tonight dear, I have a headache" is a sin (and just before the guys get too excited about that one, it says that our bodies don't belong to ourselves, but to our spouses, and while the concept is obviously sexual, I think that if your wife wants to use your body to take out the garbage or do the dishes, that qualifies too). But God designed it and it needs to be done his way (and of course I disagreed with this, which took me back to the second commandment). But even more so - I was really in trouble with this one because Jesus said that whoever looks at a woman with lust has already commited adultery. Well, I was in trouble there.   8. Don't steal anything? Well, I never stole anything big so I was fine. Doesn't matter, even when I stole toilet paper from the buildings on campus so that we wouldn't have to buy any for our apartment in college, that's still stealing.   9. Don't lie. See my comments on honor your father and mother (which is actually kind of ironic, since when I tried to proclaim my honesty, sometimes I'd say "well, I lie to my parents sometimes, but that's ok.")   10. Don't covet. See those same comments again. Don't want something that doesn't belong to you - if I told you that I've always kept this commandment, you'd probably die laughing and you don't even know me.   But God's a loving God?  (these quotations are all from the New Testament and written TO CHRISTIANS)  "Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God." (1 Cor 6:9-10)  "For this you know, that no fornicator, unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore do not be partakers with them." (Eph 5:5-7)  "Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God." (Gal 5:19-21)  The reason Dr. Schuller's television show and books are so popular is because people want to feel good about themselves while continuing in their sins and yet still feel that somehow they'll still get to go to heaven when they die.  But there's one problem with this - why did Jesus have to die?  Dr. Schuller's gospel has no answer for this question.  But the Bible does.  The Bible looks at the sins that you and I have committed (and after reading that list, if you can honestly say that you have not sinned.... well, I have no answer for that other than to pray for you) and say that we deserve hell.  Hell is a real place (not just low self-esteem or any kind of hell on earth that we can imagine) full of pain and torture.  It's what we deserve, but God loves us and doesn't want us to go there.  So He took all those sins that you and I have committed and paid the price for them Himself.  He took the penalty for our transgressions so that we don't have to.  That's the true Gospel, and you can accept that forgiveness.  All you need to do is stop believing in a self-love gospel and recognize sin for what it is - sin.  Then turn from those sins and put your full trust in Jesus.  Stop reading these books and start reading God's Word - the Holy Bible.  He will not let you down.  You will move from death to life, your final destination will change from hell to heaven.  Please at least take the time to look into what I'm saying.  Right now there's a million and one things I'd rather be doing (and some I should be doing) than typing a review for something I completely disagree with, but I'm doing this for the exact reason that I mentioned above - HELL IS REAL WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IT OR NOT!  God doesn't want you to go there (just look at all the agony He suffered so you wouldn't have to) and I don't want you to either.

 What ever happened to common sense? In this book the average American doesn't exist. I am not denying the problems that exist in the inner cities. I am denying that this is life for the average American or even the average non-white American. Comparing two extremes - best case vs. worst case is always going to give you an unrealistic picture. We live in a capitalist economy, there will always be haves and have-nots. What he is pushing for is a socialist or communist system where everyone is equally miserable and those that manage to get ahead are then forced to pay the way for those who can't or won't. Hey Mr. Kozol - last time I checked there was no army on the borders of Camden or East St. Louis keeping people from moving out, and there is noone forcing anyone to accept the lifestyle they were born into. He offers a view of the problems with no real solution except maybe to hate the rich - Mr. Kozol, how much money did you get paid to write this book?? Utter liberal garbage. Conveniently leaves most of American schools totally out of the equation, only focusing on the worst cases and then comparing them to the top schools in the nation. 
 Please read David Maces's review. I bought mine about two years ago and just today the plastic part mentioned by Mr. Mace failed. A sturdy, sleek can opener is now going to the trash permaturely because Hamilton Beach does not provide a replacement part

 Based on C/Net reviews, Amazon.com reviews and reviews by ilounge I decided to get the V55 versus the iFlip. The reviews I had seen on-line were fairly accurate, but I think [the reviewers] were too enamored with style over function.   The V55 is very well built. It's solid, ipod integration is very nice, and there is excellent fit and finish. The speakers provide pretty good sound, and make a good portable system for use on the road. In fact, the reviews used this as one of the real descriminators. But when am I going to use this without headphones? For me at least, a better sounding audio system isn't as important on a device like this.  Additionally, the importance of an IR remote is over-sold for a personal device, at least for my personal use profile in airplanes and other vehicles.  All else being the same - these would have been selling points for the V55. However, all else is not equal. There are two flaws which are driving me to return the product:  1) No 4:3 aspect ratio selection. Now many posters at ilounge had discussed this issue, and recent posts claimed this problem was fixed with a menu selection, but the unit I bought on Dec 30, 2006 does not allow selection of 4:3. I sent multiple messages to SI and received a response from Nick stating that there was not a firmware fix available for the unit. That leaves only a few possible conclusions: a) There is no fix and the few posts of a fix are 'planted' b) There is a fix in new units, but the vendor is unwilling to offer a firmware upgrade c) There is a fix and there is no way to upgrade the unit's firmware  C) is the most likely scenario, but in any case it's a deal breaker. To me - watching i-tunes downloaded video in 'wide-head' mode is simply not acceptable for a product in this price category. I don't mind re-ripping my DVDs with the proper wide screen aspect ratio, but there is no way to play native 4:3 video without video stretching.  2) The V55 battery doesn't provide power to the ipod. The ipod battery drains as the V55 system is being used. The cheaper competition keeps the ipod battery topped off, so when the video system drains you still have a fully charged ipod for your portable use. Also if your ipod battery is drained you cannot use the V55. Again, not so with the cheaper competing product.  I'll do my wrap-up by repeating the V55 is a very well built product. It's look and feel is very nice, and if I didn't have to contend with issue #1 I would probably live with issue #2. However, there appears to be no way to assure you'll get a unit with the firmware upgrade (if it exists).  I cannot recommend the V55 
 This book is an opinionated overview of some scientific literature relating to human behavior, intermixed with a conservative political agenda and some light-hearted humor.  The book is divided into 4 sections: "In the Beginning" (a scientific history of the world, from the Big Bang to the evolution of humans), "The Rise of Humanity" (hormones and human behavior), "The World Today" (discussion of recent social changes), and "A Look Ahead" (possible futures).  End material includes a short annotated list of books for further reading (8 books plus a list of interesting authors), and an index.  There are no footnotes, endnotes, or other forms of citation of source materials.  I found the best part of the book to be the second section, in which Gilbert summarizes much research regarding innate human behavior relating to gender, romantic pairing, work, and child raising.  While I found little of this information new, Gilbert does an admirable job of presenting it in non-technical language for general readers.  Unfortunately, his complete avoidance of citation makes it impossible to check the accuracy or reliability of his points.  He also tends to overlook facts that would not be supportive of his general thesis that women should be pregnant and raising babies while men are out gathering resources for the family.  For example, after summarizing various statistics about how pregnancy and childbirth reduce risk factors for certain cancers, he states "Early pregnancy, multiple pregnancies, and breastfeeding are simply healthy. Childbirth carries risk, of course, but so does crossing the street or taking an aspirin. Not giving birth seems riskier still." Phew!  I guess he's never heard of the term "maternal mortality."  One of the main claims of the book is that boys and men are being done a disservice by a politically correct agenda which seeks to make the educational and work environments unisex.  As support, Gilbert calls on studies that found children learn better in gender-segregated schools, but suggests that such gender-segregation should be abandoned by the college years "when the maturing sexes really do belong together." (Why stop gender segregation after high school?  The research that supports gender segregated education certainly doesn't show that the advantages of gender segregation are not also found in college-aged students as well.)  He rails against Title IX legislation, which required educational institutions that provide sports programs to provide equal opportunities for men and women athletes, since he feels that by nature, men have stronger physical and mental needs to participate in competitive sports.  (While he supports his arguments against Title IX with examples of perhaps absurd situations in which popular men's programs have been cut so that women's sports with sparse participation could be funded, he entirely overlooks the fact that before Title IX, athletic women had an almost impossible battle to be able to find any playing field to compete on at many schools).  In Gilbert's view, the world would be a better place if women would stick to child-raising and house-keeping, and leave the workplace free for men to live out their genetically determined hunter/gatherer/impregnator behaviors.  He cites hundreds of societal ills, from declining test scores to the widening gap between rich and poor, implicitly suggesting that they all go back to feminism and the re-gendering of society.  In his argument that gender-linked human behaviors are innate and should determine societal structure, Gilbert overlooks normal genetic variation.  While on average, men are taller than women, there are millions of individual women who are taller than millions of individual men.  Likewise, there are no doubt millions of individual women whose competitive urges outpace those of individual men, and many men whose desire to focus on child raising is stronger than the desire of many women to do the same.  In the realignment of society that has occurred particularly in the latter half of the last century, legislation and societal mores have changed so that individuals are freer to follow their own specific genetically determined behaviors.  Brilliant, competitive women are no longer confined to housework, but are free to pursue professional careers if they wish, while their husbands can stay at home with the children if that better suits their temperament.  No society is perfect, and we are far from achieving a perfect match between inherent personality traits and roles in society, but the proposals of this book would take us backwards, not forwards in allowing people to live up to their genetic potential. 
 I thought this book was all over the place, but maybe that was because I only read it before I went to bed. There were flashbacks and flash forwards and I thought the author was trying to be overly clever.  None of the characters were really that interesting to me.  It was sad that Jean didn't really have any friends and to be so old and know practically no one.  Wow!  I hope I don't end up like that when I am her age.  How could a married couple go on for 30 or 40 years and never tell each other such basic things.  What a miserable life!  I am glad this book was short or I would have put it down sooner.  I am not sure if I would read any of her other books.  I do like the fact that it is set in North Carolina, which takes me back home.  I thought this was a boring book with little moral value for me.  It is probably because I couldn't relate to the characters because I just don't live my life in total isolation.  Others might get more out of it that have life experiences that mirror these characters 
 This book is widely known as a classic, but the reader is left wondering "why?" Protagonist (can't call him a hero) of this novel is poor farmer Ethan Frome, who lives a joyless existence with his hypochondriac wife. He finds some "excitement" when Mattie comes to visit, but again, the reader wonders why, because she's vapid and uninteresting.  To recap: we're presented with characters that aren't the least bit likable to begin with, and turn pages eagerly waiting for The Happy Ending. Instead, Wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable. I feel like I wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book. WHY??? 
 After reading this very badly written book my concern is how I am ever going to trust St. Martin's Press again. This book should never have been published by a company with such a trustworthy track record. Clearly, some house cleaning needs to be done at St. Martin's Press.   The plot development and character development have all the ear markings of a novice writer. Characters are trite, clichéd and very unbelievable. The lead character, Lin Breedlove, is one of the most unsympathetic and unlikable characters in current fiction. So much of Haywood Smith's personal bitterness is encapsulated in this character that you find yourself wishing Ms. Smith had spent a little more time in therapy, following the breakup of her own marriage, instead of charging readers the price of a book for her personal catharsis.   Ms. Smith has created a lead character so misguided, angry and judgmental that the story is painful to read. Some of her misguided beliefs include: Everyone in California has a sexually transmitted disease, you can get venereal disease by sitting on a chair at a wine bar, any man who wants sex without a lifelong commitment is an evil piece of trash and Democrats are bad. Smith barely misses a chance to toss an insult at Democrats, Bill Clinton in particular. So, Democrats beware. You are paying good cash to read a very bad novel and be insulted.   But even more unsettling is the self-righteous world view that masquerades as plot in this novel. It is not only bad writing but a true disregard for one's readers.  There are so many plot mistakes in this book, which should have been caught by Smith or the editors at St. Martin's Press, that I wonder if anyone actually read the final manuscript. At one point in the book, we are told Lin Breedlove first met her ex-husband in college. At another point in the book, we are told she first met him when she was 14 years old. Lin Breedlove criticizes and judges anyone and everything outside her personal sphere of experience and comfort, then harshly deals with anyone who dares criticize her.   The dialogue reads like text lifted from the latest self-help books and very bad pop psychology. What is designed to come off as a feminist point of view is, ultimately, Smith's own shrill cry of personal pain.   One of the most unsettling elements of the book is Smith's constant quoting of scripture, mingled with talk of ten-inch erections, dildos and oral sex. Both subjects, certainly, ideal components of a good novel. Mixed together by Smith's less than deft writing talent? Ummm...yuk.  And, personal note to Ms. Smith - Jerry Mather's of "Leave it to Beaver" fame is not gay.   One last point, there were so many typos in my copy of this book, that it is clear nobody proofed the final draft.   A true waste of money.  
 I bought 3 fleece with different size but the Size of the fleece are not proper. Though it says Medium / Large / XL, everything was in same size and the length is not proper as the measurement mentioned. 
 I bought this toy for my nephew for Christmas. It didn't even work from the get-go. 
 I got this game because I thought it would be fun. I was totally wrong! Every customer that I got brought only rabbits. Rabbits, rabbits, rabbits!!! This game confused me a lot. Also, it gets very boring. And, it's very hard to control. Don't waste your money on this game! It will be a total waste of your money. Believe me 
 This book is total waste of time and money... I think the purpose is not giving insights about how to make a business, how to fund it... If you want to learn something about start-ups and how to finance them... Go and buy Lightspeed Business... Do not waste your time with this book.. 
 VERY DISAPOINTED -NOT REALLY A BOOK ON TRUE MEMPHIS BBQ BUYERS BEWARE-- 
 Buyer beware: this Elektra version of the wonderful Judy Collins "Colors of the day" has bad mastering. The tape Elektra used was obviously played back with Dolby-C, while not encoded as such. This disc should have been taken off the market. Try and find the gold disc instead 
 I STILL have not received this DVD.  It was ordered on 12/8/06 and was supposed to ship on 12/12/06.  I am very upset that it did not arrive as it was a Christmas gift.  I cannot rate the product as I don't have it.  I sent an e-mail through Amazon to jrmovies several days ago and have not heard from them.  I would appreciate a response or a refund 
 Why would anyone bother to read this when there is the lonely planet guide available? This is in my opinion a vastly inferior guide when compared not just to lonely planet but to many of the others available, it lacks  organisation and detail 
 Contrary to the one other reviewer of this book, I was very dissappointed.  I want a traditional wedding with a flare.  This book shows very out of the ordinary flower ideas that everyday people will not and cannot use.   However, the book does show a few nice 'flowers in your hair' ideas, but  for the price of this un-inspiring book, it is Not worth it.  Spend your  money elsewhere 
 This album was boring and bland. I bought it because I very much liked Conjure One's first album (I thought it sounded similar to Balligomingo's Beneath the Surface- somewhat pop, but very melodic and soothing too), but this album wasn't nearly as good. 'Endless Dream' is the only good song, and maybe 'Extraordinary Way'. The rest aren't bad, but aren't interesting, either. I reserve this album for background music 
 I just got this figure in the mail and I have to say that it is really nice looking. I have it up on my mantle now and it looks a=even better out of it's packaging. It is a must have for Kings, Gretzky, and NHL fans. Id rate the pose a 10 out of 10, it was from when he got the points record in Edmonton. This figure would get 5 stars if it wasn't for the assembly. You have to put Wayne's legs on and normally the leg assembly is easy but thios was just horrific. It is possible, but I had to use tons of soap and water just to get the legs in, and then it wasn't easy. But I think that it is definately worth it. 
 I bought this book because I thought I was going to gain insights about organic gardening.  I was sorely disappointed.  The beginning chapters drone on and on about a move to a new home site...I grew tired of hearing detailed descriptions of the doomed home.  Also, while the author went on about eating locally to lessen the impact on the environment from long distance travel, I was disturbed to hear about the home she bought being leveled and taken to a landfill and to hear about her endless trips back and forth between her old home and new one.  Finally, I was disturbed by her chapter dealing with animal drownings and killings and disagree with her statement that "if we don't kill animals, we will starve".  I'm sorry I spent the money on this book 
 This man is so bad ! anyway is your choice  
 As someone who lived (and, I guess, is still living) the life of a "gifted" person, I'm not terribly surprised by what I found in this book.  Many of the problems held by gifted students originate not from parents but from bureaucrats--people who want to figure out how best to control their talents for profit.  There isn't much profit for the parents themselves, so where's the profit going to come from?  Other than those kids marked by stock brokers and scientists for high-paying jobs, what's left?  Political profit, of course, and this is Quart's real goal.  Quart simply oppresses her topic into non-existence unless it can produce the right kind of person that will be sure to vote the right way.  Scrabble players, spelling bee kids, math geniuses...they're all weird at best and dangerous at worst, *especially* if they've been home-schooled or attend church.  Competitors in chess are hyper-competitive, but (surprisingly?) kids participating in politically-charged poetry slams are "encouraging" and "supportive".  She weeps for school districts that support the gifted and thereby thwart the  "equal results" that certain political groups seek, yet cannot find anything but disdain for programs that support the results of all students  simply (and clearly) because of the political party that happened to begin it.  Her descriptions of her subjects are caricatured so badly that one cannot have any faith in the descriptions.  And, as some have noted below, she has played loose and fast with those she quotes in order to make the right sort of case.  If you have the ability to ignore or refute the author's opinions through basic critical-reading skills, you can get a basic idea of the sorts of issues faced by the gifted.  If not, look elsewhere 
 This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever wasted my time watching! Don't dispose a precious cent on this movie unless you are a gigantic Drew Barrymore fan and you are merely viewing the movie for the raw sex scenes and constant,random nudity. The storyline could have worked, yet the movie is pathetically low budget, the acting is horrid and the movie falls desperately flat. It is impossible to like this movie unless you are obsessively in love with Drew Barrymore and you want to watch her at her lowest point. It's so bad that I had to come here to  vent about it online. The director was obviously a film school drop-out who offered the actors free cocaine and produces low budget porn. 
 This is my 3rd Nora Roberts book.  I've read the first 2 in the 3 Sisters trilogy, and decided to read Chesapeake Blue while I (very eagerly) await Face the Fire in the mail.  Perhaps I was spoiled by the characters, the conflicts, and the love stories in 3 Sisters, but this book pales in comparison.  The Quinns are meant to be a family whose perfect and deep love for one another is tempered by a course and affectionate manly banter.  Sort of like 7th Heaven meets a beer commercial.  Anyways, Seth is supremely talented, handsome, kind, and sizzling in the sack; in other words, a stock Nora Roberts male character.  Alas, he is also entirely thick-headed, vain, and has the mental processes of a mule when faced with his "problem", which he only exacerbates over the course of the book.  So he has a floozy of a mother who blackmails him into huge sums of money on pain of, what, her leaking a story to the press which, once she removes all the parts that reflect poorly on her, would be about 2 sentences long?  And, he can't tell his troubles to his family that he loves "so" much?  I mean, I wouldn't tell Cam anything myself, because he seems to deal with every moment of emotion by pitching someone off the end of a pier in a fit of manly love.  But Anna and the rest seem like good candidates for a chat.  Finally, Drusilla.  First, the name makes her sound like a villian in a Disney movie.  Second, she is flat as a pancake, and I would pay for problems like hers.  At the very end, she exhibits a spark of life, and sort of morphs into another stock Nora Roberts stock character: the sassy, smart, no-nonsense, gal who steps up to defend her man.  Which, I like that character.  In my limited experience, Nora Roberts writes female friendships and falling in love brilliantly, but her male friendships need a few less put-downs and jaws clenched to supress brotherly emotion.  And, I agree with the other reviewers who wanted Seth to end up with Aubrey.  
 First of all, consider the question that Lewis is trying to ask. What went wrong with the 'Middle East' and their 'failure' to modernize? And now think about how big this book is, about 150 pages. The 'Middle East' is a huge area extending from Morocco to Iran and he attempts to explain their 'failure' to modernize by reviewing the last years of the Ottoman Empire. That is just plain lazy work on the part of a historian who is supposed to be revered in his field.   Another issue is that he constantly refers to the 'Middle East' as 'Islam' as though Islam is homogenous or even centered in the Ottoman Empire. Granted the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire was also the Caliph but the Twelver Shi'is don't consider him to be legitimate anyway. To consider Islam to have some kind of collective thought process when encountering the 'West' is reprehensible. Consider now the fact that the majority of Muslims don't even live in the Middle East or the Ottoman Empire. How can Lewis truthfully use the term 'Islam' in his book to refer to the entity that 'went wrong' when the area he's speaking about doesn't even constitute the majority of Muslims in the world!?   This book is a quick read for people who aren't in the field to think that they're informed about what is going on in the scary area known as the 'Middle East'. The worst part is that the only people who would know that this is full of holes and lacking greatly in background and professionalism are the people who wouldn't normally read it anyway. This is a dangerous book because the name Bernard Lewis is synonymous with Expert in Middle East affairs. This was a lazy, half hearted attempt to cash in on people's ignorance and only perpetuates the wrong ideas in people's minds. Bad Lewis, very very bad. Any 'liberal historian' who suggests this book should be beaten with this book, unfortunately for us the book is very thin so it will take a while to bring him down with it.  If you want better sources, look to John Esposito, Albert Hourani and Nikki Keddie. All of them have published widely and lack the obvious political biases of Bernard Lewis. Check them out. 
 Virtually unreadable, and really not worth the effort.  Certainly that designation has been applied to the entire oeuvre of this, America's poet laureate of the South, but this novel at least lends some strength to that criticism.  This is Faulkner at his worst, employing his obfuscatory style to hide the fact that he has very little to say.  The plot revolves around a down-and-out newspaper reporter who shows up to cover a traveling air show in the sleepy fictional southern town of New Valois in the early 20th Century.  He finds himself drawn into the personal lives of a family of barnstormers (two husbands, one wife, and one son), and plenty of hard drinking, brawling and barnstorming ensues.  Faulkner was always fascinated by airplanes, and readers who are old enough to remember those halcyon days might find this a fascinating   reminiscence of a somewhat sordid era in aviation history.  But ultimately, this story is about the culture clash between the reporter, who cares about people too much, and the aviators, who care only about the amazing machines that they daily risk their lives in.  Sadly, this man vs. machine conflict is badly dated, even by 20th Century standards, and doesn't fully succeed on any level.  Of course one has to admire the sheer technical mastery of Faulkner's writing, but much of the real emotional power of his work usually comes from his use of archetypes:  the Earth Mother, the Mighty Hunter, the Soulless Businessman, the Righteously Angry Negro, the Guileless Innocent, etc.., and these archetypes not only make the story more significant - mythic, even - but they often help guide us through the complexities of the plot.  In this novel the characters seem not only very specific, but very small; they are neither familiar nor important.  Careful readers may be able to follow the plot of this novel, but there seems little enough impetus to bother doing so.  We care less about this particular group of losers than any such in Faulkner.  So while this drunken tale of planes, money and desire may find favor with completists, the rest of us would do better to get our Faulkner fix by re-reading one of his magnificent Yoknapatawpha County classics 
 I purchased this years ago and tried to read it but found it hopeless.  The style, mistakes and flat out omissions make this useless.  Wheelock's Latin is far better and worth the money for textbook as well as the workbook 
 This book is a random jamble of oddly-assembled cliches without direction or application. The writing style is comprised mainly of four to five word sentences, run together with little regard to flow or building a point.  References are often cited with no explanation, and often as many as six references are made to other chapters within a single paragraph.  The most useful advice in this book is "read articles or books about..." the topic at hand.  At least the author admitted in this instance that he has no idea what he's talking about and had the decency to refer the reader elesewhere for advice.    It's no surprise that no real publisher picked up this horrible book. It's easy to see this isn't as much a book as it is a collection of old-school powerpoint slides smashed together into a "book" 
 This book didn't teach me anything I didn't already know.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 I bought this dictionary before going to Iceland for a year as an exchange student.  It was useful for the very, very basics...sometimes.  I found it frustrating when I couldn't find words in it that I commonly heard in  conversation.  The lack of cross-references, as noted by another reviewer,  serves only to make the book smaller and more useless.  If you really want  a useful dictionary, do what I did and buy one in Iceland 
 Wow. Perhaps I'm just missing some awesome thing about the Stooges, but I was thoroughly unimpressed by this album. I only found 2 tracks that were listenable, "1969" and "No Fun" both of which sound pretty mainstream for the time period. The rest was some bizarrely boring attempt at being progressive or intriguing that in my opinion failed. I can't say too little about this album 
 A book well written but unfortunately highly biased justifying the russian atrocities. Certainly war is by itself an atrocity, but that do not allows an army to commit barbaric actions against women and children 
 I brought this book after reading the reviews of the many people it has clearly helped.  I have suffered from chronic neck pain for many years now.  I wondered if the chronic nature of my pain could be due to emotional or other reasons.   Unfortunately, the book did not help.  It appears that either this is not the cause or I am in the small group of people that Dr Sarno believes need counseling.    One thing I did find frustrating was the abruptness with which the book ended.  Dr Sarno concludes that some people will need counseling to achieve relief.  However he provides no guidance about the type of counseling or what sort of issues may need to be addressed.  I got to the end of the book with no where else to go.  I couldn't envision going to a psychologist and saying "I have neck pain, help me discover what is causing it".    I have since decided that this is not the cause of my problem.  It appears to be an intermittent physical problem.  So far my I've found that yoga and remedial massage have been the most successful in controlling my problem.  Regular yoga in particular often provides weeks and weeks of relief.  This book didn't help me, but from the many glowing reviews it has obviously helped many other people.  Mostly, I wrote this review so that people would be aware that it doesn't work in all cases.   
 Been working with mine for about a week, and am disappointed to report that the negative reviews are spot on.  I too had trouble linking it to the PC. Ran into the hardware flow thing. Easy enough to solve after an email to customer support, but they were vague enough that someone less experienced with the windows device manager might have trouble.  But the main reason I don't like it is that scanning is slow and not accurate enough. Really, you're better off with dragon speaking naturally, or just typing.  The whole thing feels like it's 15 years behind the times. The interface is horrible. The PC connection is deadly slow. The software is junk. (Can we at least import notes into a text file? WTF is a .qnt file? Now I've got to screw around getting that into a program I actually can use!) One really has the sense that these guys aren't putting any effort into keeping up with technology. These guys should look at an iPod. Given how much they skimped on everything else (program, connectivity, interface, screen, memory, chip, etc) I have no reason to think that this is a particularly good scanner.  A friend of mine has a C-Pen 20. That scans much faster, but has to be plugged in. C-pen used to sell portable versions, but I emailed their American distributer and found that they only have the wired one.  Total disappointment. As a graduate student, this device could have changed my life. Instead, it'll sit in a drawer, reminding me of the money I blew on it.  Bottom line: useles 
 This product is a sad joke.  It's expensive of course.  The paper is just heavyweight paper that's perforated so you can bend it and break out the inserts themselves... which takes some effort (not sure if it'd be quicker just getting heavyweight paper and using a paper cutting board).  But, whatever.    However, the software is crap.  That's the appropriate term.  Reading this I can save you an hour of your precious time.  No you can't make the template show right-side up.  That's right... to use the software you have to TILT YOUR HEAD SIDEWAYS.  I'm not kidding!  I guess you could also turn your monitor on it's side.  You can rotate the text so it shows the way it should.  But when you edit it, it'll be sideways again.  So you'll have to turn your head (or monitor) back and forth sideways.  What kind of company would sell such a product?   And oh yeah... if you're looking for templates for the DVD Inserts?  ... nada.  They're not there!  
 My local radio morning show was raving about this book, so I just had to order it.  What they didn't mention was that this book is FULL of the "F" word, and many of the notes are very sexually explicit.  May be a selling point for some, but not for me.  I just received it today, and it's now in the recycle bin.  Was going to give it to my husband for Christmas...glad I opened it first 
 I was, overall, disappointed by this CD.  There are many good reviews here, but they generally overpraise.  Tracks 4 through 8 have too much synthesizer for my ears.  A major highlight is track 9, The Crab and the Egret, but interestingly, the flute is accompaniment to the wondrous Chinese percussion.  Disappointingly, the CD is only 40 minutes long and left me wanting more tunes without synthesizer accompaniment 
 Gardner's book is full of banal and often incorrect observations. It's hard to believe he has received over 20 honorary degrees from universities around the world if his ideas are this unoriginal. He chooses the staggeringly bad examples of Margaret Thatcher, George Bush and BP CEO John Browne as people who have successfully changed minds. He doesn't mention that Thatcher and Bush antagonized large sections of their countries' populations, completely failing to change their minds, in fact hardening their positions of opposition; in large part due to these leaders' own refusal to ever change their minds or consider alternative policies. Gardner lavishes praise on Bush for switching from isolationism to an interventionist foreign policy after 9/11, without any mention of the PNAC team that had already planned to invade Iraq even before 9/11.   As for John Browne, his claim to have repositioned BP as an environmentally and socially concerned company has been discredited in the past year with the explosion at a Texas refinery and the oil spill on the North Slope that led to the admission that BP hadn't done any of the anti-corrosion work it was supposed to do on its pipelines.   Another poor example is Lawrence Summers of Harvard. For some reason Gardner doesn't mention the biggest controversy Summers was involved with, when he said that women could never be as good at science as men. Gardner's use of case studies from academia is another bad choice because most readers won't have heard of these professors and won't care much about their internal disputes. It's a shame Gardner didn't tackle any real-life problems, such as how to change the minds of Creationists.   Gardner insists on using "she" and "her" instead of "he" and "his" as the neutral pronoun for political correctness, and another irritating habit he has is to invent jargon that will obviously never catch on, such as "wetware" and "dryware" for the internal workings of the brain and "GoodWork" for being ethical at work, yet another painfully banal concept.   In one section Gardner describes how a psychologist uses a patient's dream to understand how the patient sees himself (or should I say herself even if he was male?) in relation to others, which sounds to me like total cod psychology, but that's just my own reaction to dream interpretations.   Regarding computers, Gardner believes that people are starting to prefer interaction with computers over interaction with other people. This again is utterly mistaken and it's clear that Gardner has next to no experience with the internet. Thanks to the internet there has been an explosion in human interaction and far more people talk with other people than with computers. Gardner says people can get emotional solace from interaction with computers that are programmed to communicate and cites a book written in 1995, but gives no further justification of this claim.   Anyone writing about changing minds ought to have a full understanding of how people use the internet and communicate on all kinds of levels that weren't possible before this technology existed, for example role-playing or participating in a political discussion forum, as well as absorbing surreptitious marketing on the internet.   Gardner's specific advice on how to change minds consists of using a variety of words that all begin with "re" for convenience, eg resonance and resistance. I had hoped to learn how to communicate my ideas better from this book, but all I learnt was that it was a bad book. 
 'If these walls could talk' was dissapointing. It was too disjointed for me to gat any real understanding of the message. I would not suggest any of my peers to purchase the dvd 
 while I appreciate what Tipler was attempting to accomplish, he fails miserabley both from a theological and a scientific perspective.  skip this one! 
 The Songlines is unfortunately two books in one and they do not really gel.  Each separately would of received more stars.  It starts quite well as a narrative of his time in Alice Springs and the aboriginal culture he explored.  This is very readable and quite educational (and would of scored 4 -5 stars).  Unfortunely at about halfway through books he starts putting in little quotes in sequence often for 20 - 30 pages which interupts the story line of the other 'book'.  He really should of pulled the quotes out and built them into a second novel.   In the end though the book became a struggle to read because it no longer flowe 
 If I could, I'd rate these as -5 stars.    I read the reviews, and decided to try these for myself.  During the first wash,the sheets shrank a little bit for a snug fit on the mattress.  What was really disappointing was how SMALL the pillowcases became, short by a good 5 inches.  They NEVER completely covered our standard pillows.  During the second wash, the sheets shrank EVEN MORE.  It took us a good 10 minutes to wiggle the fitted sheet onto our mattress.  Don't even get me started on how small the pillow cases became after the second wash.  Now, as far as pilling, it took a couple of months, but they have become extremely rough.  They look extremely ratty and the sheets are only 2 months old.  My OLD sheets were nicer, but no longer fit on the (new) thicker mattress.  I will NEVER BUY WAMSUTTA sheets again.  Don't waste your money.  We are extremely disappointed customers 
 I bought this for my 6 year old after Christmas as her cousin received one and loved it.  I ran all over town trying to find the PVD's (which are hard to find a good selection of).  I ended up purchasing some online.  By the time the PVD's arrived, the player was no longer working.  We have replaced the batteries several times.  On a rare occasion, it will turn on, but that is very rare.  We are very disappointed with this unit.  I should have listened to my husband and bought the DVD player!  
 A tired, tedious read. Very difficult to finish. I finally skipped ahead to see the end. 
 Regarding the intent of the American Idol competition, Simon Cowell has put it nicely and correctly on numerous occasions.  He constantly reminds, "This is a singing competition.  Not a dancing competition.  Not a beauty pageant.  Not an acting contest!"  Pretty correct if you ask me.  Along comes DREAM GIRLS and it seems high time that the Academy Awards heeded Cowell's astute advice in the reverse.  Someone at the Oscars needs to wake up and realize that the Academy Awards is not a singing competition.  Instead it's all about the acting and, arguably, DREAM GIRLS offers the definitive case in point.  To put it bluntly, Jennifer Hudson's acting performance was, for lack of a better description, hilarious.  The girl can't act and yet she toted away one of the preeminent Oscars of the year.  But don't take my word for it.  Virtually every serious movie critic, when considering DREAM GIRLS, noted what I have already stated.  They all agreed that Hudson's performance was amateurish at best and that she would, nonetheless, win because of her singing.  Think about it.  The movie was nominated for more awards than any other film and came away virtually empty-handed.  Now why is that?  Quite simply it's because the movie fell flat and considerably short of the movies that ultimately won.  Most honest critics, as well, were quick to note that, had things gone the way they should have, Eddie Murphy would have won and not Hudson.  Some have even been so bold as to note that Murphy's singing is nearly as good as Hudson's.  I heartily agree.  But, then, the Academy Awards continue their downhill slide toward being totally hilarious in their own right.  Anymore, movies seem to win more on the basis of PR and marketing campaigns than on actual merit.  And, as DREAM GIRLS and Hudson illustrate, sometimes it seems the Academy likes to promote a controversy as much as an actual success.  Watch this one if you want a good laugh.  Other than that don't waste the time or the money.  THE HORSEMAN 
 Almost unbelievably bad, except I saw the remake of 'Shaft,' which should have been a forewarning.  This is like a comic book for filmgoers.  No, not a graphic novel adapted to the screen.  More like a comic book for kids, that you'd be embarassed to own at any age.  Doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack, a travesty to the nth degree.    
 If I could give a rating less than 1 star, I would have. The book did start out well. Julien was the perfect hero so in love with the heroine. And Kate the perfect endearing heroine. But when Julien asked Sir Oliver (father) for Kate's hand in marriage, Kate got so angry at Julien and started to hate him- as in really loathe him. Isn't it but proper during that era for the man to ask permission from the father first before proposing to the woman? So why is Kate so angry? Julien tried to win her by showing her everything a woman would die for- his love, his comfort and his social standing. What more does she want? But she scorns him and hates him even more. And her hatred lasted until almost the end of the book. Truly unbelievable. How utterly boring and irritating. There was no special moment that made my heart flutter. Kate is not endearing at all. I even hate her already for being so irrational- and so stubborn. Doesn't she know how lucky she is to catch Julien??? Also, if Kate is really a troubled woman, shouldn't it show from the 1st page? She was a carefree, independent and so happy woman. Not at all the characteristic of someone who is troubled with the child abuse and the regular physical abuse of her father. I did not even finish the book. I gave it a try until the 300th page, but couldn't continue anymore for it is just a waste of my precious time. There was also no reason why Julien would rape Kate. He never even tried to be intimate with her at any point in the book. It's just so stupid. The writing style is good though- but the plot is just so bad! I can go on and on... but in the end all I want to say is- Do not waste your time and money with this book. Really- it's not romantic at all. Kate's actions will make you roll your eyes 
 This book is rampant with gramatical and typographical errors. For example, on page 42 there are two errors alone. The gramatical errors are forgiveable, but when the recipe calls for "1/4" of something, you are sometimes left to wonder if that 1/4 is a teaspoon, cup, gallon, who knows.  On a positive note, there is at least a wide variety of recipes. 
 Now I try to limit my caffeine intake to the bare minimum, like in tea.  I do not drink coffee.  So when I took Stacker 3 (just ONE PILL) I was jittery and could not fall asleep.  I stayed wide awake the whole night and through the day.  I felt nauseus too.  Now this was probably because I don't drink coffee or anything that has a lot of caffeine in it, but I don't recommend Stacker 3 anyway 
 ok heres the deal. jaci is an average singer that has a hype of this superwonderful voice and powerhouse. it's not true. her voice is nice at best and her songs are (generally) trite and simple, with melodies stolen from current pop songs (tell me you can't sing Jennifer Lopez's (don't get me started on her sub-par singing voice)"if you had my love" to the chorus of jaci's "every time i fall". if i was j.lo's agent i'd sue). this isn't her only song that does this, but i can't remember anymore so it's hard to believe me, i know. :) I had (notice - HAD) the enhanced version that encluded exclusive interviews (!!) with jaci at home. it was all so touching...anyways. so i got "special insight" to the song on the album. she said everyone but her didn't want "crystal clear" to be on the album but she insisted. too bad she didn't listen. its one of those confusing songs that leaves you thinking "wait...are you talking about God...or your boyfriend?!?" if you wanna sing a love song (which CC most assuredly is) than DO it! don't try to pass if off as singing to God, cuz it just comes off as a little weird and confusing. and I don't have enough time to get started on "Adore Adore Adore Adore...etc etc etc" what she needs is a window (ok ok it's a bad joke sorry). but actually i like to use the door when i hear that song. i don't recommend this to ANYone! if you MUST get a jaci cd, then i hesitantly suggest "unspoken"(also a kinda dumb song but 2 to 3 star cd). ok im done 
 Whenever I read a book and find obvious errors that I know about, and I am not even an investigative journalist, I wonder what else is wrong about it.  Ms. Nasar, it's Jacob Wirth Restaurant in Boston, not Jack Wirth and the law firm was Choate, Hall & Stewart, not Steward 
 I tried to like this novel because as one who believes in predestination, I thought it would show some of the opposing arguments in fictional form; it failed to do this.  James Hogg merely shows us a deranged human being (nothing new there!) who murders because he feels that he is 'destined for heaven' no matter what he does. Yes, he might have been saved from the fires of hell, but it would have been by God's grace, not by his own good or evil works. Isn't this what the New Testament is all about-grace in spite of man's evil doing? Whether one is predestined or 'chooses good or evil' makes no difference in the end-what matters is who saves you from your own mortal destiny which is death. This story fails to show any unique theological and/or psychological perspective. I was dissatisfied with the author's far-fetched and anti-logical presentation of a doctrine he clearly did not understand. 
 Well folks, looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here. ("Crash" comes close, but that film has a lot more detractors than this one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined, somehow, that it would "change the world".)  My beefs are not the same as most of those who don't like the film:  I don't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse, nor do I find it overly depressing.  Fact is, it isn't depressing at all cause I didn't care.  It's just boring and annoying, sometimes at different moments, sometimes simultaneously.  This not a good combination.  All right, here's a plot summary:  Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all do drugs, and this really messes up their lives. I hate to give it all away like that, but there it is.  The fundamental flaw is this: I don't like any of these people, so their pain doesn't mean anything, and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect.  Maybe if Aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would've worked, but now there just isn't anything there.  As far as what's actually in the movie, we've got  Jared Leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, who wants to be a fashion designer, or something.  Beyond this we've got Jared's mother, Ellen Burstyn, who is a weird old woman and Marlon Wayans as Leto's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues.  I particularly love how there's no real attempt to make Wayans into a person.  He's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that's it.  The doubly sad fact is that he's the most likable of the three.  He at least displays a little life.  Connelly and Leto apparently just wandered here from a Bergman film and are so dull and slow that it's a wonder that the smack doesn't cause them to cease to exist entirely.  (Well, Connelly actually does coke, I think, but it fails to liven her up any.  Also, I actually *like* the Bergman films I've seen, so that's not really a fair comparison.)  They love each other, apparently, but since I don't even like either of them I'm not much interested.  Finally, Burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been funny if I cared about her, but we've been over that...    And I want you people to know that I'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies.  I can care about the characters, but none of these people did anything for me, so the movie's dead in the water.  For good counter examples watch "Trainspotting", which has drug-addict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and "Bubba Ho-Tep", a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly horror-comedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it.  On the other hand, neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as "Requiem For A Dream", so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego.  Still, if that's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose.    "Requiem For A Dream" isn't helped any by Darren Aronofsky's repetitive, derivative over-direction.  The trouble is, this movie hasn't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is.  There's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics, but they're hopelessly driven in to the ground, as we see fast-motion a thousand times, quick-cut montages a million times and plenty of wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk, and they are, again, impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain't drawing me in.  I imagine that the overdone, repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch.  The score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over.   Truth be told, I thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half, but then it really started to grate on me.  It became evident that no, Aronofsky wasn't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no, these characters weren't going to get any more interesting.  I looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film, and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective.  It was kind of uplifting, really:  Now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom I can go do something else.  Now that's a good ending.  Grade: D+   PS This is 500 reviews.  I doubt if I will write 500 more, but who knows 
 I didn't read the passage that the other reviewer did, who stated:  "Did you know that if you start a business from your home, everything you currently own and use for the corporation (tables, computers, chairs, etc.) can be considered a donation to the corporation, resulting in a write off on your individual tax return? You can even write off your rent if you operate from there!"  But assuming his citation of the book is accurate the book is flat wrong.  A contribution by a shareholder to a corporation in a 26 USC 351 transaction is NOT A CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION and IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE by the contributing shareholder.  Moreover, one cannot contribute assets to a corporation in exchange for stock, and then cause the corporation to make a 26 USC 179 election with respect to the contributed assets.  Merely operating a business inside corporate solution is not a silver bullet for tax savings.  Nor, as some will claim, is forming a NV corporation 
 I had heard of the importance, and significance of "The Education of Henry Adams" for a long time. I finally determined I needed to read it.  I acutally read it twice, and found less in it the second time than the first.   I am sorry  I missed the greatness of this book. I am sure there was something wrong with me, but I found it to be incredibly unimpressive.   Perhaps this came from the fact that Henry Adams was not a likeable man. He was famous for holding court in his home near the White House, and making caustic and negative comments about every President who lived there.   Granted, he lived in Washington at a time when there were plenty of second-rate occupants of the White House. But the thought of people wasting their time trying to please  a blue-blooded snob like Adams depresses me. Why did anyone bother? He lived in an atmosphere of snobbery, sharp-tongues, clever remarks, and brilliant conversation. The world went on without him, truth be told, and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day.   He was a very good historian in his time. But who reads his books now? Not very many. In short, his own work was not as long-lasting as he would have wanted it to be. Maybe the influence of some of the Presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of Henry Adams.  "The Education of Henry Adams" does not have much real information. He got education in one place, none in others. Surely, the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for Henry--but he wrote nothing about it in his book.   When Eric Sevareid wrote "Not So Wild a Dream," it was compared to "The Education of Henry Adams." That was meant as a compliment. Oddly, I think Sevareid's book is much, much better. Sevareid wrote of America, the common man, the war, and what it all meant to him. Adams needed to get out more. He did not see America--not the America built by the common citizen who put it all together, and defended it.  I gained a trememdous amount from Sevareid. I cannot say the same for the work of Henry Adams.   Again, a lot of this might be me. Perhaps I read the book at a bad time. Maybe I needed to read it a third time. I do not know. I do know I do not think this is a great American classic. Forgive, please, my ignorance. 
 Anyone interested in the resolution of the Anastasia controversy must also read Peter Kurth's books: "Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson" (ISBN: 0316507172) and "TSAR: The Lost World of Nicholas and Alexandra" (ISBN: 0316557889).  Also read Kurth's direct rebuttal to Massie's "Romanovs" at peterkurth.com, specifically http://www.peterkurth.com/ANNA-ANASTASIA%20NOTES%20ON%20FRANZISKA%20SCHANZKOWSKA.htm  Highlights:  1. The DNA test's techniques are so antiquated that they produce many false positives and negatives.  These techniques are no longer considered accurate enough to be admissible in U.S. courts.  2. The DNA sample from Anna Anderson was taken from a bit of "her" intestine that -- God knows why -- had been sitting on a shelf at the hospital where she had had surgery years earlier.  Where is the "chain of custody" that any legitimate court would require of such evidence?  Thus, the sample tested is suspect.  3. The DNA test results that "prove" AA was a blood relative to Polish peasants in fact PROVES THE OPPOSITE.  According to Massie's geneology, AA was a PATERNAL blood-relative to these Poles.  But the DNA test that was conducted can only trace MATERNAL blood relations.  So a POSITIVE DNA test result "proves" a relationship where none could possibly exist, using Massie's own geneology.  None of this proves that Anna Anderson was Anastasia.  But it does cast serious doubt on the conclusiveness of the DNA test results that Massie champions, and serious doubt about the accuracy of Massie's book 
 I would have to agree with some of the other reviews.  The original series is worth reading, but do yourself a favor and skip the Enthroned.  The quality of the writing declined between the first and second series, and I am guessing that her publisher was disappointed in sales for enthroned and told her to wrap it up when she was half way through book three, leaving the ending rushed, disappointing and unbelievable 
 I love Jeff Goldblum, but he didn't carry this film. The film was ruined for me the second Julane Moore (yuck!) and the ridiculous, lame token Black daughter of Goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in Hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film. It's obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter. What a concept. It just added to the disbelief of the characters (stay Goldblum), the storyline, and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel. Jurassic Park III wasn't much better 
 I was suprised when I received The Modern Critical Interpretations edition of the Rime of the Ancient Mariner.  There are no woodcuts or any other pictures, there are no silver pages, there is no poem at all!  This book is only modern critical interpretations - nothing more.  Buy it if you are a scholar - and refer to a separate copy of the poem.  I should have known from the edition but the editorial reviews were from a different book that was an edition of the actual poem 
 If you read the fine print this "autobiography" is actually written by Alex Haley.  So who knows what parts are from Haley's life and what parts are from Malcolm X's life 
 The animal rights issue is a tricky one, because it touches on really deep questions about what it means to be conscious, to have rights, and to experience suffering.  So you might expect a philosopher to be able to sort through the ethical issues and suggest a way forward.  If so, you would be disappointed by this book.  The first chapter lays out the philosophical foundation of the book.  Singer argues that there's really no basis for assigning equal rights to all humans, since different humans have different abilities.  Therefore equality must be based on the recognition of another person's interests.  Since animals have interests too, they deserve equal treatment.  That's it.  It's not terribly deep, and frankly not even rational, but Singer doesn't bother to elaborate.  So if animals have interests, then they obviously have an interest in not suffering.  How do we know animals are capable of suffering?  According to Singer there are two signs:  they seek to avoid painful stimuli and they have nervous systems that bear a superficial similarity to those of humans.  He doesn't say how he came up with these criteria, but they seem awfully generous to me.    In fact, based on those criteria one would conclude that monkeys are capable of understanding spoken language and that humans are capable of echolocation.  Monkeys do in fact respond to certain vocalizations, and they have all the relevant physiological structures for understanding speech.  And humans actually can echolocate (with a lot of practice).  The point is that you would never seriously compare human echolocation to bat echolocation, and the ability of monkeys to process speech is negligible relative to that of humans.  Could this also be true of the capacity for pain and suffering?  I don't think anyone knows, and Singer doesn't shed any light on the subject.  The next chapter is about animal testing, and a lot of the chapter deals with the use of animals in scientific experiments.  This is the weakest part of the book.  Singer finds some of the most gruesome experiments in science history, and juxtaposes them with out-of-context quotes from the researchers to make it look like the research was useless.  He mentions in passing that the vast majority of animal experiments don't involve pain, but by the end of the chapter he suggests that all medical experimentation should eventually be stopped.  Part of his justification for ending medical experiments is the notion that such experiments don't actually contribute to medical or scientific progress.  This idea is unfortunately quite common among people who don't know anything about medicine or science.  However it's completely incorrect, and most of Singer's arguments regarding the scientific value of animal testing have been completely debunked.  For example, he continues to exploit the thalidomide tragedy, even though it was already known at the time the book was written that that incident was unrelated to animal testing.  In addition to being totally confused about science, Singer seems uncomfortable with the scientific method itself.  He repeatedly suggests that animal testing should, in the short term, be limited to experiments that will lead to rapid advances in medical treatment.  This is like saying you should look for your lost car keys where you left them.  Science doesn't work this way.  At one point (p. 47), Singer complains about a series of experiments that were shown "first to prove a theory, then to disprove the theory, and finally to support modified versions of the original theory."  This probably sounds ridiculous to a philosopher, but it's actually a pretty good description of the scientific method.  The next chapter deals with factory farming, and here Singer is on firmer ground.  As in the previous chapter, there's no philosophy, or even rational discourse.  It's just page after page of description, in this case of the conditions of animals on a large farm.  However, in contrast to the chapter on experimentation, the conditions he describes are standard practice for the majority of farm animals.  Here it would seem that there's plenty of room for improvement with comparatively minimal consequences for humans (although I imagine the situation has only gotten worse since the publication of the second edition of the book in 1990).  The next chapter deals with vegetarianism, calling for a boycott of meat and dairy products.  Again the appeal is basically emotional, and if you were moved by the arguments of the preceding chapter, you will presumably find this chapter convincing.  Curiously Singer doesn't call for a similar boycott of medicine or medical treatment, even though the argument would be identical.  Even if you belief that animal experimentation is useless for human medicine, you have to admit that the purchase of such medicine directly pays for more animal research.  Anyone who's receiving treatment for cardiac problems or diabetes, or who has ever had surgery, or who takes prescription drugs, is contributing to animal suffering.  Maybe Singer deals with this in another book, but given the chapter on vegetarianism it's a rather obvious omission.  The next chapter is a strangely out of place history of human attitudes toward animals, going back several thousand years.  It might have made sense to put this at the beginning of the book, but perhaps his editor was afraid of losing readers.  The last chapter talks about some popular animal rights movements and their accomplishments.  Singer doesn't draw any line between violent organizations like the Animal Liberation Front (which the FBI considers a terrorist organization) and organizations that actually help animals in a peaceful way (like the ASPCA).  He speaks positively of PETA, which in addition to other extremist activities, supports violence and arson.  I don't know why he would do this.  Ultimately this is a bad book.  It trivializes a serious issue by  substituting emotional imagery for rational argumentation.  The fact is that humans can benefit greatly from actions that adversely affect animals.  In the realm of science, there is no serious doubt that the length and quality of human life have been improved through animal testing.  With other behaviors, such as meat-eating, the benefits are more subjective and the suffering is probably greater.  How we assign weight to these costs and benefits is a very difficult question that Singer doesn't even attempt to take seriously 
 Equilibrium is a curate's egg - its best parts are not good throughout, and its worst aspects make erratic appearances. The acting is really the least of its problems; the cardinal failure was a script that could not decide what kind of movie it wanted to be when it grew up.    Equilibrium, however poorly, aspires to be a dystopian film, and there exists a dystopian formula at work in fiction and film alike. Such a formula was employed magnificently in Michael Radford's adaptation of George Orwell's 1984. Contrarily, films imperil themselves in discarding the formula as evidenced by Alfonso Cuaron's junky adaptation of P.D. James' The Children of Men. There are essentially three parts to this formula. First, there must be a depiction of a believable society, and plausible justifications for its existence. The author or script writer must paint vividly, yet remain nuanced, since at this stage his purpose is to show the reader or viewer, without yet telling him the philosophy underlying it. Second, two-thirds of the way through there must be a conversation between protagonist and antagonist, which formally unveils the ethical dilemma. Here, the protagonist offers his alternative, usually an acknowledgement of the humane. Third, the dystopian resolution lies in the protagonist's choice: he must surrender to the system, rebel against it, or be conquered by it. The ending, if it is not tragic in the classical sense, must be ambiguous; if it is ended happily, it is no longer a matter for the reader or viewers' thoughts: the problem has been resolved, and he may retire from it and become forgetful of it.   Libria, the society depicted in Equilibrium, is a post-apocalyptic society wherein feeling has been criminalized under the pretext that human feelings, and the actions carried out on their behalf, represent the fons et origio of man's inhumanity to man. The objective of outlawing sentiments is the preservation of peace. Is this believable? Ultimately, it is not because the viewer is given no other reason for this society to exist, no justification for its brutality except that it is by this method alone that peace may be preserved. However, a desire for peace is predicated on an aversion to war, and aversion is something we principally feel. A more believable premise would have been the prohibition of certain feelings, but it is also unbelievable because it is inconsistent. The protagonist (John Preston, a member of the Grammaton Cleric, an elite government agency for enforcing laws against so-called `sense-crimes') marries, begets children, hesitates in killing his partner - what point would there be in any of this in a society that had eliminated feeling? And, if we are being generous, and suppose that this was done intentionally so as to say, "You can never entirely eliminate feeling," it fails still; because if the denizens of Libria weren't completely devoid of feeling, they couldn't be as cowed as they are depicted. Instead, countless times throughout the film characters make comments, statements, enquiries that can only have as their possible source or response an emotion. To have had characters who were truly apathetic, or for whom the fictitious drug Prozium was effective, they would have had more in common with Star Trek's Borg. The backdrop for this dystopia, then, lacks subtlety or nuance. From the first fifteen seconds of film, the viewer ethically objects - it remains tediously Manichean throughout. The viewer is given a straw man and immediately begins tearing it down and the only suspense is literally in waiting for what we know will happen.  In Brave New World, it is Mustapha Mond's conversation with John the Savage. In 1984, it is O'Brien's talk with Winston Smith. In The Children of Men, it is a debate between Theo and the Xan. In Equilibrium, the formal unveiling of the ethical dilemma happens in a haphazard way throughout, culminating in a fight scene that lacks the awe inspired by the Matrix three years before. Here was the moment for the "talky" bit of the film, the sophisticated counter-punch, the moral awakening, the vindication of the human; instead, the viewer is given another low-brow, Hollywood denouement. John Preston does nothing to justify his alternative to the totalitarian status quo - there is no bit of dialogue with Father where lines are spoken which conveys the notion that "Feelings are essential to thought," or that "peace has been obtained at a terrible price." All the loose ends, littered liberally throughout the film, are never addressed: Why have art in Libria? Why does Father intonate, and raise the pitch of his voice to manipulate the masses in a scene reminiscent of a Leni Riefenstahl propaganda film? A better film would have acknowledged these scenes, and defended their inclusion in a climatic dialogue between John Preston and Father (or DuPont as it turns out).   The conclusion of Equilibrium can be summarized as follows: "Good guy kills bad guys, sixty-second revolution ensues, people can feel again, hero smiles, time to go to bed." There wasn't ever a genuine ethical dilemma anyway: what was wrong was obviously wrong, and what was right was intuitively right. The viewer never believed the reasons Libria came to be, or at least they never found them plausible in the way they found Huxley's, Orwell's, James', Zamyatin's, or Koestler's explanations. In Equilibrium it was all simply the soft groundwork prepared for the banal, unoriginal action movie to follow. The plot, then, was in some respects as shallow as the tendentious storylines in soft-core porn films: they needn't be sensical because no one is interested in the story, but rather for the titillation, arousal, and amusement. Many viewers of Equilibrium are fans of flashy action sequences (a majority of whom were not disappointed as their reviews attest); but for those seeking a fuller cinematic experience, Equilibrium is an unfortunate disappointment. During the film a woman asks Preston, "Why are you alive?" Preston responds with the bureaucratically sterile answer, "I'm alive to safeguard the continuity of this great society. To serve Libria." "It's circular. You exist to continue your existence. What's the point?" she asks. And, what's the point is exactly the point about this film.   
 There are arm full of books in the market place that are better than this book, and yes some that are worse.  I'm surprised that the authors have a radio show.  Just goes to show you if you're persistent, you can obtain anything in life.  There are many authors who would make better radio show hosts, but the activities that they participate in are probably more renumerative.  The book would appeal most to those who for lacks of funds or mindset wish to do all the rehab work themselves and will only acquire a house once every year or two.  There are much better ways to make money as a real estate investor of homes and make your time more productive.  To that end the book provides some useful guidance on contracting with a contractor, if you elect to go that route, and tips for cleaning up a house.  Is the book worth it's price?  Depends on your mindset and how much you value the money to buy the book.  My suggestion would be to read a library's book first, and then decide if you want to buy it 
 I wanted to learn about the man who guided so many down the wrong road to drug experiementation.  Reading this preplexed me throughout the chore.  Somehow, I couldn't figure out how someone who had so much going for him turn down this road, consuming his daughter and son in the process.  It seemed all he ever sought was publicity and nothing else except another high. His ego and hunger for always higher recognition never seemed to be satisfied.   If any of us mere humans had down what he did, like he did, we would ended up dead, in a mental health facility for life, or locked away in some prison for much longer than he served.  Book is well written and very factual but the subject matter should have been viewed with more disdain 
 chinese furniture have a strong relationship with architecture, in its proportion, construction, and relationship to the space. I was looking forward to see a more detailed analysis of such relationship but this book turned out to be a mediocre repetition of numerous chinese furniture books already in the market. Many of the pictures are from dealer's photos or Museum's existing photos.  The reference paintings are primary from Chin P'ing Mei or similar paintings which have been published numerous times by other authors.  The sketch or drawings are mediocre. There are no measured or proportional anaylsis of the furniture to the architecture.  I have returned this book. 
 This book is more about feel good stories of people who started a business and they liked what they were doing.  If you liked Chicken Soup for the Soul, you will probably like this.  I was looking for a book to give some  ideas of what good businesses someone could do part-time and make some  extra money.  These stories covered various set up costs and barely gave an  idea of what is needed.  The book basically sums up to be: Find out what  you like and make a plan.  If you already figured that out, don't buy the  book 
 This might have been an interesting book had the author concentrated more on the plot and less on the peripheral items.  the heroine is pretty, intelligent and has an interesting career and background.  The author, however, appears to place more emphasis on her fashion and sexual exploits than on developing her as a real character.  Is it really necessary to describe every skimpy outfit that the heroine wore and every sexual encounter that she has in order to further the plot?  It appears that the author feels compelled to throw some of this in every few pages in a poorly disguised attempt to hold the reader's interest.  I was also disappointed by the actual plot itself.  Some of the items were so transparent that the reader could predict them pages before the heroine came to the obvious conclusion.  Could anybody not see the significance of the ski lodge?  Other items were never adequately explained and left the reader guessing why the obvious was omitted.  If she knew that the lodge was bugged why didn't she ask Abel if he could provide some evidence?  Hopefully, in future novels, the author will leave out most of the fashion and the sex and build her character into one with the depth to be more interesting 
 This movie was extreamly stupid, but very funny.  We just laughed though this hole movie.  This was pretty much very soft porn.  The hole time all the guys did was rub themselves or the priest rubbed them.  The special effects sucked, they were probably better in the old bewitched episodes (the black and white ones!!).  The acting was very bad, and this movie is very anticrist 
 This watch works fine most of the time but if it gets even slightly moist, despite its label of "WATER RESIST," it stops working.  The screen blanks for up to a week before it begins to work again (and naturally I have to reset the time) 
 not being hip, I must venture out and say:    Oh my God!!!  What????  Who cares?  Franny is pregnant.  The big twist in this story was that it was in the 50s.  But beyond that, what's the point?  Take out the pregnancy and we are left with hyperintelligent, overanalytical, pretentious young adults whose parents did them a disservice by never offering them a real childhood.  Boring in the 50s and boring now.  As a fan of Catcher if the Rye, I couldn't wait to get my hands on Franny and Zooey.  Holden was familiar.  Franny and Zooey made me want to shower.  I really wish I had the time back that I spent reading this trite piece of...         
 When I reviewed THE STREET LAWYER recently, I mentioned that I've never put down a Grisham unfinished and that we should throw the man some props. For that book, certainly. For this one, nope. I read four chapters, 41 of its 391 pages, and gave up totally unengaged and uncaring about any of his characters or his plot. I hope he just had an off day or something, and that what he wrote later got back to what makes him so readable. 
 Don't buy songs from this racist bastard!!!! And if he so-call "hates everyone", why does most of his titles of his b-side songs start with the "N" word? Damn hick 
 My 2-year-old received this for his birthday....what a huge disappointment to him.  Looks fun, but nothing stays together long enough to play with it.  One piece gets put on, another falls off.  I was going to return it but with so many loose pieces, we lost a few before being able to take it back. Manufacturers should not put junk like this out there, disappointing kids and taking people's money.  
 Noting that Instapundit's Glenn Reynolds linked to this book on his blog, and respecting the good professor as the blogosphere's most trenchant commentator, I expected Dog Days to be bold, edgy, or in some way irreverent. Regrettably, I found nothing at all distinctive about it.  Indeed, it has a humdrum,  so-last-year feel to it -- as exemplified by the author's obsessive focus on the main character's fetishizing of her blackberry as though it were a hot new gizmo.  Similarly,  the plot so barely fictionalizes people and events that have already received massive coverage (Washingtonienne Jessica Cutler, the 2004 Kerry and Bush campaigns) that I was left bemoaning the author's lack of imagination. Cox does write the occasional witty and sardonic repartee for her two leads, but I agree with an earlier Amazon reviewer's comment that the book feels like a rush-job and is substantially devoid of the clever thinking and writing so emblematic of today's most popular bloggers.            
 This is nothing compared to their EP, which was great by the way. Songs lack of inventive, arrangements and feeling... maybe a couple of songs are to be rescued, but no more 
 Buyer beware.  Great chair for one year then the motor died.  The warranty is one year so I am out of luck.  If you think $600 is a good deal for one year's use of the chair then this is the chair for you 
 An electronics technician of 8 years, I have a solid understanding of computers but I am totally new to internetworking and Cisco equipment. In my opinion this book is very poorly written and I do not beleive it was proof-read before it was printed. Since I am not a Cisco pro I cannot detect any of the errors between the information presented and how things really work, but I can detect all the inconsistancies of the information given.   Figures and diagrams that do not correlate with the text leave you wondering which is correct. Topic and chapter review quizes that ask things which were not explained in the text. There are answers provided in the back of the book to these quizes but 1 or 2 out of 10 of every 10 answers are incorrect and not ammended in the current errata. This is very frustrating to me because I have spent too much time reviewing material to figure out why I missed a question - only to find that I didn't.   When I emailed Ciscopress and explained the ammount of errors I am finding I was refered to a very small errata page. I offered to submit a list of items that I felt should be reviewed for accuracy... but should I be the one proof reading this text?  Will the $250 exam also be so flawed?   
 I just saw this movie and would only buy the book if 80 million dollars was at stake. I am a woman, an attractive and intelligent woman and I am completely alienated from his "vision". He portrays only the  Cathy Guisewite view of womankind and all woman should chase him down and  put wasabi on his oily, phony, grotesquely malformed testicles. I have  never been so repulsed by another human.I imagine htis review is not  suitable in that I did not suffer it in book form but I feel the need to  warn the inoccent 
 I read the reviews and believed them.  When I read the book to my 2 1/2 year old, I felt weird.  First of all, the mother has a habit of 'crawling' across the bedroom floor to get to her son in the middle of the night while he's sleeping--as a baby that's fine, but when he's a grown man?  And, to be rocking a grown man in his sleep???  And then, the son, now a grown man, rocks his aged mother in his arms as well.  I can't do justice to how creepy I found the book.  After reading it, my son pleaded with me not to read it anymore and said he found the mother in the book "SCARY!"  So, I'm returning my book and the extra copy I had gotten, thinking I would keep it and give it as a gift 
 I found it to lean very heavily towards a hierarchal view of the relationship between men and women.  Men are to rule, and women are to submit to that rule.  The authors appear to see women as perpetual children who need to be under the continual domination of men, rather than as adults who deal with men on an adult level.  I suggest anyone who reads this books should also read "Discovering Biblical Equality."  It gives another view of how the Christians world see the role of women 
 I guess Albom will just keep churning out this psychobabble but I'm done with him.  At least I can say I never paid for any of his Oprahlit. Just wasted time at a library. Please don't make this huckster one cent richer. Buy something more edifying.  Like toilet paper 
 Having read a few Bosch books already (The Closers and Lost Light), I realized that I should probably start at the beginning to get better insight on how Bosch became the Bosch I was reading in the later series.  However, I was very disappointed with this book.  One of the most irritating aspects of this book was the grammatical errors (mispellings and such).  I found 3 or 4 in the first 50 pages (before I stopped reading)!  I thought it was ironic that Connelly was thanking his editor at the beginning of the book, because it did not seem that anyone was editing this book.  Also, I found the book to be too gritty.  It lacked the emotion and soul that I found in the later books.  It seemed that Connelly was trying too hard to make Bosch fit this certain mold, but then transformed the character to be more likeable in the later books that I read.  So it was disappointing that this book could not hold my interest because I just finished reading The Narrows and loved it, and will probably pick up some other Bosch books and just read it out of order.  Connelly's writing seems to be getting better and better, which should explain why I didn't enjoy this book and couldn't finish it.  I gave it 2 stars because it might have gotten better and maybe I was too impatient.  This is one of those series that seems like it is better to read out of order 
 I was beyond disappionted with this book.  The "myths" the title refers to are nothing but trivia, and many are "trivial" Beatles trivia at best. There are absolutely no revelations or new facts here.  It is also full of errors and inaccuracies.  The authors approach this book with arrogance, condescension, and a lot of snideness.  I'm very sorry I threw away almost $20 on this 
 Perhaps the author should have written a history of the Northwest, and northern railroads. I found very little of the persona of James J. Hill in this. It is a very historical narritive, not very biographic 
 I originally wrote a review of this book in 1999, titled "This is a racist book disguised as a work of art."  It seems that I didn't explain well enough my objection to Styron's co-opting of the story of a real human being, Nat Turner, whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book, "The Confessions of Nat Turner," by T.R. Gray.  Not only did Styron steal the title of Gray's book, in which Gray recounts his interview with the real Nat Turner, but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern-bred racism.    Unlike his depiction in Styron's book, Nat Turner was married.  Styron's invention of Turner's pivotal and conflicted relationship with a white woman, Margaret Whitehead, is entirely fictional.  So is any self-doubt that Turner did the right thing by leading the revolt.  In Gray's account, Turner did not express regret. There is so much more depth to Turner's life that is either fictionalized beyond recognition or left unexplored in this book.  Do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction?  Yes. The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are key to the story he invented.  Turner's fictional relationship with Margaret is saturated in the southern myth that black men are obsessed with white women -- lusting for the forbidden fruit, for which they must die.  That Styron crawls into Nat Turner's skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause.  What offends me most is that Nat Turner's life deserves to be explored by a modern author who does not condescend or patronize this African-American hero.  Instead, we have William Styron's version of Turner's life, taken by many readers as fact.  If one prefers racist fiction posing as a legitimate account of a life, then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of "Confessions."  But if one prefers reality, I recommend Gray's book as well as other accounts available about the slave revolt at Southampton, Virginia.  Styron's book does not provide significant insights into Nat Turner, slave revolt or slavery itself.  His book clouds the truth with the same kind of Reconstruction era distortions that spawned the hideous phenomenon of lynching 
 First, let me state that I have been impressed by all the Canin I have read prior to starting "Blue River."  The problem with this novel isn't that it follows pattern similar to Canin's other works, most notably "For Kings and Planets," a far more mature novel, but that the protagonist is very hard to empathize with.  A successful California optimologist, the protagonist spends the too much of the narrative defending his materialism.  When he's not bothering with that, he's repeatly over-describing his less successful brother (After the first few times, I understood that the brother was violent and troubled during high school).  There's a good story here, but it's trapped under a poor, plodding narrative 
 unfortunately was the cover of my new book a bit damaged. I really did not like this because I especially ordered a hard cover. 
 The obvious attitude of the producers of this mess was clearly one of superiority.  I mean, "After all, we're shooting in IMAX 3D instead of the nefarious over/under format!"  Well, whoopdeedoo!  I'll take THE BUBBLE, METALSTORM, or AMITYVILLE 3D any day over this.  There is some nice computer graphics work here, but there's really no story to speak of.  And their so-called "history of 3D presentation" is superficial at best.  While surely impressive in Imax, ENCOUNTER looks stupid on your TV screen 'cause everything is covered in a long shot or a medium long shot.  Yes, that may work on the giant behemoth Imax screen, but reduce it in size to your TV (even my big 36-inch JVC) and it's pretty unimpressive.  Not only that, but if you're watching it in alternating-field 3D with liquid crystal glasses, then you're watching it in half the normal resolution you normally see on your NTSC screen -- so there's next to NO picture detail.  If you want a good 3D DVD movie, search the web for one of the alternating field DVD's of something like IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, HOUSE OF WAX, or DIAL M FOR MURDER (sadly only available in 3D via pirated editions because the US distributors don't care enough to bother -- so were only left with legit DVD's of crap like ENCOUNTERS and amatuer videos of murderous clowns on the rampage).  I would have given this two stars because it features (very briefly) Cassandra "Elvira" Peterson -- BUT THEY COVERED HER ONLY IN LONG SHOT TOO!  They were REALLY stooopid, so they get one star.  Boo 
 I purchased this dvd because I own the 2nd one and like it so much.  Boy, was I disappointed!  The abs diet people must have decided to create the second dvd because this one needed a good edit.  The second dvd covers basically the same exercises but with better instruction and form.  Skip this one and buy the Abs Diet Workout 2 
 I have friends who might be into this stuff, if only because they like the old and the strange. Me, I'm just like -- Is this "It's a Wonderful Life"?  I think I might have enjoyed this more if it was a novel or maybe if I picked up the script. As it is, this just barely seems to translate into a movie, and--forgive me for I have my own opinion--"City of Angels" was a good movie. Too bad if you don't like all this "contemporary nonsense." I feel like it worked.  My opinion: it's long, it's boring, it's hard to hear. Even if it has a message, I just can't relate to it. So maybe that's my problem.  Your opinion: your own. keep it. you're lucky I gave it two stars 
 This is yet another omnivore cookbook filled with omnivore recipes with the words "egg replacer" put in for "eggs," "soy milk" put in for "milk," "margarine" put in for "butter," etc.  In some recipes, the authors got lazy and simply said eggs, etc.  I can pick up any omnivore cookbook and do this sort of substitution myself.  Also, one recipe calls for honey, which is an animal product.  Agave nectar or another sweetener would have worked just as well 
 I saw this movie yesterday thinking it'd be exciting. I sure am glad that I survived after watching this terrible excuse for a movie. There's no story line, the acting is pathetic, whoever gave Vin Diesel the idea that he can act. Like an earlier reviewer observes it's about who's dumber the guys who made this movie or the ones who gave it a good review 
 I am an Alice fan, so this is far far from my favorite.  The first star I gave was simply because I love Kate Beckinsale and the movie isn't scary.  The other is because It would be enchanting for a 3-4 year old or another youngster that doesn't know anything about Wonderland.  My 9 year old even got bored with this.  Kate Beackinsale plays the Mother in the beginning, and in 1999 she was much too young to be and definitely looked so.  She just didn't look well in this movie, and everything looked so cheap and fake.  The story was changed in all the wrong places and too much was left out.  I would not recommend this.  I would recommend the 1999 American mini series of Alice in Wonderland, it is my absolute favorite; with Martin Short as the Mad Hatter, and a long list of big names.  That one is fun for all ages 
 When purchasing music I always preview CDs at stores.  However, since I've been a long time Boyz II Men fan I had so much faith in the group that I didn't feel the need to so.  How wrong I was!  I was so disappointed!  This album put them with the likes of O-Town!  I know that each of the men are exceptionally talented so I don't know what went wrong. If they released this album just to make some cash, I would have gladly dug into my pockets and donated money rather than listening to an album that does them no justice. 
 In our opinion this book is a poor excuse for scholarship. The seminal work by Harry Oldmeadow on this same subject shows what a scholarly work should be - thorough, balanced and properly sourced. Interesting that Oldmeadow isn't listed in the Index.   This book appears to rely on hearsay and an incorrect understanding of Traditionlism to concoct a sensationlist work that is a marketer's dream but a true scholar's nightmare. 
 This movie was ok. I do prefer The Messenger starring Milla Jovovich. Milla is exceptional in that version 
 This book is all about how great Mary Kay thinks Mary Kay is.  Though I was interested in learning more about the company (I even was a Mary Kay consultant for a little while), the self-proclamation factor proved too frustrating.  I could not even finish the book 
      The book Many Lives, Many Masters tells a fascinating story.  I am thankful to the book especially for all these reviews, that are about far more than the book itself. They show a beautiful wide rainbow of states of mind.  Our Mind.  The single heart and soul warming story in this book creates many new questions for all of us, who are on our way to the spiritual awakening, trying to access the higher levels of our consciousness.  There are many people, who already KNOW, what the others only BELIEVE, or want to know or believe.   On our way there and in your quest for more, I recommend reading the book "I am me I am free" by DAVID ICKE, who shares his great experiences and knowledge in his very special own unique fantastic and loving way.      Congratulations to all of us.  We deserve to be admired and praised.    FIVE STARS to EVERY ONE OF US and still, let's shoot for more!!!   And, not to worry.  All we don't learn here, we will find out exactly how it is, when the right time comes.  It will be even much nicer, than we now think.  Wanna bet 
 Blind Items has the same writing style as at least one of Rettenmund's other books (Boy Culture).  He goes on for pages and pages to describe something that could have been said in two paragraphs.  Kind of reminds me of the articles you read in the Sunday magazine section of your newspaper.  If you like this writing style, Rettenmund's books may be for you.  Personally it drove me crazy and I set the book down after the first few chapters 
 The article that receipt is difrente to that of the photo that appears. The conector to the camera is not USB/Fire Wire, but it is a type nini Stereo 
 I bought this book and was severely disappointed.  The author seems to take shots at African American's that don't fit his version of "ethnic appropriateness".  Particularly, he takes really harsh shots at Diana Ross, The Supremes, Donna Summer and anyone else who has had the courage to just be themselves and shine without paying attention to his particular point of view of how we (African Americans) should look, act or behave.  I found it to be a total waste of money, and definitely does not represent all of "Black Beauty", just his tainted point of view 
 I aint tryna be a hater, but T.I. or his group dont have no talent, he aint no king, Scarface and DJ Screw r the real Kings of the South. Young Jeezy better than T.I. RIP DJ SCRE 
 This book would be better if the author didnt have a tendancy to leave steps out of most his examples.  Problems at the end of the chapters can be really difficult.  I highly suggest using another book, or atleast having a good undergraduate text to supplement this one 
 I've read scores of books about photo history and criticism but have rarely encountered such an unbearable load of relentlessly  postmodernist-deconstructionist-postcolonialist-genderbending cultural theory.  Certainly there is room for such perspectives and they may provide certain insights into certain photographic subject matter.  I welcome and applaud such efforts when they are well done.  But please, if occasionally a cigar is just a cigar, can't the same be true of a humble photograph?  Alas, no.  At least not to Clarke, who sees every photo as built on a foundation of past political incorrectness, which he proceeds to survey like an archeologist examining the strata of a Pompein latrine.  Viewing what purports to be the entirety of the history of photography in this monocular manner leaves us in this case with no history of photography at all.. 
 I LOVE John Grisham. I have read almost all his books, but this one.... I couldn't even read beyond the first hundred pages. It is so slow, a lot of narrative. It looks more like a history book than a thriller one. I didn't like at all 
 This book actually pokes on Henry's contemporaries and describes series of events which will eventaully lead to a horrendous headache to be suffered by the reader. On the other hand, Fielding's Tom Jones is a delight and mustn't be missed at any cost! This book is a total waste, though!  
 I came upon this film while browsing my university library. My curiosity was picqued, since my home state is rarely discussed beyond such topics as drinking (Mardi Gras) and eating (Cajun food).  This film reminds me of a line from an explanatory plaque in Jean Lafitte National Park. Looking out over a marsh (through which runs a large gas pipeline), the panel details all the restoration efforts sponsored by ExxonMobil, Shell-Texaco, et al., all of whom have refineries in or around the wetlands. If they're cleaning anything, it's their own mess. And what methods are they using? "Bio-restorative detonations," I believe, was the term used. Are those "life-giving bombs"?  Back to the film, funded as propaganda by Standard Oil Co. when local sentiment was turning against the company. I'll pass over how many times the innocently befuddled Cajuns smile broadly at the blessed Oil Rig plopped in their marsh, and the way the young boy is given the Disney-nature-film treatment, as amusingly naive as Lobo the Wolf or Henry the Mountain Burro. No, just watch this film and catch a glimpse of the prosperity once promised to our humble state. And then visit the beautiful scenery of Norco, LA, in the middle of the famed Cancer Alley 
 This book is an excellent reference book for the serious ghost hunter / paranormal investigator. Provides good case histories as well as "ghost stories" that can be used as examples on investigations 
 I picked up this memoir based on a blurb that mentioned the author's connection to the Stratford, Connecticut Shakespeare festival. Having had a single opportunity to attend this (Christopher Walken's Hamlet!) event, I was hoping for some insight and history of the event. Instead, I found out far too much about Smith's problems; of his difficulties coping with a family that was overwhelmed by having a severely disabled child in the home (Smith's sister), and very little about Stratford's festival. Well, shame on me for buying into a blurb, but I still found the book very disappointing. Focusing basically on his youth, and his later contributions to the community by running Shakespeare reading groups at senior centers in NYC, HAMLET'S DRESSER, needs far more Shakespeare. When Shakespeare does appear, the book comes to life. The joy senior citizens get from the reading groups, Smith's fascination with Shakespeare that led to a life immersed in his works, and especially in the sections where Smith discusses the actors he had an opportunity to work with is where this book truly becomes interesting. Katherine Hepburn, June Havoc, and Bert Lahr all make memorable appearances. The chapter where Smith discusses going on tour with Lahr gives the reader a wonderful glimpse into what it is like to work with a talented yet irascible actor on the road with all of its joys and pitfalls. Sadly, there are not enough of these journeys in this book. I feel some empathy for Smith's trials and tribulations, yet they didn't make for interesting reading. The troubled tales of his youth seem better suited to a therapist's office as opposed to a memoir. They truly pale in comparison to his tales of the theater, which when shared with the reader make for some fine storytelling. If the focus had stayed with Shakespeare and the theater I feel this could have been a wonderful book, as it stands it is a flawed a bit boring overall 
 If you are thinking of leaving an abusive spouse, this book may help you. The latter section, "Dealing With," is a short 'book report' based on a few sources. It doesn't read well, and it doesn't present much information. The first section, 'Identify,' wastes a lot of paper, presenting one idea on each page. It is reminiscent of "you know you're a redneck if...". Many are redundant; the last several are lame. There is a solid use for this information, but I believe it was presented poorly. The title is also misleading. "Toxic People" is too broad a category. These are ways to identify Abusers: those who are either (or both) physically and mentally abusive of others. I'm sure it will help some people, but it wasn't what I was looking for at all 
  This whole book is a collection of tabloid-like articles telling us more than we really need or want to know about some of the Yankee players. For example, Hideki has raging acne and a large collection of porn. Jeter isn't very nice to Miguel Cairo (I didn't know that and I'm sorry. I like Miguel).  The writing style is very irritating. Morrissey obviously did a lot of taping and includes many long quotes from the players, verbatim. Often they didn't bother to finish their sentences or spoke disjointedly, and we are expected to read their minds to know what they meant to say. I am a dedicated Yankee fan and still didn't know what was meant a lot of the time.  Publication of the book seems to have been rushed to coincide with the opening of another season of controversy starring the mortal enemies, Derek and Alex. Don't buy it. It's already outdated because, as of this week anyway, A-Rod is doing great - having hit a walkoff HR and being pushed out of the dugout by Jeter for a curtain call. If you must keep up with the Yankees' behind-the-scenes personal stuff, read the NY papers in hard copy or online. There is nothing wrong with some good gossip. But this is just jun 
 These are excellent graham crackers. We love 'em, and the kids do too, and it's not often that we agree. But you'll be sorry if you order graham crackers -- or any other food that can be damaged in shipping -- from Amazon.  Our recent order arrived in the original box from the factory, containing 12 boxes of New Morning Honey Grahams. That was it. No packing material. Nothing to shield the crackers from the drops and shocks of being shipped to us.  So we didn't get graham crackers. We got graham crumbs, and a few graham cracker fragments.   By all means, order these crackers. Just don't order them from Amazon. Instead, find a retailer that knows how to do it right, or buy them from your local grocery. Unless you really want graham cracker crumbs.. 
 I have both "Five in a Row" (for older kids) and "Before Five in a Row", which is designed for younger kids ages 2-4. While "Five in a Row" is not bad, "Before Five in a Row" is not worth it. Many of the children's books (at least 7 or 8) are out of print and a few are nearly impossible to obtain, even at our public library.  As others have pointed out, the suggested activities are mostly common-sense and rather unimaginative anyway. Also, the "Five in a Row" series has an evangelical Christian focus, which may not be appropriate for everyone. Some better alternatives for preschool children include "Ready for Reading" by Ashley Bishop and "Peak with Books" by Marjorie Nelsen. These books are non-sectarian and use classic children's books that are more readily available than the titles suggested in "Before Five in a Row. 
 I loved this item for a long time.  It is quiet and not unattractive.  But, I have had it for a year or so, and now it is not working.  The pump seems to be broken, because when I add water to the resevoir it stops flowing and sometimes days later it will suddenly turn back on.  It is also difficult to clean in certain parts that are hard to access for scrubbing, but good at trapping orange mold.  I also bought one for my neighbor a while back and her cats refused to use it 
 I should have purchased this book from the beginning!  What a savior it has been.  Shipping was quick and the book is in excellent condition 
 A rambling book, not very informative, with a marked liberal tone.  Not to mention disjointed-- as far as the editorial content goes, each chapter is a totally separate book with its own thesis.  I would have preferred a more  cohesive work supported by the weight of objective historical evidence  rather than repetitive tales of coffee house chats, anarchic newspapers,  and loud-mouthed ideologues -- written in a soporific stream of  consciousness 
  This story was about a boy named Robin who could not move his legs at all. His mom went to go see the Queen and his father was fighting the Scots in the North. While they were gone he stayed with a lady named Dame Ellen. One day she left and did not come back so a monk took him to a hospice. He wrote a letter to his father to meet him at Castle Lindsey. They met each other and soon his mom came home, by then it was Christmas time. They lived happily ever after.    I would give this book 2 stars because it did not hold my attenttion at all.   I did not like this book at all it did not hold my attention.                                                                                                                             
 this book comes with a kit thats not worth the price. it has templets that are more time consuming, you'd rather buy the quick and easy paper punches. this book is good for primary school children. not for somone who's looking at making serious cards. wat a waste of money 
 I don't want to challenge anyone's right to be a conscientious objector, but isn't it ironic that someone with this name, who starts a band called "The Raiders" and who habitually wears military uniforms, should have been one?  Also on the 'things are not quite what they seem' theme: on the insert notes and in the 'autobiographical' track titled The Legend of Paul Revere we are told that Paul was 'flipping burgers' when he decided to form a group.  Maybe so, but it's worth noting that he was actually the owner of a string of burger joints.  But what of the music?  Pure bubble gum; great if you like that kind of thing.  It's very derivative; you'll hear shades of The Byrds, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones in there.  There is some excellent instrumental work, so they were not entirely without talent, and they turn out some great R&B sounds on occasion.  They simply discovered that wearing tights, growing Beatle hairstyles and singing pap was a great way to have fun and make fortunes.  There was clearly friction between founder members Revere and vocalist Mark Lindsay.  The latter (often seen as the real star of the group) wanted to develop the music further, whereas Revere was happy to keep blowing bubbles.  It's noteworthy that on their respective websites, they make little or no mention of each other.  Lindsay did go on to other things.  Revere, last I heard, was still prancing around in antique uniforms, singing the same songs.  To be fair, those that see his show say it's great fun.  
 Just as another anthropologist with a Ph.D. perpetrated a hoax by raping the soul of a culture, while appealing to the drug culture, Wesselman offers a series of Castaneda re-treads, appealing to the masturbatory fantasies of spiritual eunuchs.  Summoning every tired new age cliché from the Art Bell lexicon, Wesselman is to mysticism what Jackie Collins is to quantum physics 
 I've spent the last 20+ years in the military and I really enjoy reading about our military heroes.  But, it bothers me when someone uses the military to espouse their political ideology.  I don't know anything about Allen Mikaelian, but I'd guess he was very unhappy with the presidential election in 2000 and felt he needed to do something.  The author selectively picks recipients that provide a positive image of the left wing and a negative image of the right wing.  There is nothing wrong with highlighting minority or women recipients.  I think that is great and much needed, but the author should have been up front with the title and foreword and should have left out the political propaganda.  Instead he covertly gives the impression that these 11 individuals represent your typical CMH recipient, both historically and politically.  This book definitely has some value, but unless your polical views are a little far to the left, you may get a bit irritated at the political rhetoric.  
 I read this book for school, my sister said it would get better, but it turned out to be the worst book I've ever read. I rest my case. 
 My Coolpix 8800 lapsed into "system error 2" mode within weeks of getting it.   After taking 3 or 4 shots the error message comes up and I have to shut it down and start it back up to take a few more shots before the error 2 message recurrs.  Nikon says to try a fresh battery and different storage card...no help.   Now Nikon says says send it in and we'll fix it- but don't say what it will cost...   The shots I do get aren't as good as an HP camera we have that was half the price.  The controls are ridiculously complex.   The flash pops up and fires when shooting in bright light...the whole thing is a piece of junk.  The only good shots I've gotten with it are inside shooting documents from 2 feet away...but for any outdoor complicated lighting it is unreliable... I wouldn't recommend this camera or any Nikon product to my worst enemy....Oh yeah, and they made the lens an oddball size so you have to buy overpriced Nikon filters for it.... 
 .............I think he does a wonderful job at putting these works together.  The only bone I have a the moment is that Mr. Walsh tends to make all his victims heroes/saints/outstanding figures of society.  That cannot be true.  All victims are not saint-like. Conversely, the bad guys have no worthy trauma in their background. Cut and dried, bad is bad, no slack from Mr. Walsh.  I'm still thinking about that theory 
 This has got to be the worst book I've ever read. How convenient that Amazon lists the good reviews first. That means most people won't read this. However, I'll give my two cents worth anyway. Several previous reviews state this book is funny, it's not! The book has no plot, no ending, and only a very fragmented, mostly deranged stream of thought in between. I can only guess that Ms. Smith was trying to be clever with her rambling list of web sites, use of etc. every few lines and endless droning on about cliches. It all falls flat because it all leads to no where and nothing. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Save your money for something by a different author 
 This DVD Was Both A Waste Of Time (only 49 Minutes Long) And Money. If You Enjoy Pissing Away Your Cash And Wasting Time Waiting For Something To Be Funny This Is Your DVD. However If You Like To Laugh And Work Hard For Your Money And Spend It Wisely Steer Clear Of This. Sorry Gilbert, I Usually Enjoy Your Humor, But There Was None Of That Here. I Actually Feel Sorry For The People Who Were At The Taping Of This Disc Having To Sit Though This Wreck 
 I have been a fan of Dean Koontz for many years, but I stopped reading his new novels about 6 years ago, because after awhile, it seemed as if all of his characters were the same. I recently read the back cover of this book, and it sounded so interesting, so I gave it a chance. Boy, was I sorry. It is as if Dean Koontz regressed to a first year creative writing student! His sentences are awkward, mostly out of an insane desire to use as many adjectives and adverbs as he can - it is as if he wrote the book with a thesaurus by his side. This was way too distracting, and it really diminished what otherwise could have been an entertaining tale.  Please Dean, take an opportunity to read some 'how-to' books on writing 
 It is a miracle that Misha was not hit by a car. Letting a dog roam free in an urban area for days is something your most common and average citizen would never do. But then they aren't involved in important experiments like Liz is.  Anyone with common sense could see that Misha, the Siberian Husky that Liz used for a completely useless experiment, could very easily have been hit by a car and either killed, or seriously injured and then try to find his way home in pain and fear.  No problem for Liz though. She's got research to do! What amazing irony that one of the dangers for Misha that Liz acknowledged was the "dognappers" who could have taken Misha for use in laboratory experiments 
 If your main objective, is the study of human relationships, social rapports between humans, and conquering and seducing other people, this movie is for you.  Not an embarrassing movie, at all, for any of the actors. Just, a nutty story, and enfatuation of the author of the script with people, relationships, seduction, etc.   This is not to say that the above aspects are unimportant. Not true. Just that, perhaps a movie about such a theme might be more fun for some people than others 
 I recently finished reading Nathaniel Philbrick's excellent book, "The Heart of the Sea, the story of the Whaleship Essex" and realized that Sena Naslund took a major chunk of her story from real-life events.  I suggest that readers of "Ahab's Wife" read Philbrick's book next--it is much more interesting and a truly fantastic read.  Naslund most certainly based the seafaring section of her novel upon this true story: the whaleship Essex  is stove by a white whale in the South Pacific. The men take refuge in whaleboats, and the captain is convinced by his mates to head to South America instead of Tahiti, out of fear of cannibalism, yet they eventually resort to cannibalism themselves.  I had to skim parts of Naslund's book, as it got so tedious in parts.  In contrast, Philbrick's book kept me riveted from start to finish 
 Hank Hanegraff is a blatant replacement theologian where the nation of Israel is concerned.  He is further from the truth where prophecy is concerned than most groups, to include pretribulationists.  Indeed, his "scholarship" is no scholarship at all; it is pure propaganda....  To see real scholarship, get Tim Cohen's materials (see below):  Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, Zola Levitt, Thomas McCall, John Hagee, Grant Jeffrey, Marlin Maddox, Perry Stone, Texe Marrs, John Walvoord (deceased), etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's site for details on these items, which are also available via Amazon) 
 The only song worth listening to is "Finer Feelings", hence the one star.  This album was a waste of money.  I'm so glad Kylie's music got 30 times better after this record 
 Slow wireless transfer speeds No way to automatically power-on after a power failure.  The web interface was confusing and hard to navigate. It wouldn't recognize my NTFS formatted data drive. I was forced to format the thing and spend hours transferring the same data back onto the drive.   I'm a pretty flexible guy but it just wasn't a useful addition to my network, so I returned it.  
 I am very disappointed in this program.  I have been doing my own graphics/cards for about 10 years.  I started with Print Shop (early edition) and progressed thru all the updates.  I then switched to PrintMaster and LOVED it!!!  Again, I have progressed to each new verion with very little or no problems...until now!  This has got to be the worst of the worst--- the program did not want to load without being babied.  When it finally loaded, it was very confusing and I found that I needed to get my graphics from the internet!  The area I live in only allows me to have dial up---you can imagine how long it takes to get the graphics I want!  If you are interested in doing your own graphics/cards, skip this program...go back to PrintMaster Platinum 16 for much better results.  As far as I am concerened, the River Deep Company needs to hide this edition in the DEEPEST RIVER they can find 
 Do yourself a favor and save the wasted time, effort, and headache and just buy the Apple brand cable.  I've tried these off-brand "OEM" cables and they have proven to be EXTREMELY unreliable.  Sometimes you really do 'Get what you pay for 
 With such a beautiful cover and such a career to discuss, I was very exicted about reading this book.  But OH MY GOD it was painful.  I'm sorry Mr Burns, but I don't care what your personal feelings are about Curtis.. I wanted to read about Curtis' life.. what he went through, how he came to write such beautiful music - but instead you give track by track detail of every album - and thats it.  Here's hoping someone can write an interesting book about such an inspirational man 
 Este hombre hace siempre la misma película, P lo hace fatal, el resto de actores siempre con el mismo papel. Los Americanos flipais con Almodovar, pero si vivierais en Spain os dariais cuenta de lo malo que es. Spanish is diferent 
 Poor carafe design makes this Mr. Coffee machine a waste of money. We bought this model to replace our old Mr. Coffe machine after we broke the carafe and couldn't purchase a replacement for that model.  We loved our old Mr. Coffee, but this purchase was completely dissatisfying because, as other reviewers have noted, it's virtually impossible to pour without spilling the coffee/water everywere.  After the first few uses, we decided to purchase a different coffee maker 
 I was so excited to get this book--I love to bake and love making homemade brownies. When the book arrived 2 weeks ago, I was not disappointed. Great sounding recipes, very pretty book. I believe I have pasted about 50 sticky-note tabs to the pages of the brownies I wanted to try.  So why two stars? Well, I've now made 4 different batches of brownies, and not one has turned out. The biggest problem seems to be baking time--upwards of 20-25 minutes off the time stated in the book to get them past pure "goo" stage. That would be fine if they turned out ok in the end, but that was not the case. With the extended baking time, the perimeter of the brownies (at least 2 inches in) curled up and was very overbaked before the centers were anywhere close to being ready. I salvaged what I could.  I will use this book for ideas about flavor combinations, but I'll stick with my Cook's Illustrated brownie recipe since it works.   
 I am NOT a coffee snob...I like all kinds and strengths of coffee, however, melitta does not do its one:one machine justice with these pods.  I tried all of the pods in the variety pak and was not happy with any of them.    (...) Really good coffee, lots of variety to choose from and extremely quick shipping.  Skip the melitta pods and try the Arabica Express pods (I like the Italian and vanilla pods) from podheads 
 i cannot, with good conscience recommend this movie.    please, look at it! it's awful!    drew barrymore, in her sad "poison ivy" stage, is a wretched performer.  there are pothole plothole's all over the place.  and it's itchy to watch the scene with her real mother, jaid barrymore.  were they attempting reconcilliation through a b-movie?  oh! and the guy from adventures in babysitting, father of the bride & a few episodes of friends is in it, fumbling around too. where is that guy?  there's a tough broad friend, a spooky house & at one point SPOILER: drew splits in half all oogy and walks around like some really skinny anatomy horror movie thingy.  hey! now it sounds kind of good again 
 This is a good GUY flic, nothing special, but fun for gamblers and football fans. The whole thing is kind of a self-hype, true story. The gambling predictor as ladies man and hero, puffed up and glamorized, but the fantasy is the thing for young men. Gambling, chicks, and swell clothes is what it's all about.  Shallow, no 
 I have had this watch for about 4 months. If you don't have a job operating a jack hammer it will probably run itself down. I am very disappointed in the watch. It was not cheap. I paid about $200. for it and I expected better. I am one of those people that never take my watch off and it still winds down and stops. I made a big deal about this watch with my wife, and now I get a lot of grief when I complain about it. It is sturdy, having hit the wall several times 
 Quoting the first 2 sentences of the book:  "In the American system, citizens were taught that the transfer of political power accompanied elections, formal events when citizens made orderly choices about who shall govern. Very few Americans, therefore, understood that the transfer of power might also occur, more subtly, without elections."  Unfortunately, Greider is right about most Americans' stunning ignorance about how they're really governed, although one could argue that more and more people are waking up to the fact that all is not as it seems on the surface. So far, so good - but then, in the next paragraph, without mentioning the Federal Reserve by name, he says:  "It was part of the national government, yet deliberately set outside the electoral process, insulated from the control of mere politicians."  Good propaganda must be mostly truth to work. As I write, this book has a rating of 4 1/2 stars out of 5. This is an indication that the majority of reviewers have bought into the well spun propaganda Greider delivers.  The Federal Reserve is a 100% privately owned corporation, carefully set up to appear as though it is an arm of government. It was created solely for the benefit of it's shareholders, a significant proportion of which are foreign. Greider could have mentioned this extremely important fact at the outset. Instead he deliberately helps perpetuate the myth that "The Fed" is public.  He spends the rest of the 700+ pages going into excruciating detail about The Fed's decisions and their direct effects on the economy, with a focus on the time of Volcker's reign. If that's what you're looking for, this is the book for you. If you're looking for true insight into The Fed, its origins, who it benefits, and how it directly controls the largest economy in the world (and indirectly many other economies through their privately owned central banks) at the expense of everyone else, then I'd suggest reading "The Creature from Jekyll Island".  Why 1 star? I don't like propaganda deliberately designed to mislead people who are seeking truth about a subject which affects all of us. The few citizens that take the time to research a subject so important to all of us deserve better than to be distracted by true  - but on the whole, irrelevant - information 
 This movie is complete garbage. I actually like Robert Downey Jr as an actor but hated him in this movie. Please do yourself a favor and don't watch this trash 
 I guess if you don't work for Walgreens there would be some interesting anecdotes in this book for you to read.  It looks to me like the author took the "Daily Dose of Dave"s and edited them all together in book format.  If you've work for the company for a few years then you've probably read a lot of the stuff here already through Mr Jorndt's weekly bulletins.  It's more a biography of Charles Walgreen than a look into the company.  I would find someone else who owns it and ask to borrow their copy rather than buy it.  Not recommended 
 Readers should be forewarned that this is a polemical tract rather than a work of evidentiary historical scholarship. The idea that Chinese science was "ahead" of the West (however we define the West) is not new at all; it was a central theme of Joseph Needham's work half a century ago, some of which has stood the test of time and much of which hasn't. At least Needham and his collaborators were able to draw original Chinese sources into their studies (and the later works of his collaborators in "Science and Civilization in China" are mostly excellent). Hobson's work is laden with casual and unsubstantiated assertions, overuse of silly and undefined terms like "economic miracle," and unduly credulous readings of previous scholars who had their own axes to grind. As for individual  critiques of his specific assertions about such issues as iron production, currency flows, etc, I'll leave that to the reviewers in the standard professional journals, if they bother to review this book (Although I'm sure it will be warmly received in some fields, like cultural studies, where the citation of prominent European intellectual theorists is more important than having reliable Chinese sources). In sum, this is a contribution to the growing ranks of Sino-triumphalist works by western writers guided more by recent politics and economic trends than historical evidence. A common feature of this group, apparently, is to think that because some of their predecessors have made ridiculous Eurocentric claims minimizing China's significance in their own works, that means it's somehow advisable to make equally absurd and unbalanced Sinocentric claims now - in fact, because the transparency of this approach is so obvious, it ends up preaching to the converted. My plea to others working in the same field: learn to read Chinese and look at some actual texts to check whether they support your arguments. For readers in search of more legitimate works in English about Chinese science, I heartily recommend "On Their Own Terms" by Benjamin Elman, published by Harvard University Press, which seems to be taking up the mantle so unfortunately cast off by Cambridge University Press 
 I didn't think it was possible, but they did it: the Barenaked Ladies actually made a sub-par album. This record is just weak. Don't get me wrong, there's some great songs here ["Celebrity", "War On Drugs", "Aluminum"], but most of it [particularly "Another Postcard" and 'Shopping"] is just embarrasing. I've always enjoyed the tongue-in-cheek side of BNL, but the jokes on this album are far too blatant. Rather than finding the perfect balance, BNL put too much emphasis on humor and too little on songwriting, and the songwriting is where they really shine. I tried to like this album, I really did, but it just didn't happen. I'm still spinning the first five albums non-stop; they are classics. 
 ..whats all that about? I'm putting this crap on eBay first chance I get, I'm totally disgusted at the editing ,not because of how it was edited at the time of original release, but because they have not extended the songs to there original length . Ten Years After's 'I cant Keep from crying' with extended guitar solo from Alvin Lee, was nearly 20 minuites long and they put barely 5 minuites of it on here. This could have been made into an extended package, like most reissued/remastered concert footage has been . There is little enough footage of Ten Years After&Alvin Lee out there, yet Jethro Tull's full Isle of Wight 'full' 1 hour set has been released on DVD . Nice remastering, shame about the footage. 
 I also made the mistake of judging a book by its cover and buying this book for my fourth grade daughter at the Scholastic Bookfair.  Do you want your daughter to read about a girl whose parents divorced when she was ten and writes "my method for dealing with depression was a razor blade and a locked bedroom door". This story called "Sleep-Away Camp" deals with self-mutilation.  Your child can read about a four-year old girl and her sister getting felt "in places that aren't meant to be seen by other people." How about a suicide story? How about a mother with flesh-eating disease? Or the deaths of best friends, fathers, or the death of a mother by mixed meds? It is all in this book. Of course, the authors also include anorexia and a mixed bag of other dysfunctional behaviors. Not quite so heart-warming as it is disturbing. I definitely feel I was  misled by the title and cover presentation. This book needs a "young adult" rating 
 This is, without a doubt, one of the worst "films" that I have ever witnessed.  The plot, if one can call it that, revolves around that parodying summer camp movies from the late 70's and early 80's would be hilarious.  And 21 years after they were made!  Or, was it an attempt to make a deliberately bad film, and label it "ironic"?  Either way, the film has some of the most indifferent, atrocious acting you're ever likely to see.  Janeane Garofalo (who needs to stop associating herself with David Wain and Michael Showalter, the creators of this "film" and the awful TV series, Stella) looks like she rather be anywhere else, David Hyde Pierce looks like he wants to strangle his agent for giving him this script, and you will be lucky to chuckle twice in the entire film.  In the featurette, the directors Michael Showalter and David Wain, say they were drunk during most of the shoot, and it shows.  Indifferent performances, horrible direction, continuity errors (like visible tape marks on the floor, hair styles changing in the same shot), and an appalling lack of professionalism sink this film early and it never recovers.  There is nothing good about his film, other than it ends.  It amazes me that people out there could actually like this film, AND give it five star reviews.  For the rest of you out there, do not waste 97 minutes of your time.    
 This unit is easy to set up and get running initially; it's the perpetual irritation and disfunctionality that occur afterwords that make this such a useless piece of [...].   I bought this upon the recommendation of a friend. He warned me, however, to have a backup (like a CD player) because "this thing was irritating".   I had mine hooked up to my wireless network for about a week before I finally took it for a very rough (but long overdue) final trip to the trash. The only thing I'm still wondering about is why my friend (a notably intelligent Mechanical Engineer) felt that this irritation was worthwhile.   During the aforementioned Week of Audiophilic Agony, I can honestly say that this device functioned (on demand) less than 30% of the time. I can't even begin to desribe all of the irritating episodes that occurred--bizarre, inexplicable conflicts with other (previously installed) devices on my network; saying it's doing one thing (like playing a song)--while actually doing another (...not playing a song); etc., etc., etc...   This gadget will surely put your Wireless Network Enginnering Skills to the test. Don't really have any? Oh...well, sorry for your bad luck.   I could easily waste the next hour of your time telling more horror stories. I'd prefer not to do that, however--in this case, I'd rather think of myself as the "Robin Hood of the Technologically Skeptical Crowd."   I personally listen to music for relaxation, not irritation. I've not tried other wireless music streaming devices, but do yourself a favor--skip this one and find an alternative (it's hard to imagine one doesn't exist)--even if it means reverting to your single CD player.   If you find reloading a 5 CD changer to be too much of a pain in the [...], just try to remember the good 'ole days, when you'd glady flip and dust that scratchy LP every 18-25 minutes just to enjoy the other side.  
 Anna Quindlen has many gifts, but subtlety is not one of them. Nor is originality. Just about every character and plot device in this novel has been used before -- many, many times before. Oddly, for a hell-on-wheels nagging feminista, Anna Quindlen seems unduly influenced by male authors (and cliches.) She steals much, but understands little.   Let's see, a family saga about a wealthy immigrant clan ruled by a shady, all-powerful patriarch. GODFATHER, anyone? Just as John Scanlan is clearly Don Vito, so is uber-achiever teen girl Maggie Scanlan clearly in the Michael Corleone position. She's all but anointed as his successor -- at thirteen! The only problem is, all the tough moral questions Michael Corleone has to face are carefully airbrushed away for Maggie. The old man is a brute, a bully, and all the usual feminist crybaby stuff -- but it's perfectly all right for Maggie dearest to inherit all that yummy money.    On the other hand, this book also owes a surprising debt to TOM SAWYER. Tom Sawyer and Maggie Scanlan are both the smartest, liveliest, most charismatic kids in the neighborhood. Both are surrounded by dumb, weak-willed sidekicks who exist only to make them look good. Maggie has the blandly obnoxious Debbie Malone, and Tom has Ben Rogers, Joe Harper, and -- dare I say it -- future hero Huck Finn. Tom Sawyer and Maggie Scanlan are both expected to have brilliant futures, if they don't drown, burn, or blow themselves up in the process of having their amazing but never truly subversive teen adventures.    The most interesting TOM SAYWER parallel is in the use of the hero's nemesis or arch-enemy. Tom has Injun Joe, and Maggie has her cousin Monica Scanlan. At first glance a vicious murdering half-breed and a luscious Grace Kelly lookalike might not seem to have much in common. But it seems that compassionate feminista Anna Quindlen hates blondes even worse than Mark Twain hated Indians -- she's just less honest about what she feels!  Look at all the amazing similarities. Injun Joe and Monica both torture the hero in secret, when no one can see them. Both are masters of disguise. Both meet horrible fates that the heroes don't create but -- oh, so sorry! -- don't manage to prevent on time. There's a certain have it both ways hypocrisy in both novels. Twain claims to present America as a land of innocence and hope -- only the Indians have got to go. Anna claims that Maggie and her luscious college girl mentor Helen are going to build "A New World" for all women  -- but first the blondes have got to go the way of the Indians. Ah, Sisterhood!  This tiresome business of bashing beautiful women goes back a long, long way in feminist literature. Poor Monica Scanlan is in good company, along with Hetty Sorrel, Rosamund Vincy, and Lucy Deane. (You can look up these fascinating ladies in the novels of George Eliot -- better yet, don't bother.) It's good to know that, like the nobility of the Bourbon restoration, the feminists of today have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.   Did I mention that the budding romance between Maggie and her shy boyfriend Bruce is handled with unusual skill and sensitivity? It's the best part of the book by far. Anna Quindlen has missed her calling -- she should be writing YA romance!  But of course, that sort of novel would be beneath a Barnard graduate.   
 Good Eastwood-Streep movie, but terrible book. The plot itself is fine, but the manner in which the book is written is amateurish and just plain sappy. Skip the book and watch the movie. If you want to read a well-written love story that doesn't insult your intelligence, then may I suggest Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice? Now that's good writing and an entertaining yarn to boot 
 I USE to own this CD,but, I hated it and therefor... did not listen to it much at all.  I ended up donating it to the local Library 
 This was a required text for my accounting class. Let's just say, if you're not familiar with accounting, or not fond of it, this text will make you hate it even more! Be careful because I somehow received the loose leaf edition of it and had to place it in my own binder.. 
 Disappointing to say the least.  Over 90% of the writing in this book was in book one - The Prodigal Son.  I find it hard to believe Koontz can release this in good conscience.  There are perhaps an additional 20-30 pages of new material in this book.  Save your money and go straight to book 3 
 When you have lost weight, it's a very natural thing for others to be curious about how you lost your weight and kept it off. Whenever they have heard me tell my story, read my blog or book, or found out that I did it on the low-carb lifestyle, one question invariably has come up from time to time:   "What do you think about this low-carb diet where you can eat whatever you want for one-hour per day?"  My initial reaction to these people was usually something along the lines of this:  "That's absolutely crazy! There's no way you could ever lose weight and keep it off using this method."  I did the Atkins diet and honestly have not stayed on top of all the bazillion other low-carb diets out there. But there was something very odd about this plan that it made me look around to find out more about it.  Little did I know there was an actual book out there about this very diet so many people had been telling me about. It's called The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet and it was written by a husband/wife team Drs. Richard and Rachael Heller.  The CAD diet, as it is referred to, makes the claim (and I agree with it) that many people are addicted to carbohydrates and need to be weaned off from depending on them for sustenance. Just like a drug addict gets small concentrated doses of their preferred drug daily so they can eventually get by with less and less, that same concept is what goes into the CAD diet.  If people think the Atkins diet is restrictive, then check out what you have to do on the CAD diet:  BREAKFAST: ZERO-carb meal consisting of protein and fat. LUNCH: ZERO-carb meal consisting of protein and fat.  You are NOT allowed to eat any bread, fruit, milk, juice, and most starchy vegetables. Absolutely NO snacking whatsoever except for black coffee or diet soda. You cannot use artificial sweeteners either.  Sound appealing, anyone? Hmmm? I suppose if that's all there was to this diet, then NOBODY would do it. But there is one more key aspect of the CAD diet that you probably will be interested in.   DINNER: Eat equal amounts of protein, vegetables and dessert of whatever you want to eat in whatever amount, but it must be eaten in a one-hour time frame. You can even enjoy a beer or glass of wine with your "reward" meal.  How's that for incentive? You basically starve all day long just so you can get to those sixty minutes at the end of your day where you can say hello to the buffet line! Who wouldn't enjoy a diet that lets you do THAT?!  Well, I'm still very skeptical about any lifestyle change that encourages you to eat the very foods that got you overweight or obese to begin with on a DAILY basis. I caught a lot of flack from my fellow low-carbers about my controversial "planned splurge" meal every 6-8 weeks during my weight loss. However, the Hellers give you a DAILY planned splurge!!! What's up with that?  We can blame this on Dr. Rachael, who stumbled upon this way of eating when she weighed 268 pounds after being on diet after diet. She became a psychologist to learn more about why people overeat (ostensibly to help herself in the process, too). She had skipped breakfast and lunch on a particular day she was fasting for a blood test and then, like most of us would, ate to her heart's content whatever she wanted for supper. The next morning she noticed she had dropped 2 pounds.  Thinking something must have gone wrong with her scale, she tried it again the next day, skipping breakfast and lunch and then eating a gargantuan dinner and once again, she lost another pound. She played around with what would eventually become The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet and went on to lose 150 pounds which she has kept off to this day.  The frequency of eating carbohydrates is the key behind the CAD diet. The Hellers believe that anyone who consumes ANY amount of carbohydrates during the day will set off all the bells and whistles in your body that you are hungry faster than if you avoided them altogether. They say that eating carbs throughout the day is like giving lots of small doses of cocaine to a cocaine addict. It will make them crave their poison even more!  That's why you basically avoid eating carbs on the CAD diet until the end of the day. This process of getting over carbohydrate addiction is a tricky one, and the Hellers think they have found a solid plan for making it work for lasting weight loss in people.  I still can't get around the fact that you don't change the poor eating habits of the people who have packed on the pounds. Sure, they basically starve themselves throughout the day before they eat their one BIG meal each day, but how is that stimulating the metabolism and preventing the biggest obstacle to weight loss success -- HUNGER!  There's no way I could do the CAD diet because I enjoy eating every 2-3 hours to keep my digestive process constantly in motion. I truly believe this is one of the things that has helped me lose the weight and keep it off. Since you cannot snack or use artificial sweeteners on the CAD diet, it would literally drive me insane even if there was that "reward" meal at the end of the day!  Wanna take a test to see if you are a carb addict? Click here to take the 10-question Carbohydrate Addict's Test. I scored a 2, which means "You do not appear to be carbohydrate addicted." No kidding, ya think?  Dr. Jonny Bowden, author of Living The Low-Carb Life, examined the CAD diet and said the diet uses some fuzzy science to make their points about why their plan works.  "While it seems pretty clear that there are both insulin and serotonin abnormalities in the obese, it's not at all clear that high levels of insulin depress levels of serotonin, as the Hellers hypothesize--in fact, the majority of the evidence points to the opposite response."  Furthermore, Dr. Bowden said he is concerned about the lack of attention on exercise as part of their weight loss program, stating "it's vital to both maintaining weight and to raising the metabolic rate."  While The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet has worked for a lot of people and I always tell people to do what works for them to lose weight and keep it off, I still have my reservations about this program. I think I'll pass on carb-loading my body for one hour a day 
 Well, at least the movie is faithful to its source in its spirit. Based on a book written on 1902, it's nostalgia of the British empire belongs to that era. The plot deals with a soldier who is expelled from his regiment for refusing to go to fight a colonial war in Sudan because of his impending marriage. Not only his colleagues regard him now as a coward, but also his future wife. He had no choice then but to go to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward. The filmmakers try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date, to our more contemporary (and one hopes, more enlightened) attitudes. There's no post colonial guilt here whatsoever. In some ways, this speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to tamper with the original material; in another way, it is a bit shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie. All of this wouldn't matter much if the movie was entertaining; unfortunately, it is only intermittently so 
 The music stopped playing the same day we got it in the mail.  Would have been very cute if it wasn't so cheaply made. Very disappointed 
 This book is a prolonged snivel about the pain of voluntarily going to places the author then found tacky, hostile or boring. By his own account he had not a moment's pleasure from his travels until he reached Hawaii, where it was all American and OK and Not Foreign. The only puzzle is why he did not at a much earlier stage of the trip get on a plane and go there direct; presumably he'd taken an advance from his publisher and had to deliver a book of some sort. The whole thing carries a moral for modern travellers: if you can't engage constructively with the places you go to, then please, please, stay at home - that way you'll be happier, the foreign people will be happier, and you won't needlessly contribute to airline CO2 emissions 
 I was not impressed with this book.  The glowing reviews are a mystery to me.  Miller seemed to begin one train of thought jump to another and back again.  The lack of organization was overwhelming.  The dry, unexpressive writing was disappointing.  As a text this is muddled, as "engrosing non-fiction" utterly lacking.  Furthermore, this book was extremely long.  The length is not necessarily a negative in itself, but it is when it seems that nothing of substance is being said.  The length of this book can be attributed to the constant reiteration and the poor organization.  Pure facts are as difficult to weed out as it is to understand the structure.  Very disappointing 
 Apparently,their last work with frontman Steve Perry and quite the let down.'Trial...' was the band's '96 comeback attempt,but if I remember correctly this CD was a stiff from the get-go.I tried SO hard to get into this fifteen track disc,but even with a duration of 68 minutes,I just couldn't.The songs don't completely suck,they just don't appear to have much life.Fantastic cover,don't you agree?If you're an old school Journey fan,I encourage you to check out their new 2005 release,'Generations' with vocalist Steve Augeri,who's been with the band for awhile now.That CD is surprisingly good,as I'd give it 3 1/2,maybe 4 stars.Keep in mind that guitarist Neal Schon is their 'key' player 
 the plot is a little bit superficial and has, like the film industry, not really some depth to think about. it's a discworld book with all this nice highlights of writing style but as the main red line is not a very interesting one to me, i find this book one of the lower quality discworld ones... if you are a discworld fan, then it's of course for you, but if you are looking for a first discworld book, then make sure it's not this but instead e.g. Small Gods or Monstrous Regiment or Pyramid 
 I read this short novel because I greatly admired Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning "Killer Angels," and because I'm a baseball fan.  The novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher.  It's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot.  The characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories.  The feel or atmosphere just isn't quite there.  Any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away, flaws that distract and damage the work.  Shaara sets most of the novel in Yankee Stadium with the Hawks playing the Yankees.  Why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear.  The Hawks apparently are from Atlanta, but an Atlanta team, Braves or Hawks, whichever, would not be playing the Yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season.  Finally, when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game, he does so in the semi-hidden bull pen down the left field line in Yankee Stadium--not on the mound on the field.  This book was published posthumously and Mr. Shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose--prose that was excellent in "Killer Angels."  It's unfortunate.  There are glimmers of interest in the book, but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author's other book 
 Thankfully this book is not very long, so my disappointed is only so deep. It must be said that if Samuel Huntington did not write his "Clash of Civilizations", then this book would not have written or published. This is an attempt to argue Huntington's theory, which is fine, but in the wrong method. Entitled "Identity and Violence", Sen covers very little on Identity and even less on violence. Sen states that we all have multiple IDs. He then restates it. And then again. And then again with the added ideal that focusing on one ID is dangerous. He repeats this too many times.  What Sen fails to address, recognize or grasp is the concept of an Identity. What is it? Why do we have them? What influences IDs? What are the connections between ID and violence. What is violence? Why is it used? Why is it bad? Is violence bad? Just way too many questions about Identity and Violence are left unanswered, unaddressed, and avoided in a book called "Identity and Violence" 
 Possibly the worst book I have ever read.  The "style" could be bested by a not-too-bright fifth grader.  The plot is an imbecilic rehash of the Divinci Code.  Don't bother keeping track of any details, because everything turns out to be irrelevant.  If you want to entertain yourself and your friends, however, check this out of your local library and get mildly drunk.  Now open the book at random and read aloud.  This should cause hysterical I-can't-believe-this-got-published laughter.  
 This shows all the hallmarks of another rigging of the review process by shameless spruiker Brad Sugars.  Notice all 5 star reviewers have only ever reviewed books by B.S. and .... low and behold they all recieve 5 stars, and most are thinly disguised promotions complete with embellished statements of the undoubted and profound effects it's purchase will have on your business, imploring you to buy it, complete with exclamation marks!  B.S. started Action International Business Coaching, with 700+ franchise holders, it seems to me a portion of those are working overtime through review writing to ingratiate themselves with "The Boss".  I don't doubt Mr B.S. has probably done some admirable things, but the two books of his that I made the mistake of purchasing (Instant Cashflow and Real Estate Riches) were the text equivalent of "Vaporware" with little beneficial content and many tired cliches.  So to summarise, boo to you Mr B.S., living proof that Snake Oil Salesmen never die, they just change industries, you've reached a new low.. 
 What a disappointment. Every single character in this film is depressed, mentally ill, and self-absorbed. No one is sane or sympathetic. Therefore, there's no one to identify with or root for. No one gets better or grows as a person. So what's the point? Annette Benning gives a strong performance, but her character is vapid and self-pitying. Not worth two hours of your life 
 While I didn't partiularly care for this book, I can see how others might like it.  I'm not a big fan of fake meat products, and this book has an over abundance of recipies featuring processed "meat" analogs.  I very rarely use this book for this reason.  That being said, I do enjoy her baked goods section.  So, if you don't mind the vegetarian "meat," you may like this book, but if you don't like it either, then you may want to go with her other cookbook, "the Soy of Cooking," which tends to use more vegetables, temph and tofu rather than "meat. 
 This book, up to the very end was very good. With out a doubt a three star book maybe three and a half.  The end is what ruins the entire thing. Don't worry I'm not going to spoil anything. I'll just say the ending stinks out loud!  This story is not really horror, its SiFi. A adventure/drama/SiFi. It really should have been about 100 to 200 pages longer. Everything in it was really cool and fun to read but it just seemed rushed. And somethings were not really dove into thoroughly enough. The writting was dead on as always and character development was good.  This book just needed another couple hundred pages to go from a barley average book to a great book 
 "The Koreans have established a group they call the anti-Japanes Communist party. Koreans were part of the Japanese Empire but hated the Japanese and hated the war." quote from page. 89 This book has a high risk of being misread by people who are not aware of the Korea-Japan history. Japan brutally "invaded" Korea. The author knows this. But she still describes Korea as if it is supposed to be part of Japan.   If you are not aware of the history, you would think "damn those Korean communists, why do they hate Japanse? What's wrong with them?" Imagine,  "Netherland people have established a group they call anti-German Communist party. Netherland was part of the German Empire but hated the Germans and hated the war." Would you want your kids who are not aware of the German invasion, to read this and think that Netherland people were wrong?  The book describes Koreans as cruel, barbarious people who tries to harm innocent Japanese people, who are described as the victims.  Come on!! Japanese were the invaders, and Koreans were the victims!! The hardships that she goes through is because of all the atrocities that Japanes has committed to Koreans!!   This is a well written book, but if it can form a misconception about history, it should not be recommended by school teachers to their students.  Especially, the Japanese still have not apologized for all the atrocities they have done to Koreans, Chinese, and other Asian countries. At least Germans have apologized for what they've done. I'm very sure there are much better books that can be recommended.   The author's father was a high official who worked in manchuria, where Unit 731 was using Koreans and Chinese people like lab mice to test their biological weapons.  Search Unit 731 in wikipedia if you don't know what I'm talking about. Search Asian Holocaust, for other atrocities that Japan has committed. 
 The man died as he lived a loser. This uneducated thug was nothing more than a racist piece of crap. Plain and simple truth. The only praise he deserves is praise that he is dead. Thats one less racist thug off the streets. A two year old can write better music than he did. Heck calling his stuff music is an insult to music and musicians every wher 
 I am a great admirer of some of Steinbeck's books. Grapes of Wrath is among my top ten.  East of Eden is unspeakably bad. It thrashes cliches out until they smell of putrefaction. The brother conflict, rather than being a modernization of the first biblical murder story, is an exaggeration in kitsch than can hardly be surpassed. So is the story of the incredible evil woman, the mother. So is the good Chinese in his great goodness. It makes me grow new goose bumps just to remember the extremes that Steinbeck went into as far as sentimentality goes. There is not a single real person in here. The book is a rambler. It walks about the countryside of it's story like a gentleman with nothing better to do. It gives you heaps of little pearls that wait for the rescue from the swine. It throws aphorisms at you when you start drowning in the pulp. In Germany we had a special genre for this kind of writing: the Heimatroman. This is one. I enjoyed and cursed it till the end. And then I watched the movie. Boy, was James Dean a bad actor, you wouldn't believe it. It got an Oscar in it's days as best movie? Oh boy. There is absolutely nothing right in the movie. And that made me realize the difference: the movie is so bad, you can not possibly stand it till the end. The book however is a monument of artistic provocation. I couldn't put it away. I dumped the DVD though 
 I purchased this DVD and it was scratched to hell. It will not play without continuously skipping 
 We were led to believe that this book was geared for children because of the trading cards included.  However, the subject matter is crude and offensive on many pages.  I would definitely not recommend this book for children.  I also think that the contents reflect the downward spiral in our culture and therefore, would not recommend it for adults either 
 By reading all of the other reviews I thought that this book would be right up my alley, and the actual story line was, but the execution of the story really lacks something.  I felt no real connection to the characters, and there was never any suspense to the writing that made me want to read further.  It's not that I disliked the book - it's that it didn't stirred my emotions at all.  I felt that it was a waste of time 
 I have never read anything so poorly written before.   This "book" is a waste of time and of paper 
 Although Dead Soul begins quite decently and surprisingly for Doss, who has a tin ear for dialogue, dearly loves a cardboard character, and has no sense of plot, it rapidly and unsurprisingly disintegrates into a mangle of missed opportunities.   Since most plot reveals take place off scene, you have no idea what's going on until the end where Charlie tells all. Is this supposed to create suspense? Does Doss even realize how ridiculous this is? Does he have an editor? Can the editor read English? Now these are real questions for Charlie to answer 
 i haven't read the book,but if you have a whole chaptyer on fusaichi pegasus,who turned out to be a dud,why should i.the only animal voted among the greatest athletes in the 20th century even ahead of my idol mickey mantle,the greatest natural baseball talent we humans ever saw,was secretariat!he sprinted the belmont,with no one around him,he hit the mile at 1:34,and as the daily racing form said,into a strong wind down the stretch and hit the wire at 2:24 flat.maryland still denies him the stakes record at the preakness by two seconds.so why doesn't he appear in the table of contents 
 I wonder how many of the people who get up in arms about this airline accident get up in arms about the United State Navy shooting down an Iranian civilian airliner, then lying about it, then decorating the murderers who gave the order to shoot and the order to lie about it? Not many, I bet. I suppose some of you call yourselves Christians, too 
        The book is called The Circuit. This book is about a boy named Francisco Jimenez who wants to be another person. He had a hard time in school because he almost knew no English. He couldn't understand her. He had 3 brothers and 1 sister and a mom and dad. The worst thing to him was getting deported.        In school he had a problem with 2 kids named Curtis and his friend. They were the bullies. Once Francisco had wore a sweater that belonged to Curtis. Of course he didn't know. He was lucky they didn't beat him up. Later they became friends.         His brother that was born after him had a rare disease, but he made it through. I think that people who would like this book are people who have boring lives. After every chapter he wanted you to put the book down. He didn't leave any suspense. I hated the book so much. 
 This is another of those books for me that was very "middle of the road".  It was not terrible and it was not great.  It was a bit slow for my tastes and the characters were very ordinary.  
 I'm very glad that so many readers liked this book, and that it's been a good one for Vietnam vets.  But I felt that this book never found its way.  It felt like snapshots from a depressive life, intermingled with a thriller.  I guess it just didn't work for me as literature, or as a thriller.  I was was drawn to O'Nan by his work in Granta 54, but I probably won't try him again 
 My 60s something father gave me this book. I am a 45-year-old middle-class man with a 6-year-old son using my wife's account. I don't understand for whom this book is written. It is full of painfully obvious advice such as "Don't play with your food" or "Do not throw golf clubs... in anger." Anyone raised in America (presuming that is the author's intended audience) who doesn't already understand these things and take them to heart isn't going to be interested in reading about them in a book, if they can even read. Chapter 15 deals with Staring and differences where the author admonishes: "Do not repeat racist, sexist or ethnic jokes or tolerate them in your presence." If you were not a racist you would obviously already understand and agree with this. If you are, this book isn't going to change your attitude and you would probably want to burn it. I found this book useless for any reasonably sophisticated person unless you happen to be from a third world country or another planet. If the book was intended to teach good manners to the unsophisticated, dream on! I think the author has a Professor Henry Higgins Jones. I am also concerned about my father's opinion of me, I mean "Do not expect a child to endure a lengthy shopping trip unless it is to a toy or candy store." Duh 
 Within two hours of recieving my complaint the seller refunded my money, without requriing that I ship the product back.  For that I am thankful and appreciative, and can recommend the seller. I have no idea what was up with the product.  As I noted earlier, I just recieved this product and it has the overwhelming smell of petroleum, literally like the smell that comes from an oil truck delivering fuel oil to your home.  I bought this for a child and would never dream of giving it to them.  I am contacting the seller to request a refund.  If I succeed I will note that in the review and increase the star rating 
 I read the book and saw the movie, which other than title and major characters, have little in common.  I can't say I really liked either.  The book is a little funnier. My major learning from the whole project was when "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" taught me about "roman a clefs", of which "Devil" is one.  Perhaps if I had more interest in the fashion industry, I'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that "Devil" provides.  Meryl Streep is very good as the apparently soulless Miranda Priestly, editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, but somehow she's never quite devil enough.  Anne Hathaway is passable in her second (or third) "made over princess" role.  The minor characters, including the wonderful Tracie Thoms as "best friend" Lily, are mostly wasted.  
 I work in the construction industry as a secretary and I bought the Construction Dictionary for my desk so I could look up some of the more obscure words when I type letters and proposals.  This dicitionary is  really easy to read but the words are too basic.  It would be a good  dictionary for someone new to the business but if you need a more diverse  set of words this is not the dictionary for you.  It's priced right for the  beginner 
 I have been doing a lot of reading on Welles for a research project and while it is clear that Welles was no angel, this book seems to go out of its way to put Welles in the worst possible light.  There are too many flights of fancy and liberties taken.  For example, based on no evidence Thomson suggests that not only did Welles have sexual relations with Dorothy Commingore but that he practically raped her.  Perhaps the book reveals more about the author than it does about its subject.  There are some useful takes  on lesser known figures like John Toland but on the whole it is a book to take with several grains of salt 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 Yes I have on my night table "kind of blue" and "Giant steps" and "Chet"..... yes I am a "jazz nut".. but inspite of having listened at least 20 times to this CD, I just can't "get it"... I am giving it 2 stars as there is NO doubt of its historical value.. but I can't say that I really enjoy listening to this album..... I will try again in a few years........ Again this is only my opinion so maybe I am ( and probably am) wrong!!!  April 2007; 2 years later I realize now that this is a fantastic album. I just needed to train my ears!5 stars!!!!!!!! 
 If you are looking for some insight into the history of terrorist networks and what motivites these peaople then keep looking.  If you are looking for a short book of facts about al-Qaida then this is the book for you.  I found this book extremely dissappointing.  For one it is a mere 52 pages. (excluding the bibliography and long appenices).  The rest  of the book is little more than a list of facts.  ie 27 pages listing known or suspected members with a brief paragraph about each and 15 pages of a timeline listing several dates with a sentance or 2 about each 
 I had heard of the importance, and significance of "The Education of Henry Adams" for a long time. I finally determined I needed to read it.  I acutally read it twice, and found less in it the second time than the first.   I am sorry  I missed the greatness of this book. I am sure there was something wrong with me, but I found it to be incredibly unimpressive.   Perhaps this came from the fact that Henry Adams was not a likeable man. He was famous for holding court in his home near the White House, and making caustic and negative comments about every President who lived there.   Granted, he lived in Washington at a time when there were plenty of second-rate occupants of the White House. But the thought of people wasting their time trying to please  a blue-blooded snob like Adams depresses me. Why did anyone bother? He lived in an atmosphere of snobbery, sharp-tongues, clever remarks, and brilliant conversation. The world went on without him, truth be told, and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day.   He was a very good historian in his time. But who reads his books now? Not very many. In short, his own work was not as long-lasting as he would have wanted it to be. Maybe the influence of some of the Presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of Henry Adams.  "The Education of Henry Adams" does not have much real information. He got education in one place, none in others. Surely, the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for Henry--but he wrote nothing about it in his book.   When Eric Sevareid wrote "Not So Wild a Dream," it was compared to "The Education of Henry Adams." That was meant as a compliment. Oddly, I think Sevareid's book is much, much better. Sevareid wrote of America, the common man, the war, and what it all meant to him. Adams needed to get out more. He did not see America--not the America built by the common citizen who put it all together, and defended it.  I gained a trememdous amount from Sevareid. I cannot say the same for the work of Henry Adams.   Again, a lot of this might be me. Perhaps I read the book at a bad time. Maybe I needed to read it a third time. I do not know. I do know I do not think this is a great American classic. Forgive, please, my ignorance.

 I have just finished this lengthy and mundane tome. 564 pages of this author's ponderous personal philosophy,  gratuitous sexual dysfunction, constant and maddeningly self ingratiating referrals to classical music and composers, discussions on all the authors that ever walked the earth, and when finished with all the above, a good little story that could have been written with one third the pages.  As if all this were not enough, Styron pulls out every lengthy, obsolete, and arcane word that he can find with which to propel his story along. (One can imagine him, loaded with whiskey--which he freely admits to being his greatest source of inspiration--pouring over every dictionary and thesauras written in an attempt to impress the reader, or, at least the liberal East Coast intelligensia.)The end effect for the reader is a constant slowing of momentum of the narrative, in order to look up a new and confusing word every five minutes. (One does, however, come to learn what "simulacrum" means; he uses the word some 15 or more times throughout this laborious read.)  I will not go into the story, save to mention the three major plot lines: that it is one of about 10,000 treatments of the after effects of concentration camps; a love story about a deeply scarred woman, having endured life in one of the camps, and a mentally deranged man; and a young Southern writer coming to grips with culture shock in Brooklyn--this being Styron, or Stingo, as he endearingly calls himself in the story. In one of the more compelling passages in the book he realizes that he no longer wants to live in the South and turns back to the squalid and sewer like life of New York. Being from the South, and after having slogged through this tedious read, I only wish that he had been belched into the Northeast sooner.       
 As someone who studied meta-mathematics at Caltech and UCLA, I found this book disappointing-stylistically, mathematically and philosophically. To paraphrase the physicist Pauli, this isn't right; this isn't even wrong. This well-meaning man's editors should do a little bit of legwork before reprinting a man's inflated self-appraisal. I am so disappointed in this book that I am seriously considering returning it for a refund.   I guess I should blame myself. My first response to the editorial comment naming the author as the intellectual heir to Gdel and Turing was, "Gregory who?" Shelah, Solovay, Martin: these are names I know, but who is Gregory Chaitin? I should have gone with my gut. In retrospect, it is telling that all the jacket quotes are from freewheeling authors of popularizations, not from respected philosophers, logicians, or scientists.  The entire book is written in an embarrassingly gushing, adolescent style full of boldface and exclamation points. I know that the author was trying to write an enthusiastic, accessible book of philosophical and methodological advocacy, but this doesn't excuse shoddy editorial craftsmanship.   Don't take my word for it. Let the author speak for himself. From page 7, "Gdel's 1931 work on incompleteness, Turing's 1936 work on uncomputability, and my own work on the role of information, randomness and complexity have shown increasingly emphatically that the role that Hilbert envisioned for formalism in mathematics is best served by computer programming languages[.]"   Imagine if a working composer wrote, "Bach's preludes and fugues, Beethoven's symphonies, and my own string quartets have shown increasingly emphatically..." This man's reputation in his declared field is nowhere near his apparent stature in his own mind. The ideas discussed in this book are worthy of late-night musings over a nice brandy, or maybe a Scientific American article, but only after extensive revision. They are not ready for publication in a monograph.  From pages 148-149, "This book is full of amazing case studies of new, unexpected math ideas that reduced the complicated to the obvious. And I've come up with a few of these ideas myself. How does it feel to do that? [...] You have to be seized by a demon, and our society doesn't want too many people to be like that! [...] In fact, I only really feel alive when I'm working on a new idea, when I'm making love to a woman (which is also working on a new idea, the child we might conceive) or when I'm going up a mountain! It's intense, very intense. [...] I push everything else away. [...] I don't pay the bills. [...] And you can't force yourself to do it, any more than a man can force himself to make love to a woman he doesn't want. [...] People may think that something's wrong with me, but I'm okay, I'm more than okay."  And there you have it. I was hoping for a book to catch me up on some of the recent advances in meta-mathematics and how these ideas bear on science and philosophy. For a far better viewpoint on how information science influences modern physics, check out Charles Seife, Decoding the Universe. 
 The beginning of the book was written more like poetry rather than telling an actual story.  The sentences were broken up and scattered all over the pages, very inconsistant.  It's a little discouraging when you first start to read it and a bit confusing.  Towards the middle it began telling more a story rather than poems about how the "author" felt which helped you get into the book more.  Towards the end I just wanted to hurry up and finish it just to find out the ending without skipping to the end.  The story line is good but poorly written, true or not 
 After reading a number of books regarding women who served in the Vietnam War, I was anxious to read this book as well.  I expected more personal stories, perhaps a synopsis of the interviews of each of the 50 nurses studied.  And the word "studied" is where my main problem with the book lies.  It's written like a research paper or dissertation...I was unable to connect with any of the women on a personal or emotional level.  I found myself paging ahead, hoping it would get interesting, but unfortunately, it never did.  I much prefered "Women in Vietnam" by Ron Steinman or "A Piece of My Heart" 
 there was this girl--maybe a freshman in high school--who seemed to possess all that indispensible boy-girl scoop?  You know, like where the noses went when you kissed and stuff like that.  But once you got a little older, that same know-it-all girl was just an embarassment because she knew very little--but her confidence in what she did know fooled us all.  The point is this author is similar.  She has a big fan base, is able to sell her books as trade paperbacks--which at [...] is a big investment for most readers--and once you've read around a little bit you realize this is the most lightweight stuff and really not worth it.  Her female lead is supposed to be zany but in reality is mostly flaky.  The male lead is a little more complex but not by much.  There are the standard charming, slightly wacky oldsters to add a little wit to the mix and her hook for this book--oooh! Ghosts with a desire to unite couples through really lame stunts!  There are many MUCH better written series romance books available and at this price you could buy TWO solid reads that were written by authors who had committment and pride in their work 
 i read the house of m and thought it was pretty bad, so while bored i decided to try avengers disassembled.  unfortunately it was not very good either.  i just didn't like anything about this book at all. 
 The gameplay is just foolish and found the game annoying and un-fun!  The kids didn't even like it. Run, don't walk away from this dentist-office of a game JAWS-cr@p. (JAWS = Just another W. Smith 
 I'm a huge Dylan fan---own everything he ever released.  In my humble opinion, this is Bob's worst.  Just a really bad CD.  'Nuff said 
 I got mostly through the intro of this book and was immediately infuriated.  I sent this book right back to the store.  In the intro, it says natural is better, breast is best, I am not going to pretend that my goal is anything other than to convert you to my way of thinking.  So hello?  Who exactly IS this thinking woman?  I don't think it's the reader because it sounds like they will be told what to think, period, end of story.  I do not appreciate condescending tones in informational books.  They make it emotional when I am purely in search of facts.  It's true, I have never done this before and I am not an expert.  But at the same time, I am not an idiot.  I can read and comprehend.  I can participate in discussions and form my own opinions and beliefs.  Thanks for being straightforward with me, but I didn't buy this book to see one point of view.  I bought it to see what my options were.  I firmly believe there is no one right answer to all of this, and I would like the leeway to see all the answers in a factual way to decide what I want to do.  I will do the best I can, but I will not be put into a mold, thank you very much!  Not any mold.  Not the modern woman's "give me drugs now" mold, and not the natural woman's "hypnobirthing" mold, probably not Bradley or Lamaze either.  I will decide what to pursue after I am finished gathering information.    I feel like it is CRUCIAL for women to get an overview of the various methods and to select a strategy based on whether it is something within their personality to do.  Otherwise, I feel like it will be a waste of time when everything goes down as one will have to work as hard to "do the method" while already be working hard to get babies out.   I would not recommend this book if you are on the lookout for multi-faceted, non-biased, factual information.  Intead, check out "The Birth That's Right for You" by Amen Ness.  That book really gives you the lowdown on the birth process and a lot of different points of view on how women might cope based on their personality.  It isn't a side-by-side comparison on the different methods, but it is a realistic starting point and is chock full of information to better help a woman understand what she is in for 
 I am sorry but this book, after 5 years did not help my fiance at all. Infact, it just made it worse.   Some people don't realize that being "nice" is a personality trait, NOT a "disease". On top of this this isn't a "disease".  It's absolutely disgusting to call a personality trait a "disease".   Who am I to say such a thing causing such a paradigm shift in thought?  I am a social studies major, in the middle of getting my graduate degree.   and I think that this book, plus going to her outrageous seminars in L.A. was just another great way to pocket some cash by preying on victims who are convinced that they are bad for being nice.   This is all simple common sense people. Although I am not a huge Dr. Laura fan, I would suggest reading her books to get your thoughts straightened out on what is right and wrong and how it is OK to say no. Don't waste your time with this book. If you have a problem netowrking, go read Dale Carnagie's book "How to influence people". Great timeless classic. 
 most boring of the barbie movies, i am sure glad my daughter has stopped asking to watch it over and over. and when it is so boring it seems to drag on forever. and i agree with another reviewer, princess and the pauper and rapunzel, much better!!! 
 Not a surprise for this overrated, squeeky-painful-to-the-ear recording.  There are so many other Broadway musical recordings out there that people should check out 
 This is not so much an encyclopedia as it is an encyclopedic religious polemic.  Its "Topical Index"  contains an entry on almost every Christian sect in America from the Quakers to the Romans, but not a single reference to any branch of Judaism, (or any other non-Christian faith for that matter). However, atheism, paganism and cannibalism DO get their own entries! Go figure.    There are few quotes in here from non-Christians. No Jewish Supreme Court Justices, or Jewish statesmen or Jewish military leaders are quoted, but  Conrad Hilton, a Christian hotel manager and playboy gets half a page. Non-Christians like Albert Einstein  only get a couple of short,  out-of-context blurbs.   If you agree with folks at Amerisearch, the publishers of "America's God and Country" and believe that the Founding Fathers were just joking around about the First Amendment. then you will have no problem with this book.  But if you need a more inclusive  reference work on the religious, and philosophical fabric of the United States, move on, this one has tunnelvision. It is very biased, to the point of creepy, with gaping omissions and therefore too compromised to be useful as a legitimate reference. Perhaps in the next edition they'll have a nice quote from Paris Hilton 
 I was so anxious to read this after waiting so long for the 2nd book.  I loved White Oleander.  This book is psychotic and not much of a story.  Very disappointing from a talented author 
 The book we received was not the full book with the ISBN number we ordered. It was volume one of two with a different ISBN number, which was clearly noted on the back of the book. We had to send the book back AT OUR EXPENSE 
 This may be a good SD, don't know because the company would not allow shipment to Hawaii.  Therefore ordered the Viking SD and it has been a very good SD 
 More predictable than an old TV Land episode of Bonanza and much less entertaining, this story of an anti-government rancher and his three sons, one the upstanding sort who seeks to work for good within the system, one an idealist, and the middle son, Tristan, played by Brad Pitt, a tormented man who seeks to find peace within nature's anger. At least that's what I think he was doing. The fact is I never was a fan of this movie, not back in the 1990's when my best friend loved it (and predicted Julia Ormond would be a superstar--sorry, Gina, if you ever read this, I just couldn't resist working that in there, ha-ha) and not upon the occasion of a recent second viewing. I don't think there's anything to really recommend this movie to anyone. It's not spectacular in its setting, it's not revolutionary in its by-the-numbers story, and I found then and still find now that it is highly melodramatic and boring. To each his own, I know some love this movie, but from where I sit, this film is a would-be epic that never rises above fluff 
 This book is written by an annoying, weak man.  The formal innovations are vaguley interesting, but in any case do not rescue the work from its primary deficit: you must sit there for several hours with the voice of a neurotic chatty little wimp who reminds one of a certain kind of homosexual man streaming through your mind, mostly in the form of digressions and non-sequitors.  This is neither entertaining nor enlightening, and since it's the product of design it is actually a little infuriating.  I too listen with good faith to the academic hierarchy present and past for recommendations, and I had in my version the hitherto utterly reliable Frank Kermode as Introducer; but damn, this book - its characters, its plots, its language, its taxing convolusions - is just annoying.  Its only virtue is that reading it might raise awareness that vaguely condescending moralistic little works like this about unheroic, petty, neurotic, sordid, idle, superficially cosmopolitan people are a mistake to begin with, and - since we all have only 70 or 80 years on earth and aren't all compulsive aesthetes - time would be better spent elsewhere.  There is nothing of the hard Sophoclean light here 
 This movie is strickly for the women now I see why it was made for the lifetime channel. It was hard for me(as a man)  to watch this show knowing that there are people out there like these characters.  I was looking for a happy ending and didn't get it.  
 I have to say I truly hated this book. The premise sounded interesting so I decided to give it a try.  I've read all her other books in the series and found the characters to be quirky.  This time I found her usual friends and co-workers to be boring and self involved caricatures. The groundwork was there for an interesting serial killer with complex motivation but it never developed that way. The constant head hopping was annoying and the ending came out of nowhere.  Cromwell has obviously gotten bored with her characters and it shows.  This is my last Cromwell 
 Lawrence Block is a very good writer, usually. This "mystery" is chockablock with padded dialog that often seems to go on endlessly and to no purpose. And, to top it off, the "mystery" ends on a totally unbelievable and silly note.   There were four bodies total, that is people "killed" or otherwise departed from this realm of tears. Three were explained at the end, and the other one was simply left hanging, the explanation being that, well, some things just cannot be explained. Gimme a break.  That, on top of the bloated dialog, makes this one of Block's lesser efforts, to put it mildly 
 A total Piece of Garbage, do not buy this at all.  First of all it is battery operated which i did not know when i bought it.  Secondly, when i went to put batteries in it, the terminals in side of it are offset, one is higher than the other, and the higher terminal was damaged.  When i put the batteries in and put the cover on it did not work, the case was pushing the battery away from the terminal.  It worked without the cover on but that doesnt do anyone any good if u cant prevent the batteries from falling out.  The thing is rather loud too and cover is a piece of cheap plastic.   The thing is a Piece of Garbae, DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!  
 I bought a Sony ICD-MX20 Digital Voice Recorder a week ago.  I was surprised that Sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named "Digital Voice Editor".  Sony Customer Service staff told me that if you lost the CD that came with the box, you had to buy a new one.  Only patches of the software are available to download.    The Customer Service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device.  This immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged.  Sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services.  Think twice before making your buying decision.  
 After the first 11 books, that were laced with black comedy and inopportune situations handled and aligned in a way to make sense, the 12th books somehow leaves the reader gasping for more and ends with a flat note. I can, however, find cognizance with the moral of the story that sometimes people you think you are close to, fail you with their "nobleness" or lack of guts! That you have to find strength in yourself to fight your own wars and that a family has an important part to play when you're struggling through your live. I think the gist of the story is that that the three children find succor in each other - almost a live force driven by love, that protects them and eventually helps to extricate them from impossible situations! 
 The only reason I finished this book is because I kept hoping for some redeeming quality to emerge.  (It never did.)  What did emerge is a sordid, distasteful portrait of what a set of lives may become without a sense of decency.  However, that was obviously not the point; rather, the opposite of the author's intention.  Attempts to scintilate with the glamorization of bohemian lifestyles, wild adulterous sex, and utter selfishness bombard the reader without mercy.  Worst of all, no one in the book learned anything from their awful behavior!  The fact that many people who are not crazed religous fanatics sincerely believe that there is a better way to handled unwanted pregnancy than abortion is not even given a sentence of consideration.  I won't buy a book from this writer again.  Don't waste your money 
 Tha Dogg Pound was banging 10 years back,but  they lost there Groove long ago. the flows are tired&there are too many hands on the Production end. seems to be going through the motions&hoping to catch somebody feeling the vibe,but you just can't recapture where things were at back in the day. Snoop is just hall passing these days so him being on cruise control here comes as no suprise 
 Elezabeth Shue is always good, but Cage was pathatic.  Story line droned on and on with a big flop at the end 
 This woman is no Catholic. The Holy Father has told us not to talk about women being priests. When a friend showed me this book, I told her to go to confession. This is a warning to devout Catholics 
 Ridiculous, convoluted and unresolved plot with main characters that have become predictable and boring.   Did Cornwell even write this one herself? If so, she missed a glaring discrepancy when she proofread: On page 216 Marino remembers Mrs. Paulsson greeting him at the door "wearing jeans and a soft pink sweater", but later when he tells Scarpetta what happened during his visit to the house he describes her as having worn black books and a camouflage shirt when she opened the door.  Perhaps it was the author's attempt to let readers think Marino only imagined the pink sweater scenario because he was too ashamed to remember what really happened. However, to this reader it comes across simply as a mistake the author forgot to go back and correct 
 Shevonne the imperial hoodrat or whatever you claim to be.....you wouldn't know about being a hustler if Ice-T slapped you with your tampon. Its painfully obvious that you don't have any music knowledge due to the fact you enjoy ignorant, inbred, klown music. I am sure you do relate to the lyrics because you definitely have the iq of a tree frog. And no I will never reach that level.......or should I say sink to that level because I never move backwards with my intellect only forward.   Dem Wack boyz are one of th worst groups out there to date.  Support real emcees like Mos Def, KRS-One, and Immortal Technique 
 I received my Valeo Ocelot training "glove", still waiting for the other.  Bubble pack had only one glove in it.  Amazon HELP has no concept of partial shipment 
 This book was immensly boring. I feel utterly stupid for having wasted my time reading this blithering mass of mindless jargon. This mystery did NOT keep me on the edge of my seat like it should have. The characters were poorly described and muh! What a waste! I'm just sorry that I couldn't choose to give negative stars 
 This book is one of the funniest I have ever read because it is truly "Progressive liberalism". Absolutely nothing new. Bash, bash, bash Conservatives. Use of hate speech, which liberals go crazy over if it is use against one of their sacred cows. Trying and trying to rewrite the Constitution, something they have never studied or learned what the framing fathers thought when they wrote it.      I offer no excuse for George W. who is no conservative, but if liberals offer no more than this which they don't, Republican's will keep getting elected. I like most Conservative's long for another true Reagan 
 It's definately a good starting point for a reference library, yet it still seems to leave a lot out. For example, it does little to explain world-building and gives less-than-detailed examples in a lot of the book's sections. Most of the info in the book can be found with a search engine. I recommend it only for those of you who want to build a decent reference library 
 If you know anything about Army aviation or Apaches, Fire Birds will either tick you off, or make you laugh till you puke. This was supposed to be the Army's Top Gun? So sad. It's so unrealistic, I wish the Army had had veto power on this one before it was released. 
 So, reading the other reviews I felt compelled to add my thoughts.  Someone said earlier, glad to see someone from bean town getting props.  What the heck dude?  Mr. Lif.  There are so many awesome artists from this area, don't spend your money on a band whose career has been made through disses.  I don't like Eminem, but Benzino and the Made Men, have 'Made' themselves by jacking others fame.  I like the guest work, but the guests are better than the group itself.  Get there stuff.  Guests can be useful but they usually show that a band is lacking talent when overused.  I listened to this album and wished I could get my money back.  It's not even worth selling, I wouldn't want to screw anyone else 
 I was very gung ho when I found out that Disney was finally releasing the Davy Crockett TV show on DVD.  I grew up watching the two Davy Crockett movies.  HOwever upon actually seeing these DVDs I was very disappointed.  It is exactly the same as those two movies it is just split into five seperate episodes.  The Episodes: Davy Crockett, Indian Fighter; Davy Crockett Goes to Congress; and Davy Crockett at the Alamo are all the parts included in the movie Davy Crockett King of the Wild Frontier.  The episodes Davy Crockett's Keelboat Race; Davy Crockett and the River Pirates; were what made up the movie Davy Crockett and the River Pirates.  I for one am planning on buying the newer version that came out in 2004 that is just the two movies on one disc.  The only difference between this set and the new set is that there are couple of features on this set and that there are introductions to the episodes buy Leonard Maltin and it has two discs in a tin collector's box.  The biggest difference of all is that this set runs from between $37-$100 whereas you can buy the two movies on DVD for $14-$16.  I myself will go for the cheaper movie set rather than have to watch each episode sperately.   
 Like all James Patterson's books, this was a good story idea, but poorly executed. Patterson's characters are interesting and his plot lines are clever, but the dialog runs from awkward to silly, and his pacing is often confusing and forced. That's why his books do better as movies: a better writer gets to use Patterson's concepts with more realistic dialog and good pacing 
 This must be one of the latest entries in the Dan Brown school of writing. Name an expert, assign an audience, lecture on historical points and expect applause at the end. Well, Kathy Reichs can wait for a long time. There will be no applause for this book. I would like my money back. I'm almost finished and still can't really figure out what the plot actually is. I guess she will just pop the final lecture and the conclusion will name the murderer. What about motive, character development (sex + history), etc... This is my first novel by this author and it will be my last 
 I listened to Dr. Turnbull lecture in West Virginia when I was 19-21 years old in the early eighties in my hometown. At that time I found him an inspiration. He was able to communicate such respect for life, how different people live it and to provide an insight into the beauty of the peoples he had studied. When I saw this book I was delighted because, of course, I was hoping to feel that person I came to know somehow communicated in the text. In the end I was left feeling his life was brutal and disillusioning and a horror in many respects. I think the man I sat down and spoke to years ago, who gave such inspirational lectures, would never have left you this way.  This is not a love story , it's a sad defeated story about failed love and man's degradations. In this way I found the book an oddity.   I suppose Dr. Turnbull was accused of operation with rose colored specs, but in a sense a teacher deals with the human spirit and he was a very elevating person. One thing that stayed with me was his discussion of how without certain fundamental things like food and security people behaved without their "humanity". It helped me appreciate Maslow's heirarchy so much when I came to study that in ed classes and then use it's meaning in teaching. Dr. Faini brought him to our world in school , and his love of music and percussion and world instrumentation was so obviously connected to Dr. Turnbull. I prefer to leave my memories intact and read Turnbull himself, even if the author might contend he has exposed the reality. 
 I couldn't get past chapter 5, and that was after skipping through some of the earlier chapters. Dull descriptions, and too many of them, dominate the writing. Characters were about as exciting as bricks. Plot development--ha! This is a mystery novel: why isn't the plot going anywhere?  And lest I forget, grammatical errors abound in this novel. Tip for you, Nevada: something is not "comprised of" things, things comprise a larger object. And Yosemite being at the same *longitude* as Mississippi? Pleaaase! Give me a break, it's barely at the same lattitude; Yosemite is 225 miles north of the very northern tip of Mississippi, and Mississippi is 300 miles long N to S. Hey Barr, are you sure you weren't smoking that dope when you wrote this?  Apparently (thank you other reviews), the punchline is that a plane full of dope has crashed in the mountains and people are swarming over each other to get at it. Big whoop. Come out to LA and you can see drug dramas for real--murder, intrigue, corruption and all.  Do something useful with your time: find a good Sherlock Holmes novel 
    So much of Orson Welles' Othello rendered unintelligible by technical glitches, it is somehow back-handedly fitting to find Ian McKellen achieving the same effect out of simple interpretive perversity, rushing wildly, incomprehensibly through 1/3 of his lines, chumblingly swallowing another 1/3.  (It may not be fair to fault him for so 'interesting' an attempt--the notion of phony working class touchy-feeliness might have been Trevor Nunn's.) Whereas traditional plumes, turbans,"neighing steeds" and floor length robes can cover a lot of inanity, this obviously low budget, lower imagination production offers no space in which to hide it's time-shifted pointlessness. (Recalling the legends of Welles' costuming problems, one wonders if this entire concept hinged on Royal Shakespeare's wardrobe out-of-stock except for left-overs from some Yank Civil War turkey.)   It has to be said that Imogen Stubbs might have made a touching Desdemona in a less change-for-the-sake-of-change production. And what a delight to hear Willard White articulating in his vibrant, Robesonesque bass tones, battling not only Iago and the Fates, but the sort of clever-dick innovations that transmute a High Testosterone Warrior/Man-of-Action into a bureaucratic paper shuffler and wielder of  rubber stamps.    
 Bad. The songs are only okay, and the dances are pretty bad for Fred Astaire. Astaire later said it was the worst movie he ever made. I agree with him 100 percent 
 King of run-on sentences, that is.  The problem with Benford's books isn't the story.  This book, along with the first in the series, In the Ocean of Night, presents an absolutely fabulous story.  Benford has come up with a really excellent idea for a series of books.  The problem is Benford's writing.  For some reason, Benford forgets that "science fiction" consists of two words.  He places much emphasis on the first word, but doesn't realize that it's fiction.  Mr. Benford, this is not a science textbook!!!!!!!  Getting the science right in a fictional book is all well and good, but if one can use the book to teach a physics class, then the writer's priorities are a wee bit skewed.  If you wish to write a textbook, then write a textbook, and leave the fiction to fiction authors.  In addition to putting waaaaaaaaaaay too much emphasis on the science, the structure of his writing leaves much to be desired.  As previously mentioned, he seems to have an ongoing love affair with the run-on sentence.  There are literally whole paragraphs in the book which are nothing but one huge sentence.  And you can forget trying to follow a conversation via the use of properly placed quotation marks.  A quotation mark is to Benford what holy water and crosses are to vampires.  I give this book 2 stars simply because the writing is so horribly bad.  The idea behind the story rates a stellar 5 stars, but I had to subtract at least 3 for Benford's pitiful excuse for prose.  I actually feel that giving it 2 stars is a generous showing on my part, as I was sorely tempted to give it 1.  A word of advice to the prospective reader of this series:  Read it after having a couple of glasses of wine.  It helps.  (Seriously. 
 As a dog lover who has struggled with her weight, I was prepared to thoroughly enjoy this book.  Boy was I disappointed.  I was absolutely horrified in the beginning.  Why would you even get a dog if you were going to keep them in a crate in the basement all the time?  And the ridiculous lengths she went through to find "quiet" foods?  You've got to be kidding me.  How bad can an 8 lb. dog be while you're trying to eat?  And then, after they've "bonded", to take her to visit the family and leave her to spend the night outside in a crate?  I just didn't get it.  I wasted $11.  Maybe Amazon will give it back 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 This is one of those cheap international books that isn't even published in America!  I feel robbed. The text is in English however the introduction is in multiple languages, which, in my opinion takes away from what I thought would be a book on the splendor of American steel.  I was also most interested in reading the actual text of the ads and the books was so small that reading the text proved difficult quite often.    While these books would make a good inexpensive gift for an automobile enthusiast or graphic artist/advertising executive friend, I would hesitate to add them to my own library.  Be careful of all books produced under Jim Helmann as all are like this and are foreign produced 
 First of all the subtitle has been wrongly interpreted.  Some creationists have decided to use this title to expose Darwin as a racists.  He may be, I have not read "The Descent of Man" yet.  The origin of species talks very little of man.  It is a book of observations and study.  It concentrates on how plant life, has by selection, brought forth all the species we see today.  The survival of the fittest through millions of years by gradual change.  Darwin covers his beloved pigeons in depth.  I agree with him that all the different types of pigeons we see today probably came from one ancestor of the pigeon.  This is called variation of kind.  We see this in just about every living creature and flora.  The problem arises when the next step is taken, the rise of one species turning into another (reptile to bird).  Throughout the book Darwin does admit to this fact, but he still maintains that it must be, with much difficulty.   There is no doubt there is a tremendous amount of work that went into his book.  It is a difficult read.  I would rather have read the dictionary.  One does need to know his enemy.  Darwin is not the originator of "evolution."  There are many who came before him, since the dawn of time.  He was influenced by numerous men of his time, some being more radical.  Darwin was nothing new, he just made it "hip."  What he started has turned into the secular humanism the world had adopted.  I don't think he meant for this disease to spread like it has.  From his writings I understand him as an agnostic, but doubtful.  I believed he struggled with the possibly of a deist.  It is safe to say it was his only ambition till his dying day to prove "evolution" as proof of our existence.  What of the missing fossil record?, he new they would be found.  He was a confusing man.   150 years later and there still has been no intermediate fossils found to prove the case.  In fact we are discovering more that validates creation.   Wish you well, Scott                       
 Here is a piece of litigation that was successful regarding claims similar to the ones made in this book (reading over 1000wpm), photographic reading levels, etc.  http://www.quackwatch.org/02ConsumerProtection/FTCActions/trudeau.html  Best to stick with good old study methods (SQ3R) etc. Best regards JVoge 
 Roth can be an amazing stylist, but this book lacks any sense of forward motion, and precious little suspense about the past.  Mickey Sabbath is obsessed with his dead Croatian sex-goddess mistress, and with sex in general, and the book explores his sexual escapades (mostly in the past, but some ick-factoring fantasies in present too) in microscopic detail.  This might be acceptable if it was leading to enlightenment or some kind of catharsis, but if it's intended to be there, it eluded me.  When Mickey masturbates on her grave, for example, his release isn't more profound merely because apparently, he's not the only ex-lover of hers to do so.  It's as if Portnoy aged but never matured.  Mickey is on the outs with his wife, and ruined that relationship partly with a dalliance with a student that came to life when the tape recording the student made of their erotic phone calls finds its way into the university's hands.  perhaps this is meant to comment on some of the "sexual harassment" excesses of the nineties, but it's so implausible, it doesn't wash, and seems to be little more than an excuse for a tour-de-force reproduction of that recording printed side-by-side with a scene of Mickey and student.  Mickey is a retired puppetteer, and his first wife was his muse.  she disappeared mysteriously long ago.  This thought nags at Mickey like a scab, but it is never resolved for the reader.  Sometimes Mickey claims to have murdered her.  There's no reason to believe this, but there's no alternative either.  The book goes on and on episodically:  Mickey throws himself on the mercy of an old friend, but is kicked out when he attempts to seduce the wife, and also, is found sniffing the panties of the daughter whose room he is staying in.  Just because the rants of a dirty old man are described vividly, without holding back, doesn't make them somehow emblematic of the human spirit.  Roth fails to turn these details into something universal and worthwhile.  It's a long book that just never catches fire.  I suspect it won its various awards because the judges didn't know what to make of it and didn't want to be considered prudish.  There's no "there" there, no story to reflect upon...  As always, there are some lovely passages.  Roth writes vividly and is often funny.  It would have made a good novella or collection of stories, but as a novel, it sprawls in its own flab 
 We have owned this Jack in the box for about a month and a half.  The music has already stopped working and we didn't even play with it on a daily basis, much less on a weekly basis.  I wouldn't recommend this toy 
 I quit reading this book after 225 pages. Like most of the books I give 2 stars, I'm going to leave that one statement as a major testament to what this book did for me. I don't know if it's fair or not. I'm sure scores of Bloom fans will say I'm too ignorant to understand it. Maybe I am. But the purpose of writing a review is to be consistent in rating the books I read. I find the lack of lower ratings on many books puzzling. If you read a book and it isn't to your liking, you should say so. For me, this was of very little interest, and just wasn't a very good book.  I found the commentary about Adam and Eve to be the most interesting part of the book. Everything else, including the Book of J itself, was hard to take. The introductory piece before the translation was downright painful, and the only thing that got me through it was the notion that the actual book couldn't be much worse. I was right, that it couldn't be much worse. But it wasn't really any better either. For me, these stories are too transitory and scattered to be of much interest.  The commentary starts off well, but then sinks into an almost desperate attempt to declare that J is a) a woman, b) the main influence of Shakespeare, and c) the main influence of many classic Western voices (Tolstoy/Freud/Kafka/etc). After 225 pages, I got so sick of hearing this assertion that I quit the book and stared out the train window for the next 45 minutes. The total lack of focus and drove me bonkers.  I think scholars of the subject might enjoy the book, but casual fans of literary works will have a tough time with it. As a reference, I have read Michener's Source, and recently Rushdie's Satanic Verses. Both are steeped in religion, and both held my interest for many pages, the latter more than either. But this book, well, it was very difficult for me to keep at. Those who don't already have a working knowledge of the subject matter are going to struggle with this.  It's not necessarily that I think this book is lousy. It's just impossible for me to really identify with. And in that sphere of existence, the one I live in, it's a 2 star book, simply because I would rather watch the buildings, cars, and grass go by the train window than read it any further. Take it for what it's worth, but that was my experience.  Not for the casual reader 
 Nothing but self-important producer yacking about how accomplished he was at an early age, as mere snipnets of what I thought was going to be a movie were shown. Very disappointing, as listing didn't indicate that this was not the full movie uninterupped 
 Extemely thoroughly researched, but author has gone astray with his novel, burdening the narrative with extraneous detail and long digressions that have nothing to do with the plot, which is convoluted and unconvincing. Characterization is weak,and, overall, the author seems to have ventured too far afield from his own expertise. That is, he seems to lack most of the tools of good fiction writing. Astonishing that the publisher seems to have put a fair amount of money behind pushing this book. 
 Scott, working with Andre de Toth, who worked with him in Stranger Wore A Gun, finds himself in a film that does not stack up against the Budd Boetticher Western he made around the same period.  Scott plays a rancher in a range war against a bigger, powerful rancher, who has married the woman Scott loves. Scott tries to refrain from violence, but when the other rancher hires gunmen to kill Scott, Scott has to defend himself.  Westerns often feature a plot that has been done many times before, but are distinguished by great writing, great action, and great performances, and this film features none of these things. It is great that this film has been released on DVD, but it will not be remembered as one of Scott's better films 
 I really wanted this to work, since my older home has thick walls that make wireless an iffy proposition. However, even with the little blue light that purports to say the signal is great, it isn't. It works at about the same speed as wireless when it works at all, and then without warning drops the signal. And Netgear tech support seemed to know less about the product than I did. After a half hour on the phone the operator I was dealing with said that I should have picked option 3 on the original voice menu (which a pretty confusing menu to begin with). Now the fun begins; getting RMAs to return to two different shippers (both via Amazon), going to UPS, paying to return the products..... not a happy camper. 
 Nora Roberts's books are my escape, and usually a blissful one.  I love the magic, character development, strong women overcoming obstacles, and romance found in her novels.  Morrigan's Cross disappointed me.  Vampires are a little over the edge for me, but what made me close the book was the 10-year-old vampire with the protaganist.  I spend my days with children who have been abused in every way imaginable, and reading this put me in a bad mood.  King was a comic relief, but he got killed.  That was when I did something I've never done with a N.R. book - closed it, put it in the closet, and later sold it.  I'm not reading any of the others in the trilogy.  Instead, I took out the Three Sisters' trilogy and enjoyed myself.   
 Flowery. Verbose. Rambling. Compound sentence upon compound sentence. This book was unreadable for me. I quit 
 Babyface sued singer Anita Baker for allegedly failing to pay him for a song he produced for her. He filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit against fellow R&B artist Anita Baker alleging she owes him at least $250,000. Babyface co-wrote and produced the incredible song "Like You Used to Do,".   It's kinda hard to beleive this, but it seems Anita decided to con her producer even if the album went gold with 500,000 sold copies. I purchased this CD because I had heard about this duet with Babyface and "Like You Used to Do" is the best track on the album. 
 I upgraded my home net with several pieces of Netgear hardware, including the FR114P router, the WG102 Wifi Access Point, and the FS108P, an 8-port switch with 4 Power Over Ethernet (POE) ports. The AP and the POE switch have been excellent choices. Not so with the router. Although it has features you don't find in a lot of consumer routers, like stateful packet inspection (SPI), logging, and email alerts, it just kept dropping connections to my home PCs for no apparent reason that I could find, and no support from Netgear. The DHCP server would seem to die, and all my home PCs would then lose their IPs and revert to private IPs (169.254.x.x). At that point my only recourse was to restart the router. After three weeks of this nonsense, I said to he** with it. I'm sending it back. The router I'm interested in now is the SMC Barricade Plus SMCBR14VPN. 
 I have been a Le Carre fan until the end of the Cold War. I somehow still managed to follow him later for some time. But now it is over, definitely. I disliked this novel, and the movie is obnoxious. Rachel Weisz is quite ridiculous in her part. Which idiot nominated her for her Oscar is beyond the point. Zellweger got an Oscar for an even more horrible performance recently, in the otherwise quite acceptable Cold Mountain. And even the otherwise great Blanchett had to turn in an awful performance in The Aviator to get one. (Why can these nice girls not get one for one of their good movies?) My conclusion: this world is strange. It has no idea what is good and what not. 
 While the guide may review restaurants, hotels or museums that are not typically covered in other guides, its failure to address local activities was disappointing. Information on bike rental shops, scuba shops, fun tours or other things are absent. If you want a guide to more than hotels, restaurants and museums you might want to reconsider this purchase 
 Book is simplistic. In a word--stun 
 I usually like James Patterson but this book was absolutely horrible. Not only was it hard to follow, but I never ended up caring about any of the characters. I can't believe he was able to get this published AND win an award. I guess I just don't get it 
 I had expected an insightful analysis of the motivations behind modern terrorism. Instead I got a diatribe against western liberalism. Lee Harris is the poster child for the modern John Birchers, people who believe our way is not only the best way, its the only way. In an increasingly global economic and political system, his view of the world can be said to be outmoded, at best quaint, at worst pathological for if we are truely to address the problems facing humanity over the next 100 years, we will need tolerance and inclusivness. 
 I saw this book when I was a child and wanted to read it then (it had a cool cover with a kind of blimp/airship on it).  Unfortunatley, life intervened and I only got around to reading it just recently.  Alas!  This book was a lot better and more wonder-filled in my imagination than it actually turned out to be.  The story is not very interesting, the setting is not well-painted, the protagonist's adventures are pedestrian, and the whole thing is swiss-cheesed with so much British slang as will likely put an American kid off his feed.  Skip this one 
 Seems that all the book does is Talk bad about the reagan years and the Republicans.  I think that the author needs to come back and look at other years under different presidents 
 I bought this book as a primer reference to patents.  What I got was a dictionary of words.  This book pretty much is a dictionary without a lot of explanations.  Really basic terms also.  A lot of basic paraphrasing instead of actual text from the 35 USC manual 
 I would gladly take my hour and a half back.  I enjoyed the humor of ST 1, and there's only a nod in that direction here - so lame, it only serves to draw attention to its absence.    Also, this turns into a slasher flick - a systematic knock-off of each of the characters and an exploration of how gruesome the special effects can be.  Now, I'm not necessarily against this, though I don't really care for slasher flicks, other than to say that it becomes super BO-RING!  And I do mean boring  There's not even really a "B" movie quality here that provides something memorable.  Nope - nothing redeeming here.  Don't bother  
 I was looking for an inexpensive way to store homemade cd's so I chose this item.  I would estimate that at least 40% of the cases arrived damaged or broken and they are so cheaply constructed that on the ones that weren't broken the plastic tabs break on the first or second use.  Spend a little more and get something of higher quality 
 Of course reviewing a book by its cover is ridiculous, but this catalog's cover keeps slipping off, which is annoying enough to merit a mention. And then there are those stupid fold out pages, so I spend half the time like a tourist trying to manage an unruly map, and inevitably they rip. As for the content, well, the text descriptions of some of the artists use interesting terms like "conceptual trigger," but the photos of the art itself are small and dull on thin, uncoated paper. And as the descriptions of the artists read more like frommers than lonely planet (I.e. positive only), it's hard to value the text too much. Buy the "PS1 Greater New York 2005" instead. You can get more out of the Whitney book by googling the artists' names.  I should say that the introduction by Chrissie Iles and Philippe Vergne is superb, but you can read that online:  [... 
 He writes with a lot of descriptive detail, to a fualt. Every person he mentions gets their biography put in. Way too much extra junk about people no one would ever here of. Chapters start out with the continuing story and quickly break down into the life story of some high ranking account for the PGA, and so on. Read only if you need to get some sleep 
 This book is out of date - stating that *the* correct way to fire a pistol is by holding it with one hand, keeping the other hand at the side 
 If you can endure Franken's cycle of hilarious writing to crap to writing about how crappy it is before finally getting back to the good stuff, go for it.  "Oh, the Things I Know" takes great pains to steer clear of incindiary comments so that lots and lots of people who don't know a college graduate well enough to get them something they really want will buy this book as a graduation gift.   Unfortunately for Franken, he's playing to the right audience - the over 35 buyer of the gift for a college graduate - who will likely flip through a few pages and chuckle before setting it back down. Because the book isn't comforting, uplifting or even really that funny for the market.   [... 
 I'd just like to add that at a major high tech firm (where I worked) this approach died a slow, expensive and horrible death 
 I'll tell you why.:  Little story, my husband surprised me with a GS puppy last year when I came back from a weeklong vacation. I did not want a puppy yet because I've never owned a dog before and I wanted to do some reading on the subject, especially with a GS. It's not the kind of breed that you can just buy and say "ok, we have a cute puppy" and that's it. Every dog deserves a well informed owner. But I ended up using my intuition and common sense to do the majority of training for my dog (who I now love dearly). This book taught me nothing that I hadn't already figured out on my own. And I must add that there is only about 10% of this book that is actually geared towards GS's. It's a very broad based book on how to train a dog, not just a GS. There are many other books out there that will tell you about the breed and what to expect about there intelligience, personality and the AKC standards for this breed. I learned more things browsing through GS magazines at PetSmart. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK !!!! There are MUCH better books about German Shepherds !!!!!! 
 When I opened the package, I found the filter box seals (one at each side) were broken, an indication that it was not new. I thought it's ok as long as the glass is clean and clear. When I opened the filter box, three pieces, the ring, the glass and the circular clamp, jumped out. While it's bad sign, I still thought it's ok as long as I could put them together. Well, the glass was not clear, as if it was sanded in the middle with a fine sand paper (I never saw any filter or lens in that shape  before!). Before to ship it back, I did try to put three pieces togather (so next person will not see these pieces jump out when open the box). Guess what, the circular clamp was about 2-3mm longer and two ends couldn't meet!!! I couldn't image any scenario under which this could happen, since it was from Amazon, not from some unknowns of eBay (actually, any eBayer will have to worry about the Feedback). I was really shocked that Amazon shipped that garbage to its customer!  Hope this is just a random incident and Amazon does have a very easy return practice. Otherwise, I would not buy anything from Amazon 
 WELL,GUYS JESSICA SIMPSON IS THR WORST OF THE WORST.SHE SINGS AS BADLY AS SHE LOOKS.THIS CD IS VERY,VERY,VERY BAD.AVOID AND WAIT FOR THE NEW IRON MAIDEN CD WHICH SHOULD BE OUT SHORTLY. 
 Just, usually so talented, wastes himself on this effort.  It starts bad and stays that way.  It is a real shame, though his other attempts (Echo House, even the uneven Stringer) are worth while 
 After years of hearing about what a seminal work this is, I finally broke down and bought a (used) copy.  I expected something like the anti-Simon, an exhaustive documentation of how we are inevitably headed toward doom and collapse unless the government steps in to intervene with specific recommendations.  I was extremely surprised to find that this book is nothing more than a long description of the authors' computer model!  Is that it?!  Apparently so.  The authors assembled a computer model of all human activity and natural science, complete with feedback, time delay, and other parameters (yeah, they really present it that way!).  Then they ran it through a computer and found what they expected - quite a surprise, eh?  Then they tweak on the basic model and find that almost nothing leads to a rosy scenario.  Humanity is going to collapse by 2100, and there is nothing we can do about it.  Well, almost nothing.  Apparently, if we stop procreating, stop economic growth, and spread the existing wealth evenly, everything will be ... well, it won't be great, but it will be "okay", sorta like the warehousing activity that we call public "schooling".  I think there is a book that describes the resulting society, ... I believe it was called _Anthem_.  I gave the book a couple of stars because of its canonical status, but it certainly doesn't deserve the attention it has gotten.  A major flaw is that they don't describe the model they use in any significant detail to allow you to run the numbers yourself (they refer you to another article, and you can find the original model on the internet if you're perseverent enough).  If someone is throwing this into your face as proof that we are headed to certain disaster, fear not.  There simply isn't enough substance here, some of the information and assumptions are dated, and you can certainly point out a few holes in their model assumptions that tend to undo their long-term analysis.  If you are thinking about using this to support your world view, please reconsider.  Try something a little more grounded in reality, without the breathless hype, like any environmental economics book by Tom Tietenberg 
 Good first attempt at the task. The second generation model, CTZ900 Telezapper II uses the THREE tones necessary to remove your number from all of the current computer lists 
 Note to the author: I suppose there's an "ethical" way to own slaves, too 
 Halley uses 17,000 ft. high Mt. Ararat in eastern Turkey as Noah's Ark's final resting place when the Bible says mountains of ararat in the book of Genesis. Also, old traditions attribute the Ararat range to a different area than where Mt. Ararat (formerly Mt. Masis) is located.   On other points he talks about humankind seemingly only 6,000 years old (as most Biblical versions claim if generations are taken literally in Genesis). Well, like another book written in the early 1960's (The Genesis Flood) this book is out of date badly on the age of humankind as DNA studies have since totally proven human life is much older than the few thousand years these books claim. Unlike the Genesis Flood this book seems to reflect the author's real genuine beliefs 
 To start off I loved all of the Trek series on tv. I think DS9 was my favorite because of the story arcs and what an excellent job the actors did with making the characters their own.  I mean Shimmerman  made a Ferengi likable.  Vistor as Kira, Siddig as Bashir I loved the depth they brought to each part.  Knowing how the series ended its a given that some new characters had to be brought in and I'm glad to see Kira is still the commander of DS9 in this book.  However I was struck by an odd sense as I continued to read past the first 20 pages or so.  This feeling only intensified as I read.  There seemed to be particular emphasis on the leadership and skills of all the female characters while all of the male characters where lacking in some sort.  It seemed as though the author had a sexist slant to both books.  There were so many instances of it that it ruined the books for me.  Kira is strong in the book as she should be and so is Ezri.  It seemed the authored took pleasure in marginalizing all the male characters.  Nog is portrayed as capable but immature and harboring ill feelings over the Jem'Hadar in holding on the station.  Ya think?  He lost a leg in battle with them and he doesn't trust them.  No different than how O'Brien and Kira felt about the Cardassians, Picard and Sisko of the Borg, or Kirk of the Klingons.  The author spends time on showing how Nogs fear consumes him.  Ironically his fears are not misplaced as I found at the end of the book.  One new character, and Andorian, lives under the shadow of his famous mother on the High Council.  Bashir is described in one part as being a "silly Doctor".  Ok, the same Bashir that survived a Dominion prison, was recruited because of his intellect by Section 31 and has to stand twice as far from the dart board from O'Brien because of his genetic enhancements?  The same Bashir of the Abyss novel by David Weddle and Jeff Lang? Bashir may be naive with romance but he's not silly.  If you read the account of him in the Avatar books he's a twit.  He also adds nothing to the plot except as being used as a device to show what emotional trauma Ezri is going through.  There is a point where Ezri says something rather callous and insensitive to Julian but for some reason he is the immature one.  Ezri is growing after all(being newly joined), she's allowed to say anything she wants and get away with it.  The author also likes to depict the female leads as looking through or completely ignoring input or comments for the males.  The plot is bad too.  I thought there would be some resolution at the end but there wasn't.  I don't have a problem with strong female leads.  I loved Captain Janeway, Colonel Kira, and Lt. Commander Dax in the series.  And though the majority of the males were depicted as peons Picard is described as I remember from the series. And another new addition Commander Elias Vaughn fares well though he is over a hundred years old.  I couldn't help but think how much better this book would have fit in the Xena universe with the sexism and low and behold the author wrote a novel based on the series. The addition of a Jem'Hadar is also interesting but there is no real development with the character until the next book The Abyss.  I thought the Avatar series was a waste of time and money.  They were the first 2 ST novels I read.  I was happy with next one, the Abyss.  Though it probably will have little effect on sales I felt compelled to write this review.  If I can just save one persons money I'll be happy 
 I ordered 200 hundred of these and half of them were squashed by the time I received the shipment and you can't get the shape back. If you want good quality balls spend your money on the Playhut version. 
 I was really looking forward to reading this book since I am both a brain researcher and a professional musician. First it was highly disorganized and rambled from subject to subject without any real framework. Much of what the author spoke of was not related to how the brain processes music but speaks to the way research is conducted. Even this was sparse at best. He attempted to explain the elements of music so that the majority of people could understand it. However it became too watered down and even lost me. Lastly the author was entirely too self congradulatory as to his own accomplishments. Pushing the envelope of science should be  award enough. For these reasons I can not recommend this book 
 I have been waiting for this book for a while as the publishing date slipped a few times. Having recieved the book, I wish I never bought it. To start with 2/3 of the book is about java, optimisation, a poor section on JDBC and some networking stuff that you can find anywhere else. The remaining of the book is a general discussion of Java and the last chapter (Ch 15) is about a simple 3d engine (jist 3D)which is pretty incomplete. The book has many incomplete code snippets and no games in sight which is surprising when the authors have been around the game development forums for such a long time.  The book seems to be a poor attempt in discussing games development in Java. More like an attempt to cash in the market demand.  If you are buying this book to learn about Java and 3D, then there are better books such as -Developing Games in Java- by Brackeen which has good explanations about various aspect of game development in java.  My advice is that dont waste your money on this book 
 Being a long-time Nancy Drew collector, I really looked forward to reading this book, but I found it to be very disappointing. I've read a lot of the 'tart-noir' wacky-gal mystery series, and this book seems to have all the standards - sexy, ditzy gal who just can't seem to get it all together, hunky boyfriend, obsession with glamorous flashy clothes, the need to keep secrets from the police, and on and on. But Cece Caruso just doesn't come off with any realism to me. She's too over-the-top, and she's not even a good detective. By her own admission, over and over throughout the book, she keeps missing the point, and the clues, and everything else that would lead her to understand what's going on and solving the mystery.  Cece is a biographer of mystery writers and in this book she is writing a book about Carolyn Keene, the author of the Nancy Drew books who was and still is a group of ghostwriters. There is a lot of Nancy Drew collecting info in this story that was, for the most, taken from some speculative fan-made guides, honored by some collectors as The Truth but frowned upon as hypothetical by the rest of the bibliographic world. It also seems the author made up some of her own. Her depiction of Nancy Drew collectors at their annual convention in Palm Springs is really unflattering. Believe me, they are not the strange, nerdy, boring people she makes them out to be. For some reason she found it necessary to compare their boring get-together with a wild swinging convention of golf-fan lesbians at the same hotel.  It's disappointing that the first major piece of fiction published about Nancy Drew collecting and Nancy Drew collectors is such a mediocre book that plods along for the most going this way and that in directions that lead nowhere or that Cece just doesn't 'get'. Her obsessions with vintage clothes, gourmet foods, alcoholic beverages, art, and on-again-off-again boyfriend are all pretty interesting, but she and her gang need more characterization, and need to be a little less fabulous-in-every-way to be believable.  Nancy Drew fans who read this book will probably be disappointed. It's less about Nancy and more about Cece and friends and how 'hot' and 'cool' and too-fabulous-to-be-true they are. Let's hope the next author who takes on the Nancy Drew mystique will give it a more interesting treatment 
 I don't know the process works for applying to other grad school programs, but if you're trying to get into a top tier b-school, this book has little to offer you 
 WHAT A WASTE OF FIM! TOO SNIDE FOR MY TASTE. MAYBE IT'D BEEN ENTERTAINING BACK IN THE 60'S, BUT TODAY IT'S ATTEMPT AT CAMP - OR KITSCH - IS JUST TOO THIN 
 this book was very informative...but I don't feel that it gave me what I  was looking for.  I was hoping to get more on how to turn jealousy around.   On a positive note, it does give different situations and the aspect of the  nonjealous partner - so in that respect, it was an eye opener.  But I felt  it didn't give enough information on how to cope and rise above jealousy 
 The jacket story and reviews got me to buy this book... what a waste of money.  The characters are weak stereotypes and the storyline's nothing special at all.  I guess in this day and age anyone can publish a book about nothing, but to make matters worse Hallman's writing (I think he likes to think of himself as a research journalist) is laughable and his research deplorable.  He tries to write a revisionist history through the eyes of a self-admitted novice perspective and makes a fool of himself.    Being a chess enthusiast, I figured I would push on for awhile.  To my horror his description of his chess-master pal is a disgrace to most chess players; making them seem like anti-social, self-absorbed bums that are out of touch with reality and politics.  Though this stock character may make for interesting reading in the hands of an average author, Hallman brings out the worst in stereotyping and one ends up disliking those we need to like in order to make the story readable.  Hallman overexerts himself to find tangents of interest, even tracking down a lama (of which are a dime a dozen in the area he's interested in) that renounced his vows in favor of rock'n'roll.  The connection is so labored that Hallman seems like one of those people you run into at a party that makes sure you understand how important they are because they went to school with George Clooney's cousin.  Calling Hallman's writing incoherent babbling would be an insult to the deranged... NEVER BUY THIS BOOK.    May not agree with me- doesn't make it unhelpful!!! And don't say I didn't warn you 
 MOON CALLED is no relation to Norton's Yiktor series; this is an "after the fall of civilization" novel more along the lines of NO NIGHT WITHOUT STARS or STAR MAN'S SON, though evidently not in the same setting as either. As in those stories, the protagonist of MOON CALLED was an apprentice being trained in relatively arcane, specialized knowledge - in this case, a priestess - who was cast adrift from her people before the story opens. Unlike the protagonists of several other Norton stories in this vein, Thora was not exiled; her native village was destroyed by pirates, leaving her to make her way in the world alone.  Stumbling across an alien, injured stranger by chance, Thora is drawn into contact with Malkin's native society, wherein Malkin is familiar - lifelong companion, if you like - to a man of power in that society, wherein the gender roles are not quite reversed from those in Thora's own culture (down to serial polyandry in Makil's society, as opposed to polygamy in Thora's). Thora goes through some culture shock, but not much - Makil's society is only peripherally explored, mostly concerning those aspects that a hunter and sentry without strong family ties would see.  With very little tweaking, the story could've been dropped onto either continent of the Witch World during the Kolder War; the new universe introduced here isn't very memorable, and the post-apocalyptic aspects aren't utilized beyond setting up a "cache of very dangerous stuff" that could've been almost any McGuffin without loss of originality. (Thora and Makil's people have to make sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands, with some disagreement among Makil's people about whether it might be useful for *them* to exploit.) No suggestion that I noticed of how the now-dominant religions, magic use, and so on happened to develop; throwing "Set" in as the name of the deity worshipped by the forces of evil is a little jarring for that reason, because none of the other religious elements seem to have such a clear connection to present-day mythology (generic moon goddess, Lord of Light, that sort of thing for the other religions).  While this book has its moments - I'll grant any of Norton's books that, though it doesn't quite make the three-star cut for me - I would recommend DARKNESS AND DAWN or SPELL OF THE WITCH WORLD over it for similar material given better handling. Elys' story in SPELL OF THE WITCH WORLD has some similarity to Thora's, but has a much more fleshed-out setting (though a more standard resolution of her relationship with Jervon than Thora has with Makil).  Nitpicks: - It doesn't ring true that other survivors of Thora's native village scattered without trying to regroup, or that Thora abandoned them without more backstory and effects on her character. (Thora doesn't seem to know if there were other survivors, or care.) Norton offers some explanation for Thora's detachment, but it seems thin. She was being trained as a priestess and a major figure in the community, but feels no apparent responsibility apart from her duty to protect various religious artifacts. For her, being a priestess seems to be about her special Chosen status, not at all about her relationship with/responsibilities to other people. (While this is certainly one way to develop a society, Thora lost her home and everything she ever knew except her dog, and doesn't seem to have been affected at all as the story opens a few months down the line.) - Thora doesn't quite seem to have the responses of a trained fighter - on poking into a strange, darkened room, she remains silhouetted in the doorway, and generally doesn't seem to be as prone to moving cautiously (or not at all) as one might expect a lone wanderer to need to be. - Granted that this is a setting without efficient mass communication, it still seems that travellers' tales would've at least made Thora acquainted with Makil's people by rumour before she encountered them, since they're within a few months' journey at walking pace (a lot less, possibly) from her native village.  The back cover blurb for the first edition is poor, by the by 
  This book was selected for an introductory statistics course at my university and ALL of the students absolutely LOATHE it. Unfortunately John Rice and/or Duxbury publishing have failed to realize that when it comes to mathematics, a textbook is only as good as the solutions to the exercises that it provides. With this book, THERE IS NO DETAILED SOLUTIONS MANUAL- only 'numbers' at the back that will in many cases leave even the strongest student absolutely clueless as to how the answer was obtained. Take for example, question 21 from chapter 1, which is one of the easier questions in the textbook. It asks a very standard probability question: 'What is the probability of being dealt a straight in poker?' When solving this problem, even an avid poker player might not think to subtract the number of straight flushes from the numerator (which is reasonable because it technically IS a different hand). So the student will flip to the back and see a 'minus forty' in the answer, and have no idea why it's there. And I must emphasize, THIS IS ONE OF THE EASIER QUESTIONS IN THE BOOK. With the proof questions (some of which are quite challenging) there are no answers whatsoever.   If you have a choice, you would be far better off purchasing 'An Introduction to Mathematical Statistics and Its Applications' by Richard Larsen and Morris Marx. It is deals with the topic at the same level as the Rice textbook, but is far superior in its presentation, examples, practice questions, and solutions. Many students in the course that I'm taking actually went out and bought this textbook (it was used to teach the course in previous years) because the Rice textbook is so bad.   
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 This is my first John March mystery, and Red Cat does not tempt me to read his first 2 books. The plot concept is somewhat intriguing but after each interaction between John and his brother David, I lost more interest. Why does John allow himself to be abused by his brother? His brother David is a caricature. Ultimately I didn't care what happened to either of them and gave up 
 This is simply embarrassing.  Sting has recently taken to passing himself off as a classical musician, playing guitar and lute and singing.  He can do none of these above the amateur student level.  Only someone with an incredible lack of taste and a huge ego would attempt such a musical endeavor for anyone beyond his own edification.  But then to place it on a disc and ask people to pay money for it just bursts the bounds of meretriciousness.  He should have stuck to the same tired old reworkings of the one modal folk-new-age-trash song that he has based his solo career upon.  And he should change his name to "Scat," for this more closely identifies with the brown, odoriferous material on this album 
 I was expecting much more out of this 2 volume set. The books are full of mistakes, especially in formulas. If you plan on purchasing these books, make sure to download and print out the errata as well. It could save many headaches in trying to understand formulas that don't agree with the accompanying explanation. I don't doubt that Glassner is a very intelligent man, but his descriptions are somewhat dense and difficult to decypher sometimes. My recommendation: get an ACM SIGGRAPH membership to get access to many of the papers in this field and get the algorithms straight from the source 
 This was absolutly dreadful. Ann Rinaldi has never written a book so awful in my opinion. I waited three months on this book and spent $11 on it to find it a dreadful mess. Even Rinaldi's worst books have had some historical reward for the waste of time like the Coffin Quilt, but I got nothing from it. And not to mention the charictors. Even her charictor Sarah in Sarah on Her Own was more believable. Phoebe gave nothing to the story, she was a spoiled brat of a girl. but don't let this turn you away from her other books like In My Father's House or Hang a Thousand Trees With Ribbons. Most her books are enlightening and worth the read 
 I recently saw Danielle Steel interviewed and was impressed that she had raised 9 children, lost a son to suicide, and did so much humanitarian work.  I'm not a fan of this type of novel but thought I would give it a try since I was so impressed with her in the interview.  There were two things that drove me nuts about this book, the most annoying of which was her repetition of words and phrases, often right on the same page.  "He was going to ask Carole" and then in the next paragraph, "He had decided to ask Carole."  The second most annoying thing was all the cliches.  It isn't often that I roll my eyes while reading a book.  I also think she spends way too much time with her superficial descriptions of places and people and not enough time having them do things.  I like the way other authors develop their characters by showing us how they behave, react and what they say in different situations.  I think having a character kick a dog (3 words) tells you a whole lot more about them than 50 pages of superficial drivel, which this book is full of.  I think Danielle Steel is a remarkable woman, but as an author, at least of this particular book, I don't see the magic or talent I expected from a person who has been called, "the world's most popular author."  447 pages.  Two days.  That's time I could have used elsewhere, feeding the hungry or ministering to the poor or sick.  OK, probably just reading another book 
 My twin sons got this for christmas when they were 3.  They loved it!!!  The dog is so cuddly and cute.  They loved playing pretend with the accessories.  My only complaint is that within a day the latch was falling off, the syringe was coming apart, and the brush had lost a couple of bristles.  The boys had not played rough with it, it just wasn't the quality that I had hoped for.  It is a real favorite of theirs, I am just afraid that it won't last as long as their imaginations.  I think that with a few improvements it will be a fantastic toy.  A real winner for young children in the hospital.  
 I believe that it is human nature to not want to read what yuo are forced to read. And i was assigned to read this in my HST301 class at oakland university. But goodness, Mr. Sam Bass Warner is interested in things that I am flat out not interested in. My teacher, for some reason, is just fascinated with the idea of privatism, however all it is is saying capitalism in a different way. I'm sorry I just don't care when Philadelphia put in waterworks and who were great contributors to the city. . .oh wel 
 Ok, first things first, FALL OUT BOY IS NOT PUNK! Fall out boy is emo. Not punk. Punk Is black flag, agent orange...but NOT fall out boy! Their songs are bad, mostly about how their girlfriends wont sleep with them and they can not play their instroments at all. Listen to the bassist!  Think twice about buying this horrible CD!  Thank you for your time 
 This movie is NOT for you if you cannot handle movies just being flat out weird.  Sure, there are plenty of plot holes, Reeves is in it so don't expect an academy award.....however the plot is very interesting (again filled with tons of holes) but I watch a movie to be entertained, not to be a film critic or to analyze everything.  Overall, if you like weird movies like "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" this movie is for you, if not and you like to be a nerd about movies and analyze every little detail about how "true to life" it may or may not be.....well just skip this one 
 Bottom line:  You cannot learn improv by reading a book just as much as you cannot learn to effectively speak in front of an audience without the practice of getting up and doing so.  Took many classes at the school, and I understand the resentment of some of the other raters saying it's "cultlike".  To get stage time at IO, you do need to start getting into politics and competitiveness that ultimately can ruin the experience of improv as art.  But, as many people know, Improvolympic is where many SNL recruits and and the nation's funniest professionals came from (or rather went through).  So, you are going to attract that element [sigh].  It's not entirely the IO staff at fault for the culture that exists there. The school itself is excellent with many great dojos teaching from their own experience of improv, and each one has a different and wonderful element to bring.  That being said, I would not recommend getting this or just about any improv book.  You have to DO in order to create improv,  not analyze. Analysis can create blocks because you're thinking about form too much.  If you want to become a good improviser,  you need to be smart, educated and a good writer.  So my suggestion would be to improve your writing skills (as articulation is extremely important), stay in touch with current events, and stay healthy (do your cardio) so your brain works fast!! Then get off your butt and take a class.   This book was written by someone with solid, professional, in-the-trenches experience, and who has a national reputation for heading a school that has helped to produce a lot of talent (or at least get it off the ground).  However, it is not a well-written book and does little to explain the rules or rather 'principles' or 'laws' of improv 
 I picked up this book expecting a mystery, and I was sorely disappointed.  While I enjoyed the characters and the setting, and even the body of the plot, the ending was terrible!  It felt like the author got tired of writing the book and just... stopped.  It makes me wonder if the author knew the answer to any of the mysteries at all 
 Okay, here is the deal.  This thing is built well, but it's dimensions and performance work against it.  It's height and width are just right for a pocket book, but it's thickness gets it in trouble.  It's a clunker, if you put this thing in your pocket (if it will fit) you will feel it.  Hell, it might even pull your pants down.  The thickness also makes it awkward to write in since it never folds flat and there is always resistance when jotting down an idea, which makes writing a chore (which is counter productive to the pocketbook ideal, which is maximum convenience).  If you are looking for a real nice small notebook, opt for a Moleskine.  Pass on this clunker 
 NICE BOOK IF YOU ONLY NEED TO LEARN HOW TO BATHE, TRIM EARS OR CLIP NAILS. DOESNT TELL YOU WHAT SIZE ATTACHMENTS TO USE OR WHAT PART OF THE BODY TO USE THE DIFFERENT ATTACHMENTS.ITS BETTER IF YOU HAVE A POODLE, MORE PAGES DEVOTED TO IT. ONLY ONE PER OTHER DOG 
 After the debacle that was Dirt I tried to repair the damage by making my now filthy looking hair shiny.  Well now my hair was not only dirty it was shiny and dirty.  Is this a joke.  I am sure that Jonathan was not trying to deceive people by charging such exorbitant prices for a hair cut if he was not a man of substance and yet here I am trying to wash this out of my hair, with his very shampoo and all I have is tears. Clearly this is not Product Without Tears.  
 Even though this is a "popular" version of the theory, with the considerable advantage of being by Einstein himself, it is not so easy as the presentation may imply. Einstein says in his introduction that his reasoning will demand no more than a high-school knowledge. It might be true in his time, but nowadays the book demands a longer study in Physics. I offer myself as an example: I'm a literature student in post-graduation level, and simply couldn't grasp the meaning of many mathematical demonstrations he uses to make his points. His reasoning is also obscure in many passages (what are really those 'galilean coordinates'?). Perhaps these details seem self-evident for professional readers, but they are not for the general public (the implied target of the book). In brief, Einstein didn't succeed completely in his attempt at popularization.  
 Looks nice. This is plastic. Did not last even for 2 months. We use very light items like cookies, etc to move around . 
 I read this as a greek woman who does not consider herself "the typical greek". Which means that if you asked every person in my life if they thought I would "go greek", every person would say with 100% certainty that I would remain indepedent. With all that being said, I picked up this book for a good light read about a world that I myself sometimes do not feel completely comfortable in. The book was terrible, I had to push myself to finish it because all of the characters were so flat and unlikeable and the writing was so green. Most people will read this book because of the back cover summary and the close up of the pledge's chests in their P.U.'s (personal undergarments) on the front.  If you have to read it, borrow a friends copy or from the library - please don't reward this author. 
 The warranty for the Magic Bullet is awful.   If you get it as a gift, Hope that the person giving the gift bought it the same day they give it. After several e-mails pictures etc. I was informed since the gift was bought in October, but not given until Christmas, had no warranty after October even though it was not used until 12/25.   The cost of the bullet at that time was 99.00. The base can be replaced for $20.00 (including shipping and handling). Many people who use the Bullet states it only lasts a year. If you buy it you are getting robbed.  It is amazing now they advertize buy one get one free.   Seems like it saves you shipping and handling when the 1st one goes.   
 I read several critics reviews before making the purchase and was very excited about an instinctive method book. I read it from  cover to cover over a weekend. I then went out Monday evening, full of warm and fuzzy feelings about dog training, to apply what I thought I learned and found myself staring at the dog not knowing where to start. I understand that the books overall theme was not just about yard work but I found the book more philosophical about the method and fell  short where the rubber meets the road. I did use some of the material to tweak others teachers methods (Tarrant, Long or Smith). The book reads like a compilation of magazine articles that are loosely related and rambles a little to much for my taste(side bar information about his favorite dogs). It is a good winter fire side read and I highly recommend it as that, but not as an owners first hands on training reference 
  After the excitement of THE WOLVES OF CALLA, SONG OF SUSANNAH is more than a little disappointing. Susannah and her demon possessor, Mia, are off to give birth to whatever, Roland, Eddie, Jake and Callahan are in hot, well, lukewarm pursuit, and for many pages nothing happens. Many, Many pages. This book plays to the worst parts of the series, overly mannered speeches, cryptic messages, 19's all over the place and page upon page of meaningless dialogue that will interest only fans of minutia. There are a few moments where things pickup, like when King himself makes an appearance, and while it proves  interesting for King to take such a hard look at his 70's self, it's not exactly Kilgore Trout meeting Vonnegut in BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS. Another problem I had was that unlike the clear and horrifying creations of Wrightson and Whalen, Anderson's blurry impresionistic images left me cold and did nothing to enhance this volume of THE DARK TOWER. For the second to last book in the series I had hoped for some real resolutions to some of the problems, but I guess King decided to save everything for the last book.   P.S. Man, if I heard that baby called "the chap" one more time... 
 I admit that I'm addicted - despite the s.l.o.w. progress, constant female bickering, and frequent fashion details.  I want to see how this dang series ends...will it?    This particular installment of the Dragon et. al. left me feeling underwhelmed.  The ending was a disappointment, but I'll press on and order book 8.  
 The Sharp Warm and Toasty microwave is a clunky hybrid of toaster and microwave. It takes 10 minutes to toast a muffin. The software is buggy-- I can't program it to toast a muffin to the end, but must get up and re-start half way though. The interface is clunky--it has little relationship to most appliance interface design, so must keep manual handy.   Plus, ours JUST DIED died, after only 2 1/2 years of moderate use.  The user manual has no troubleshooting section. (Like nothing will ever go wrong). Neither does their Website. So I tried to contact Sharp through their Website and after filling out all my info and problem details, found their site doesn't work with Firefox. The end. 
 I was pretty disappointed by this.  I was looking for songs that my kids could sing and dance to.  This just was not it!!  It's too bad, its one of my daughter's favorite movies. 
 Please, I beg you, purchase one of her other books!  I have read nearly all of Aiken's works and they are FANTASTIC.  However, this book was very cut-and-dried, dull, and prejudiced.  The characters of the island people were so caricatured that it was borderline offensive.  No child deserves to have to read this book 
 Specifically, you'd have thought that Russell and Corrine Calloway would've learned from what happened to them in the aftermath of the Stock Market Crash of 1987 (chronicled in "Brightness Falls").  Nah...they're still the shallow, selfish, self-absorbed people they were 14 years before.  The trouble is, you can't really tell whether McInerney thinks that's a good thing or a bad thing. 
 David W. Mount is a terrible writer.  I can't believe how much of a chore this book is to read.  His sentences, in my opinion, are ambiguous and I find myself backtracking unnecessarily. 
 I usually try to at least finish a book but this one was impossible!  I had to give up at page 180-something, I had had enough.  I will not even circulate it to my friends.  Thank god someone gave it to me and I didn't pay for it 
 I thought this book was all over the place, but maybe that was because I only read it before I went to bed. There were flashbacks and flash forwards and I thought the author was trying to be overly clever.  None of the characters were really that interesting to me.  It was sad that Jean didn't really have any friends and to be so old and know practically no one.  Wow!  I hope I don't end up like that when I am her age.  How could a married couple go on for 30 or 40 years and never tell each other such basic things.  What a miserable life!  I am glad this book was short or I would have put it down sooner.  I am not sure if I would read any of her other books.  I do like the fact that it is set in North Carolina, which takes me back home.  I thought this was a boring book with little moral value for me.  It is probably because I couldn't relate to the characters because I just don't live my life in total isolation.  Others might get more out of it that have life experiences that mirror these characters 
 hey the cd and movie is great but theres a song on the radio when bob is fixing his car and on the radio right before thay annocend that thay were killed thes a song playing that goes (over the mountians across the sea0and i dont know it i want to know hwo sings it and the name of the son 
 Don't bother.  Characters are lifeless, plot is boring, can't believe her first book is a best seller.  Maybe it was just pure luck 
 Danielle spins the usual McRomance. Fairly decent for her, but sometimes there are situations in her books that are simply 50 years out of date. Example is the lady in a former book whose husband REFUSED to let her attend law school. Hello? 2004 calling? I remember a story about a character giving birth who was forced to give birth with her legs strapped down. This written in like 1985 and they stopped doing that in like 1965. Well, the throwback in this book is the two selfish girls who were "cruel" to the stepmother. Hello? 2004 calling? Like 60% of their contemporaries don't have mixed families? Like mom DIED two years ago? Like y'all are adults? The twist that irritates so much that it throws you out of the web of belief needed to enjoy a romance novel 
 I had high hopes when I read this book. I thought it would bring insight into the very unique situation of adopting an older child. What I found was a book that was so totally depressing it left me with the feeling of  "why do this at all, why would I want to do this?" In the end we  did adopt an older  child. We have referenced many good books but I do not  include this one among them 
 Imagine an eight-year-old trying to explain his father's ideas. This book is like that. Pope John Paul II was a man of great philosophical and theological depth and profound life experience. Curran just doesn't have the mental age or spiritual maturity to be interpreting the late pope. John Paul's encyclicals, e.g. Veritatis Splendor, will be beacons lighting the path of Christians long after Curran's name has been forgotten (it is pretty much forgotten already).  
 Well seeing all the reviews on here and being a former fan of sugar ray along with being bored to death at work I've decided to write my own review.  I believe sugar ray had something special with the first two albums as well but as time went by they have gradually gone from ultra-hip, I just wanna drink beer and cause trouble types, to oh so sappy songs about love and how heart break sucks, nothing that hasn't been told a thousand times over. When I first hearsd Sugar Ray back in 97 I thought their sound was revolutionary, I bought Floored and liked all the tracks and soon found myself buying the first album, then the third, fourth, and fifth albums came out, the third one was alright i bought it for the songs that weren't radio friendly such as Glory, Personal Space Invader, and Burning Dog; And with the release of their fourth album I bought it as well, hoping that they would get back on formula; Yes as you might of guessed i was delusional; their music had seemed to had gotten worse as predicted.....Now with the release of their fifth album, they had already lost me as a fan so therefore, I give all three of the most recent albums of theirs a 1/5 stars for lack of originality 
 We've had this ball for over 6 months and our little one won't give it the time of day. I have never seen her so disinterested in a toy before. I brought this because we have several other Manhattan Baby products that we just adore. This one is a huge disappointment. It's much smaller than the picture posted and there are no  textures or anything to really engage baby. It's also odd because our Ellie loves "taggies" but she is not the teeniest bit enticed by the many tags on this. I would not recommend this product 
 Will not play once video was downloaded. I get the error message:  "can not play file, please try again later. error# 0x80040273" I made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the UnBox department was already closed, I was told the UnBox Saturday and Sunday 6-5 hours. I have to say I am impressed with the Call back feature. I downloaded the Unbox Beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem. Thanks Amazon UnBox! I will Update again - Feb. 10,200 
 Stephanie Coontz, "scholar" at prestigious Evergreen State College, has delivered yet one more broadside against reason and intellectual honesty. One need not spend time dismantling the arguments of those who find her work fair and balanced - propagandists have always had their supporters. Suffice it to say that this is characteristic of what passes for "scholarship" at today's college, which is to say, it is simply awful. Coontz relies entirely on whatever meager evidence she can muster supporting her premise, while totally ignoring any and all evidence to the contrary. In this case, that contrary evidence is massively overwhelming - but no matter - the end justifies the means. Tripe 
 I am very disappointed in this blanket--though some could be considered my fault.  I searched soley for "Electric blankets" and when this came up over and over, I thought I would try it for the price.  It is NOT electric, but that is the category I found it in--and still find it in.  "Queen size, electric blankets only."  Other than that, it is way too expensive for a nonelectric blanket--and probably way too inexpensive had it been electric!  I just don't want anyone else to be mistaken.  It may work out, but I did not need another regular blanket and it is not very soft.  Good luck shopping 
 Really, Don't bother with this one. I'm from England and the've discontinued it here. I've had it just over a year.   The printing started fading on the right of the page so I bought a new toner. This didn't solve the problem. So I followed the troubleshooting advice and bought a new drum. This didn't solve the problem. I emailed Brother. They rang back (quite promptly) and after cleaning a piece of glass inside, it still didn't work.  Finally they suggested I take it to be overhauled. The people I contacted at last gave me some sound advice. "Bin it"  Probably the last time I use Brother 
 Wow looks like Mary was digging for another story or just on some really good acid this time. Lets just say her book just found the scriptures very handy and she wasnt even really trying as hard this time. I think Mary should see a shrink and be very heavily medicated. Her books are strait Fiction in a wonderous and glorious attempt to make the common christian a "HOLY ROLLER" I have never once read scripture were Jesus calls anyone Child. She sounds like Jesus thinks she is from the red neck woods of Georgia. Grow up Mary stop bearing false witness. !!!!!! Stay off the drugs and do your homework MARY! This book was not worth the paper it was printed on and if heaven is like you say it is I DO NOT WANT TO GO and be any part of it. 
 If your intention is to podcast to a public site, this is a good book, with clear instruction. If you want to set up podcasts from your own website,there is nothing in this book to help you, and you would be wasting your money, as I did. The book does not live up to its title.   The author assumes that you are a public blogger wanting to post podcasts on a public site. There is nothing anywhere in the release about the book that this book is no help, if you want to post on your own website. Next time, I guess I go to a bookstore and look at the book. Anyone want a very slightly worn, but unused, copy of this book? 
 This song is so dirty and ugly - both the lyrics and the tune.  I guess it's a fun song if you like to party, but partying is not for me.  The Dirrty video goes with the song perfectly.  By that I mean it's also dirty and ugly 
 I had to purchase this sequal to Witch Child. It was a must to continue the journey of the quilt. The beliefs of past centuries and the Indian culture were so vivid in the writings of Celia Rees. You have to read both books 
 I mean no disrespect to a prior reviewer--Jill Switzer--or to anyone for that matter.  But I do resent having been enticed to buy this book.    Ms Switzer expresses 'enormous gratitude' for the advice given in this book, which has led to a book deal. She wrote the review in July 2004--her only one--when she was 'putting the spit and polish on her manuscript.'  I searched Amazon for her book but apparently it's not published yet, or Amazon hasn't yet begun selling it.  Please look for Ms Switzer's book to check the authenticity of her review.    Another disquieting piece of advice in the book was the suggestion that the writer employ an indexing specialist.  MS_Word does a pretty good job of indexing--am I wrong?   The book does not give sound advice regarding what to do when a publishing house tries not to pay a writer (usually first time writers will need to field such a 'try on'.)  I remember it saying that under no circumstances should you bother the Editor of the Publishing House regarding money matters.    Overall, this book felt like it was designed for 'wannabees' who would never be.    Strange also, that this book, like so many others that seem to pander to the interests of the Publishers, won't state expected income in dollar terms for things like romance novels.    Thank God for Amazon's new 'real name' system--now I can read reviews with some certitude of genuineness.  
 I didn't feel that this was his best work.  I liked the characters and the story line was great, but lacked in suspense until the 6th of 8 tapes.  Too much detail on mundane stuff.  Suspense picked up on Tape 6, but wasn't the same type of suspense like "PREY".  Enjoyed it, but would've liked more suspense 
 After reading this book I have concluded Albert Gore is quite possibly the most arrogant politician since Richard Nixon. The country is lucky he was not president, hopefuly Bush will do better than previously predicted, allowing opportunities for true public servents rather than know it alls like Mr. Gore 
 My god, this film is terrible!! One of the hardest films to track down in the UK "video nasties" scare, there are instances even now of this selling for £200-£300 on eBay in it's original VHS video format ...!! Unfortunately this film being rare had nothing whatsoever to do with it being any good.  "The Beast in Heat" (to use its more famous title) seems to be a low budget clone of "Ilsa She Wolf of the SS", but without a single ounce of the talent or budget present in any aspect of even that film's production. It's basically a very boring war movie in which we watch grumpy (and very obviously un-German looking) Nazi soldiers trade insults with civilians and members of resistance groups in some anonymous European village. Every so often some very obvious stock footage kicks in of planes and tanks attacking, which, apart from being obviously filmed completely seperately, is also in a different aspect ratio to the main feature footage!! Yes it's that bad! This dull state of affairs drags on for 85% of the films running time and is enough to have you reaching for the fast forward after just a few minutes. Everything is awful - the acting, the script, the dubbing, the sets...one hilarious moment occurs early on when a railway bridge is blown up. I guarantee you've never seen anything so lame. I swear they had the camera zoom in wildly on a STILL PICTURE of a very small detonation and even added extra hand drawn flame effects directly onto the celluloid.  If it wasn't for the unbearable tedium of the rest of the film, you could at least spend a few happy minutes laughing at this type of stuff.  But of course, somewhere in this mess lurks the reason for the film's true appeal - the scenes of SS officers torturing naked women prisoners. I'll give this film one (just ONE!) compliment - it does star a very foxy leading lady in the shape of Macha Magall, as the sadistic "Doctor Kratsch". Sadly no match for Dyanne "Ilsa" Thorne in the charisma stakes, but it's impossible to tell if she's any good as an actress due to the inept dubbing she is saddled with (along with the rest of tha cast).   That aside, the "cruel" experiments that she is in charge of are real bottom-of-the-barrel trash. Making most shock value in the cheapest way possible is easy - have everyone naked. Right, what next? Well from there the flaws really start to pile up. The central "experiment" of the film is a sex-crazed dwarf that Dr Kratsch keeps in a cage, and whom she occasionally whips up into a frenzy of over-acting by throwing a naked woman in with him. What follows each instance of this is a montage of the worst possible face-pulling and general pantomime style rape attacking from the dwarf, and plenty of screaming from the hapless naked actress while she tries to look as though she is being overpowered by the crazed mini monster (rather difficult, as he is so small!) The camera zooms in wildly on splashes of too-red tomato sauce being liberally spashed about, as the beast carries out his assault. In one sequence, the dwarf even ups the outrage stakes by lifting his cross-eyed face from woman's lap to show a mouthfull of torn-out bloodied hair...ugh! Don't worry, there's not even a hint of realism to any of this. All the while, Dr Kratsch and her attending guards watch silently, occasionally licking their lips in apparent arousal at the gruesome sight (I don't know where all the unusable footage of them laughing their heads off is, but there must be loads of it).  Realism fares no better in other scenes as still more naked prisoners are tortured, eaten alive by rats (yes they are gerbils), or have stuck-on fingernails pulled out, The dubbing in these scenes is the worst synched dialogue you have ever seen. "Stop it...you're hurting me..."  the soundtrack burbles while a bored looking actress's lips move in completely unconnected directions. Even throwing a baby in the air for rifle target practise or shooting a naked woman directly between the legs can't raise a gasp with production values as low as these.   Due to the sparse placement of the torture scenes within the rest of the generally boring war and resistance action, it's rare for anyone to manage the feat of sitting through this rubbish to the bitter end, so should you fail, I'm sure you can guess the well deserved fate that awaits our cruel SS lady doctor...have a guess where she ends up. Sadly it's presented very half heartedly...you'll be only too happy to see the end of the film roll up on your TV. To realise that such a waste of space as this has been given a DVD release is more entertaining than actually watching the thing. They could at least have kept the original cover ( a hint of which can be seen in the lower left corner of the sleeve), it was a masterpiece of trash cinema promotion.   The irony is that the British politicians and press who campaigned for films like these to be banned have ultimately succeeded in prolonging their shelf life far beyond that which the films deserve. This should go back to the obscurity in which it belongs.  
    This story was seriously depressing, and was in no way a book that I would call enjoyable. 
 I enjoyed Joan's first two books, but this one was a disappointment.  I don't see that Joan Erikson really helped Joan Anderson become her own person.  Instead, Anderson often seemed childlike in her relationship with Erikson, allowing Erikson's voice to be more powerful than her own.  Surely Anderson is mature enough to know whether she wants to cut her hair, and doesn't need Erikson to dictate what she should wear to a business meeting!  Erikson may have had some valuable words of wisdom, but a true mentor honors who you are and encourages you to become your truest self without projecting their own preferences.  
 Let's get one thing straight. I loved bionicle legos and when i first heard of this movie, i was hyped up to buy it. but when i saw it, i was really disappointed. let's see how this movie is:  VOICES the voices are really cheesy. They don't fit the bionicles at all. I'd rather have no voices than any!  PLOT Okay, they totally missed out on the original bionicles. They only focussed on the second bionicle design which is Ugly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  THE MUSIC I have not much to say, but this music was..................... .......... freaky.  OVERALL this movie would of gotten a one star if the plot was bad nothing relating to the stories in the magazines or website. However, the plot was okay following a bit at the comics and websites. so this somewhat a "ok" movie. just be warned 
 I came to this book very interested in knowing more about Ho and to see this period of history told from the perspective of a figure not normally viewed as a major player.  Having previously read Paul Preston's biography of Franco (a long book), I was hoping this would be of similar quality (see my review of Preston's book).  It's not.  This book is very detailed.  As one of the other reviewers notes, there are specifics about all sorts of travels and meetings with all sorts of names, places, and times.  But, nothing really ties these things together to make a story.  It's so bad that I haven't finished the book and probably never will.  So, why 2 stars instead of a total blast of 0 or 1 star?  Because I do believe the author has been thorough and so this deserves some respect.  I just wish there had been an editor or someone to help turn this into a story.  And the final plug:  Preston's book about Franco is really good 
 After reading this book it became obvious to me that the author has many unresolved issues with her religious life and with Christianity.  Even though she sheds some insight about whom or what MM was, she did so in a negative and sometimes condescending  way.    I was somewhat hurt by the character assignation she did on JC.  Obviously, she had made Jesus an idol of worship instead of the holy man he was and therefore took it upon herself to shatter that idol in this book.  The very thing she blames the Church in doing - making Jesus an idol - she has done herself.  The Jesus she spoke of in this book is not the Jesus I have come to know and love.  It is very easy to take words out of context and use them in a way to indicate hostility when in effect no hostility was meant.  It is easy to come to false conclusions and premises when one's perception is skewed by one's personal beliefs and emotions.  Jesus was human, but that does not take away from the divination of his being.  If Jesus was so humanly perfect then it would conclude that none of us could ever walk in his footsteps.  None of us would have a chance of experiencing heaven. That is ludicrous. 
 First of all, let me make one thing quite clear:  I am for the legalization of all drugs, I get really annoyed when people speak against marijuana, I am repulsed by the lies and propaganda that groups like DARE use against pot, and overall, I think pot is pretty cool--if you use it wisely.  This book is a frivolous castle in the air.  It presents all of the benefits, including some Ms Bello made up herself, and doesn't show you any of the downsides.  In my experience, and in the experience of many of my friends, there are dangers as well as benefits regarding this plant.  Marijuana is not some thing you can casually pick up and allow to fill your life; it can very easily take over your whole livelihood.  In order to become a conscientious and responsible pot-smoker, you need to set limits for yourself, know when and when not to smoke, take up plenty of interests besides drugs, balance being "high" with being "normal", and above all, take the plant seriously!  According to this book, smoking pot is like drinking water:  100% harmless, you can do it anytime you want and as much as you want, and without it, you're toast.  ...This book automatically makes marijuana less safe than it would be otherwise!  There are plenty of other books that will give a more balanced pro-and-con view of the old bhang!  This is nothing but propaganda, equal and opposite to the propaganda used by DARE 
 More mind numbing Christian apologetics.  Comparable with the ideological propaganda disseminated by McDowell and Strobel.  If your intellectual capacity is very limited, then you might find this book compelling 
 I agree with the reviewer who mentioned unfinished subplots and unexplained sequences. I gave this movie a chance because I am a huge john candy fan and had never heard of it, but, I know that often, sleeper movies can be buried gems just waiting to be found (a la benny and joon)but this wasnt one of them im afraid. I found this movie mildly amusing, John Candy does very well but overall, the movie doesnt hold up to his other movies. The ending was dissapointing and there were too many, as above mentioned, unfinished subplots. Was there supposed to be some sort of development with the John Larroquette sequence? that was really a pointless addition other than to give the family somewhere to go while Candy learned his sailing and yeah, what was wrong with the popcorn? I loved you John Candy and i miss you dearly,you'll always have a place in my heart, however, this movie will probably never be watched again. I will see you again, in planes, trains and automobiles.  
 I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job.   So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. Take a pass on Airsplat. The sight seems ok for the price. 
 I suppose I should be grateful to Alexander for doing some original research but it's hard to get excited about a book that has no enthusiasm for it's subject and some how makes a fascinating man dull.  I recommend the great Frank Graham's McGraw of the Giants.  It's out of print but readily available at used book stores.  Graham covered McGraw for years, knew him well and, more importantly, knew countless sports writers who covered McGraw from his days in Baltimore.  Graham examines his controversial subject with a critical entusiasm that brings this great but very flawed man to life.  As Graham skillfully shows, McGraw's edge was sometimes so sharp as to be repellant but he was an innovative genius at baseball marketing, administration, selecting and motivating players as well as on the field strategy.  If you're a baseball fan, he's worth studying 
 I should first say that I have not watched the series, but will follow that up by saying that this movie has not persuaded me to do so. I am a casual anime fan and for reference will say that the anime's I have enjoyed include Dragon Ball Z, Outlaw star, Cow boy bebop and Ninja Scroll.  If you have only seen 2 movies in your life time and the other one was "Big top Pee-Wee", then maybe (and I stress maybe) I could understand a 5 star review. If you are a die hard fan of anime and if all it takes is a couple of bloody scenes this may be for you. If you are 15 years old you might be impressed with this. However if you expect depth of character, story evolution and strong plot, skip this.  In a nut shell some girl is depressed and wants to disappear/Die, what ever, so she disappears and shows up in Gaea as the Wing Goddess. Two separate factions have been warring with each other over a dragon armor suit that holds the fate of the world. The girl is the key to the suit in a way it goes to whom ever she decides; the good guys get it the end. Believe me when I say this is the better telling of that story and the less painful one.  The Good: a couple of good fight scenes and the animation were pretty good.  The Bad: The tone of a movie is very important and this story was way over dramatized. The characters aren't developed at all so you can't really bring your self to care about them, or want to pay attention to them. The movie felt like they were trying to squeeze the content of a long draw out series into 95 minutes and they failed miserably. I considered turning this off several time but felt that I should finish and form a complete opinion about it. Well I have and it aint good.  
 I did a lot of research before purchasing this computer. I read a lot of rave reviews,but  was greatly dissapointed!  First it was great (1 week), then we had problems, it would show upside down on the screen, we fixed that, then we had no keyboard, the cd itself worked.  I have written twice to the customer service over the span of 7months and I still haven't got a response. I would call, but no number on their website. go with Leapster instead, don't waste your money 
 I'm a diehard Nikon fan.  My first Nikon was a gift from my father when I was 13.  Since then, photography has been a serious hobby, having had a few photos published and even spent time working in a photo lab while in college.  Having said that, and after reading several reviews about people having trouble focusing this camera, I absolutely agree with them.  Someone responded by saying those reviewers haven't read the manual.  Baloney.  I bought the Coolpix L1 to replace a 4 year old Coolpix 850.  The L1's camera's focus feature works fine in the daylight and works for s**t indoors, especially with the macro settings.  I've been patient and have given it three months.  I am fed up.  This camera is going back to amazon in the morning 
 The Southwest Airlines Way offers little applicable business process knowledge.  Instead the author provides a steady diet of amibiguities and generic case studies.  Drucker this is not.  I was particularly interested in the relationship between unions and Southwest management.  What I expected was a discussion on the management side of the economic value added of union involvement and on the rank-and-file side a discussion of the reasons unions were needed in lieu of employee empowerment programs.  What you get is "we're all in this together".  I recommend this only for those readers who know little about the airline's history and seek a basic primer.  Buy it used 
 (2.5 Stars) When I first began reading WH, I was turned around a bit on the chracters as well some language styles, so I decided to cheat and check out the list of characters that was in the back. I soon realized how unhelpful it was and very disappointed by its lack of contributing nothing more than the obvious. What I mean is, instead of helping me deciphor who was who and in relation to one antoher, in which a geneology would have been better, they merely gave very short snippets of description that was actually in the text itself. I got through all the relations by my friend who supplied me with a genology chart.  There were also endnotes that state the obvious as well and it was very tedious to have to keep flipping back to see if they would clarify anything. One character speaks in special Englilsh dialect that was difficult to read and understand. The author suggests that you just need to read it aloud and you'll understand it. Granted, that's true, but a translation in the endnotes would have been nice too.   There is a timeline at the beginning, which is nice but I'm not sure what the point of it was and it seemed randomly placed. At the back again, there is a short discussion on the motifs/themes of the book. It was somewhat enlightening but they point out things the reader would have picked up anyway. But, one thing that was really interesting was that there was a short essay on how the book was received from Bronte's time as well into modern times. The short bio at the beginning was done well though.  The overall language of the book was modernized while still keeping certain dialec and stylistic elements of Bronte that didn't really work well. It was very awkward at times but nevertheless, very readable.   Someone who wants a less intimidating introduction to Bronte or any classical works will find this book helpful (& others in this series). But for those of you who are used to a more strict classical interpretation with a more academic flavor, this is NOT the book for you. You will find it somewhat dull, unchallenging and tedious. The language is not very sophisticated nor reminiscent of the linguistic era (which I enjoy, you may not, so...)  The STORY of WH was fascinating. I both hated it and loved it. There were times when I just wanted to chuck the book across the room because I found it SO vile, the charcters so enraged and violent, selfish and horrible. I haven't feld that way since I read Ann Rice's 'Memnoch the Devil'. I've never read a more passionate and fierceer book; and while I read, I was both dreading it yet couldn't wait to see what happened.   I read this several days ago and I'm still buzzing from it. The confusion of the names is a very interesting device, clever and sly. Bronte was ahead of her time, fusing both the gothic novel with supernatural, dramatic and tragic styles. The evolution of 3 generations was so complex yet the progression of each was so vivid and stand out on their own. I haven't decided if I hate or love Heathcliff and Catherine, if even I can forgive them for their nature. And the wonderful way that Bronte wrote was not just the language of words but in the way she used the wilderness of the moors as a description of their wild selves.  
 This book was hard to understand. I would not recommend  this one to those who are just curious, like myself. 
 There are probably 3 ways they could have gone about making this compilation on Glen a good one:  1) The greatest chart hits overall..giving better stature to the ones that charted not only on country but also pop and/or easy listening Billboard charts. 2) Focus on the biggest songs on the country Billboard charts..meaning if a song charted #1 country with a poor pop showing you give it preference over one that charted #30 country but #20 pop 3) Try to assemble the "artistically" best tunes from Campbell's career  Approach #3 is out the door the minute you use the word "Hits". Hits are an OBJECTIVE thing...it either was or was not a chart hit. If you're gonna name it "Greatest Hits" then artistry can't be your TOP criterion for selection.  Approach #1 is out because one of his top 10 country tunes from 1976 , a medley of "Don't Pull Your Love/Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye" which also crossed to the pop chart, isn't here at all. I also don't see "I Knew Jesus (Before He was a Superstar)" which was a decent sized country AND middling pop hit. Strike 2...  That leaves Approach #2...a "country hits" collection. Does it succeed? #1 hit "I Wanna Live" (1968)...not here. Top 10 hits "Try a Little Kindness","Manhattan,Kansas","Honey Come Back","Everything a Man Could Ever Need","It's only Make Believe", his top 10 duets with Bobby Gentry on "Let it Be Me" and "All I Have to Do is Dream"..not here. The aforementioned "Don't Pull your Love/Then you Can Tell me Goodbye" and "Country Boy (You Got your Feet in L.A.)"..more Top 10 hits missing in action. [I'll cut them a break on post-1981 material after Glen left Capitol..but that would be ANOTHER 5 missing Top 10s otherwise].  Wait, you say...it's only 1 disc. They have to make decisions as to which huge hits to include. OK...60 minute runtime...axe "Classical Gas","Amazing Grace","King of the Road (instrumental)","Mr. Tambourine Man (Instrumental)"...none of which were chart hits..and that frees up space for at least 4 more hits. Then add about 15 more minutes of music (80 minutes is CD capacity) and you could squeeze in about 9 of those missing hit songs..(that's all but 1 of the ones I mentioned if you're keeping score)  BOTTOM LINE: A complete failure to represent Glen's hits. Look instead for ALL THE BEST (ASIN B00006JIC0)(which collects just about all the ones I mentioned as missing and retains the big stuff that's on this one).[One caveat: Some have mentioned poor remastering on that one so sample it via library or a friend if you can first].  If you have a bigger stack of money available, get double CD set GLEN CAMPBELL COLLECTION 1962-1989 instead (ASIN B000002ZDA on Razor and Tie Records) for the biggest stuff plus rarities like his first big chart hit (1962's #20 hit "Kentucky Means Paradise" recorded with the Green River Boys) and a lot of his late 80s top 10 country hits. 
 I thought this book was simply disgusting.  I felt so ashamed being in a bookstore looking into this book.  Many times I felt so nauseated looking at it that I had to put it down.  It is a shameful book, and I think it is more shameful that these young men should parade their bodies that way.  This is what they call art? Originally I did not want to rate the book at all because it does not deserve not even one star, but I had no choice but to rate it.  Amazon should give one the choice to give it a "0" rating if one feels that the book is really bad.  I don't recommend this fetid book to anyone 
 I hate that I wasted my money on the Untelling. I heard so much about what a great writer Tayari Jones was and people were really lying. The story had loose ends, the main character was supposed to be educated but came across as the opposite, the over-quoting of Dr. King, the lack of resolution at the end. Just because someone uses a bunch of big words doesn't make them a good writer. No wonder her books aren't selling. Maybe her next one will be better if she concentrates on learning how to actually tell a story that doesn't put you to sleep. Better luck next time but I won't buy another of her books 
 What a mind-numbingly inept end chapter to a series that began with the greatest horror-comedy of all time, The Re-Animator.  Continuing in his deluded quest to claim the Re-Animator series for his own, and to convince us that he can direct, producer Brian Yuzna has managed the opposite.  Beyond Re-Animator merely confirms what was evident about the Yuzna-directed Bride of Re-Animator, that Yuzna knows nothing about directing actors and story.  As with Dagon, Yuzna seems to have secured financing from Spanish sources for this film.  Unfortunately, the problem is that they also tried to force in a mostly Spanish cast.  This is a story set in Massachusetts, for crying out loud -- why would the warden of the prison, the reporter coming to cover the story, the guards, and a good 90 per cent of the inmates all have Spanish accents?  It wouldn't be as howlingly horrible if these guys could act, but they can't.  Simon Andreu as Warden Brando and Elsa Pataky as love interest Laura Olney get the most screentime of anyone in the cast, but their acting is so bad, and their ADR-afflicted lines so glaringly off, that they manage to sink the film every time they open their mouths.  Yuzna seems to pick his leading ladies based on their willingness to take off their clothes (witness the gratuitous "nurse nipple" scene in this film, or Fabiana Udenio and Kathleen Kinmont in Bride of Re-Animator), and Pataky makes for one of the most unsympathetic love interests I can remember.  But even Pataky and Andreu pale in incompetence next to that blustery, seething mass of bad acting that is leading man Jason Barry.  Based on Yuzna's shoddy history with actors, one might be tempted to blame it on the director, but the fact is that in this film, Jason Barry is incapable of pulling off a single believable moment, basic elementary acting.  His every internal and external beat rings false, his dialogue delivery sounds like a cold reading, and even his basic body movements look like amateur theatre.  Most high-school students do better than this.  Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West, seasoned pro that he is, gamely plays along, but the script puts West's character so far off to the sideline in favour of the vomit-inducing Pataky-Andreu axis that Combs is unable to save this film.  On a strictly technical level, the cinematography looks good, the score is all right (though often too serious-minded for its own good), and the film doesn't look low-budget.  But when the "story" is such a mess and the actors so inept, no amount of slick lighting and camera moves can save a film.  Yuzna really should stick with producing, because on the Stuart Gordon-directed Dagon, at least there were some good moments.  But Beyond Re-Animator is beyond salvaging, possibly the worst film sequel I've ever seen, and way up there in the list of worst films I've ever subjected myself to 
 I did laugh and was mildly entertained and never bored with this one.   The DVD commentary also includes some other stories that are also pretty funny and explain some of the pitfalls of an underfunded movie, which explains some of the end product here, I would think.  Of course, I had seen the Ebert&Roeper review of this movie beforehand so I was not expecting much.  In fact, I was curious about a movie they found so terrible.  And "Dirty Love" is not all that great, it was not as bad as I expected either.  My wife hated...HATED...this film, so I would not call it a "chick flick". 
 Imagine the cheapest pillows you can find, and then imagine a pillow one step up.  This is what you get from this product, a "second-to-the-worst" product you can imagine.  Not recommended for nightly use as it is poorly stitched and insufficiently stuffed.  This pillow has no support.  Maybe it can go in the guest bedroom, but even at these prices, you can do better for your guests.  And don't bother trying to return it to Amazon either, they'll take all the value of it back because of shipping charges 
 I had high hopes for this DVD but was thoroughly disappointed.  There is no narrative.  It is just a conglomerate of a bunch of interviews that gave tidbits of what they think is going on.  It was extremely boring and confusing.  I'm wondering who Tony Palmer is who can get Time to give a positive review on it.  I'm completely let down.  The lone star is for the dance clips of Margot. 
 This book was good in that it has some interesting ideas about the future, mortality and aging. This might have made it recommendable.  But the story didn't have any meat on it. It was actually pretty boring and ultimately a disappointment. And for this, it's not really recommendable 
 I'm not sure Byatt had in mind as a prospective readership for this novel.  I read a lot and am not a stranger to the world of literary criticism, but this tome was virtually unbearable once I hit about the halfway point.  The first half was somewhat interesting and I had high hopes.  But as the book quote-unquote progressed, there just was more and more nothin'.  Endless, lengthy quotations and, frankly, boring observations.  I'm not sure I have anything of value to comment on, specifically, but I would like to forewarn readers:  this is one of the most trying, pretentious, uninteresting books I have ever read, and I think it would not likely appeal to the vast majority of readers.  It could conceivably appeal to lit crit buffs but even then.  Yuck 
 Let me preface my review by saying that I'm a vegetarian. I have Sara Foster's first cookbook and absolutely love it. The pages are stained from use and every recipe I prepare is a big hit--scones, cookies, eggplant parm... This book however is lacking in vegetarian options (even sides that can be used as main dishes) and I don't find the desserts or breakfast items as exciting. I would highly recommend her first book however 
 I have been a fan of LaBute for many years now and have yet to dislike any of his work, but this is not a very good play.  When I read a play, I try to envision how it would play out on stage.  This script has little potential for making a good production.  I guess this may be why it was published before anyone tried to mount a production of it.  I really feels unfinished.  The characters change their intentions throughout the play in an attempt to create twists and turns in the plot.  To me it all seems pretty contrived.  Since the plot is pretty much a mess, LaBute uses the convention of the main character breaking the fourth wall and talking directly to the audience.  This results in some good monologues (possible audition material), but the play itself just kind of fizzles out into these kind of monologues instead of having a real arc to the story.  The dialogue is still good and there are some interesting scenes, but all-in-all it's just not a very good play.  If you are a fan of LaBute and have read/seen all of his other work it may be of interest.  If you are new to LaBute try The Shape of Things or The Mercy Seat 
 I was sooooo disappointed.  I had high expectations for this book and found that it was really nothing more then stories told from a counselors chair.  This book told me nothing about how to overcome the problems, but instead focused on experiments conducted to account for jealous partners.  Truly a waste...there are other books out there that are much more useful 
 There are only 1 or 2 short topless scenes and a few crappy death scenes. The death scenes are boring and plain. This movie had so much promise but fell so short. I wouldn't watch it this movie on cable let alone pay for it 
 When I ordered the books and checked out, there was no indication of the shipping cost. Since I dealt thru Amazon before, I assumed the shipping to be included. When I received my invoice, the shipping cost equalled the cost of the books.  I contacted the seller and was told that was the way it was.  I am very unhappy that I have to pay this cost as the books were already shipped.  If you are going to use this type of outside services, I would advise you to insure that the customer knows what he will pay, in total, before they complete their order.   This transaction is a  negative for Amazon.   Regard 
   This is bring to your notice that the product that i have orderd has not reached me yet. I request you to do the needful. Thanking you Prince Georg 
 Executive summary: should you read this book? Answer, if you want to see a vivid imagination at work, yes. If you're looking for a sober, carefully-argued work, no.  Author Tony Blankley is clearly a US conservative of the deepest hue. This is thus a book written by a conservative for conservatives. It is also strong on patriotic heart-string tugging and worship of the US state religion, that is, America (which can do no wrong, which is eternally benevolent).  The thesis is that the West is menaced by radical Islam, which seeks the destruction of the Western way of life and its replacement by sharia law. To me, this is as far-fetched as the proverbial bucket of sugar from China. Mr Blankley makes some good points - there are indeed problems with Muslim immigrants in Europe, the proportion of radical Muslims is indeed rising and, as I write, the Deutsche Oper's production of Mozart's "Idomeneo" has been cancelled for fear of offending Muslim sympathies (for some reason it featured the severed heads of Mohammed, Jesus and Buddha). And there will certainly be more terrorist attacks by fanatical Muslims. But does this amount to a resurrection of the Caliphate that knocked on the gates of Vienna in the 17th century? No. But Mr. Blankley would have you believe that it could.   In his opening chapter, Mr. Blankley paints a nightmare scenario of Muslim takeover and domination that reads like something from "Monty Python" and which, to my eyes, tears to shreds the author's credibility for everything that follows. And what follows is a bit like what the British memo to Tony Blair said about the US intentions in Iraq, that the US fitted the facts around an already-decided US course of action. Mr. Blankley does this with much loaded language and strong (and occasionally questionable) statements, and ends up by saying that the USA should declare war on radical Islam and utilise full war powers, such as internment. He clearly strongly disapproves of those lily-livered, multicultural, soft, godless Europeans (I don't know whether he is religious, but he is careful to play to his US audience by invoking Providence a number of times).  However, anyone from Northern Ireland or northern Spain could tell Mr. Blankley what the West faces - a larger version of the IRA or ETA, a relatively small number of terrorist fanatics with a larger number of people actively supporting or passively ignoring them. More security, better intelligence are clearly needed, as they were with the IRA or ETA. But the British and Spanish managed without going to extreme lengths of declaring war on terrorism in the style advocated by Mr. Blankley. These are complex problems requiring compromises and adjustments on all sides; the rapier, not the bludgeon, is needed.  At one point, Mr. Blankley seems to hit on the essence of the problem, but then steers away from it. This is a war of ideas. How exactly does one declare war on ideas? It is not possible to bomb and shoot people into your way of thinking. The Irish Republicans on the Falls in Belfast are still just as ardently Irish Republicans.   The only way to combat an idea is with a better idea. And America has a better idea - democracy. However, no matter how much Americans wish it, US-style democracy is NOT the default condition of humankind; the mere displacement of a dictator or two will not make US-style democracy automatically flourish. Only by example can the USA make it appealing. If America lived up to the high ideals of its founders, not to mention the first Republican President (would Abe even recognise the present incumbent?) it would be unstoppable. Naturally, one will never please all the fanatics, who will insist on continuing to have both feet firmly planted in the air. But if the world could see an America, which gave a fair deal to ordinary Americans and minorities, in which the government wasn't beholden to religious fanatics and lubricated by corporate money and backscratching and in which it was even-handed in its foreign relations, most of that world would be impressed and want the same.  The world is ready for such an America. Problem is, America, having with the recent law changes essentially acquired its first dictator, with an apparent desire to arrest and torture whoever he wants, apparently isn't. Pity.  It seems to me that this book almost certainly has an ulterior motive. Although the dreadful word "Iraq" is rarely mentioned (and then only in approval of the US actions there), it seems to me that, having invaded Iraq on a totally falsified pretext and found no WMD there, some justification was needed to cover backsides that suddenly were looking very bare indeed. Answer: The Clash of Civilisations! This book may be an attempted justification of the mess into which the USA has got itself. By holding forth the thesis that the Clash of Civilisations is the real reason that George Bush invaded Iraq, the author seeks to transform him from bumbling incompetent to great visionary, just in time for the forthcoming elections.   At one point, Mr. Blakely gets slightly carried away and calls President Bush "George the Bold". And this is quite appropriate. The previous "bold" leader in history was Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy in the Middle Ages. Charles's name in French is "Charles le Tï¿½mï¿½raire", and "tï¿½mï¿½raire" is more accurately "rash" or "foolhardy". He led his duchy into a disastrous war with the Swiss Confederation and lost his duchy and his life. France then acquired Burgundy and has been drinking the proceeds ever since. "George the Rash"; bon, n'est-ce pas?   
 I give up... 100+ pages in. I can't take it anymore. It is incredibly boring. The people are unlikeable and vapid. The sex is stupid. Jane Smiley is too talented to write a piece of crap like this. 
 To tell you the truth, I couldn't make heads nor tails out of this book.  The language is too far away from even modern, and the characters are confusing.  I love sci-fi, even the new computer-oriented (some call it cyberpunk) stuff like "Snow Crash", but "Synners" is just strange.  Ala the Emperor's New Clothes..."Oh my, how strange!  It must be good!"  No, sorry, it's just strange.  I actually came here (to Amazon reviews) to see if anybody else had made sense of it.  I thought I might read farther if I understood it better.  I'm only to page 18, and I doubt I'll finish it. Dou 
 As with a lot of reviews here, I will warn anyone interested in seeing this "movie" that the language is incredibly crude and over-the-top offensive.  It's worse than the "South Park" movie and TEAM AMERICA--and any other foul-mouthed flick I've ever seen.  THE ARISTOCRATS is basically dozens and dozens of comedians telling a simple and, for me, unfunny joke. The comedians, however, are funny.  This might have worked better if it had been shorter.  There was a point when I just got too trashed out on the vulgarities by everyone to care what this movie was saying.  Kind of like the first episode of HBO's "Deadwoood" series: bad language eventually not only loses all effect, it also erodes any meaning.  It had its moments.  I laughed at the ventriliquist constantly abused by his foul-mouthed puppet.  The gay-looking dude doing his take on Liza Minelli was funny.  The Gilbert Gotfried segment actually made that joke funny...one out of a hundred...?  In the end, THE ARISTOCRATS could have been just as well done but with a different joke and a different title.  THE PARROT ON MY SHOULDER or KNOCK, KNOCK. Because it's the really talented people they're talking to who are funny.  Not that joke 
 Nothing like EON. EON is the one. This was a hack sequel with no guts. Very dissapointing 
 I had never read a John Grisham book.  But I am generally a believer in the notion that "if something is hugely popular, there must be a reason for it being so."  So I assumed there was something massively entertaining about John Grisham's writing.  A week ago I picked up "The Street Lawyer," and I was prepared to be entertained.  Boy, was I wrong.  This book stinks to high heavens.  This man cannot write.  "The Street Lawyer" is badly written, stupidly plotted, and riddled with banalities and cliches.  I could go on, with great fervor, for hundreds of words, about what makes this book abysmally bad, but I'm going to save my energy.  Please, just trust me, this book is terrible.  I shudder to think that the American reading public is engrossed by this man's words 
 Okay so I thought this book was supposed to be really great, but when I read it, it seemed very outdated; almost as if it were written hundreds of years ago.  Also, I am so over Ben Franklin.  So, he invented the kite and the can opener. I think that we as a society would have figured those things out for ourselves after a while anyway.   I was looking for some good witty sayings to use when I picked up this book.  Until I turn 75 next year, I will not consider myself old and will not be using any of the outdated sayings or information in this book.  As far as an almanac goes, my arthritic joints do just fine in predicting the weather for me.  In terms of up to date information , I would like to recommend Player Haters by Carl Weber.  
 I didn't get 20 pages into this book before I said ENOUGH ALREADY GET TO THE PART WITH THE WHALES.  Sheesh.  Maybe the ending is good.  Maybe Ishmael and the whale become lifelong friends and live happily ever after.  I do not know because Mr. Melville wont stop rambling on and get to the POINT.  There is a nice picture of a whale on the cover of my copy anyway so that rates this book as TWO STARS.  The rest is mostly junk.  Back to the drawing board 
 I bought this game about a week ago. I had not purchased the prequil (sp?) to this game and did not know what to expect.  I began playing the game and immediately got bored about 30-45 minutes later. I have no played the game since. Here's why: The graphics, to me, are ridiculously annoying. It makes the game feel so unrealistic. The graphics are a step lower than "NBA Street" and even more unrealistic. The real problem is that there is just nothing to do. You enter tournements and they all feel the same. The little side missions are laughable, and I feel like turning off my Ps2 and smashing the controller on my head repetitively everytime I play one of them.  I can go on and on about why I hated this game. But I won't. The bottom line is that I strongly urge you not to waste your money. The cover and appearance of the game appealed to me and made me want to buy the game...but don't let that happen to you 
 My mother recently ordered this book by Mr. Chopra and was urging me to read it. She spoke very highly of it and told me that he used science to prove God and such, etc. Allow me to be upfront. I am a skeptic, and a firm Atheist. I do not believe in the backward illogical concept of God that most religion would scare you to believe in. But I decided to keep an open mind, as I always do, and I read Mr. Chopra's "How To Know God" from cover to cover.   First of all, Mr. Chopra does not speak of the God that most religions speak of. He in fact urges the reader to rethink their concept of God, the first chapter is called "A Real and Useful God". Here Mr. Chopra describes a God that all of us can reach directly, and he also describes most people's general view of God and how he is a supposedly unattainable God until death...etc. He then devises 7 Stages of God, that match our human emotions and says there is a God for each stage. He continues to say that whenever we feel this or that, we are experiencing the God of that stage. This is where I begin to have a problem.   Mr. Chopra begins this book with his own concept of God, that is neither supported by scientific evidence or any sort of rational thought at all. I was unable to get anything out of the following pages because I could not help wondering why I was not given any evidence into Mr. Chopra's thought process. He simply creates his own idea and flies with it, assuming the reader will just go along with it and not apply any sort of thought. This is weak and misleading. But I continued to read. He then begins to talk about three versions of reality, the material reality (the material world), virtual reality, and quantum reality (God's world outside of space-time). He then says that there are many arguments in the material world against God, but none of these can be applied because God is not in the material reality, he is in the Quantum reality. Absolute garbage! Pure assumption! I was outraged by this statement, and saw it as a poor way of denying the logical and rational arguments against God. Mr. Chopra once again maintains excellent continuity by not supporting his claims with any sort of scientific evidence. How can he say that God is in a different reality? What makes him think God isn't in the same reality that we are in? How does he know there is a virtual reality? These so-called "realities" seem very fabricated to me. They are a clever way of escaping arguments against God, if you put God outside of this world then you can't apply any arguments from our reality to his, according to Chopra. I do not buy this, and feel sorry for anyone who does. I am impressed though. That is a clever trick, and nothing more than a trick. Mr. Chopra seems to be exhibiting "wishful thinking" here. He acknowledges that the mind is in search of God and needs God (with scientifc evidence), I believe Chopra's mind is just like all other minds and wants to justify God and find God, so he will by all means attempt to do that. He wishes for there to be a God, and so there will be. He can change his reality as he pleases. This sort of wishful thinking is dangerous when explaning or proving a point because it makes Mr. Chopra incredibly biased and unreliable.   While reading this book in its early pages I was almost assured that Mr. Chopra was speaking of God in a purely metaphorical sense, but I later found (much to my disappointment) that he was speaking of God in a very real and literal sense. Many will claim that Chopra uses "science" and "quantum physics" to explain God and how we can reach him, but that is a misconception and perversion of the truth. Mr. Chopra does indeed make clever points using theories and stories involving quantum physics, but they do not relate directly to the existence of God, or our ability to reach him. They seem to just be random tidbits Chopra throws in so he can say he proved God and our ability to reach him with "science." It is an absolute mockery.   I did find Mr. Chopra's ending chapters on the paranormal (telepathy, esp, clairvoyance, synchronicity) to be interesting, but once again not supported by anything and pure wishful thinking. Mr. Chopra just plays the God card everytime he is faced with a dilemma that is unexplainable or difficult to understand. The God card in this case is more like a Joker, it serves no purpose and is just a laugh.   Mr. Chopra does have good stories to tell, but they serve no relevance to God or finding him. His writing is not bad, but it is also not very good. I find Mr. Chopra to be a very weak thinker who ignores all rational arguments and ways of logic and reason to further exonerate his wishful thinking and enforce the idea of God in his reality. If you are interesting in a book relating Science and Spirituality I would recommend Amit Goswami's "The Self-Aware Universe". I do not recommend this book at all, especially to other skeptics. Mr. Chopra not only seems to have a rather negative and close minded view of skeptics but he completely shuts them out and addresses them in a rude manner.  I have kept an open mind in reading this book, but Mr. Chopra has not, in fact he hasn't shown much evidence of an intelligent "mind" at all.   This book receives two stars just for effort and a few interesting tidbits. 
 Bought this because Logitech has a great reputation with other products. I used this for a short period due to it being uncomfortable and I never found the battery life to be long enough. I actually went back to a Jabra wired unit until recently, when I purchased a Samsung bluetooth headset that is comfortable, has good battery life, and the sound is better. I guess I prefer the in-ear style 
 This book is terrible.  RaH takes a perfectly good murder mystery and turns in into...well, I don't quite know what.  Halfway through the book, it seems as though he had set it down for several years, came back to it to finish it off, but had nothing but nonsense on the brain.  I've seen authors pull an ending out of their hat before, but this book absolutely takes the cake.  It's not even my book and I threw it in the trash so it won't waste another person's time ever again 
 Nancy Heche is a very needy woman, as self-described in her book.  In her isolated little evangelical "Come to Jesus" world she knows nothing of organizations such as PFLAG [Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays].  PFLAG is a national organization with local chapters and has been around since the 1970s with a significant membership.  I know, for instance, that PFLAG has numerous chapters in Nancy's own Greater Chicago area.    Nancy's book takes a particular evangelical view of gays and lesbians.  It is clear that she knows little of the contemporary scholarship about sexual orientation.  Sexual orientation was removed as a dysfunctional category by psychologists during the 1970s.  You wouldn't know that from her book.  Progressive evangelials such as Hope College professor and psychologist David Meyers support marriage equality for same-sex couples and he offers a much more informed and helpful book about gays and lesbians in his volume titled What God Has Joined Together.    Nancy's book cover quotes come from reparative therapy organizations such as Exodus.  These sorts of James Dobson efforts are shameful and not effective.  Nancy even describes on page 37 of her book how having a "bum" for a father can create a classic model to turn the son into a homosexual.  Nancy is obviously stuck in some pre-1950s world.  Her views and book are all the sadder as she claims to be a therapist.  
 I found this to be weak. covers are feeble at best. a sign of that current time in music histor 
 As a baseball fan and photography buff, I liked the photos in this book.  But once you look through it, you'll just sit it on the shelf and be done with it.  And that's not something I'm happy with considering the cost of this book 
 WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT!!!!  The twist is that the "real" music isn't on here...  This CD is what I would expect if it said live accoustic version.  To even compare itself to the greatest hits it should have the hits on there. There is no ROCK 
 I do not care for this book at all.  I didn't find any of the tips and shortcuts to be for anything I use after effects for (special effects).   I don't have an answer as to what book I will purchase next, but save a tree and pass this one by 
 Ah, true Love.  Dinner by candlelight.  Holding hands in the moonlight.  Snapping a new clip on your Glock while your significant other sprays you with semi-automatic love missiles.  I appreciate a dark comedy as much as the next curmudgeon, yet MR. & MRS. SMITH annoys more than it entertains.  True, there is a predictable plot about a beautiful couple stuck in a rut--a couple who, unbeknownst to one another, are professional assassins (just try to stop that suspension of disbelief train).  Add to that the erotic chemistry between Brad and Angelina; my eyebrows are still singed after watching them.  But all the sexiness and over-the-top, lamebrained action fail to overcome the annoyance of Pitt's detached smirk and Jolie's constant flirtation with wackiness.  As the fighting (boy, is there fighting) escalates, I was suddenly asking myself, "Wouldn't it be great if they popped each other off?"  Maybe in the sequel.  While we're at it, would someone please feed Angelina a steak, mashed potatos. . .something?  Nothing wrong with being slim 'n trim, but come on, lose the East Africa look.  In the long run, MR. & MRS. SMITH's biggest problem was the fact Vince Vaughn didn't appear enough.  At least he gets paid to be annoying. --D. Mikel 
 Like Hayek's Road to Serfdom, this book was written during the Secon World War when Keynes was busy crafting the post war peace. It is infused with the 1930s' corporatist ideas and tends to favour the Communist version more than the Nazi/Fascist version. Keynes is indisputably the 2oth century's most important economist but why does Schumpeter and his creative destruction occupy position #2? I put it down to the same reason as Marx' Theory of Alienation gained such sway. As there was little else to salvage from Marx' writings, they hit on that to make him apear relevant. Marx was a dangerous idiot and the fact that Schumeter heaps measured praise on him suggests that Schumpeter should also join him in the intellectual trash can of history. I see little relevant in his work which I feel has gained prominence simply because economics has lost its intellectual direction. Unlike Gary Becker and other recipients of the Nobel Prize, Schumpeter tackles big issues. But the big issues shrug him off. Nothing here to ponder over 
 This band is getting alot of critical acclaim right now, but I'm just not feeling it. The single "Wolf like me" is the only song that stands out to me on the whole album. It is a great song, but everything else is just blah. I think the band could use a different singer, the guy they got doesn't sing very well or very "soulful". The music is good, very original and the only reason I haven't sold the cd yet. I really think ppl need to hear this one for themselves before they buy. Don't be fooled by these 5 star reviews. Just listen to the cd before you buy it. That's my advice 
 This was less of a biography then an extended Rolling Stone record review.  The only thing Dave Marsh likes better than Springsteen is Dave Marsh.  If you want to read the author repeat his interpretation of the lyrics for hundreds of pages and harp on a couple of his own simple-minded themes over and over then this is the book for you.  I found this book almost unbearable to finish even though I am a big Springsteen fan 
 I am so dissapointed in this CD. I bought it because I have "Blow By Blow" and "Jeff Beck with the Jan Hammer Group" and I love those CDs. This crap sounds like somebody that heard those recordings, practiced for one week and tried to do an imitation of them. I don't like one cut on the entire CD. I only gave it one star because I couldn't find a way to give it less. 
 I've read every one of Iris Johansen's "suspense" novels and have loved most of them.  The last couple though have been so painful to get through. This one however, I don't think I can even finish.  I read where someone called these characters "cardboard," and I couldn't agree more.  The female heroine randomly throws in curse words in a cheap attempt to create tension between herself and the supposed male protagonist.  Whereas in the Eve Duncan Books and the Wind Dancer books we are drawn into the story and come to care for the characters, it is patently obvious what will happen with each of these characters - makes me think of a writing 101 class.  "Now this should happen here, and this here, and this here and boom, climax, happily every after."    I hope that Iris can get her groove back and begin writing novels worth my time.  
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 I read the other reviews praising this book and have to assume that I was not in the right space to appreciate this book when I read it. This was the most boring piece of literature ever written. I know it was a period piece/coming of age story etc., but pages upon pages of people picking cotton, talking about cotton, and talking about picking cotton...zzzzzz....it took me forever to finish because I kept passing out and having nightmares of- yep, cotton 
 Walt Whitman's life's work is his "Leaves of Grass", enlarged over the years with additional poems.  Regarded as America's poet, Whitman wrote in the 1840s through the 1880s, encompassing both the "Manifest Destiny" ideology of the pre-war, through the Reconstruction period of US History.    The poems are diverse and upbeat.  The language, for the most part, is clear and easy.  Nevertheless, like most poetry today, the poems are so little different from prose, except in the presentation into lines.  Very few poetic devises are used.  One may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry.  But, in comparison to rhyhming verse by Longfellow, Frost, Byron, Browning, or Shakespeare, current poetry appears meaningless.    Although a classic, "Leaves of Grass" offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology.  None of his poems are memorable.  Not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature.  I give two stars to the work, simply because I must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation.  Whitman is considered important enough to be the major poet in the movie, "Dead Poet's Society"; so, the reputation of the work must be quite impressive, though it beats me how that is 
 As A high school teacher by day and a college professor by night, I find it quite funny that the cover of this book is intended to depict a "rebel teenager" when infact the boy pictured looks more "normal" than almost any teenager I know.  Get a grip folks.  Teenagers are teenagers, let them do as they please, they will learn by thier own experiences not by force-fed scripture.   
 I agree with what Elain, another reviewer, writes below. Told through a series of letters, the novel spans Bess' life. I found this tedious and the writing unnatural, written for the readers of the novel and not for the readers of the actual letters. Bess meanders through her life, a goody-two-shoes, writing smarmy virtuous thoughts while manipulating those around her- the only element of the story that was interesting. elain wrote:   Despite rave reviews, I thought Elizabeth Forsythe Hailey's A Woman of Independent Means was a weak story. For one thing, the life of the protagonist Bess was only explored through her correspondence over the years. It is impossible to reveal a whole life through letters only. There are other nuances to a character that cannot possibly be revealed through letters; those are only what Bess chooses to write about. It's true that a life through letters gives the novel character, but also it does not expose as much as an omnicient narrator would. Also, it seems that Hailey adds dimension to her novel by introducing a string of tragedies. It is very uncommon that Bess's husband and son die within her lifetime, her house burns down, her daughter is struck by a car and later befriends a count, etc. Such events were constantly inserted into the story until it became unrealistic and maudlin. It may be true that Bess lives a life scarred by tragic events, but these happenings are so plentiful it is almost fantastical. To sum it all up, if you're interested in exploring the life of a very colorful lady, read this. But if you're looking for a novel that will leave you awed, you'd better head back to the bookshelf 
 Each time you replace the battery you have to reload all of your data.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 This book was not helpful to me, in fact, it was a little upsetting.  It reminded me, with the dialogue format, of some of the "channeling" books (like Seth or the Course on Miracles), but without even the substance of those books.    Rather, the authors seemed to concentrate on people's childhood troubles, just as a psychoanalyst would, regressing them so as to uncover the beginnings of their psychological problems.    This, to me, is not a useful procedure, but obviously, some people are helped by it.  For those who cannot afford psychotherapy, maybe this little book is a fair substitute.    I personally would need something a little more substantial and down-to-earth.  Diximus 
 The writer of this book is so much in love with himself and it is so much of a theme that I simply had to put the book down.  You can find what you need elsewhere if you cant bear to listen to Bob Glover praise himself, thats what I did 
 What more would you expect from a revisionist historian whose books read like novels, with no researches yet dressing up all half baked hypotheses as proven theses. Treat this book as some infantile rantings from an inadequate mind 
 This book proved to be disappointing. The author adores Kay Francis (perhaps too much), but he has no grasp of film history or the times in which she lived. The book is only about the actress and provides no details on what else was happening in Hollywood or the world. The illustrations are poor quality and also disappointing. It seems a rush job with little perspective or care for the final product 
 I wasn't very impressed with this book.  The games for infants suggested are very obvious, common sense ideas, like picking your baby up and flying her in airplane style.  I don't think anyone who has an imagination will  get much new out of this book.  Also, it gives you song lyrics without the  tunes/music, which isn't very helpful.  While there are some good ideas,  they are too few to make this book very worthwhile 
 why ? because it has good sound dts hd 5.1 master lossless audio the picture quality will not blow you away it just seams flat and washed out and this just isnt a good movie i like tim burton and mark wahlberg but this movie was done wright the first tim 
 CUBE (the original) is fantastic, but CUBE 2: HYPERCUBE just doesn't measure up at all. Dont bother with this one, just watch the original classic instead for a good horror/sci-fi thriller... 
 For all those who are interested in reading this book (after reading the glowing tributes paid to it by ignorant and biased christians) please note that the author is a proven and blatant LIAR. If you are truly in search of truth and not simply looking to strengthen what you want to believe( as must be the case with most of the people writing here) then you owe it to yourself to at least know about this man more before taking his word for the truth. Read his book but please visit http://www.ahmed-deedat.co.za/homepage.asp to purchase a video of a stunning debate that took place between dr anis and sheikh ahmed deedat (a famous muslim sholar)as a companion peace to this book. Believe me you will learn a lot more that way...that is if you really are in search of TRUTH 
 This isn't one story, but seven. One for every one of the papa mouse's sons as they lay in bed. They are but a few pages, and most all of them aren't very good. This book is best for those ages 2 or 3, through 8 or so 
 This book is really only for a man who is married with 2.3 kids a good job and goes to Christian that goes to church every Sunday.  It is not for someone who is single, not Christian and has no kids.  In one of the last chapters is says the best help comes from your employer, your wife, your kids, your church and your friends.  What if you are self-employed who is going to help?  What if you have no wife? No kids? No church? No friends to confide in?  I find it hard to believe that the author has a Ph.D. and is President of a mid-life crisis centre and still has such a narrow view on society and on how people live today.   Don't get me wrong this book is not all that bad, it did help to see that there are other men going through the same thing as me.  Just be forewarned that one of the PhD's mentioned above is in theology and that the author is a pastor even though he says this book is for Christians and unbelievers that there is a bible passage at the end of every chapter.  ....Hmmm what if your Jewish, does that make you a unbeliever 
 My desktop CD-ROM refused to recognize that the CD was in the tray. It did recognize other CDs. My desktop is a HP Pavilion 2000 with Windows XP HomeVersion. My laptop did accept the CD so I know that it is not the CD. I purchased the product for use on my desktop, not the laptop. I would appreciate instructions on fixing the problem 
 I dont think this CD is all that because I only liked 1 song, track 3, the rest of them are too deep for me, I'm an old school techno lover, so I will say if you like new age Techno, then you will love this CD!!! 
 Obviously both and Finnegan proves it. Joyce spent seventeen years on this book, which can be properly read and understood by only one person - James Joyce, who passed away in 1941.  Now if you'd like to devote yourself - and perhaps your life - to achieving an understanding of Finnegans Wake, you are certainly free to do so.  And, having once attempted  to achieve such understanding myself, I can assure you that some of your time will be well spent.  But the facts are as follows:  1. Joyce was fluent in a number of European languages and had a nodding acquaintance with many more.  2. From this knowledge he fashioned a special vocabulary of multilingual blends and puns which he used, with ordinary English syntax, to create the solipsistic discourse of Finnegans Wake. It is, in effect, a private language.  3. Since most of his vocabulary is drawn from, and puns on, the languages Joyce was familiar with, the only way one can begin to understand what's happening is to be as familiar with them as James Joyce.   4. The entire book is said to narrate the mostly incoherent nighttime dream of its antihero, "HCE."  This was Joyce's way of "getting at" (whatever that means here) some sort of unconscious European cultural mind - as apprehended and imagined by James Joyce, of course.  5. Finnegans Wake is thus basically incomprehensible. The explications in Campbell & Robinson's Skeleton Key, while well informed, are, as the authors admit (though not in these words) the only sense they could make of it with the assistance of a shelf full of reference books. By getting in on the ground floor, C & W effectively dared anyone to disagree.  Which would, of course, require another pair of literature Ph.D.'s with another shelf of reference books. There can be more than one interpretation of Finnegans Wake, including a belief in the profitlessness of interpretation.   6. Once in a while Joyce can still write a melodious sentence that is close enough to English to carry some meaning. As readers of Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist, and Ulysses are aware, Joyce was at one time a master of poetic English prose. Searching for the poetic moments, and those alone, makes for a pleasant diversion, and will undoubtedly reward the extremely well read and knowledgable.  If you're still intrigued, your best bet is to find a copy of the drastically abridged edition with commentary that Anthony Burgess put out forty years ago.  Burgess loved Finnegans Wake in the Campbell-Robinson interpretation, and he supplies enough editorial matter to aid you in your innocent quest to believe in Finnegans' greatness. The book may be  useful to some as a kind of Rorschach/I Ching for your own creativity: "How many puns and themes can *I* find?"  This book allegedly turned Derrida into a Deconstructionist. I believe it. Students of OCD and associated disorders should take a look at the entire Finagin Fannomenikonn, if you know what I mean.  
 If you are looking for a book on how to live on a limited income, this is not your book.  Nina Wildorf seems to live in a world that doesn't involve student loans, car payments, or the idea of a savings account.  Her rule of thimb for budgeting is 20% of your income towards clothes.  This is not fical responsibility.   And only wash your jeans every 6 months so that they don't fade?  Really?  Am I the only one who thinks this is odd?  On the other hand, she does have some cute ideas for decorating on the cheap--I am glad to see that someone besides me goes dumpster diving! 
 As a resident of the author's city, I was looking forward to reading her much anticipated release.  Unfortunately though, I was sorely disappointed.  In fact, the reviewer who awarded A Taco Testimony two stars was generous.  Unlike the 2-star reviewer though, I stuck with it, reading page after dull page, hoping it would improve (but never does), much like a monotonous "Saturday Night Live" skit that doesn't know when to end.    Without semblance of structure, she haphazardly places poems, recipes, and anecdotes at random, repeating herself ad nauseam utilizing the sophomoric "Taco is life" metaphor.  Moreover, her inchoate thoughts lack depth and detail.  Riddled with inconsistencies and contradictions, full of fluff and devoid of content, her style resembles that of a grade-groveling high school sycophant, trying to con her audience with melodrama and malaise, but inevitably saying nothing of note.   In her weak attempt to explain "Culture", for example, she affirms that it is lack of cultural awareness that results in our inability to know and respect others which ultimately causes violence in the world.  Here, I agree.  Yet her very example epitomizes HER ignorance of culture.  With awkward phrasing she states, "A man who lives here but is not from here is trying to sue the city to get the three crosses, the symbol of our town, removed from all public displays."  Not only does she promote divisiveness by insinuating that he is an outsider, despite claims throughout her book that we are all one people, she fails to acknowledge that the crosses of Calvary are recognized worldwide as the autograph of Christianity - that the triumvirate could represent centuries of violence perpetrated against non-believers.  By failing to recognize the identities of non-adherents of Christianity, she obliterates them from the landscape, engaging in her own brand of cultural imperialism.  Thus, the crosses are not merely the symbol of our town, the simplistic notion that the author would like us to believe.     Perhaps the author is better suited to writing fiction.  I can only hope her tacos are better than her book. 
 We bought this humidifier as the low-cost alternative when our kids were sick this week.  It's horrible!  We're returning it today!  When this unit is running, it leaks water between the reservoir and motor units.  Overnight it leaked enough water to completely saturate a folded up large bath towel I placed under it!  Two days later & the towel is still wet!  Additionally, the unit is noisy, spits out water droplets with the mist, and is very difficult to clean (oddly shaped water reservoir makes it impossible to completely empty the unit).  If you need a humidifier, buy a different product 
 The high reviews for this album surprise me, as a lot of what is on this CD is pop music with subtle celtic undertones. Now, not all of it is poorly done, as there are a few nice songs. However, on whole, this is nothing to rave about.  A FAR better choice (though somewhat subdued) is Celtic Voices: Women of Song. (I understand some people don't like this review, but I would LOVE to know how "You Raise Me Up" is in anyway celtic? 
 My son receive this toy for christmas. On the first attempt to charge the battery it melted down, smoking and sizzling. A call to Estes had new battery & charger on the way. After first installing the new battery, noticed the rudder was sticking. After cutting part of the fuselage away i thought i had it moving freely. On the second turn of the first flight though it stuck in a full left turn and that was the last we saw of it! Thats EXPENSIVE entertainment. I'll be calling Estes on Monday. If looking for a plane, check out the park flyers on Tower Hobbies. 
 Listened to the audiobook version of this James Patterson novel in the car -- simply because my spouse bought it off a remainder table cheap and I figured we should get our money's worth.  Twenty minutes into it I wanted to chuck the first tape out the window the writing (and the audiobook narration) was so overwrought.  But then I listened longer as I realized how amusing the bad writing was.  A wonderful text here for a creative writing class:  how to write junk fiction that sells but which you'd never want to put your name on.  Sad that someone can write as poorly as Patterson and sell oh so many books 
 This is a story book!  I usually give books the benefit of the doubt but this book flat out sux.  All this guy talks about is how he is some hot shot sports agent and the lessons he supposedly learned through the years.  Let me tell you something, this book got old after the 2nd chapter.  Every F'in paragraph has to do with one of his golf clients and bla bla bla.  Its ridiculous.  The title is true, they dont teach this at Harvard because they're stories of an individuals life which completely put me to sleep.  But im not going to leave without giving some positives, like saying you should check out Automatic millionaire and the 12 critical factors books.  Those are worth reading.  Peace in the middle east 
 I only read "Loving," but let me tell you, that book is the worst.  Every fundamental rule of writing is broken is this "book." Yuck! I mean, the last line of the book is really "and they lived happily ever after." Puh-leeze 
 This movie is more a curiosity than a "chef d'oeuvre" (French for masterpiece) of erotism. It hasn't aged very well either... It may have been a hit then, because it was one of the first of its kind - although I am not sure.   Coming from my fellow French men, I was expecting a more sensual and passionate love story rather this 2 hours of voyeurism and sadomasochism. I found the movie rather boring, expect maybe for a few scenes. The total exploitation of a young woman for sex and pleasure will be very disturbing to some. 
 I stumbled across this CD when I was looking for an Enya-like artist and subsequently bought this CD solely based on other reviews. What a mistake.  The vocal aren't ethereal and the instrumentals are grating.  The worst part is the extensive use of echo and reverb.  I don't know who mixed this album or who approved its use but I am sure they were stoned out of their mind at the time.  If I had to describe it, I would say it is a "punk" version of an Enya wannabe or some other untalented artist, mastered by some guy who passed out on the effects console.  I can't recommend it to anyone, unless maybe you sniff paint fumes for a living. 
 "Get Used to It" and "We won't stop" are TBNH releases that share the same category: boring music. Where's the energy? Where's the passion and love? Where's the catchy music? How I miss TBNH from Shelter and Brother & Sister!! 
 I found the book to be extremely wordy.  As I read the book, I found myself having to remind myself what the chapter (or topic) was suppose to be covering.  Many of the statements in the book are common sense and points are repeated over and over through-out the text. The books is loaded with long list consisting of from 4-12 items.  The list appear to be attempts by the authors to include every possible idea they could think of.  My Professor used the questions from the test bank and many of the answers were buried in the readings.   	The cases studies were interesting, and the information on the website helps with the case analysis.  Although after reading one of the chapters, any reading was interesting.  Reading this book became a chore.  If the book is required for class, start reading now because the way the book is written will make you procrastinate 
 I'am unable to get this message to anyone.  This is the second book I orderd and both books are bad.  This one starting on disc #4 all is bad. I sent back the customer card and explained my displeasure but no one has contacted me.  I had the same problem on Vanishing Point, the cd left will not play on my player.  I will not order another book from You. Once I can see this happen, but twice is unacceptable 
 This album was released in 1999. And now, seven years later, this album does not even matter. Britney Spears is remembered not for her musical talent but for her inability to parent a child. Great music lasts dozens of years for its complexity, innovation, creativity, and ability to transcend cultures and generations. Great music stirs something inside the listener, and matters to the person who created it. Britney Spears and the ridiculous product that her record companies have created is none of these things. It saddens me to see the number of copies an album such as this sells originally. And yet, the great albums of all times sell thousands of copies years - decades, even - after their release. Music like this, Britney Spears and her peers, disappears into the folds of time. It does not matter. 
 I am a huge fan of Elvis Costello and ran to the shop as soon as I read the great reviews of this album, what a mistake!!!   Very few of the arrangements offer an improvement over the original version. The cardboard cut salsa montuno of 'Clubland' sounds as classy and natural as a plastic flamingo and the wonderful Ska sound of 'Watching the Detectives' is lost in a jazz arrangement that doesn't offer much to the melody.  Elvis' voice is not suited the long sustained notes of 'Almost Blue' and most of the songs. It worked well on his 'Juliet Letters' album because the Brodsky Quartet played for his style but with the clean and crisp sound of the Metropole Orkest it is just painful.  For me,'Hora Decubitus' is the only song worth listening from this musical jumble 
 I can't get it to stick! I might be able to get one or two of the cups to hold, but as soon as I put toys in it, it falls 
 this book is retared...i would never let no one else read this it really that bad...i cry it was so bad...every time i look at it makes me sneeze...now that bad...i just sneeze i look at it...it give laTisha ga 
 If you like shallow arguements and can't think yourself out of a paper bag, this is a must read.  Bill use hate speach that will awe the stupid and make the intelligent cry out in frustration.  Remember unlike the government, Bill knows what is best for us....mainly buying his cheap products and buying these third grade readers 
 This is an excellent textbook.....if you already have a PhD. in Fluid  Mechanics.  As a textbook for an undergraduate course though, it is useless  except possibly for using as a very large paper weight.  The text  completely lacks any useful examples.  Most are far too simplistic to be of  any use in solving the end of the chapter problems.  As far as the writing  style is concerned, the author fails to put items in a distinct clearly  stated way.  The text also lacks proper end of the chapter reviews of the  material, which should highlight the important concepts and equations for  quick reference.  The back of the text has solutions, but only to certain  problems and, as usual, in McGraw-Hill texts, only to the most basic and  simplistic questions.  In essence this text is a poor example to be used  for teaching the classs, unless of course the instructor makes the solution  manual available, in which case the student may have an outside chance of  understanding the course concepts.  I really I wish I had been like my  friends...they photocopied the necessary chapters for our course and saved  themselves about $80 
 This book needs a serious updating.  When I did find something that interested me, the chances were very good that the web links to their site were old and not working.  Further searches for the company usually lead no where.  Wouldn't recommend 
 I may be alone on this boat, but my thoughts on this book are more on the negative side than positive. Although the story presented traits of originality, human flaw and truth, I couldn't help but think it was all too predictable. One could imagine what would happen from the first mention of an experimentation that would increase a person's IQ incredibly. Like that saying, "What goes up must come down." right? I found Charlie's efforts of finding an answer to what was going to happen to him next were stretched and unrealistic.  All in all, ignoring the predictability, this a phenomenal example of realization, "coming of age", and loss of innocence. Charlie's yearning for intellect slowly turns into yearning for emotional maturity as his IQ raises. He notices that with his new intellect, people started treating him differently. He realizes that the world wasn't as nice and comforting as he thought it was  before

 You know how when a regular pick hits your strings, you can hear the sound of it hitting the string, then after it releases and the string reverberates you hear a note?  Well imagine hearing 15 picks hit the string before the string produces music.  And the 15 picks are made of coiled wire.    I can't imagine a worse sound or feeling.    
 By the cover you would never know it is a ( VERY Poor) piece of fiction, written as if an adolescent was given a high school assignment and was just passed an article about Royal Rife the day before. I'd say someone owes me 10 bucks, but that old adage of a fool and his money soon being parted,  keeps running through my mind. 
 I, like many others, wanted to like this CD, but was really disappointed. A lot of work obviously went into the creation of this. They have an interesting sound at first that quickly gets predictable.  I thought the first song was decent enough, but after that the CD spirals downward fast. The main problem, as many reviewers have noted, is the singers voice, which is often hard to hear. But if I had a voice like his, I'd probably want it towards the back of the sound mix.   The most original thing about this CD was the liner notes/lyrics, which are presented in the form of a funeral program. Get it? Cool, huh? 
 this in an uninspired telling of a transparent political fable.  Good enough to watch once 
 Same exercises, even the same pictures, and of course, the same cocky attitude. I dunno, maybe a video would be better, but when I see "JP" sitting on a chair flexing his biceps, I don't get all that inspired. The book starts out just like "Pushing Yourself to Power" and has pages and pages of stories about Charles Atlas, Herschel Walker, et al, and how all they did was push ups, chin ups, squats, and sit ups and they became Greek gods. Then it moves on to  nutrition (oh yeah, that's an exact science), then to page after page of cocky attitude and re-hashed pictures of "JP" and Wendy flexing and posing. I was very dissapointed in this book 
 This is a little far fetched but bare with, a London born Actress transplants herself to Los Angeles, after landing on a Soap...and then writes about a London born Actress being transplanted  to Los Angeles, after landing on a Soap. Got it? Personally this psuedo semiautobiographical novel about Hughes life (or lack there of) is testament that some actors should remain just that! The cynical nature in which her character sees Los Angles and the people surrounding her is way too close to accurate for this to be classified as true "fiction" and the parallels between her main "villain" Meredith Contini and a certain fabulous legendary New York Based All My Children icon is so blatant it borders on insulting. Her work on General Hospital was good, Her work on All My Children was tolerable, at best, but her work as a writer makes me ashamed to admit Finola Hughes is a fellow Brit. 
 I read this book because it says it was a best seller, and the author is supposed to be one of the best at suspense.  With those expectations I was disappointed.  The author relies on gimmicks - like ultra short chapters to make it seem like you're reading faster.  Each chapter is 1 or 2 pages with at least one blank page between, so what looks like a 400 page books is really only a 250 page short novel.  One chapter is literally a cliff-hanger.  The plot's sort of a rehash of H.G. Wells' Island Of Dr. Moreau, borrowing a bit from X-Men comic books.  The mutants are all children who can fly, and they're severely persecuted by their keepers, so perhaps what makes the book appealing to other readers is the suspense derived from the endangered children angle, another cheap gimmick.    The villains are all one-dimensional stereotypes, blindly abandoning all their principles and humanity to profit off the children.  I could point out numerous flaws in style as well - but that's not the point; you could find flaws in better books too.  The point is the book is overrated for hack writing of less quality than many old pulp magazines I've read.  Even the love scenes are corny and seem like one of those cheap romance novels ("My arms were high and tight around his neck.  He pulled me against him and I felt him, all of him, against my thigh . . ."). The author also doesn't seem to understand the geography & terrain of the area he's writing about (for example, a small Sony TV won't receive Denver channels in Gunnison National Forrest, certainly not well enough to recognize faces in long shots as the author describes), and has some weird ideas of horror ("Chain link fence and concertina wire and guard dogs in the middle of the woods were scary enough, but to see the words "U.S. Government" attached to "Trespassers Will Be Shot" made me ill.").  Much more like this is topped off with a liberal dose of hypocrisy:  "The arrogance and amorality of the scientists working here affronted everything I believed in.  I wanted to find one of 'them' and strangle the person with my bare hands."   This is the last time I'll buy a book because it says "best seller."  If you want to read a well-written sci-fi suspense novel in which the protagonist is a child prodigy, I recommend The Fourth R by George O. Smith (ISBN 1557429332 - Also known as The Brain Machine, ISBN 0824014308) 
 Well, three German punks kidnap a rich guy (it doesn't really matter why).  Most of the dialogue consists of a leftist rhetoric that hasn't been heard since the 1960s.  There are lots of gloomy shots of the various characters brooding with vague looks on their faces.  Two of the kidnappers are male, one is female.  Of course there's a love triangle.  They drink quite a bit and smoke some pot.  Eventually they decide to let the guy go since they aren't the killing types.  There's a silly little twist at the end that is good for a laugh.   Find something else to do with your two hours, unless you want to practice listening to German. 
 The 2 stars is the average I give to all the fable books written by Patrick.   The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: 5 stars  Obviously, it is the best one. (you can see it from the sales record in Amazon). It was the first Patrick's book I read. I have finished reading the whole book in one setting and couldn't wait and jump to look for his other books. The book has a reasonable length, setting up a bit simplified, but not over-simplified, and still reasonable fable-like setting to illustrate all important team dysfunctions and team building skills. The whole book is tight and coherent and an easy but enlightening read. Highly recommended!    Death by Meeting: A Leadership Fable 4 stars  It is a good one but not as great as the five team dysfunctions. A very good explanation of all kinds of meetings and how to use each of them. I recommend you buy one, read it and keep it as a reference. One drawback is the author tried to spicy up the book so one of the main characters will occassionally scream out some rude comments if he didn't take his pills. I never work with such an unusual person and I prefer less dramatic in a management fable. (not something like in "Desperate Housewife", the neighbor besides you was a serial killer and the housewife across the street did her gardener and used her Chinese maid to bear her baby.)   I should have stopped here and never rush to read his other books..    The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive: 2 stars  This is the one made me begin to feel betrayed. If the five dysfunctions have been crafted for months, this one seems to be done within weeks. The fable setting needs more polishing works. Although the four obsessions have been presented with reasonable clariy, reading this book makes you feel that the author thinks you are an idiot. Scenarios like how the VP HR plots to damage the trust seem to be more suitable for a toddler fable rather than something for teenagers, not mentioning for managers. The rough plot affects the whole four points--though four very good points. I will recommend you to skim the whole book in less than 20 minutes by standing in a bookstore.    Five temptations of CEO 1 star?  It is the one makes me begin to feel angry. Again, if the five dysfunctions have been crafted for months, this one seems to be done within hours. The major story (95% of the book) happened in a dark train, where a poor CEO was taught about these five temptations by some ghost-like old men, who turned out later to be the previous CEOs in the SAME company! Again the five temptations are all great and worthwhile points. It is the plot that made me sick. If you have a chance, skim the whole book in less than FIVE minutes.   Silos, Politics and Turf Wars NEGATIVE 1 star  The worst one. Negative 1 star is because it wasted my time. I thought the five temptation one was the worst until I read this one. Patrick spends most of the book to illustrate the silo problems rather than provide any solution. And he even spends many pages about the main character's struggle in balancing his work and his wife's pregnancy, which I believe, should belong to another fable about personal life balance, given how many pages the author devoted to this. From other fables, more or less, you can at least learn something. But not from this one. Forget it!  
 I found this book to be full of ramblings and fluff.  Whatever somehow resembles advice or technique is common sense and useless for those with serious conflict. While I feel that conflict takes two,  I don't particularly think it's fair to place all responsibility & work on one person ( usually the victim, or nice person). How about a book on how to not be an   A-hole? A much better book is EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL  by Susan Foward.  E.M. offers true whys and what-you-can-do-about-it that this book suggests, but is somehow disguised as ramblings.   Very Disappointed! 
 Dr. Freeman's justly esteemed "Lee's Lieutenants" -- a THREE VOLUME work -- still stands (despite the discovery of materials unavailable to Dr. Freeman when he first wrote in the 1930s and 40s) as the baseline for any study of the Army of Northern Virginia.  The cheap attempt by a modern publisher to squeeze a few cents out of the franchise, offered here, throws out TWO of every THREE words Dr. Freeman wrote to allow for a one-volume "abridgement" for those presumably too intimidated by the thought of reading three entire books.    The three-volume work, as Dr. Freeman wrote it, was reprinted fairly recently.  If that is no longer available on Amazon, any decent sized used book store will have it in stock.    WHATEVER you do, avoid this butchered, one volume version like the plague 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck.   Re: J Czecholinski  Hey J, you couldn't be more wrong! Your review is as flawed as Lahaye and Jenkin's unbiblical writing. First, I am a Christian who does believe that Jesus is coming back, but I do not believe He is coming back in a secret, silent rapture that the LEFT BEHIND series is making millions of Christians believe. I believe in the verse you used (to try and prove me wrong), which is 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 : 'For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout,with the call of the archangel,and with the trumpet call of God. First,all the Christians who have died will rise from the graves.Then,together with them,we who are still alive and remain on the earth will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and remain with Him forever.' When Jesus comes back, we will know it. Keys words being COMMANDING SHOUT and TRUMPET CALL OF GOD. We're not going to be zapped up while others are standing around for 7 years. In the Bible, 7 years refers to completeness or totality, which is time until Jesus comes back for good. Lahaye and Jenkins are taking figurative language from John's revelation and making them literal and adding their own spin to sell books and make movies. This adding to Scripture and polluting the word of God makes me think of Galatians 1:6-9 which says: "I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel--which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned! As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned!" This is what Lahaye and Jenkins are doing: perverting the gospel with their own spin. And your "belief" in the anti-Christ is incorrect as well (along with Lahaye and Jenkins). Check out these verses: 1st John 2:22 "Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son." or 1st John 4:3 "...but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world." Key words their being EVEN NOW IS ALREADY IN THE WORLD. This is referring to SATAN who was in the world in John's day and still in the world. The Bible says in 1st John 2:18 that many anti-Christs have come and anti-Christ is anyone who is against Christ. There are many people who are persecuting the Church and Christians (as this is the last days that we are living - check out 2nd Timothy 3). Why are we looking for somebody like Nicholae when there are already those who have the spirit of the Anti-Christ? Why are polluting the word of God to try and sell books and movies. Why are we allowing ourselves to be eternally condemned because we are starting to follow this new type of thinking? Do you think that the disciples, when Jesus ascended to heaven, thought that there would be a silent rapture followed by tribulation? No! Finally, you said that 2nd Corinthians 6:2 says: "TODAY is the day of salvation I'm looking SO forward to that day when the Lord will come for me and all born again believers that we won't HAVE to endure the tortures during the Tribulation." What bible version are you looking at. 2nd Corinthians 6:2 clearly states: "For he says, 'In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.' I tell you, now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation." Nothing about Tribulation and nothing about enduring tortures!!! You are just making up Scripture, perverting the GOSPEL! Now verse 4 talks about troubles (lower-case "t"), hardships, distresses, etc. That is happening now, today until Jesus comes back with a commanding shout and trumpet call of God to take us to heaven and those against him into eternal judgement - no 7 year tribulation period!!! Live today like it was your last day, because you could die or Jesus could come back (and believe me, you will know it because until you can show me verses where a silent, secret rapture will take place and there will be those left behind battling for seven years, I will continue to follow the God-breathed word of God and not fluff of Lahaye and Jenkins. "Tribulation" is found once in the bible (Rev 7:14 NIV) and it is with a lower-case "t" and has nothing to do about what the books suggest. "Rapture" never appears as this is a word that hasn't been around that long. So in summary, Jesus is coming back and we will know about it (whether you are a Christian or not). And off the subject, yes, baptism is essential to becoming a Christian and being saved (not praying Jesus into your heart)...it seems that the same people who believe in Lahaye's rapture are usually wrong on that issue as well. Please do yourself a favor. Read the Bible and follow it. If you do that, then you won't be led astray by these false teachings of someone like J. Czecholinski who cannot even get his Scriptures straight!  Follow the teachings of God 
 This book was very disappointing. I would return it, had I kept the receipt. I was perplexed about why she didn't just focus on making a book about her love life. Maybe that would have been more interesting, but she hardly makes her French boyfriend sound the least bit important to her. I am an American young woman, so maybe I don't understand her humor. Most of the time I felt like the French had to put up with her, and her lack of sophistication,than the other way around. Yet another whiny book about someone living in Paris and complaining about it, which I find completely rude, and sort of seems to justify the French people's animosity towars Americans (though the author is more like the Brits) 
 I wish writers who attempt to write "historical" thrillers would take the time to READ a book that was actually written and published in their chosen era.  This is an awfully contemporary 1919.  "Don't blow my cover" one of the cops says at one point in the book.  When Wheeler attempts to write period dialogue he resorts to bad clichés or catch phrases that belong to the 21st century.  Lazy writing, I'd say.  And unimaginative to boot. The book is filled with laughable anachronisms and outright errors (for example: Lady Doyle was an occult -- she was a practitioner of automatic writing and a book was even published about her talks with her "contact"). Wheeler obviously is having fun with all real personalities of the period, but I was getting tired of the overpopulation of real people and how they all seemed to have interchangeable personalities and their contemporary attitudes were increasingly annoying.  It seemed like he couldn't create any fictional characters of his own.  He fails miserably as a novelist.  The book is really screenplay disguised as a novel - plenty of snappy and "hip" dialogue, an overabundance of action sequences, lots and lots of gore and violence.  But a novel?  No. There have been countless books using Doyle and Houdini as detectives of sorts.  "The List of Seven" is far better than this book.  And the novels of Daniel Stashower that feature Houdini and his brother Hardeen are immensely better.  Wheeler really doesn't know much about his subjects but slides in so many references he thinks he does and he thinks he can fool his readers as well.  However, anyone who has read in-depth biographies and/or the letters of these people (Doyle, Lovecraft, and Houdini) knows that these men are much more interesting and colorful than the caricatures to which Wheeler has reduced them 
 My wife wants to have her filling pulled because this idiot says so. Why do I call him an idiot.  Here are two examples. Coral Calcium: he says a goverment agency won't let him publish anything about it--so he refers you to his website where you can find out more if you subscribe!  Hey, Kevy, there are no apriori restraints on the press in the USA. Pigs:  He says you should not eat pork because pigs eat thier own excretement.  He thinks that is disgusting, thus not healthy.  Well pigs and rabbits can eat their own. There may be many reasons not to eat pork, especially in third world countries.  but Kevy sure didn't bother to research them.   Why do research when you can make up a stupid reason.   Given his pork logic I'm surprised he doesn't say not to eat anything organic as the compost used to grow things contains animal excrement 
 I too had this book for a college 19th century art course. Most of the movements were not new to me and I dearly love most art of the period. But for anyone new to it this will be an incredibly boring read, too much bogged down in marxism and political correctness. Eisenman; a self-professed "Marxist-Art Historian" seems unable to speak of any movement without making it into classs warfare or accusing artists of being sexist or rascist, while completely ingnoring the historical context. As with many art history surveys Eisenman also suffers the delusion that there is something inherently wrong with academic art and that the only worthwhile art of the 19th century was made in France 
 i ordered the item saying it was in-stock. but days passed i still havent received the item until i followed it up. i was told the item was in a back order. i think they shouldnt write in-stock if the item is really a back order meaning they dont have it. it delayed the item for 2-3weeks and it was suppose to be a gift. though i can say the item was nice when i got it 
 The plot and its development are extremely weak.  Acting is marginal and special effects are questionable.  What can I say, I love SciFi, have a thing about time travel flicks and enjoy punishing myself with B rated SciFi movies.  If you're looking for quality entertainment, then this is not the choice for you.  If you're a nut about SciFi, go for it Bro 
 John Coltrane was villified most of his creative life for playing at the edge of a world he was helping to redefine. Wynton and the LCJO are in effect the death of creative musicians like Coltrane, or most of the truly creative Jazz scene for that matter. Wynton is establishing himself as "the face of Jazz". A market oriented phenomenon which freezes some of the elements making Jazz without ever capturing the true essence of the music. By telling us (and make no mistake, these guys do...): "this is what Jazz is" and trying to re-appropriate themselves the music of Jazz giants such as John Coltrane who, if he were alive, would not be given the time of day by these folks, Wynton and his posses are raping what is true and beautiful in this music.  The recording, since I must talk about it, features a set of crafty yet discomboluted arrangements merely mimicking what Coltrane was, mostly empty of content, setting in motions soloists who sound more like "Jazz puppets" than anything remotely close to what Coltrane was striving for (notable exception: Ted Nash !). You do NOT need this record. Wynton and the LCJO does NOT need your money; spend it on musicians who put their life and their art on the edge, the way Coltrane did 
 This novel by A.E.W. Mason is an epic tale about a young soldier named Harry Feversham. After receiving three white feathers of cowardness from his fellow soldiers, and one from Ethne, Harry sets out to redeem himself. The novel is slow to start, and stays dull throughout his ventures. For being a love story during a time of war, the book is lacking romance and battle. There are so many characters in the book that none of them ever seem to be fully developed; not even Harry. Halfway through the book I found myself wondering who three quarters of the characters were and what their significant role was in the novel. I have read the book twice and I still have no clue why Harry was retrieving the letters from the wall and what their importance was to the story. If you chose this book to read at night to put you to sleep, or really like patriotic British war stories, then by all means, this may be the book for you. As far as I'm concerned, the book was extremely hard to follow, the characters had little depth, and there was no action at all (this is supposed to be a story about a soldier). The novel was extremely predictable, and like most love stories, everything ends happily ever after. After Harry's heroic acts in the desert the three soldiers take their feathers back and this also wins Ethne's heart.   
 Of the many O'Reilly books that I have purchased, this is the first one that was really poor. I'd give it -5 stars, but the lowest you allow is 1. The author seemed more interested in being clever and funny, then imparting information.  However, I also have two very large Perl books that are also almost useless, so maybe it's a Perl problem 
 This is a collection of articles written for Petrowski's monthly column in American Scientist magazine. Many are brief biographies of 19th-century engineers; a (very) few look (very) briefly at particular pieces of historical engineering (an article on the Ferris wheel is probably the best); others are ruminations on such hazards of the engineering practice as the stress that keeps them up at night and their failure to be awarded Nobel prizes. These seem quite satisfactory articles for a magazine column but they are slender stuff for a book. And Petroski's tendency to return to the same subjects, pardonable in a monthly column, becomes repetitive when the columns are collected. All but die-hard Petroski fans can skip this on 
 As a student of many books, I can safely say that this offered less information on the subject title of any book I have read. It has made me a little hesitant of new books unless I specifically know the author. Spend your money elsewhere 
 Is this Deaver's worst book? I honestly don't know because I haven't read everything he's written. However, I can emphatically say this is the worst of his books I have read -- and I have read most.  (... 
 Where's Tomas?  Where's Pug, I mean all the cool characters?  Why does this book seem like a fantasy 90210 
 Typical of a Ripley's Beleive It Or Not book, there are no refrences.  It is a collection of cute trivia from the older Ripley's Believe It Or Not books.  Problem is, most of what can be checked, is wrong.  Frank Wells was never on the Titanic nor the other ship disasters claimed.  The section on laws includes myths and jokes that someone believed.  Stories from older Ripley books are re-told with different names.  It even says "Mushrooms are a fruit." (They are actually fungi. 
 I have dyed red hair, a lot of dyed red hair. this product made no noticable difference in the shine of my hair. WIll not purchase again 
 I was disappointed with this book.  I didn't learn anything new from reading this book, which was really disappointing.  For the price, it's just not thorough.  There are many other books on the subject that offer the same advice and are a better value for your money.  If I'd have had the chance to flip through this first I would not have spent the money on this book.  Over-rated and over-priced.  
 the on-the-rock marriage scenes are pathetic, making this already lukewarm and loose thriller become even worse. from the very beginning, this female washington reporter knew what mitch rapp did for a living, yet she continuously whined, intervened, demanded, complained, pried into her husband jobs and duties. what is this? trying to make rapp look more humanly realistic, making him look more like the stereotyped american husband? making us enable to enter rapp's bedroom, wathching 'war of the roses'? come on, this is a thriller, not jackie collins or danielle steele's 'honey, no sex tonight'. get rid of the nagging wife pronto! also, this novel is not up to the standard of a good thriller. a story falling apart in many ways 
 We checked this book out of the library.  My daughter who is almost 6 began flipping through the pages and then came running, screaming, crying with tears saying the book is very scary and she did not want to even look at it, nevermind read it.  I read it myself.  The message is a good one - be yourself and don't worry about what others think, but the things that happen to Camilla are a bit graphic and scary for an impressionable child.  
 In December 2002, I purchased the pet chime and paw & two additional paws.  I was extremely satisfied with them until the past couple of weeks.  In the past couple of weeks 2 paws have stopped working for unknown reasons and repeated emails and phone calls have gone unanswered by Lentek.  They're great, IF THEY WORK 
 As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.  The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.  The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.  There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention.   Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.  If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue 
 When I bought this book, I was already a "pre-trib" guy, and a big fan of the Left Behind series.  I thought this book would help me as a Bible student to have a clear grasp of Biblical eschatology.   After I read this book, I realized that the Bible has absolutely nothing to do with a secret rapture followed by seven years of anti-christ led chaos.  I was amazed at how weak and utterly careless Lahaye is in his exposistion of Scripture.  For instance, his insistance that the 'Day of the Lord' and the 'Day of Christ' must be differant.  One of his main arguments in favor of a secret rapture is that since judgement is not mentioned in John 14:1-3 or 1 Thess.4:16-17, this MUST be a seperate event from the final judgement!   One good thing that came from reading this book is that it led me to consider other interpretations of the end times.  For far more careful study, try "Four Views on the Book of Revelation," by C. Marvin Pate, "The Last Days according to Jesus," by R.C. Sproul, or my favorite, "The Church and the Last Things," by Martyn Lloyd-Jones 
 First, I should preface this review by saying that I believe the edition I read was an earlier one, which may have not been thoroughly updated.  That said, what I did read was, well... not too revolutionary.  I have read a number of books in this vein and know what entails a good read.  For me, that has to be something which really challenges me and not so much gives me answers, but new questions and avenues to explore.  This book did not do this for me.  Basically, Shakti explains her background.  She is very self-congratulatory (I felt) as she explains that she lives her life by intuition, and has done all kinds of things people have felt were crazy, because she listened to her intuition.  I really feel that this book has one core truth to offer, and that is listen to your intuition, your immediate feelings, your first thoughts. Don't analyze.  Just be.  But you don't need to read this book in order to get that insight.  You just got it from reading my review of the book.  If you are interested in learning about the author herself, this book may be a good read as it explains quite a bit of her background and her spiritual growth.  But it's overall a very general book, which offers no real answers other than "follow your intuition." And I feel that a book which purports to discuss "planetary transformation" ought to offer something more than that one insight 
 I like Jennifer Lopez, but I am not a fan of J.LO...let me explain. Jennifer started her career in the mid 90s, did some promising work (Selena / Out of Sight / The Cell / Blood and Wine / etc.), and a very well done debut album for an actor (On the 6). Everything was genuinely promising. UNFORTUNATELY, once "J.LO" was born (circa 2001), her endeavours got weak, too commercial for the sake of money, too fixed only to hype her up, not all that original nor different than anyone else, to truly stand out. "Rebirth" is an example of that. When I heard Get Right for the first time, I loved it, I thought it was catchy. It harkened the days of On the 6..that sassy, groovy, R-n-B vibe she had. Then I caught Step into my world, the only real R-n-B track on the album and thought, I'm feelin' it, definitely a favorite to this day. The the rest came along (3-11) and I thought, Sony & J.LO made this for the sake of money, due to her films doing poorly, hence she had time off to commit to recording a new album. I thought it was a very obviously fake attempt to compensate. I think she is a great performer, a very talented person, but I honestly don't feel this album makes her an artist, merely a reworking of herself musically. I rank it 3rd in her album line...  On the 6 (4 stars) J.LO (3 stars) Rebirth (2 stars) This is me...then (2 stars) 
 I think deep thinking people tend to be unhappy because they're not living life.  They're idealizing and rationalizing life.  Some of the concepts here may be good, but reading this book will leave you feeling empty, even if you agree.  It's better to spend the time living your life than reading these kinds of deep books 
 I expected more from the first true book I've read about this type of phenomena. The book should have been a third of its 398 pages, because in the end, all you have is a couple of people's stories, however compelling they are, to judge for their truthfulness.  The three cental figures connected to the Linda Cortile case won't reveal themselves, so we're left wondering if she made them up(by sending letters to the author) to further her sensational means.  There isn't any real evidence other than a xray that used to show an object in Mrs. Cortile's nose, which is no longer there, well, because the aliens took it out.  Hopkins conviction and analysis is compelling, as well as some interesting side stories.  But in the end, even if the events did take place, which is possible, what happened is kinda silly.  With obsessed top security agents, a wierd "world leader", and criss-crossing generational alien meetings, this should have preferably been a 30 page article 
 I'm a huge Britney fan, but this cd [stunk] so bad.  When I bought it, I thought I was gettin a remix cd of songs like Lucky, Stronger, Satisfaction, and other songs on that cd, but it was just "Oops" when it came in the mail.  Two song, Track Numbers 5 and 7 are over 6 minutes, and 7 is the instrumental of 5 
 Worst idea, ever. Someone please remove his larynx. One star gives him too much credit 
 I am so sorry I hadn't taken the time to read the customer's reviews of Made in America and The Lost Continent, prior to buying them.  Frankly, I'm not sure which of these two books is more disappointing.  The only thing I was able to take away from them was the idea that Bill Bryson thinks hammering and bashing anything North American (USA only) is considered extremely good fun and humorous 
 I really liked Joust unexpectedly, and so I decided to borrow this book as well. I'm about 2/3 finished up to this book and would like to comment on it already. I WANT to like this book, I really do. In fact, sometimes I forget my misgivings and enjoy some of the parts.  The problem is, it's not just up to the same quality that Joust had. Explanations of the dragons and theories on their training was well enough in Joust, but it continues on to here, which is tedious to say the least, and sometimes I felt like throwing the book against the wall and shouting, "I KNOW already! I know about that falcon crap! Get with the story!" There was too much explanation of unecessary things, such as harness colours and God-knows-what-else. It's even worse that all of these things seem to push the actual story and events and make it really simple...I read Joust and thought, "That was good. Now the next part, where Kiron and Avatre have their adventure, should be better." And then my reaction when I found how easy things were became, "Eh?" I wanted a story, not a...diary of sorts.  But the worse part is I feel this book wasn't edited, not by the editors, not by the author herself. I found so many parts that reminded me of amateurish writing, which is ridiculous because I know this book was written by someone with a lot of novels under her belt! For example, there was a part where Kiron thought along the lines of, "The dragonest would be born amidst thunder and rain like Avatre. That was a good omen." And then he says the EXACT same thing a few sentences down. A lot of this 'information repeats' happens so many times it's difficult to ignore. There were too many explanations of obvious things. One of the dragon's names changes from Bethlan to Bethulan over several times in the book. Many sentences were awkward, something akin to: "It was the same man Kiron had met earlier, but he looked so different he would not have been able to tell it was the same man." I also found a LOT of sentences with words that don't make sense, or were lacking words, as if the author wrote them while half-asleep, and never looked at them again. That alone distracted me and frustrated me to a point where I never wanted to trust the author again...  If you liked Joust, you should read this book anyway, just to know what happens to Kiron, but don't expect too much. I hope the third one doesn't AT LEAST have the errors this one has. 
 i gave it 2 stars as i felt that overall i would not recommend this book 
 I expected more from the Mastermixers...what did they mix here? just straight music...nothing new...nothing fun...just average vocals with average music.  I have heard other Beatle impersonators do mixes and I DO love the Beatles but...I will be selling my copy soon.  
 I have a friend that her daughter has MPD  switiching into seven defferent people within their own mood changes, good and bad. Would like to know how commom is this disease?Would like to know more about the MPD. Whom to talk  to, Doctors, hypnotherist, whomever that can give some insight on MPD          Thank You Joh 
 I went to Circuit City with my dad to buy this MP3 player after my older sister recieved one for Christmas. When I was researching the quality of this product, some of the reviews were not pleasing, but I'm sorry to say I actually went out and bought it. And I'm also sorry to say this review will not be very pleasing either. The exterior casing of the Creative Zen Nano Plus is merely cheap plastic -- flimsy and pathetic next to the iPod nano 2nd Generation's aluminum casing. Scratch marks and scuff marks show up easily and I'm guessing that the curved part that comes off to allow you to change the battery would also break easily if stepped on, etc. The positively worst part of this MP3 player are the earbuds, which fall out if you barely touch the wiring. In order to keep the earbuds in place I have to stick them into my ears at an odd angle which makes even Sound Level 1 too loud to hear someone speak in an "indoor voice". Sadly, there's more: the backlight doesn't stay on long enough to allow you light to see which song is playing, how long it's been playing, etc. There is a "backlight" section in the "Settings", but the longest it can stay illuminated is only 15 seconds. Also, when skipping tracks, you use the same button to scan within a song, making it much harder to scan within the song than skip tracks. Another disappointment is that two of the CDs I tried to load onto this MP3 player weren't read as "being there", although they work fine when I listen to them on my WalkMan, DVD player, computer, etc. Luckily, I've had this player for about nine months, but it's still going strong, most likely because of the fact that it runs on a single AAA battery. This does get most annoying after awhile though, having to change batteries every two to three weeks, or whatever, depending on how often you listen to this. From the reviews on  this site, I'm most likely going to purchase an iPod nano 2 GB for my next Christmas. So although it's around $90 more, I'm hoping it'll be worth the extra money to have an MP3 player I'm not complaining about all the time 
   I admit it: I saw this on a library cart and assumed from the cover that this was some political humorist on the order of P. J. O' Rourke or Jon Stewart who had simply not come to my attention.    How wrong I was.    Greg Palast bills himself as some kind of investigative reporter. He is not. He is a partisan who puts together a tidbit here, a tidbit there and fills in the blanks with left-wing cant taken from the talking point memos of a thousand fringe groups and special interests. What doesn't fit in with his agenda is simply ignored. Where a "fact" is vitally necessary, it is often invented.    Palast doesn't document his "secret" finds. Much like Seymour Hersh, another truth-challenged "investigative reporter", Palast expect you to accept on his own authority that when he tells you of this or that secret document that has come into his possession, you are to believe simply because he says it is so (ipse dixit, as the Latin goes).    The basic themes are what you would expect to find in any "progressive" screed: the United States is evil, Bush is evil and dumb, big corproations are evil and greedy, there are secret cabals that rule the United States and want to dominate the world and would, were it not for a few "freedom fighters" who blow up innocent women and children and so forth. We've all heard it ten thousand times and its no more rational coming from Palast than it is from someone else.    Two examples will suffice to show the blatant dishonesty of Greg Palast.    First is Palast's defense of Dan Rather's use of forged documents. Palast, without evidence, not only rejects the argument, but attacks the people CBS brought in to examine the entire fiasco. No evidence - just blast.    Next is Palast's attempt to misrepresent the work of M. King Hubbert, a geologist, on oil reserves. Even though he reproduces Hubbert's original chart, Palast simply distorts Hubbert's conclusions.    Overall, Palast simply plays to the crowd: those who share his beliefs. No proof is needed to support his contentions. As long as he casts the United States as evil and so on, all will be well and his books will sell well since the people who read them are not interested in truth, but in having their already existing beliefs reinforced.

 As a professional/advocate in the field of autism treatment, I am continually disheartened by the large number of false claims made about the causes/treatments of this disorder. This book only adds to that trend.  As of the writing of this review, there are still no definitive data to suggest that autism is caused by environmental toxins or vaccinations (although the author suggests otherwise). While the effects of environmental influences continue to be investigated by competent researchers, it is irresponsible to suggest to parents of children with autism that we already know the cause of this neurological disorder. The only influence/potential cause of autism that has strong evidence to this point is a genetic influence.  Homeopathic treatment of autism? How can the author seriously suggest that such a treatment is advisable? Homeopathic compounds have NEVER been shown to be effective for ANY disorder (autism or otherwise) under controlled conditions (and by that I mean double-blind placebo-controlled studies). Although many persons have reported a benefit of homeopathic rememdies in their own lives, just as many people have reported the same effect when given a placebo. This suggests that homeopathy rests on people's beliefs for its perceived effectiveness.  I typically suggest that people search the "Association for Science in Autism Treatment" on the internet to get a handle on what professionals really know about the causes and effective treatments for autism. 
 I waited to read this book and was totally disgusted with it. It was more of a history about her mother (who was no doubt certifiable). Ms Wood dedicated her life, for good or for bad, to the Screen. The least this author could have done was not to  write it like someone was standing over his shoulder! 
 When you have lost weight, it's a very natural thing for others to be curious about how you lost your weight and kept it off. Whenever they have heard me tell my story, read my blog or book, or found out that I did it on the low-carb lifestyle, one question invariably has come up from time to time:   "What do you think about this low-carb diet where you can eat whatever you want for one-hour per day?"  My initial reaction to these people was usually something along the lines of this:  "That's absolutely crazy! There's no way you could ever lose weight and keep it off using this method."  I did the Atkins diet and honestly have not stayed on top of all the bazillion other low-carb diets out there. But there was something very odd about this plan that it made me look around to find out more about it.  Little did I know there was an actual book out there about this very diet so many people had been telling me about. It's called The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet and it was written by a husband/wife team Drs. Richard and Rachael Heller.  The CAD diet, as it is referred to, makes the claim (and I agree with it) that many people are addicted to carbohydrates and need to be weaned off from depending on them for sustenance. Just like a drug addict gets small concentrated doses of their preferred drug daily so they can eventually get by with less and less, that same concept is what goes into the CAD diet.  If people think the Atkins diet is restrictive, then check out what you have to do on the CAD diet:  BREAKFAST: ZERO-carb meal consisting of protein and fat. LUNCH: ZERO-carb meal consisting of protein and fat.  You are NOT allowed to eat any bread, fruit, milk, juice, and most starchy vegetables. Absolutely NO snacking whatsoever except for black coffee or diet soda. You cannot use artificial sweeteners either.  Sound appealing, anyone? Hmmm? I suppose if that's all there was to this diet, then NOBODY would do it. But there is one more key aspect of the CAD diet that you probably will be interested in.   DINNER: Eat equal amounts of protein, vegetables and dessert of whatever you want to eat in whatever amount, but it must be eaten in a one-hour time frame. You can even enjoy a beer or glass of wine with your "reward" meal.  How's that for incentive? You basically starve all day long just so you can get to those sixty minutes at the end of your day where you can say hello to the buffet line! Who wouldn't enjoy a diet that lets you do THAT?!  Well, I'm still very skeptical about any lifestyle change that encourages you to eat the very foods that got you overweight or obese to begin with on a DAILY basis. I caught a lot of flack from my fellow low-carbers about my controversial "planned splurge" meal every 6-8 weeks during my weight loss. However, the Hellers give you a DAILY planned splurge!!! What's up with that?  We can blame this on Dr. Rachael, who stumbled upon this way of eating when she weighed 268 pounds after being on diet after diet. She became a psychologist to learn more about why people overeat (ostensibly to help herself in the process, too). She had skipped breakfast and lunch on a particular day she was fasting for a blood test and then, like most of us would, ate to her heart's content whatever she wanted for supper. The next morning she noticed she had dropped 2 pounds.  Thinking something must have gone wrong with her scale, she tried it again the next day, skipping breakfast and lunch and then eating a gargantuan dinner and once again, she lost another pound. She played around with what would eventually become The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet and went on to lose 150 pounds which she has kept off to this day.  The frequency of eating carbohydrates is the key behind the CAD diet. The Hellers believe that anyone who consumes ANY amount of carbohydrates during the day will set off all the bells and whistles in your body that you are hungry faster than if you avoided them altogether. They say that eating carbs throughout the day is like giving lots of small doses of cocaine to a cocaine addict. It will make them crave their poison even more!  That's why you basically avoid eating carbs on the CAD diet until the end of the day. This process of getting over carbohydrate addiction is a tricky one, and the Hellers think they have found a solid plan for making it work for lasting weight loss in people.  I still can't get around the fact that you don't change the poor eating habits of the people who have packed on the pounds. Sure, they basically starve themselves throughout the day before they eat their one BIG meal each day, but how is that stimulating the metabolism and preventing the biggest obstacle to weight loss success -- HUNGER!  There's no way I could do the CAD diet because I enjoy eating every 2-3 hours to keep my digestive process constantly in motion. I truly believe this is one of the things that has helped me lose the weight and keep it off. Since you cannot snack or use artificial sweeteners on the CAD diet, it would literally drive me insane even if there was that "reward" meal at the end of the day!  Wanna take a test to see if you are a carb addict? Click here to take the 10-question Carbohydrate Addict's Test. I scored a 2, which means "You do not appear to be carbohydrate addicted." No kidding, ya think?  Dr. Jonny Bowden, author of Living The Low-Carb Life, examined the CAD diet and said the diet uses some fuzzy science to make their points about why their plan works.  "While it seems pretty clear that there are both insulin and serotonin abnormalities in the obese, it's not at all clear that high levels of insulin depress levels of serotonin, as the Hellers hypothesize--in fact, the majority of the evidence points to the opposite response."  Furthermore, Dr. Bowden said he is concerned about the lack of attention on exercise as part of their weight loss program, stating "it's vital to both maintaining weight and to raising the metabolic rate."  While The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet has worked for a lot of people and I always tell people to do what works for them to lose weight and keep it off, I still have my reservations about this program. I think I'll pass on carb-loading my body for one hour a day 
 This is nothing less than the story of an African American man's struggle to define himself within the context of the 60's US black power movement exploited by a white Englishman. Mike Marqusee brings nothing new to the story of Muhamed Ali other than stilted prose and an uncritical eye. It fails as a book about boxing and is equally weak with respect to Ali's struggle with the white establishment of his day. Marqusee's attempt to embrace Ali's story serves only to water down the true struggle of an entire generation against the evils of institutional racism 
 I've heard good things about this man's books for some time now and after seeing a number of good reviews for PROMISE ME (the book) I thought I'd try the audio version. I was very disappointed unfortunately. I hadn't noted he was the reader when I loaded them in to my car stereo and started to listen but I didn't get very far into the discs before I ejected them in dismay. He's just not a very good performer, I'm sorry to say. This is a performance medium (audio books) and the book rides on the shoulders of the performer. In trying to sort out the performance from the plot/story, I can't say as I was that impressed by the latter either but will admit, I might have given the more neutral tone of the printed book more of a chance. It was painful (sorry, HC) listening to the audio version 
 I was very interested in buying this product even before it came out, but I have to say I am disappointed.  This product does not offer any thing that a digital watch timing your run, a play list that is constructed before you run and figuring our your miles before you run on the street and it is even less useful if you are going on a treadmill.  I say less useful on the treadmill because it keep track of the distance for you, and when running on the street its not that hard to chart out a running path for you before you go out and run.  This product is not the breakthrough that a lot of people think it is.   I am a fan of Apple products, have owned 4 Ipod, 2 Ibooks, an Imac and a MacMini but after buying this product I have decided to sell it because it doesn't do any thing that can do on your own.  I don't think that my mind would change if they added a heart monitor because you know that they up-charge for that probably into the 60-dollar range.   I have been running for the past 3 months on a daily basis, and have run 5K-10K and half marathons in the past.  
 The premise of the story caught my attention -- a man presumed dead for years, whose wife had already collected a large insurance policy on him, appears to be alive after all.  The problem is that Sue Grafton's fictional detective Kinsey Millhone is too incompetent to solve the case.  How does she resolve her dilemma?  By asking two other perpetrators if they were involved just to satisfy Ms. Milhone's curiosity.  Lame!   And then there is this subplot into Ms. Millhone's personal life that leads to nowhere.  I don't know what "K" or the rest of the alphabet has in store for readers, but I'm not interested in finding out 
 I have watched these two for quite awhile and find myself, not only tiring of the endless re-runs, but of the two women advisers touching peoples' derrieres and bosoms.  They are rather snobbish, not very attractive women, who lost me completely when they pushed wearing hide-tight maternity clothes that made them look like blimps, they apparently never heard of a good hair cut and finally, the hideous recommendation that you wear a dress over a pair of slacks.  The posturing and face making when wearing something "wrong" is off-putting, silly, but not amusing.   I am very glad I bought a copy from the new and used section of Amazon, I would have been quite cranky if I had paid full price 
 I am a fan of modest mouse at least most of there stuff I didn't like long drive loved moon and antartic and thought lonesome crowded west was good this one however has only one good song to offer the fruit that ate itself is a great song well worth downloading better than any song on long drive or lonesome crowded west but the rest of the cd is garbage so save your money and download that one song 
 Each of the stories in this collection are excellently written short stories exploring sexuality. But, as for erotica, I found them way too tame. I am a woman and I need "foreplay" even in my sexy reading, but I also need some action. I have kept this book by my bed, giving it a second chance several times, and every time, I am completely disappointed. The "good parts" are too few and far between 
 Do not buy.  This may be the worst product I've ever bought.  It has never worked properly.  I've kept fresh batteries in it, but it's still no good.  Within 10 feet of the laptop, I'll click three or four times and nothing happens.  Then, I'll click and the slides go in fast forward until the end.  It's quite embarrassing to be giving a professional presentation and have this happen.  Awful product.  Believe the bad reviews.  It's worse than they describe.  The only positive thing I can say about the product is that it doubles nicely as a cat toy.  My cat loves the laser pointer 
 I had to read this book for one of my teaching classes, and out of all the awful books my instructor assigned during the semester, this one was the worst.  First of all, Mr. Ayers includes so many poems in it that he may as well have just compiled an anthology. Most of them are not even good poems. They are the likes of that which you might see a 10 year old write. I don't know why he bothered to write a book when he contributed less than half of it. But if you like crap "poetry," then you might enjoy this book.  Secondly, Mr. Ayers doesn't seem familiarised with the precepts of economics. He says that all children are entitled to a free and high quality education, all while dissing private schools. However, he fails to understand that you can have free OR high quality, but not both. This is because he hasn't yet asked himself who will provide this free and high quality education, nor has he considered what it means to deserve something.  Ayers' book is nothing but socialist propoganda, so it is no wonder it is being used for the instruction of teachers. After all, the only real goal of public schools today is to get children into the socialist mindset, teaching them that they deserve the unearned. No wonder America's schools are failing, turning out nothing but mediocre adults with mediocre minds. Teachers and students alike have been brainwashed by this kind of crap for the last several decades. 
 This book was very helpul in learning about how to handle my dog 
 I expected a lot more profundity about this topic.  There are much better works out there than this. The book is evidence that one cannot assume that because a writer has many books published that hey keep getting better, ofthen the revers as here where the audience in mind is simple people who find worn out bromides helpful.  Try angel dust insted 
 As a longtime visitor to Something Awful I have grown to enjoy Parson's   writing immensely. When purchasing this book I expected to read a light, humorous account of WWII inventions gone wrong. In reality, the book is a ponderous recitation of those inventions replete with plenty of mind-numbing technical details and absent of anything remotely resembling humor. Hopefully SA/Parson's next literary venture will help us forget this stinker.  
 If you like strange stories, you will love "Running with Scissors" because it is just plain weird.  After reading this book, you will have a feeling that you just returned from the Twilight Zone. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal 
 Caution: This review contains a couple spoilers!  First off, I have to admit that my husband and I ended up seeing this by accident, when flipping through channels. What is not accidental (and is patently inexcusable, in my opinion) is the sheer awfulness of this movie. It was so bad it was funny, and for that reason alone we watched it for the (surely unintended) comedy.    The movie is rife with stock and unoriginal characters: whiny useless blonde woman, who can only stand there and scream at critical junctures (almost as vexing as those young women in horror flicks who are running for their lives but always trip and/or fall down), sexy young doctor/bimbo character (I guess she finished that pesky PhD while still in high school), buff blonde himbo (no, that's not a typo, he's just the male surfer version of the bimbo), and a couple of token minorities, one of whom gives preachy pep talks (we actually cheered when in the midst of Jackson's character's "we must pull together as a team to survive" rah-rah speech, a shark surfaced and gulped him down raw). Yummy. Mr. Shark doesn't fancy that sanctimonious claptrap anymore than we did.  Most amusing scene: bimbo scientist feels it necessary to strip off her wetsuit before she kills a shark, and after all the drama and suspense of the impromptu strip-tease we see she's wearing sensible white undies rather than Victoria's Secret. Aww, what a disappointment. But I guess good girls don't go to heaven if they wear naughty underwear.   More things we picked up on: whenever a character cusses, drinks, smokes, or looks at porn, something terrible happens. Evil shark suddenly appears and punishes said sinner. Hardly subtle. (For example, one guy lights up a cigarette and seconds later loses a hand - hubby said this was the best anti-smoking campaign ad ever!) There are probably more than a dozen references to God throughout this film, which in itself is not objectionable, but becomes obvious and annoying after more than a couple times. There's even a "group hug" scene where all the characters join hands in a circle and pray. What is this, the 700 Club? Not to mention a shark gets stabbed with a crucifix in the end. Spare us the lofty moral overtones and get on with the story already. Oh wait, that would require a plot, wouldn't it?    A lot of people have been comparing this movie to "Jaws." I'm not sure what they've been smoking (careful there, might lose a hand!;), but the only thing this joke of a film has in common with "Jaws" is the CGI effects might as well date from the 70s. There's no excuse for a 1999 film to have CGI so terribly bad that it's just plain embarrassing after awhile. Cast should have done shadow-puppets on a wall instead - I think it would have been scarier. More entertaining, too.  This movie is so predictable, so corny, and so appallingly bad that I wonder if the actors even dare list it on their resumes. 
 It seems that people either love it or hate it and  I belong to the latter category.  How did this become a classic???  Having forced myself to read to the end I'm not going to waste anymore time - just read the other 1-star reviews - poor kids forced by their teachers to read this over-rated garbage 
 Since when is beautiful art presented on crappy, low-grade glossy paper. These artists are incredible and deserve so much better than this stock chinese manure. It's like listening to Beethoven on a 1990's era cell phone.   And sadly, the great Doug Chiang had departed the ranks of Lucasfilm by Episode III 
 Notwithstanding the fact that the acing in the movie is actually quite good, the screenplay is so tedious I actually fell asleep in the middle of the afternoon while watching it. A good cure for insomnia 
 These are hard to get on the dog's feet - they're hard to get adjusted, and they will not stay on! If he steps in just a few inches of powdery snow, the bootie comes off. The velcro straps are not secured to the bootie, so if the dog steps on an unraveling end, the whole bootie comes off - then you may lose the bootie AND the strap! I'm still looking for a better alternative, but havent come up with one yet. 
 The author needs someone to explain to her that arguments develop not simply by stringing one sentence after another and expecting that with a little tape, good cheer, and hope, a coherent line of thought will emerge.  Rather, arguments develop by actually rereading what you have written, revising it so as to clarify the connecting ideas, and making assertions that require some kind of evidence to defend them.  A little reseach along the way wouldn't be a bad idea either.  While the topics being discussed are certainly interesting, the result of this porridge-like prose (it's not at all clear that book represents sustained meditation), is a kind of mush capable of taking any of a number of shapes 
 Just before the Big War, Louis Seynaeve is still a boy of eleven years. He grows up in the nunnery in Haarbeke, also known as the Reformatory. Together with his friends Dondeyne, Byttebier and Vlieghe he forms the secret society The Four Apostles. Later their club is reinforced by the new guy Goosens. Their main vocation is to get a hold of 'forbidden books'. One day father and grandfather Seynaeve visit Louis to bring him bad news: Louis' mother fell from the stairs and is taken to the hospital. The truth is that she is pregnant and that any moment now she can give birth to a brother that will upset the easy life Louis was living.   Like so many authors who were adolescent during the Second World War, Hugo Claus is gifted with a relentless urge to get in touch with what happened during his youth. The Sorrow of Belgium is clearly the culmination point of war drama in the works of this Belgian author. Claus does not narrate the heroic deeds of the soldiers, but paints a colorful canvas of life under repression. Simple factory workers and storekeepers are trying to make the best out of things, but more often than not they fall into despair and misery. All this makes great prose as seen through the eyes of the child, Louis Seynaeve.  But then something strange happens. In the middle of the book Hugo Claus decides to changes style completely. Instead of the steady sequential narrative of the first part, the reader gets a mishmash of impressions. The few storylines that are developed die in a pool of chaos. Suddenly the story stops making sense and starts flirting with utter boredom. It is clear that the main theme is collaboration and the blindness of people under repression, but nowhere is this given any reason of existence between the fragmental, pointless descriptions of the adventures of mostly flat characters.  It is incomprehensible why such a potentially great novel was ruined by the desire of Clause to write a novel of more that 700 pages. It would have been great it he had skipped the last 400 pages. A pity 
 "Trading Up: Why Consumers Want New Luxury Goods" of 2004 was a very good (and very successful) book. Mr Silverstein had to come up with a sequel.  "Treasure Hunt" is the result, and its purpose is to address quite the opposite phenomenon; it could have been titled "Trading Down".  I think that most of the book's "stories" (or "case studies" if one wants a loftier description) are too loquacious and they very rarely make the author's point.  This book is, as most sequels, a let-down 
 I first got to know Cheryl Wheeler from her funny songs on the Sylvia Hotel CD. I also saw her in concert where I was taken with her folksy loving insightful songs. I also thought she was very bright and had an unbelievable way with words. But still the songs that got me most were the ones that were kind of funny. I have to say in a collection album with 19 songs, they are all very somber, and not the funny ones I was looking for. Her voice is beautiful, and the lyrics are still compelling, but don't plan to laugh 
 I know this type of person. I've watched his unbearable TV show. I ask, why can't we all just get along?  Being a peace lover, and a church going Christian, his ways are VERY un-Christian like.  Jesus would not approve, Bill, but luckily for you, God is very forgiving.  Attacking others is not very nice.  Most of us learned that in Kindergarten.  And I really wonder how TRADITIONAL it is to hate others when you can't, or won't, comprehend what their lives are like.  Perhaps we should go back to burning at the stake, lynching, or segregation to prove just how Christian, Traditional and Patriotic the United States really is. Do I need to remind you, Bill, and your brain-washed followers that this country was founded by men trying to escape persecution for believing something different?  Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all citizens?  Those who hate will love this book, those with an open, loving, tolerant mind will know better.  
 This movie tries way too hard to the point that it becomes a painful melodrama filled with gratuitous dialogue and over-acting.  I found this movie to be thoroughly unsatisfying 
 If you're interested primarily in Near-Death Experiences, then do not go with this one.  Mrs. Whitfield describes her two NDE's here, but this is for the most part a New Age compendium on how to increase your spirituality through the balancing of your chakras, handling psychic and kundalini  energies, etc.  There's nothing wrong with that except for perhaps  misleading the public with the title such as it is.  Mrs. Whitfield is an  accomplished therapist and extemely well-studied in her work, but there are  too many publications available like this one.  For those wanting powerful  testimonials from those who have had near-death experiences, you will NOT  find it here. There are so many more books available from Amazon that carry  NDE accounts that will change your life 
 The only thing worse than reading _Beloved_ (read my review of the novel) is listening to Morrison read it.  She goes so s - l - o - w - l - y, and seems more impressed with her book than the reader.  Quite frankly this book doesn't really demand this close of a reading.        Although trite to say, the best compliment a writer can have is having someone else make the text come to life, and this audio book is interesting only as an historical artifact.  
 There are two very good songs on this album: Man In A Box (duh) and Love, Hate, Love. The slow-brewing intensity of the latter song sets it apart from the straight-up metal of the rest of the album. I really liked AIC back in the day and think both Cantrell and Staley are great talents, but I could never get into this album. Dirt, Sap, and Jar of Flies are all superior to Facelift so if you're new to AIC check those works out first 
 The book has great pictures but no real detail about how to build ponds or waterfalls.  How disappointed we were when we received the book.  We will look for other books but will not purchase them online.  We need to be able to see what is inside the cover.  
 This was the 5th book I've read by Jodi Picoult, and the one I liked the least. I was intrigued by the subject of the book, as I have been with all of the subjects she has written about. But, this story did not measure up to my expectations at all.   This book was supposed to focus on the question of mercy killing, and could you/would you kill someone you loved if they asked you to because they were ill and had been suffering for a long time. One of the main characters is Cam MacDonald, who is the sheriff of Wheelock, Mass. Cam's cousin Jamie arrives in town and promptly turns himself in to Cam, citing that he has just murdered his wife. Later, you learn she had been battling cancer for a while and allegedly asked Jamie to kill her. So naturally Jamie has to go on trial.   Well, a majority of the book turns out to be about Cam's adultery, which is annoying in and of itself. It seems like adultery is romanticized in this novel and made to seem 'ok' since, as you discover, Cam is disillusioned with his life and is only sheriff because he inherited the position and it's expected of him. Plus, the person he has the affair with, he has known a day or so, which is ridiculous.   Interspersed throughout all of this, almost seeming like an afterthought, is content dealing with the actual subject the book was supposed to cover.   I was very bored with this book, but continued to read it, thinking it was bound to pick up eventually. It never did. As it turned out, I ended up skimming the last 80 pages. If I were you, I'd pick another novel.   
 Kapsalis took the right subject in the wrong direction.  She missed an opportunity to attack gross negligence in the medical culture.  Both men and women are victimized by a culture of unnecessary and invasive medical procedures. There are pre-admission physicals, employment physicals, sports physicals, insurance physicals, immigration physicals, and on the job physicals but no proof that physicals save lives. Up until recently, women in Lithuania had to have a gynecological examination to get a driver's license.  Furthermore, some professions ie Nurse Practitioners and Certified Physician's Assistants almost subsist on doing physicals because older professions {DOs and MDs} protect their turf Last but not least, she should have criticized Joan Emerson's research.  Patients are protected by being covered up and treated objectively.  How many patients want to be fully exposed with no chaperon? 		Kapsalis also didn't mention Jack Olson's book "DOC: The Rape of the Town of Lovell" about convicted physician/rapist Dr. Story.  Overall, Kapsalis didn't approach this subject from the best perspectiv 
 Although Valley Girl came out when I was a teenager, it somehow eluded me until now. I bought it because of the favorable reviews, and of course, for the sheer nostalgia. I won't say it's a BAD movie, but I would compare it directly to The Last American Virgin in terms of screenplay, story and acting. Unlike The Last American Virgin, however, this film has an awful sountrack, and it didn't really end in a notable way.  From a filmmaking standpoint, this seems amateurish. Apparently this is where director Martha Coolidge cut her teeth, because she went on to direct the remarkably good college film, Real Genius, just two years later.  The big problem with this film is shallowness. We never learn much about any of the characters, so it's not easy to care about them. I still can't figure out why the lead characters were attracted to each other, since the only way they ever describe each other is "hot". They never engage in deep conversations or share secrets with each other. There's no depth to the relationship at all.   Another problem is that all the high school students in this film appear to be about 18-22 years old, while the sexy mother of one teenage girl appears to be under 30 years old herself. A whole subplot that revolves around the mother (Beth, played by Lee Purcell) is unsatisfactorily resolved about half-way throught the film, then never mentioned again. Even so, I like her temptations a lot more than Stifler's Mom in American Pie!  Lisa Foreman's lead character, Julie, behaves less like a "Valley Girl" of the 1980's than she does an ordinary middle class teenager living in Overland Park, Kansas. If you're familiar with Moon Unit Zappa's song, "Valley Girl", you'll find almost none of that kind of language in this film. Nicolaus Cage's character, Randy, is likeable enough, but he looks more like a member of Jefferson Starship than a "punk" (his almost mullet-like hair is blown upward on top--that's it!). Unfortunately, for an "odd couple" story like this to work, you need to emphasize the extreme difference between the characters. But these characters could have easily been neighbors from childhood. They don't seem at all from the other side of the tracks.  The obligatory montage scene fails because it continues for the entire length of the song, "I'll Melt With You". A montage is meant to compress time, and dragging it out for an entire song defeats that purpose. They should have faded it out after 45-60 seconds for more effect.  The most entertaining characters in the film, by far, are Julie's parents--a couple of former hippies who were obviously the prototype for Berke Lander's parents in the hilarious 2001 teen film, "Get Over It".   The soundtrack, too, is terribly inferior to The Last American Virgin, and doesn't represent the early 1980's well at all. Only the aforementioned "I'll Melt With You" stands out as a great song. Meanwhile, a tune that repeats the question "Johnny Are You Queer?" seems oddly out of place at a preppy high school prom.   From a nostalgia standpoint, I didn't feel like I was watching an 80's movie at all. In fact, the most pleasant nostalgia in the film was seeing ashtrays on every table (even though the characters didn't smoke), which reminded me for the first time in years that California was once part of a free country, and wasn't always ruled by neurotics. Frankly, I was surprised that the Orwellian thought-police hadn't airbrushed all those ashtrays out of the film. Today, every surface in California is littered with a fear-mongering Proposition 65 warning stickers instead. I'm so grateful I was a teenager in the 1980's, rather than today!  Overall, this film fails on too many counts to recommend it, but I wouldn't blame you for checking it out. It's good enough fun for 99 minutes. The Special Edition DVD adds quite a few features that make the DVD worthwhile, if you can get it cheap! 
 If you're an aspiring screenwriter, it always helps to just watch one movie a whole bunch of times and make your own with some of your own twists to differentiate it and people won't call you a ripoff. That seems to be the in thing to do now since there have been so many remakes, or as they're called "re-imaginings" that you wonder what was the point in making it. Normally I would excuse such films but not in the case of the Black Christmas remake. Written and directed by Glen Morgan and produced by James Wong, it's hard to believe this film is brought to us by the guys who did some amazing episodes on the X-Files.  It's Christmas time and a sorority is celebrating the night before they all go off with their families. Around this time, a murderer named Billy Lenz escapes from prison and he's heading to the sorority. Stricken with a liver disease that gives him yellowish skin, he has a weird fixation for eyeballs and he has it in mind to ruin the girls' night.  Like a lot of recent horror films, there's a tendency to have the horror come through gore shots and if the phrase "weird fixation for eyeballs" doesn't give an idea for what you'll see then look elsewhere. Granted, there is a deleted scene included that's even more extreme yet at the same time, it's still quite gory and after awhile it wears thin. There's almost a sadistic quality in seeing girls not only suffocating through bags over their heads but to ALSO have one repeatedly stabbed is excessive and robs what's already a traumatic event. Another problem is giving the killer a backstory. Just like Leatherface, we can't just simply have characters face real evil and menace, it has to be people who have been screwed over by life and are lashing out. What was scary (when you didn't think about the cheesy stuff) was the fact people are being harassed by a kind of supernatural presence or evil personified and here it just makes everything seem ridiculous.  If you're a guy, one good thing about the film is the amount of ladies on hand. From Buffy's Michelle Trachtenberg to Lacey Chabert (Party of Five) to Mary Elizabeth Winstead (of Final Destination 3), it's hard to watch cute ladies getting diced. Of course it doesn't help they all tend to play the same type which is sarcastic, spoiled rich-chick. We get Andrea Martin as well from the original but still, it's disappointing that they don't do much before each girl is ceremoniously offed.  Is it worth a watch? Hard to say since only a rare few actually like it but it's hard to like something that's just so bad in the first place and convincing yourself there's some merit in here will take awhile 
 When putting together the mobile section of this item, I was very disappointed in its flimsiness. It looks like just a few knocks will cause the screws to break from the plastic.  When I turned it on I was disappointed a second time, this time by the irritating buzzing sound that the mobile makes as it rotates. It's so loud you can't hear the music, which is a shame because I'm sure my son would enjoy looking at the moving lights. The third disappointment - the buttons are VERY hit-and-miss. Sometimes the music buttons don't work (the lullaby one worked eventually once I mashed it in really hard). That I could live with, but it's fiddling with the other controls that is really irritating. Control for music off, lights on/off and rotation on/off all seem to be tied up in two buttons. If you have the music and lights going, then turn on the rotation, the music and lights will go off as the rotation comes on. Then you have to press buttons in whatever order seems logical until you get them all going the way you want them. Please bear in mind I am NOT particularly daft - I managed to figure out my TIVO remote in a day or so - but the controls for this baby's musical mobile make no sense to me. I thought at first it was supposed to be deliberately challenging in order to stimulate 'baby's natural curiosity', but after two nights it really got on my nerves, and if I can't figure it out, I don't see how my one year old is supposed to. I can only think that there is something very screwed up with the circuitry in there.  I'm not dismissing this item all together. The music is lovely - not too simplified and not too electronic-sounding. The Minute Waltz is particularly nice (I've noticed my son scans for it). The lights are lovely too, and do look pretty when they're moving if you can stand the buzzing. My son has come to depend on the music to amuse himself with as he falls asleep. BUT, if you buy it, I'd recommend testing the buttons and the motorized rotator before screwing the very flimsy mobile pieces together in case you need to return it. 
 I literally laughed at the case presented for Evolution when I read this book because of the high publicity and reviews this book has received. If this is the best-case evolution has to offer, I really feel sorry for people who buy what this guy is selling. He has no evidence to back up his claims. I was surprised that Dawkins mentioned evidence like 'Lucy' and the `peppered moth' which were proven wrong years ago. I am a creationist as you can probably tell, but not blind. I picked up this book with an open mind honestly looking to see if I have been believing in something that is not there, but instead of putting doubt in my mind, I was reaffirmed there is nothing to the evolution theory besides man trying to put God aside and not feel guilty about it. I encourage everyone to look at both sides of the story, pick up a good book that presents evidence for creation and weigh them both and see, which case makes more sense. Of course many people just call creationists crack pots and never bother to look at where the evidence is pointing, if that's you, enjoy this temporary life because its all your going to get 
 This is the worst popcorn popper I have ever owned!  It is slow and doesn't pop well.  I thought it may have been the popcorn seeds so I bought some new ones and tried again.  Same thing!  What a disappointment! 20 minutes of popping to get less than 15 half popped and/or burnt pieces.  In the same timeframe I was able to take out my old $10.00 popper (Walmart special)and pop 3 large bowls, melt the butter and disperse to the 15 teengers waiting in movieroom.  What a waste of money 
 There is not much to say about this book except that it is often extremely confusing for the layman. The examples skip steps, there is usually no explanation as to how to apply the theorems and one is often completely clueless as to how to do the exercises, or much guesswork must be done on how to apply the given formulas.  If you are already knowledgeable on the subject of numerical analysis this book might be a good reference for refreshing your memory but for the beginner it is for the most part going to be a frustrating waste of time 
 I decided to read W&P because I had heard that it is hailed by many to be "The Best Novel Ever." I'm making my way through those books considered "classics" and normally I read them with gusto.  This was different. I made it all the way through it, but only through determination and perseverance. To those who ask me how I read the whole thing, I reply, "One page at a time."  I found the book far too complicated and far too verbose to keep track of all the characters and their relationships. Some editions have a guide included that you can use as a bookmark so it's right there when you need to remember who's who and where they fit in. The guide also has maps so you can get an idea of where the events are taking place. I would have been lost without it, and heartily recommend you not be either. Another recommendation would be to keep a journal as you read along, something you can refer back to so you don't get overwhelmed.  I could go on, but I guess I could sum things up by saying, "You've been warned."     
 I read Diana Palmer for a easy no brains love story this was not it. To many plots and relationships going on and not enough on the main couple. I give it 2 stars because its Diana Palmer 
 Many, many years ago I read Catherine Coulter, read her avidly, eagerly looking forward to her next book. Well, this is the first one of hers that I have read in about a decade and WHAT HAPPENED? Three times I set this book down in disgust, only to come back to it out of sheer stubbornness.  There is not enough room to write about just how bad this book was. From generally poor writing (Mary Lisa said, Jack said, Lou Lou said... until you want to yell "I KNOW who is involved in this conversation!), silly plot, unneccessary side stepping.   WHO CARES that the hero digs a chunky chip into guacamole? OH WOW, we get to know the different flavors of potato chips being devoured by three woman while they talk about the big case. WHEN have any of us heard of investigating cops asking "why is she wearing those pajamas when you are wearing those"? YEAH sure, an agent involved in a case is going to let endangered person call the shots in even the tiniest part of the investigation. And the names! Mary Lisa? Lou Lou? Puker? Gimme a freaking break! Aaaarrrrggggg!!!   Ms. Coulter, I used to love your books. PLEASE get back to what you used to do so well. If you cannot write the "FBI style" books that are so popular now, then don't. STOP feeding the bestseller beast anything less than your best. Cease. Desist. Please go back to what you are great at 
 The Motely Fool has never shied away from congratulating itself, in an entertaining sort of way.  The trouble comes in when the reality fails to live up to the authors' claims.  Their style of rah-rah anyone-can-make-a-million investing appeals to some novice investors for obvious reasons.  But as Malkiel points out in the classic A Random Walk Down Wall Street, there will always be a few people who have a fortunate run for a few years.  Today, sadly, after the crash of 2000, the Gardners' conclusions in Rule Breakers Rule Makers seem to be more misleading than helpful, especially for someone just starting out.  If investing were only as easy as the Gardners make out then their own "Rule Breaking" portfolio might have continued to work.  They have tried to selectively cite certain of their more recent portfolios to make it appear that they're continuing to "beat the market like a drum", while sweeping under the rug their losing portfolios.  But as the reality of their results stands, they ought to be ashamed of themselves for hyping up stocks and making themselves sound like the next Warren Buffett.    There will always be people on Wall Street like the Gardners, inflating expectations and temporarily taking in some newcomers.  In contrast, real investors like Buffett and Graham are modest about their results.  They stick to a realistic expectation of returns, and realize that today's hot stock is often tomorrow's set of crashed dreams.  A beginning investor would be much better served reading Graham's The Intelligent Investor, or another classic of the Street, rather than being drawn into a charming but unrealistic look at the high hopes of what are ultimately mere self-promoters 
  Why do so many people think EJ is the God-gifted talent he is? Just because he makes some violonish sounds in his guitar? I don't mean to say doing that is easy--hell I can't do it, but does that mean that I need to make my guitar sound like a violin to be classified as a "genius"?  And yeah, that battery thing.....ummm let's see. Wow. Yeah. But hey, there are people who can walk on their hands. That's impressive too isn't it?  I don't mean to take away from Mr. Johnson's abilities. I know he has a houseful of them. But there's something supremely hollow about the way he plays guitar because all what he wants to do is create the world's sweetest, most pleasing sound. No edge, no bite, just honey. As does Kenny G 
 If your idea of a good alternative film is one devoid of plot, good acting and any semblance of structure then you might enjoy this piece of utter rubbish.  I think this is a sad homily to gay men who get excited seeing ugly German gay men with shaved pubes getting off with one another and then call it art 
 I began this book with great expectations.  By the time I finished, I was extraordinarily disappointed at many of the portrayals of refugees and at the lack of knowledge the author displayed about how refugees get to the U. S.  She missed an opportunity to educate her readers about the U.S. Refugee Resettlement Program which is administered by the Department of State and carried out by at least nine refugee resettlement agencies who must operate within strict guidelines.  Nowhere in this book did the author mention that refugees do not drop from the sky, but are placed, through a structured program, in cities all over the U.S.  She may not have looked beyond her own city to find out that the experiences of refugees there may not be typical of other places, may not have inquired about the quality of life of those others, and may not know that the ones in Lincoln had to have a sponsor before they were allowed to come.  Refugees usually receive a cultural orientation before arrival here. It may not be enough, but usually gives them some idea of what to expect.  Many already have relatives whom they are joining, and those relatives, too, would usually have given some idea of life here.  The author mentions slums - the Dept of State has strict guidelines about housing - it is to be safe and affordable.  The dismal working conditions may be realistic in Lincoln, but the author should note that perhaps it is not like that in other towns.  The author thinks that refugees do or should live in fear of the INS - they should not, because they are here legally with documents to prove it and have been approved by the INS before they are allowed to come anyway.  I also noted that the author mixes refugees, asylees, and Mexicans.  Mexicans are not and never have been refugees.  Asylees and refugees also are not quite the same.  She says almost nothing about the good things available to refugees.  What about Pell Grants for education?  What about English as a Second Language classes or private tutoring? Where are the many benefits which are available to all refugees?  Things like Medicaid, TANF, Food Stamps, vocational rehabilitation, etc.  The author mentions the burden of repaying a travel loan.  Although this is a legal debt, it can be deferred for at least three months or more if there is a pressing reason.  Refugees have signed a travel loan in their own language before they come and are aware that repaying it will help other refugees who want to come to the U.S.  The author seems to believe that all refugees are simple country folk. Many were sophisticated city dwellers who had the comforts and luxuries we do and who want them again.  My overall feeling after reading this book is one of irritation at the portrayal of refugees who seem demoralized, sad and poor.  Where are the happy endings?  The triumphs?  The joys?  At the end, I have to wonder exactly why this book was written when the picture of refugees is often erroneous.  I am a case manager for a small refugee resettlement agency, and have many stories to refute those in this book 
 This book is tedious, plodding, repetitive, themeless.  I never could really understand what its thesis was, or what the recitation of sketches of various Biblical figures was supposed to demonstrate.  This is a fascinating subject, but this book turns it into boredom.  I could not finish it 
 I'm a fan of Dave Barry, I enjoy his column, I enjoyed some of his books in the past, and I bought this one with great anticipation. Boy was I disappointed! The story is meaningless, the characters are not interesting, the events are mostly dumb and the dialog is uneven and unfunny.  Do yourself a favor, do not read this book! I can't believe anyone recommends it 
 BOOKLIST claims that "buried within every true baseball fan is a Nerd with a calculator and a scorecard" - a statement mildly amusing if not deeply offensive to 80-90% of the nation's dedicated baseball fans. There  is far, far more to this beautiful game than mere number-crunching. Try  poetry, drama, romance, myth, legend, simple competitive excitement. This  book seems to miss the other 80-plus percent of the game and those other  80-plus percent of the readers and fans. And even for those who would  rather sit in front of their computers than in the outfield bleachers, the  author's measure of hitting greatness is at best the most narrow possible  measure - the standard but highly unrevealing category of batting averages.  There is much ado about nothing here 
 Definately doesn't live up to What to Expect the First Years.  Somethings are written very vaguely, if at all.  Recently we were looking up hives - nothing!!!!  Just a blurb.  Sorry Arlene Eisenberg, you need to take your time with these books and include everything before you just send it to the presses 
 I also ordered the Errol Le Cain and got the Jane Ray version!  What is the deal?  Why is this happening 
 He obviously lost the contest because INXS wanted someone who could write their own tunes and not be a bar band cover band 
 John Dunning's "Booked to Die" was a New York Times best seller, and also won the prestigious Nero Wolfe Award.  It is one in his series of Denver police procedurals featuring homicide detective Cliff Janeway.  Dunning, who lives in Denver, Colorado,owned the Old Algonquin Bookstore in Denver for many years, and "Booked to Die," (duh!) is set in the world of rare and collectible books.  I really found it an interesting world to enter, and learned quite a bit about it before the book was done.  But do I believe the designated villain, a book dealer, really would have killed?  Not on your life.  And do I believe anyone would kill over some valuable books?  Not on your life.  Of course, I realize that in the current world, it must require great imagination to write a mystery that doesn't feature as villain a ruthless drug dealer with friends in high places; still, one of the first requirements of a mystery, for me at least, is at least temporary believability.  Dunning writes well, he does well by Denver, and, as previously noted, the book trade. He's a thorough-going professional, and the story keeps trucking along, rented U-Haul and all.  As, "I drove south, into the coming snowstorm.  I thought about the U-Haul truck and the mileage that Bobby Westfall had racked up.  I thought about Greenwald and the screwed-up Ballards and the turtle-faced man.  Snow began to crust around the edges of my windshield.  The road was getting slick."  Still, the book has a paint by numbers feel to me, or rather it has no feeling, to me.  Supporting characters are cut from the finest cardboard. I'd say the book didn't touch my emotions, but that wouldn't be entirely true.  It left me with a bad feeling.  Consider: the first love interest deserts Janeway without a word when he leaves the police force.  A woman who's met up with the book's actual designated bad guy in an unpleasant way is a total senseless irrational coward, keeping herself and everybody else in continuous jeopardy.  Suspicion is cast on the book's later love interest, a ploy that's been used untold times by writers better than Dunning.  And a 19-year old female character, introduced only to be killed shortly, is made a Glaswegian Scot, no less, and stuck with the given name of Elspeth Pride, known as"Pinky" by her friends. For heaven's sake, if you're giving a character only 30 pages to live, at least give her a humane name.  My yiddische grandmother, whom I loved, used to say of someone she disliked," he should live and be well."  After that came an unpoken sentence: "But not in my vicinity."  Dunning should write and be well, but not in my vicinity.    
 First of all, in this book Monique said that she weighs 220lbs.  I dont think so.  Maybe at one time she did, in high school.  I dont think she was really being real in this book for some reason.  I read the first chapter and maybe 2 pages into the next chapter but couldnt get any futher.  Instead I looked at the black and white pictures she had through out the book.  Being as I dont have anything to read at this monment I might pick the book up and try to read it again in one of my totally bored moments.  Other than that, I really expected more out of this book.  Glad I borrowed it from my sister instead of buying it.  Better luck next time Monique 
 Thankfully this was not the first CD I bought by this artist - it was not a big hit with me. The work on this album can not compare to the other CD's he has released since. His other CD's have converted me to country music  and convinced me that Tracy Lawrence is the very best. He has only improved  over time- - like a fine wine 
 I tried to read this book.  I really did try, but I gave up on page 52 because I couldn't take Mr. Neely's pathetic attempts at being amusing.  He seems to feel that he has to be 'cute' because a straight book on playing the piano wouldn't be interesting enough.  Or perhaps he didn't have enough to say and had to pad the book somehow.  The one bright spot is that I took this book out of the library instead of wasting money on it 
 Just finished this book last night. Skipped large chuncks of it, as the only reason I was trying to even finish the thing is to find out what it was that happened 15 years ago.  I got this book as part of a giftbag at a Shecky's NYC event, and it took me a while to get to the book. Unfortunately, it's not realy well written, and the plot is sort of contrived (hence, the vast skipping of whole passages). The whole book revolves around some mysterious thing that happened 15 years ago and is surrounded by chunks and bits of events leading up to it, but with no real value.   While I appreciate Ms. O'Connor's effort at writing, for her first work she just doesn't quite pull through. The characters - while pretty well developed - were not entirely interesting and didn't conjure empathy from me. They were just a bunch of "messed up" girls due to "messed up" parents, suffering some "messed up" situations, and that's what the entire book goes on and on about.  Ms. O'Connor definitely has the potential to pull together something much better in her future work, but her writing style, use of analogies and similies, and descriptiveness, are all rudimentary still. It seems like she tried to add some shock and titillary value to the book by all the sex scenes, but that easily reduces it to the same levels of your average romance novel plus noir.  Anyway, the only thing I really liked about it was the Bay Area setting for one of the characters, because each mention conjured up happy memories for me 
 [the two stars here are for the audiobook only. I give the book six stars.  I loved the book. Best book I've read in years. Couldn't put it down.  But the audiobook is dismal. The voice artists are amateurish, their speech clumsy and unnatural. It's as though they're reading from a script that they haven't rehearsed and they don't know how to get "in character". The attempts at foreign accents are overdone and painful to listen to.  (I love listening to audiobooks and radioplays. I listen to many hours of BBC World Service every day. I know what foreign accents sound like. Not like these).  I strongly recommend that you find a preview of this audiobook before buying it, to see if you'll dislike it as much as I do. Or buy the book instead. Heck, buy five copies of the book like I did and give them to your friends. Awesome book 
 I find it hard to believe that the author has even visited Cuba, let alone lived there. Not being an American, I have legally spent quite a bit of time in Havana myself - and not as a tourist, either - and there are so many glaring inconsistencies between this book and the realities it describes, I would have sworn it was written by someone who was only going on third-party descriptions and their own wild imagination.  Jineterismo is indeed a gaping wound in Cuban society, but it certainly doesn't work the way this book describes it - quite far from it. There is a lot of uncommon ground between Cuban-style jineterismo and generic western-type prostitution, and this author's take is remarkably closer to the second one. To give an example: no Cuban jinetera would be "sitting by herself" anywhere, let alone at a "cafe near the Habana Libre Hotel," and with a "stack of papers" in front of her no less. That picture is straight out of the US, and anyone doing said things in Cuba would never, ever be mistaken for anything other than a foreigner, not even by the naivest American tourist. More importantly, the jineteras sell romance more than they sell sex, which is amongst the most alluring things about them. One may pay them, but one is always left with the impression that they're being generous and "helping out" someone with whom they had a good time, not contemptuously paying a professional for services rendered as described in the book.  The book may be enjoyable as a read - I don't know, as personally I was unable to finish it for being so annoyed with the false picture it paints. My own impression is that it is naive and rather sophomoric. If you do choose to read it, please keep in mind it is pure fiction. If a literary glimpse into modern-day Cuba (shocking underworld included) is what you're after, there are far better books out there by Cuban authors, and even an excellent relevant collection of short stories and book excerpts 
 This is misleading...not even 5% of the Ruskin masterwork is printed in this book.  
 This book is so small that I can't believe it. And, it's not very inspirational either.  The photos are small and the print is even smaller.  I don't recommend this book 
 I picked up a copy of the first edition originally published in 1977 years ago at a used bookstore, mainly for some of the wonderful drawings.  While I can generally recommend that original edition this book has gone downhill over the years in my view. The original drawings were warm and natural, the newer one's have a harder, colder edge to them.  The most decadent the original edition got was in describing pot and poppers...now we've got info on crystal meth, cocaine and other hard, life-destroying drugs.  Far from being an objective reference book on gay sex this book has always had a pretty obvious agenda...namely selling the promiscuous casual-sex lifestyle the authors saw as liberating.  This lifestyle isn't limited to gay men of course but it was rather new and enticing for our long oppressed group when the book was first published.   Entries on long term partners or couples is brief and halfhearted but entries on watersports, rimming, fisting, etc. are extensive.  From the authors writing style one would gather that anyone not into these esoteric practices just isn't opening themselves up to their true desires.  The real problem however, is that instead of having a nice, long entry on a topic like anal sex, covering both it's history and all the issues, Joy is more interested in cramming in every weird, esoteric "gay" practice that it can in order to be called definitive.  Whether waxing rhapsodic in a new entry like 'shaving' or belittling the promising trend toward a lighter-skinned physical ideal for us caucasions rather than an overly sun-leathered look the book too often rubs me the wrong way with it's (overstated) opinions.    The best gay sex manual ever written was published by Gay Sunshine Press the same year as the original Joy of Gay Sex (1977) and is also still in print.  It is Men Loving Men by Mitch Walker (revised in 1985 and 1994).  It has beautiful illustrations (especially the hippie influenced original) and a joyous, loving, holistic writing style.  Gay Sex by Jack Hart (revised in 1998) is also very good and again, with wonderfully sexy drawings.  These other books deal with casual sex as well but they don't sell it with the relentlessly aggressive manner that this book does.  If you find many of the practices detailed in this book variously unappealing or scary at least you can rest assured that there are wonderful other books out there that don't feel the need to detail every bizarre practice under the sun 
 I thought I'd find more logical techniques for sleep from Dr Brazelton since I enjoy all his other books, but this book just follows the old-school cry it out method. I did find many non-crying solutions in a newer book called the No Cry Sleep Solution. 
 In case anyone else is looking for it, the song that's playing during the stolen cheer (the one that begins with "Brr, it's cold in here") is The 900 # by The 45 King. It's too bad they left it off the soundtrack 
 Ray Johnson is a virtually unknown figure of the Pop Art scene and his story is filled with interesting figures from New York at the time. Additionally his suicide puts a tragic spin on his biography. I was disappointed though once I saw that 'How to Draw a Bunny' was not going to let the viewer at the information so easily. What you do get is interesting enough but it comes with an soundtrack consisting of drum riffs that is engineered at the same level as the interviews which proved to be very distracting. About 30 minutes into the film I realized that I had yet to see any of Johnson's work in the film. When it does appear it is quickly cut, cropped, or shown in bits.   'HTDAB' does not suffer from lack of information. After a while, I got the feeling that the filmmaker had almost too much information and interviews often stray off unrelated to each other. I was left to wonder why some anecdotes went on for five minutes while other more interesting ones were cut off to quickly.  At times too much of a 'personal touch' interferes with the film. Why for instance do we need to see a re-creation of a valentine xerox work of Johnson? Was the filmmaker concerned that it might serve to undermine the actual work? Its not too much of a shame...you get the point of the film -and Johnson's collage and xerox work- rather quickly but the details that are supposed to be the meat of any documentary are downplayed by the garnish.  
 Sure, I had fun reading this book.  But the Amazon reviewer who termed it "highly speculative" is understating the case.  Opinion, conjecture, hearsay, and speculation too often take the place of thorough, solid documentation.  And unlike many other Amazon reviewers, I found McLellan's tone off-putting.  She alternates between patronizing her subjects (the very notion of calling them "my girls," for instance) and setting them up primarily as sources of voyeuristic thrills for the herself and the reader.  Is the book dishy and intriguing and flamboyant?  You bet.  But is the topic of lesbianism in Hollywood well-served here?  I don't think so 
 I read this book and find it poorly written.  The Author has no real story line, he keeps going off in different directions and never keeping to the story at hand.  He puts too much junk into it.  First rule of any writing - keep it simple and straight to the one and leave the fluff out 
 This book is so dry that I thought that I was reading soda crackers.  If there is valuable information between these covers, it is buried in dust 
 Any blurb that begins: "We think of Europe as the charming continent of windmills and gondolas..." signals a book that doesn't set its sights too high up the evolutionary tree. It's like saying "We think of America as the charming continent of cowboys and obesity". It's treating the reader like a five-year-old.  Yes, Europe has problems. But it doesn't hold the copyright on riots, minorities that can't be assimilated or no-go zones in ethnic ghettoes. If more citizens of your wonderful country actually shifted their butts out of their air-con SUVs, got passports and came to visit Europe, you wouldn't need silly, patronising books like this. And, yes, we've got windmills and gondolas, if that's what makes you happy. 
 I subscribed in late May to MaximumPC and PCGamer. Early July I started getting PCGamer.  Still nothing from MaximumPC.  I called customer service and they said they had recieved my order June 2nd and to expect my first issue in late September. Thats nearly four months! That is an unreasonable wait relative to the industry standard and clearly outside the stated wait on the order form. I gave one star because the magazine is a good magazine. But at a $8.99 news stand price it is too expensive... so I am left with the choice of spending almost $35 to get the four months worth before my subscription starts (more than the subscription itself) or just missing out on those issue.  Very poor customer service.  
 I read this book on the advice of a friend who said it was an american literary masterpiece.  To my surprise I found the book boring and devoid of any value.  Miller spews out a self-absorbed diatribe intermingled with profane and tedious nonsense.    After a while I thought - why am I wasting precious time on this book?   There are other far better literary works.   
 This book is an outcome of the Copenhagen Consensus 2004. Eight economists ranked 38 proposals for spending $50 billion to address ten problems - climate change, communicable diseases, conflicts, access to education, financial instability, government corruption, hunger, migration, sanitation and clean water, and subsidies and trade barriers.  The book proposes that these problems - many caused by globalisation, or imperialism as we call it - can only be solved by more globalisation. But are they really global problems, needing global solutions? Aren't these problems spread unevenly across the world's nations? Shouldn't every people make their own assessment of what they must do to improve their lives?  The idea of ranking problems across the world ignores countries' different needs. Each country should decide how much to spend on what. It would be silly to put all their money into preventing diseases, and spend nothing on clean water.   The economists supported public, not private, health services, "Health economists almost universally accept that market failures in health are so great that governments must intervene." But they ranked trade liberalisation third and easier migration for skilled workers tenth. Don't free movements of capital and labour cause problems? As one of them, Jan Pronk, wrote, "Financial and monetary instabilities increase with globalisation, and economic inequality as well" and "Market reforms can lead to ... more rather than less poverty. ... in Africa and South Asia urban and rural poverty increased."   Some of the economists observed that capital controls shielded countries from shocks caused by capital movements. Some noted that migration of professional people from South to North robs developing countries of the fruits of their investment, and reduces wages, and increases profits, in the developed countries. Others believed that the more open the economy, the less unequal and corrupt it was, which would be news to Enron workers in the USA.   The economists ranked at 16th, 17th and 18th proposals to address climate change - two forms of carbon tax, and implementing the Kyoto Pact. "The panel recognised that global warming must be addressed, but agreed that approaches based on too abrupt a shift towards lower emissions of carbon were needlessly expensive."  Finally, though, they did not recognise that some countries do the lot, without aid and without the advice of foreign economists. Cuba, for instance, controls diseases through its universal health services, prevents conflicts, educates all its people, has stable finances, curbs corruption, feeds its people, controls migration, ensures sanitation and clean water for all, and controls pollution. It supports its industries and controls capital and trade. Cuba disproves the book's assumption that capitalism is the best, indeed the only, choice for us all. 
 In this award-winning novel for young people, all the black people (with possibly one exception) are honest, kind, hard-working, ambitious, intelligent, and good looking.  All the white people (with one or two exceptions) are cruel, dishonest, malevolent red-necks, who persecute the "colored people" for no reason at all.  Historically, there's some truth to the setting and events, and we all admit that blacks were sometimes persecuted in the past.  But that was then.  This is now.  Times have changed, but young people are still required to read this one-sided tripe.  Let's hope that English teachers will eventually recognize this poorly written novel for what it is. 
 I read a lot of books and have been doing a number of reviews and this is one of the only books that I couldn't finish. After beginning to read this book I found that it just bounced all over the place. The book was not focused on anything or anyone in particular especially Andrew Jackson. If the book did focus on one thing in particular then it was details of the types of personalities some of the men around Jackson had, which I am not sure how one could be so familar with that not knowing any of the people personally. Sure you can learn something about personalities from letters but the detail about personality types was too much. Spending too much time on small detail does not make for great reading nor does it help one to see the big picture behind the story. So if what you like in a book is learning about personality types you will love this book.   The book also seemed to be written by a some what biased point of view by the author. The title should have been something like Politics in the early 1800's. This book will NOT keep your attention from one page to another. If you want to know more about Andrew Jackson spend your money on something else! 
 I thought this book would provide information (it does, but very little) about the lazy scholarship and outright denial that many leftist, particularly, in academia have about communism.  The book ends up being a whole lot of name calling, and very little presenting of actual facts.    I recognize the schizophrenic love affair the left has with communism and am always looking for more and more (as if it was needed) facts to show how evil and devestating communism is.  Instead, this book belongs on the bookshelf next to Al Franken and Ann Coulter and more ideological shrieking.   Don't waste your time, this book is so much fluff.  I only gave this book two stars because, it rightly points out the state of denial someone must still be in to think communism is a good government system 
 There soon will be published a four-page review of this book, by my hand, in the journal 'Vigiliae Christianae'.  What follows here, is the summary of that review : 	Louth's 'Maximus the Confessor' wants to provide an  introduction to the theological thinking of Maximus the Confessor, a goal  the author hopes to achieve by providing translations of some of Maximus'  major theological treatises, especially 'Ambigua ad Thomam' and 'Ambigua ad  Johannem'. 	Although both the editor of the series 'The Early Church  Fathers' and Louth himself stress the necessity of an accessible modern  translation of "key texts by the major Fathers", Louth's  translation of Maximus leaves a lot to be desired. 	First of all, his  negligent treatment of the original Greek text has been the cause of a  number of annoying mistakes in the translations.  In more than one case,  these mistakes even twist Maximus' theology in a way the Confessor himself  would not have agreed upon. 	It is hard to believe that the author of  this kind of translations has been able to provide such a sound and correct  introduction to them.  However, it goes without saying that the real  sources for further study of Maximus' thinking, i.e., the Confessor's  works, have not become more accessible by this edition.  On the contrary,  the numerous inaccuracies and definite errors in the translations might in  the future result in some strange conclusions about Maximus' theological  thinking

 In the years since September 11th, 2001 many authors have tried their hands at the 9/11 novel, with all of its delicate subject matter, and thus far they have met with only limited degrees of success: Jonathan Safran Foer, Julia Glass, Wendy Wasserstein, and others have centered novels on the pre- and post-9/11 era, and now Claire Messud takes her turn with "The Emperor's Children," a novel set during the months preceding and immediately following that horrific day. The titular 'emperor' is Murray Thwaite, a prestigious journalist living the quintessential Manhattan lifestyle: fame, money, parties, and the adoration of literati and socialites alike. He has cultivated an image based on truth and integrity, although those charactersitics are notably lacking in his actual person. His 'children' are the people immediately surrounding him, captivated by his presence and hoping to coast on his celebrity with varying degrees of maliciousness. At the novel's onset most of them are suffering from some form of paralysis about their life's direction. First and foremost is Marina, Murray's daughter, who seems hopelessly trapped in a prolonged adolescence -- afraid that if she grows up and tries to make her way in the world she will be unable to live up to her famous father's reputation (the thought of disappointing him is particularly troubling to her). It is easy to forget that Marina is 30 years old because she is quite deliberately written like a high school aged socialite. Then there is Murray's nephew, Frederick "Bootie" Tubb,  who has grown up in awe of his distant uncle and comes to Manhattan after dropping out of college to ask him to be his mentor. Bootie, an intelligent but overly philosophical and idealistic young man, quickly becomes disillusioned with Murray (for who could possibly live up to the lofty expectations that celebrity produces?), and becomes determined to expose his uncle for the charlatan he believes him to be. Complicating things further is Ludovic Seeley, a smarmy Australian businessman who has come to Manhattan to start his own magazine -- and aims to shake up the existing journalistic order by dethroning the reigning king. Ludovic is such an arrogant cliche that all he needs is a mustache to sinisterly twirl to be an outright cartoon. Lastly, there are Marina's best friends: Julius, a gay hanger-on from chilly Michigan eager to make an impression on the New York social scene, and Danielle, who is presumably the humane center for the novel to pivot on, but suffers from such ludicrous Ally McBeal-esque crises in her love life that her credibility is dangerously suspect after the first hundred pages. The characters are uniformly pretentious and are alternately mildly and seriously annoying, but Messud manages to propel her novel forward despite their intrinsic unlikability because, as shallow as they are, they are all multi-layered, complex, believable people. The many threads comprising the narrative are expertly weaved together for some compelling character studies (even if you wouldn't necessarily want to hang out with the lot of them). But that willingness to stick with their stories is, at least for me, predicated on the belief that they will be changed people by the novel's end. They aren't. And while the narrative is expertly crafted, Messud has a penchant for overusing commas in her prose that becomes, increasingly, irritating, as she uses them to stretch out her sentences, and to add separate thoughts, or descriptive elements, and even, occasionally, dialogue, so that they feel like run-ons, like this one right here, this example I've devised for you, but are, for the most part, technically, grammatically sound, even though you may have to re-read the most trying sentences a second time, just to figure out what she is saying, without letting all of her distractions get in the way.   Messud does an admirable job building suspense as the chapters go by and September 11th draws near. There is a great degree of foreshadowing to be found, some directly indicating that September will be a month of great change, what with Ludovic's magazine set to launch on the 13th and a wedding to take place, but naturally none of the characters can predict just how fateful the month will prove to be. The sense of impending disaster looms large in "The Emperor's Children," and it is quite unfortunate that the novel loses steam when tragedy actually strikes. Indeed, 9/11 is almost anticlimactic when it occurs, serving merely as a catalyst to wrap up everyone's story lines. It was unbearably annoying to endure the outrageously selfish way that the characters responded to the attacks and the gross loss of life that they witnessed. In the late afternoon of that day, after the towers had fallen and Manhattan's skyline was irrevocably altered forever there wasn't a lot of soul searching going on in the hearts and minds of these characters. All they care about are their own petty problems and how the terrorists ruined their carefully planned calendars (I felt like throwing the book across the room in disgust when Ludovic had the audacity to go on a tirade about how his precious magazine's launch had to be cancelled). I live in the tri-state area, about an hour and a half away from Ground Zero, and the events of that day and the intense mourning that followed will be with me for the rest of my life, and what Messud has critically failed to capture is the way that 9/11 actually brought a grieving city closer together for a brief moment in time, and how for once people put aside their petty complaints to work on the larger issue at hand. I remember crying at work alongside my stunned colleagues and the reassuring hugs we gave each other, the phone calls I made to -- and received from -- people I hadn't even spoken to in months or even years, just to make sure that they were all right. I remember the eagerness with which people helped each other out, whether the need was great or small. This incredible outbreak of brotherly love earned the admiration of the world, but it is conspicuously absent from Messud's telling. One character uses the tragedy for personal gain career-wise, one uses it as an excuse to wallow in self pity (not for anything to do with 9/11, mind you, but for strictly personal reasons) ... I don't want to give too much away by outlining the callous behavior that offended me so much, but in my opinion it was woefully inappropriate. I had hoped that tragedy would change the Emperor and his Children for the better, but I was wrong. And it's a shame. Messud is definitely a capable, promising writer -- but this isn't her finest hour 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 I think the only strong points of "The Phantom Menace" is Darth Maul and the lightsaber duals, which I thought were well done, and the visual effects and scenery.  But other than that, "The Phantom Menace" was just an unfortunate mistake.    I think the problem is that Lucas broke one of the unofficial science fiction filmmaking rules: You've-got-to-keep-children-out-of-science fiction-stories.  Or at least show them as little as possible.  How can we take a space dogfight scene seriously when you have a little kid who doesn't know how to pilot a fighter, buzzing all around the battle and saying things like "this is intense?"  I never understood why they felt they had to go that far back into Anakin's life anyway.  Why not just begin the story with Anakin in his twenties and already under the tutelage of Obi-wan?  That's when all the important events began.  And Jar Jar, well, we know the consensus on him.  Well, at least things got more serious again in "Attack of the Clones," and would continue to improve with "Revenge of the Sith. 
 I have no idea why this one's still in print, much less in so many editions, as if it was some sort of classic.  What "Miss Blandish" is, quite simply, is a straightforward rip, in theme, incident, characterization, and plot, of Faulkner's "Sanctuary". If you read "Sanctuary", you'll be  effectively getting the same story, plus a much higher level of writing, plus an introduction to one of the great writers of the past century. So don't waste your time on this thing.  Chase was a serial plagiarist, and also made a play at copying "The Big Sleep". Chandler, faster off the mark than Faulkner, hit him with a lawsuit and forced the book off the market. So you won't find that one on Amazon.  
  "Nothing's okay," Westgate Penitentiary inmate Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster) says, "I gotta get out."  That's because the sadistic screws are keeping the otherwise tractable inmates down with BRUTE FORCE.  You treat a man like an animal and he turns into one, right?   At least so sayeth the usually reliable director Jules Dassin in this overripe movie about a prison on the edge of explosion.  You see, the bad guys - the inmates - have a backstory, told in a series of flashbacks, that proves they're good guys under the prison grays.  They just got hooked up with bad women who made them do bad things.  Flashbacks don't lie.  They don't necessarily entertain, or keep a movie chugging onward at a comfortable clip, but they don't lie.  The prison officials, on the other hand... the otherwise decent warden is weak and vacillating.  The avuncular doctor drowns his reprehension in brandy, emerging from his alcoholic stupor  periodically to crack wry about the inhumanity of it all.   The baddest good guy is Capt. Munsey (`Sir' to you), Hume Cronyn, an effete sociopath with a blood taste for dishing it out (he seems particularly fond of whips) and a penchant for the insinuating seduction.     I wanted to like it, but as BRUTE FORCE plodded forward, piling melodramatic excess on melodramatic excess, I found myself fighting it.  Fighting the notion that everyone in effective authority was a heartless goon, the ineffective ones were broken (presumably by the ruthless System), and the inmates were misunderstood choirboys.  Despite its good looks, good performances and exciting final scene I had too many "Aw, c'mon" moments to honestly say I liked this movie.     The transfer print is in good condition, and the disk includes a hands-free Stills Pressbook Gallery with a number of behind-the-scene photographs, publicity stills, lobby cards and posters. 
 I wanted to give this book ZERO STAR.  But the scale said that I had to give it at least one, so that's all it gets.  I had never read a book by this author but the synopsis of the book read like a good read. It started off so slow that I didn't see where the plot was going anywhere but I kept reading, thinking that something would happen in the next chapter.  After three weeks and 119 pages, I GAVE UP!!  I was more than sadly disappointed.  This is probably the last book I will read by this author.  I'm still wishing I had gone to the public library instead of spending money to add this book to my collection 
 Don't even think about gettin' this on 
 I have had this camera since Jan '05 and have so far taken approximately 10,000 shots while on trips and at weddings.   Don't expect much from it and you will be happy. As an entry level DSLR it does what it's supposed to do in ideal conditions. I find it's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light, provided that they are not moving.    Cons:  In landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well.  Battery dies FAST. The battery I got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting, especially when shooting in RAW mode. I have yet to fill up a 1Gig card when shooting in RAW mode(Approx 150 shots) before the battery dies. Surprisingly when shooting jpegs, I get more shots per charge(Over 300) but hardly enough to last a day. I cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while I was out on a hike. So I always carry a backup film camera (my trusty Elan 7).  The viewfinder is very dim. When I look through my Elan 7 and then through the 300D, it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300D's viewfinder. In indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap, especially when having to resort to manual focus.   Autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible. When shooting indoors, the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject. I have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur. This is despite having a 420Ex Flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus.  The 420EX flash is supposed to "talk" to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed. However, with the 300d, this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over/under exposed.   After about five months, the shutter button started sticking. I would click it and then it would remain depressed. The shutter button would only pop back up after I jiggled it a little.  Another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button. And since there is only one thumbwheel, it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed. For example, if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature, then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel. When you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera, this is a real annoyance.  So would I recommend this camera: If you are a casual point and shoot person, it's an affordable entry into DSLRs that produces decent photos. But if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately, look elsewhere 
 Too many pieces have been performed with stringcord instruments, and I just don't feel good about the sound of classic piano. This is just my personal taste, I guess 
 I was disapinted with this book. It is extremely general and theoretical, never specific. The author uses mostly complicated and technical terms when it is not needed. This book is also very repetitive, certain ideas are repeated over and over. 
 This whisk does not stand up like a wire whisk, it is not sturdy, however it looks very nice sitting in my Emeril tin on the counter 
   This book by the cover appears to be a very in-depth book when in fact it is meant to be a sort of text book. I have taught for over 4 years and this company was a primary source of text books. Over all their text books are of good quality, but leave a bit more to be desired. I found this book to be in-line with my history with this publisher. In fact if I had known that the book was by them I would not have purchased it for myself. That was my mistake for not paying closer attention.    The book offers the typical level of information that I would expect from this publisher. It will provide enough information to dazzle those of you that are not so technically inclined, and may even impress you. For those that have a bit of technical knowledge. You will find the book basic and leaving you at a point where you will either want to know more, or are not sure if this book offered you any more information than you already knew.    Anyone that is serious about finding out information about the Tivo box, the actual software, or remote hacking is pretty basic and offers no real interesting information that will really improve your Tivo experience. It offers information about changing the text and displaying information on the screen that really has no realavence, or benefit.   As for the hardware hacking, this information may be interesting to someone that may be timid about opening the box. If you have any real computer experience, you could have figured most of this information on your own.   In my best oppinion I would pass on this book. In fact if any other Tivo books are of similar quality I would save the money and find a good library to check it out for free. Even if it is late you will have still spent less than the shipping 
 This movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes.  Yes, it is slightly interesting to see the Cannes environment, but not enough to watch this film. It could be a cure for insomnia, though.  Fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed.  You can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen, and it's really just very boring. All those fans of Johnny Depp: be particularly warned. He may have co-star billing, but blink and you'll miss him 
 Probably the most creative part of this book is it's title and jacket. This is not a mystery story, and the search for the lady in the paintings is just a minor journey, interspersed with dozens of peripheral characters that come and go in a flash. Some funny moments halfway through the book in events that probably didn't really happen (his grandmother getting sucked up a garbage chute into the kitchen from the basement during a tornado)are much welcome after his meandering into unrelated asides from classical literature. It's a short book that should have been much shorter 
 I have seldom seen such a bad movie with so much talent.  (David Arquette, Stephen Baldwin, Mickey Rourke, etc.) One wonders what they saw in potential for this script or why they made choices to be involved.  This horribly misguided film centers around a juvenile prank gone awry that ends up involving two bank-robbers who freak and there is enough gratuitous violence and mindless killing (and torture) to last me for the rest of my life.  The film starts out terribly boring and gets more mindless and boring as it concludes, perhaps expecting the violence to make up for the total lack of story.   This is a disaster not worth enduring.  Save the actors and film-makers the embarrassment of seeing this film and see something else.   
 SKYSCRAPER is in one word, awful.  Anna Nicole Smith wouldn't know how to act, and once you've seen her watermelons once, they're not all that attractive.  The two love scenes with the wimpy background songs are some of the worst ever put on celluloid.  The acting is all around atrocious, especially Charles Hubere in the role of Fairfax, the Shakespeare spouting rastaman.  When Anna spouts off to her cop husband, that she wants a baby, you just wanna stick a binkie in her mouth, but not one as big as hers or she'd gag. Which is just what one must do to survive this horrifying cinematic waste 
 I was surprised to find this book very unhelpful in my new tutoring business. It mainly discusses the relationship between the tutorer and tutoree and provides no information on tutoring techniques, etc.  A real  disappointment 
 I am also a big fan of Jillian Hunter, but this book was dreadful. Where was the editor? How did this get published? If this had been the first Jillian Hunter book I had ever read, I'd never read another. But fortunately, I have read the wonderful Bostcastle books first.   I really echo the other reviewer who said she can't believe that Jillian Hunter wrote this. It was just a mess-- scattered characterization, slapstick humor that often didn't work-- it was just a mess. I suppose it had some charm, because I finished it, but I was shaking my head over how dreadful it was all the way along.  And the ending? Who cares if Hannah finally felt like she was home? Why introduce a fully sprung daughter after the poignant scene at her grave?  Sloppy sloppy writing. 
 A compendium of shortcuts and tips and tricks, many of which (to my knowledge) have never been documented before, but there's no indication of where to use them, and why they'll benefit you 
 I'm a fan of Janet Evanovich and her Stephanie Plum series, I think it's laugh out loud funny.  I didn't care for this story at all, it seemed sloppily constructed and I agree with other reviewers, lacked a story line or believable characters.  I left off a few chapters into it, there was no point in finishing.  
 ...essentially you get what you pay for. This book is certanly NOT representative of what I have come to expect from National Geographic.   I had eagerly anticipated the arrival of my book, but was dissappointed to find within the first few pages that it is uninspiring at best. Most of the pictures are poorly executed and at times seem amateurish. In the past I've found photographs by professionals like Steve McCurry ('Portraits')visually arresting. Not so here.  At least it only cost me $20 oredering from Amazon. If I had been able to preview it beforehand, I would not have thought it worth even the discounted price 
 The References were very good,I did not think that the entire book, was simply case histories. Perhaps my expectations were to high , overall the book is good 
 This album is not terrible, it is quite adequate and even sophisticated in a background music sort of way..It is just not very engaging on the forefront though..We all know Alex is a masterful programmer, but the famework that surrounds his beats this time generally does not hold the listeners attention, the album is mostly a showcase for the spastic and weird, rather then evolving beats that engulf a listener into the most immersive experience techno has to offer..You could definitly track this artist's waxing and waning of artistic zeal, with this album continuing Patterson's return to his more dancy, breezy roots, while incorporating the more twisted, dark elements of his post ultraworld releases. 
 Mcmurry is a colourful and over-generalized textbook that presents the most fundamental concepts of organic chemistry without fully elucidating on their logic. Mcmurry's style is to induce learning of 0-chem via memorizing of reaction mechanisms, and other trivial components.  The only reason you should buy this book (same reason I did) is if your o-chem course is based on this; that being, this is your prescribed text. It is far too difficult to study organic chemistry with another textbook. However this may not be the case for this edition of Mcmurry. Organic Chemistry by Wade has the same chapter format, covers essentially the same thing but treats  the fundamental principles with more depth; allowing the reader to appreciate the finer points of organic chemistry.  One thing that irritated me the most about this book was that there is no appendix for IR frequencies of major functional groups, and mass spectra is barely covered. It is at best just mentioned...nothing more. Wade treats the interpretation of spectral data with more clarity and depth...something which is essential in second year chemistry.  All in all this book doesnt even provide a good grounding in the basics. When it discuses KMnO4 oxidatation, that at least should be a review of redox.   The chapters on Substitution and elimination reactions as well as further chapters in aromatic chemistry are satisfactory, but it is the basics that are lacking. I would suggest for first time o-chem students to consult Wade and compare it to the writing style of Mcmurry. Albeit Mcmurry is very nice and colourful, you will regret its lack of depth and its over simplification of organic chemistry.  The book itself is supplemented with another spectroscopy book here in Australia, which suggests the severe lackings of this book. This has been inherent in it for the last three editions...Not too happy with it 
 Vincent Canby isn't exactly a good critic.  His review style isn't bad, but the way that he watches movies and evaluates them has no visible sophistocation, and his general opinions just aren't right: he gave a negative review to "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980), and was the only film critic in the world to do so -- not that he had any decent reasons.  He said in his review that he was often looking at his watch during the movie.  Was he in the right movie?  I don't know, but I really don't want to know what other blasphemic things he has done.  You can't trust a film critic who finds one of the most exciting movies ever made "boring."  Opinions can be wrong 
 All this book does is tell the same spells over agian that are in the Players Handbook like Ivisibility or wish of Polymorph other so please don't waste your time with this boo 
 i purchased this book, mainly because of my love for michael moore's work and i wanted to see what the other side had to say. however, most of the book simply pointed out flaws in michael moore's character, rather than attack the things he had to say. im sure most of us could assume that michael moore was not the easiest person to get along with. i was upset when reading this book, as i am with most political books, because rather than put up well spoken arguments, the author just bashes anyone who believes otherwise. i am a liberal and was disgusted when reading certain parts of this book, mostly because it consisted of essays trying to debase liberals and not much else. the things they pointed out about michael moore's movies/books that were false were good points, however they were trivial when compared to the larger things that moore had to say. overall, i was not impressed with what this book had to say, i was insulted, and it looks like i wasted a fair amount of money 
 The quality of the DVD's was good. However I did not like the third season as well as the first two seasons. It seemed that the story was setting up for season 4. 
 ....poorly written re-hash of "Rock's Mystical Lady".  This book was so unnecessary!!!  If you are a Stevie Nicks fan, you could do your own research on the web and get more information yourself!  Don't bother reading this book.  As for the pictures....they are all black and white...not that great...some are interesting.   If Wincentsten was aiming to do a photo book on Stevie, he should have marketed it as such and gone all out with color photos, ect.  He should definitely give up trying to "write" about her.  This is info my 10 yr old sister could find online 
 This book goes on my list of the worst books I have ever read.  It took me 3 tries and a five days to get through the introduction. I had to read it for my Ap US History class, and sure, it was very educational. (I have a test on it tomorrow, so let's see how much I retained) It just took FOREVER!  I spend 7 days locked in my room while on vacation in the beautiful Smokey Mountains. Those 5 days it took me to read the intro are not included. I read all day every day and it bored me to death.  I constantly drifted off and fell asleep reading it four out of those 7 days.  I liked the last chapter... because it was the last. 
 This was the first Ludlum book I have read.  I bought several and now am thinking I've wasted my money.  He took a realistic story and destroyed it with an unbelievable plot.  All the bad guys, who have so much power that they can have anyone in the world killed within 24 hours of the victim hearing about the Secret Plot to control the World cannot even protect their top masterminds from being kidnapped by a New York lawyer, his consultant ex-wife, and a couple of low-level military officers.  Then, each bad guy willingly spills everything about the Secret Plot merely upon learning that one of his colleagues has insulted him?  Give me a break.  Don't even get me started on how unrealistic the relationship is b/w the main character and his ex-wife.  Give the book as a gift to your 12 year old nieces and nephews, but don't waste your time or money on this if you are over 12 years old 
 My daughters are not Barbie doll fans...but they do like the movies. So do I.  All but this one. The Pegasus were beautiful...but it stopped there.  We thought Barbie was too snotty and disrepectful in her manner of speaking. Bring back the nice Barbie!  Her 'boyfriend' was just as snotty.  We didn't like the evil Wenlock...and the way he preys on teenage daughters forcing them into marriage.  In one scene Wenlock throws a tray of food into one of his wives face. That was shocking and sad.  Our copy of this dvd went into the trash 
 The special effects are very poor. The mixing of horror with humor and a teenage type script just doesn't do it for me. Not recommended 
 The songs are poor, the recording quality is worse. For some reason no one can duplicate the sacd multichannel quality in Dire Straits or Allison Krause 
 When I first got diagnosed with ADD (as an adult) I believe the exact phrase "You mean I'm not lazy, crazy or stupid?" went through my mind.  FINALLY, there was an explanation.    So when I heard about a book by that name, certainly I had to check it out.  Once I did though, I was sorely disappointed.   I have ADD, yes.  Nevertheless, I've still managed to get pretty far in life in spite of the "handycap" the authors of this book seem so eager to hide under.   It's been a while since I read it, but I have the distinct recollection of finding some new example of a "You can't succeed in the world because you are 'disabled'" mentality on every page.  You can't do this, you can't do that, you've failed and you will continue to fail - just accept it.   Excuse me?  I don't know about the authors of this book, but MY ADD makes me creative and intuitive and perceptive and just generally a genuinely unique and awesome person (egomania aside).  Where is this addressed?  Where are the helpful hints for harnessing THAT kind of potential?  If they're in there, I sure didn't see them.  All I found were new little tricks for combatting the "affliction" with which I am (oh so unfortunately) beset.  Using these tricks, I can hope against hope for some semblence of a "normal" life they say.  Thanks but no thanks.  I'm doing pretty well so far, and I refuse to feel like some sort of mental cripple.  If you, and the authors are happy considering yourself as something less than the rest of the world because of the way your mind works, feel free - this is the perfect book for you.  But you can count me out.  
 I saw the movie before I read the book and, as many know the book is almost always better than the movie. Well this is the exception. The movie was visually stunning and the story was touching. I am of the opinion that there is nothing more fulfilling when it comes to reading, than a good love story unfortunately this book does not deliver. Maybe it's because the book is more fantastic than it is love story and I went in to it with the wrong mind set. Don't even get me started on the lame ending. If you want a good love story skip the book and watch the movie 
 Eww! I read this book because it was recommended in a well-known woman's magazine. Obviously, it was a paid review. Boring, unbelieveable, poor character development, I didn't care about the characters and the story was PREDICTABLE.  This is the only book by Norah Roberts I have ever read, and I have no reason to want to read others. If you like to read confession magazines and formulaic romance novels, perhaps you will like Montana Sky too, although it is a step down from the worst romance novel I ever read.  I read the entire book...I kept waiting for it to take off.  Don't buy this book, don't even waste your time borrowing it from the library. It really is that bad 
 Why are there so many insanely positive reviews for this book?  Honestly, what has this author contributed to the world with this book?  Was it the characters?  No, they've all been used and reused and used some more in practically every other work of fiction in the last fifty years (i.e. cocky and handsome FBI agent, beautiful but dangerous killer with a past, take-no-sh#t FBI boss, etc.).  Was it the deep insight into the characters themselves?  A laugh out loud, "No!".  There was nothing coming close to character development.  Was there some new and clever writing style?  Unless you count having two page chapters revolutionary (I call it a way to have a two hundred page novella turned into a four hundred page novel).  How about the plot?  Was that something worth my time?  Not unless you haven't ever watched suspence movie in your life.    So honestly, what the hell makes this book worth anyone's time?  All I can find in this book are two dimensional characters, needless sub-plots, ludicris dialogue, and empty promises (we're lied to about the main character's fate in the beginning and we're lied to about this being a thriller in the vein of Hitchcock).    As a person who has turned to the world of novels to escape Hollywood's onslaught of needless, pointless, and time wasting strategy of churning out movie after movie of pure garbage I can trully say that this is the type of book that will doom us all into a market of hurried and horribly bad novels to take our hard earned money.    This man does not deserve our money and certainly does not deserve to write anything other than an apology letter to the world for dumbing us down into thinking that this type of writing is anything other than trash 
 Perhaps useful if you own a large sailboat, but not very relevant for a lake-bound 23' powerboat.  Expected more diagrams 
 I am so sorry I read this book under the illusion it was a mystery type of book. The author has been writing on the edge of fictional biography/mystery, and this time she crossed the line.  I got bewildered when the "plot" never turned up, the bad guys were just so unimportant that the twins linguistic skills just overrode their appearance on the scene and Peabody's maternal instincts just couldn't be bothered with evil doers.  The book is probably fine for those who bought the author's work for reading about the sentimental family interrelations but for those who expected something more exciting it is a dissapointment.  I feel as if I was sold this book on false pretenses.  
 While the book is amusing, I highly doubt it is based on fact. I am not arguing the entire book to be false, but I did research (ended up doing a paper on it for one of my college classes in fact) on the so-called real Ten Commandments.  Technically, Kick is correct. The "Ritual Commandments" he listed are labeled in the Bible as the Ten Commandments. However, if he had read any other part of the Bible he would have seen that this was the second list given to Moses; the first one being the "Ethical Commandments" which we are all familiar with. Both of these lists, among several other decrees, were equally important to the people. Whenever referring back to the commandments, the ethical ones are always used. Plus, for Christians anyway, after Jesus all of the old laws were abolished. The Ethical Commandments were summed up in two laws: Love God and only God, and Love your neighbor as yourself. It only took me 10 minutes to read part of Exodus and see he was twisting the truth. If he can get such an easily researchable topic wrong, then how am I to have faith in anything else he says 
 I really truely wish I would read reviews and stop ordering from Amazon. All four pieces are broken. One in tiny bits. Stupid me just opened the package from a month ago! 
 I wanted to learn more about Bantam Chickens as I was interested in keeping them as pets in my backyard.  Although the writer gives quite a bit of information, the info given was very discouraging and I gave up the idea after reading the book.  Months later I found a website that gave a more down-to-earth approach that inspired me to try keeping Bantams as pets.  Also, as with many other books on animals, the writer seems to fall back on the many diseases a chicken could possibly contract as a way to fill pages.  If you wrote a book about Humans, you could imagine how many pages could be devoted to disease, rather than more interesting aspects of Humans or their behavior. I'm sorry I bought this book.  
 If Elmer J. Fudd is ever turned into being grasping, greedy and witless, it will be because Warner Brothers read this book. 
 Some very fine dancing from the dancers when the soloists can get free from the Soviet rechoreographing and replotting and a really visually insipid American production -- which recalls Coney-Island side-shows (as in On the Town, for example).  Sets, lighting and (especially) the intermission/interval "interviews" are cringe-making and naive.  Pity they can't be deleted.  "Atmosphere" is sqeaky-clean, phoney and abjectly PC  -- would you ever believe that these girls were supposed to be "slaves"!?  Orientals are seen as drivelling idiots.  Orchestral music is finely played.  But the whole cheerful, jaunty production has no confidence in what it is doing, which it ought to have even if the Byronic "plot" is admittedly fustian.  The comments of the staff show that that they're quite willing to snort and send the whole thing up.  This production trivializes everything it touches and reduces the ballet to a series of individual excellent performances.  Alas, for the ballet see the Kirov production instead.  Petipa was a genius. The audience loved the production.   
 I so hate to say it, but this book was an embarrassment to the series. I bet poor Lilian is rolling over in her grave over this one. It was much to do about nothing. I used to really enjoy her series about Qwill and the cats; however, I do believe if they can't get better ghost writers for poor 'Lil', then it's time to put old Quill and the cats to bed. 
  Feel  author has the technical knowledge but should focus on the common classics with enough detail for one to comprehend disassembly procedures. I've got every clock making tool available and I could not get the cover off the winder gear of an old common Cannon 
 I bought this for my 9 year old without looking at it. There is a picture of Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake and the wardrobe malfunction. When did that become a world record? I wish I hadn't bought this 
 I came to this book after having seen it referenced in a number of more general books with chapters on cellular automata. The book describes numerous experiments in varying levels of detail that are suitable for running on cellular automata. The example experiments are both abstract (`Life' or `Parity' rules) and concrete (simulation of physical systems). Little attention is paid to simulating either social or biological processes. There is a lot here but the level of detail is poor. Many explanations of the simulations assume considerable knowledge of the physical systems being simulated or the weaknesses of other approaches that may used. The greatest weakness of this book is that it relies on a specific hardware implementation of a CA machine. All examples require this machine (a PC card) to be installed in your PC in order to run. This card appears to no longer be available (no supplier details are given in the book). The use of Forth (a language using reverse polish notation) to describe rules and the reliance on specific hardware makes the rules discussed difficult to implement on a software CA. The rules presented in the second half of the book are so tied to the hardware implementation of the unavailable PC card as to be impossible to translate directly into English-like rules. This is a definite dud 
 If Tony Hillerman wrote this novel (novella actually), I sure can't tell. I have been a Chee/Leaphorn fan for many years, but this novel is not in the same league with Hillerman's other work. It is reminiscent of a 'B' movie. Instead of building suspense, the plot is laid out all too plainly, the characters are unreal, and the Chee/Bernie romance doesn't ring true.  I am amazed that it was published 
 Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat provides a rather feeble excuse for her limited bibliography and fails to provide adequate citations for many of her assertions. There is an obvious French slant on history throughout the book. And in some cases there appear to be insertions of "local legends" or Francophile dreams for which there is no other evidence than Toussaint-Samat's statement (i.e., fabricated quotations attributed to Charlemagne's biographer in the cheese story on pages 116-117 - look it up!). In a generalized, broad-spectrum work such as this it would be all but impossible to check every fact. But, that being said, the book contains hundreds if not thousands statements of fact and her uncritical (at best!) inclusion of information for which there is no evidence in the source cited brings the whole book, as an authoritative source, into question 
 This book was recommended to me by an accupuncturist who did a great job on my back.  I found it contradictory and ultimately confusing to the point of being useless.  Readers are encouraged to diagnose themselves as being damp or dry, warm or cold, with an interior or exterior issue, and with an excess or a deficiency.  (There may be more categories, that's all I can remember now.)  The main problem with the book is that if one is, say, both damp and cold (which Pitchford states is a common combination) then the dietary advice is contradictory.  One chapter says to eat raw vegetables, the next says no.  One says eat meat, the next says no.  One says fruit, the next says no.  One stresses brown rice, the next says very little brown rice.  In addition, being too far along one axis is the same as being the opposite condition.  If you just said "Huh??" then get used to it if you order this book.    Lastly, the big puzzle to me in reading all these 5 star reviews is that not one person (unless there is a review I missed) discusses how their health was improved, how they lost weight, anything!  Isn't that really the proof of a book on dietary recommendations?    Bottom line:  eat whole foods, not processed, organic if possible, and a variety of produce, whole grains, and small portions of lean meat.  I just saved you 700+ pages of reading and $30-something.  And you're welcome. 
 This book is partitioned into two sections: "Basic Narrative," which is a summary of antiquity from the agararian communities of the ancient Near East (Mesopotamia and Egypt) to the fall of the Roman Empire and the emergence of the Christian community and; "Societies and Cultures," which is a more detailed look at those societies and cultures that fall within the book's qualifications and, to a certain extent, the relevance of those cultures to contemporary, Western society/culture. Every sentence if not every paragraph of the first section is a bold, arguable statement that begs further exposition, discussion or reading. Actually, it appears from the "Guide for Further Reading" at the end of the book, that the first section of this book may be a derivative summary of Cantor's readings of those materials. One might be better off reading those materials for oneself rather than relying on Mr. Cantor's synthesized book reports. Mr. Cantor's use of informal, laymen language makes this book further unsuitable for use as a reference or quotation within a thesis or other scholarly endeavor. The second section of the book loses some of the somewhat cavalier arrogance (which Mr. Cantor may have meant to come across as wit) of the first section but the disjunct writing styles within the section is perplexing. The created interview with St. Augustine is clever but the section on Civil Law lacks clarity and overall what has been cited as "authoritative insight" appears to be Mr. Cantor's ruminations or opinions. While the attempt to cover the breadth of the topic within a couple of hundred pages could be construed as either laudable or [a] folly, the result in this case is an embarrassing attribution to Mr. Cantor's erudition 
 Knight claims to be a  Druidess,  Witch,  Wiccan, Dream expert ... Like McCoy and Conway, you name it, she'll claim it.  Search out the *real* authors ~ the ones who actually have substantial background in their field. Read Grey Cat for Witchcraft. Emma Restall-Orr, Peter Berresford Ellis, or Philip Carr-Gomm for Druidry.  Scott Cunningham or Kerr Cuhulain for Wicca.  If you are genuinely serious about learning of the realm of The Fae, please read an author who has legitimate experience: R.J Stewart.  
 The thermostat on this heater is a waste of time. It has a knob that you can control the thermostat shutoff level with. The trouble is that when you try to adjust to say, 70-85 degrees the sensitivity of the thermostat becomes extreme and you can never get it right. It'll either stay on all the time or never come on until you get to around 65F.  It also smells rather nasty 
 I don't think this book gives an accurate veiw of what kindergarten is like. I teach pre-school and have been to kindergarten classes with the children. This book gives an idea of what pre-school is like 
 The author shows she is obviously making a transition from poetry to prose with this novel.  Her sentences are long and wordy, and her numerous metaphors make little sense in their context.  She goes to great lengths to describe many little and unimportant details, causing the actual story to suffer from lack of content.  Her descriptions of life in general seem unreal - she describes things and events in a way that no person would do in the circumstance.  The storyline is decent in some places, but it is generally hard for the reader to follow.  Many times, I had to go back to read paragraphs and pages again to realize where the author was going.  It is true there were many points in which I wanted to stop reading all together, which is a rarity.  I was altogether disappointed in the book.  I thought it would be decent, from all the literary awards it had won, but it really was just pages of fluff and poetry disguised as prose 
 This book stinks. It's filled with a little of everything but not enough of the right information. Pass... if you really want to see the book check it out of the library and save the money 
 I must agree with the review that appeared this week in the TLS (Times Literary Supplement, London, 27.01.00), which managed to describe the book without talking about the social character of knowledge - except to say  that Goldman has a 'dirigiste' view of how knowledge should be controlled  and communicated in society. His own euphemism is 'epistemic paternalism',  and readers might want to judge for themselves what it all means, once the  dogmatic philosophising and gratuitous formalising is removed. This reader  found the implications rather scarey, though luckily this philosophical  stuff rarely gets beyond the seminar room. A definite step from back (and  away) from Fuller's work on social epistemology - and even more  conservative types like Kitcher and Longino 
 Lots of nice bungalow pictures if that's what you want. Doesn't appear as this book had an editor, so many typos and errors. If you need a book that will help you decide on colors don't waste your money on this one. The color photography although nice, does not come close to matching the actual colors named in the text. On top of that the colors described in the text are often just plain wrong. The Sherwin Williams Color Chips in the book are totally off when compared to the actual color chip card from Sherwin Williams. The icing on the cake is that the book binding was so poor it disintegrated after about a week of limited usage. The good news is, this book is now serving a more suitable role as part of a landfill. What a waste of money 
 This sound dictates a socially contructed "norm"......there is so much more out there to experience.....maybe this sound is reflective of a pop culture and society that dwells in thoughtless consumption, capitalist greed, spoilt little teenage brats and the "I want more and more" attitude.....this middle aged lady is assisting in forcing you all to lead "mono" thought lives......get over it and get out of your socially constructed lives....Kylie is an unthoughtful, talentless, pseudo accented woman and i feel a little sorry for her.....it would actually be quite sad to look back on your life and realise that you were responsible for something as hideous as this 
 I sincerely expected much more from the author of "Guns, Germs and Steel" than this booklet that thrives on the trivia of evolutonary psychology. It's  obious why is sex fun- to encourage reproduction - and I expected the author went beyond this self-evident fact. Bit it didn't. And, excuse me, Dr. Diamond, how you account for gay sex in your reasoning? Homosexuality is totally  overlooked, yet it's one of the mayor puzzles of  human sexuality- and of sexuality in general. Dr. Diamond, I'm very disappointed 
 IMPORTANT: Find a mobile with the option of it working, while being silent w/out music.  I thought this mobile was great for the first 5 minutes, but then I quickly realized, I couldn't get the thing to shut up- darn it- they didn't put that option on it! How can this be? It is a $40+  dollar mobile. My baby just wanted to see it go, but the music, and sliding beads put him over the edge. This mobile is too loud, and the sliding beads are loud as well. It stimulates baby too much. Even after covering it up and arranging it under the bumper pad- it was still too loud.   The motion is actually quite hypnotizing and great, but "Tiny Love" RUINED it by not putting a "silent running feature button" on it.  I'd pay $60 for it if it would just be quiet!!!   If this mobile worked without sound it would be wonderful. As it is now, I can't use it that much- only when baby is at his happiest. Even then, the mobile wears him out- and ruins his happy state, because it is too loud.  I think I shall pry it open and try to break the speaker.  I am serious.  I rated it with one star, because I can only use it when my baby is at his most rested and happiest state. If he is the least bit tired, it overstimulates him and makes him cry.  
 Once I finished reading this book, Robert W Smith made a really terrible impression as both an individual, a writer and a martial artist. He writes and communicates in an arrogant and conceted manner. However his book on Baguazhang was a lot better. This book is a waste of money, though you will find out what one American thinks, if that is what you want. His attitudes about chinese martial arts on Taiwan and on China are biased. He just seems to really dislike China.  
 I eagerly awaited the arrival of this book, but was sorely disappointed. Granted, the language was challenging at times (I kept a dictionary close by), but I just couldn't empathize with the  main character, Max. The story dragged on. I couldn't wait to finish it (I swore I would). What a waste of time. I'll be giving this book away at the next yard sale 
 Disappointing.  Looks like she was trying to wrap up the trilogy without putting too much effort into it.  It lacked much of the depth and richness of her previous books 
 Don't be fooled. This book has a title very similar to The Ultimate Book of Kid Concocitons book I saw on PBS. I bought this book thinking it was the PBS book and was very upset. I'm sure I am not the only one making this mistake. The projects in this book are out dated and seem to be the same old things that have been around for years, Buyer beware! I would bet the publisher did this to trick people into buying there book 
 I stopped reading Ludlum stories years ago, as I found his books to be so similar to each other as to make them boring.  I also had to deal with a regular feeling of deja vu... didn't I read this passage before, or, this setting or person seems familiar. Those issues did not creep into my reading of this book with great frequency, most likely because I kept thinking, "There is NO way he'll get out of this" or "That would never happen."  I realize that reading a good novel, and especially a "spy" novel requires a fair amount of suspension of belief.  However, this one passed those limits 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 This was an unusual story, unraveling as it progresses and memory returns, feelings surface, and it builds up to an ending that I am still not sure I care for 
 Im not really writing this review to sway anyone's opinion of it.  Tastes are different from person to person.  Some may love this book, others may hate it, and a few will think its okay, that is just the way things are.  I only wanted to share my opinion about it, because oddly enough it stirs up strong emotions within me whenever I think about it. The first time i read this book I hated it.  I have read it again since then and upon finshing it twice I still don't like this book at all.  Yet, during both times that I read it I could not put the book down.  This is the bizarre duplicitous nature of The Relic.  I do not like the story or the characters, but still I have been drawn in.  As much as I hate to admit it I consider this book to be a real page-turner.    I don't think i need to go into the plot so I will list the offenses this book commits (once again this is just my opinion).  Predictability - I dont think I was surprised even once while reading this book.  It gives you the kind of cut and pasted characters that are far to overused these days.  From the first time a character is introduced you can pretty much tell whether they are in it for the long haul, or merely here to serve as entree's for the monster.  The outcome of most of the situations presented are easily deciphered if given any thought at all.  Not to spoil any surprises but I'll give you one guess what happens when we are informed that the museum the beast haunts has a security system with solid metal doors that fall into place to cut off a supposed thief's escape route.  Throw in the fact that we are informed of this right before a gala premier of the museums' new attraction in which hundreds of guests will be attending and...well I think you allready know where this is going.  Poor Characters -  All your cliche's are here.  From the overworked, underappreciated heroine, who puts all the pieces together, to the museums management staff who refuse to shut down the museums' premier even after numerous, grisly murders.  Why? do you ask.  Because of revenues of course. I wonder if the museums' head director wears the same suits as the mayor from the movie Jaws.  If the characters arent fulfilling the role as a needed cliche' then they are doing the exact opposite that any sane person would do.  If I heard strange noises in a closed section of the museum I was gaurding, especially after the fact that at least two horrific murders were commited in the vicinity, I would call for backup before I investigated.  Of course I am sane, so reverse what I would have done and you get the basic course of action most of the people in this book take.  UNBELIEVABILITY -  There were many times while reading this book when I had to stop and say, "Give me a break."  I also used the expressions, "Oh, please", and "That is so STUPID!".  Many times we are expected to deny common sense, and reason so that the story can progress.  Of course if you had a monster that could be killed like any other animal on this planet, then this book would probably only be 100 pages long.  So in an effort to stretch it out to 400 or so pages you need a creature that can be described as nothing short of the animal equivalent of a sherman tank.  Im not kidding, this monkey-lizard is shot no less than 5 times and probably a great deal more with no ill effects.  I don't want to give anything more away, but there will be many times when you will find something hard to believe in this book.  Many "What a rip-off" moments - To often while reading this book I found myself comparing it to some other book or movie that had come before it.  There is a reason so many people compare this book to Jurrasic Park, many plot points and supposed surprises seem to be taken right out of Chricton's book.  So instead of putting the quote "Far above Chricton's Jurassic Park" on the cover of The Relic, I would have put "Not above taking ideas from better books".  Put Jurrasic Park, Congo, and Jaws in a blender and you have The Relic. This "borrowing" of ideas seems so bad at times that I wouldnt be surprised if for every copy of The Relic sold Micheal Chricton received royalties.  Once again I feel compelled to mention that for all its stupidity, and predictability, I could not put this book down.  For that reason alone this book is probably worth reading, and sharing with your friends.  Then you can all sit down and compare notes on how many times you each found an instance where you found yourself thinking of another, probably better, book 
 I LOVE the series. Have read every book. I am disappointed that they started out in paperback and when it became popular they switched to Hardcover. Tacky in my opinion. But anyhow. I love EVE, Roarke and all of them. In my opinion this one is lame and boring. I actually felt that I eithe wanted to skip pages ( but you never can because right then and there you might miss something ) or just was very eager to read about anything the friends and buttler had to offer. It was okay to find out about another piece of Eve's past. But she goes on and on and on... and yes it is important, and in every book it is mentioned, this time it was written in a very lame and boring style. Very sad. The entire story had no umpf to it. It is as if Nora Roberts wrote it with half her brain already dreaming of her next vacation or she was bored with this as well and couldn't quite get it right. That happens. Doesn't make it bad or the series bad. I LOVE it. But this one, what a drag it was. Blah. I could tell from the beginnig who it was. Now we just had to wait and find out the details that usually EVe puzzles together. It was as Eve was just tired. And the story just didn't move on. No umpf and fire behind it. Just listing of situations, ideas and people's problems. Boring. I recommend this series to anyone interested, but of course hope you will start with the first one. To fully understand the relationship between all of them. And why now do we have to be cross with Mira? It not just sad but stupid as well. Doesn't fit. Never got the point in the last book, why it ticked EVe off so much. So her friend had a bit of a hard time accepting that this icone of hers wasn't all he seemed. Not as if Eve never had her moments of meltdown. Yes she always did her job right but so did Mira, she delivered in the end. I love the relatinoship between Mira and Eve and really didn't need to read that they were not doing well together. And the make up was, okay but not thrilling.  Okay. Enjoy this book, I am sure it will thrill many but for me it was a boring book.  
 I get the feeling this could be one of those books people look back on 5-10 years from now and ask "Did we actually think this was the direction technology was going?" It's always risky writing about the future of technology, so credit to the author for giving it a try. I'm just cautious of academic-type books that consistently have to invent words to make their point (e.g. findability, everyware, wayfinding). The book is written well and interesting in parts (hence no 1 star rating), but not nearly as interesting or useful as the author's Information Architecture book (hence no 3+ rating) 
 This CD is fun and musically intriguing, but not appropriate for kids... one song talks about "what can you do in a case like that but stamp on your mother, and your toothbrush, and on everything that's helpless." Another talks of being an immigrant to the country and says "and they beat me, and they banged me, and they left me on the ground." And another says "I'm a great sharpshootress. There is nothing that I can't shoot in the eyes, or the ears, or the teeth, or the fingers." Musically it's fun and goofy and intriguing, but I was appalled when I realized what I was encouraging my young child to listen to.  
 I usually really love her books and this one was good but not great.  I think if the first 150 pages of "will she wont she" were not so repetitive it would be much more enjoyable. The characters of Kate and Mitchell were likeable and the story did get better as it went along.It was just way too fluffy for me and not a suspense at all.I also find the lifestyle of her characters so insanly unreal. Private jets, nannies,access to five million dollars in 2 hours, Money beyond imagination. Just too fluffy...... 
 This book contains a veritable catalogue of every fallacy known to the art and science of logic. As a treatise meant to persuade the reader, its reasoning and language is nothing short of ridiculous. He fails to establish any sort of common ground or reliability. Then he wallows in abusive Ad Hominum, discrediting pro-technology positions by insulting those who hold it. He introduces a dozen red herrings, wasting time justifying conclusions irrelevant to the issues at hand. The book erects an army of straw men as it attempts to justify its rejection of positions by creating then discrediting different and usually weaker positions. More than anything it is a gallery of appeals to emotion, attempting to rationalize its conclusions by appealing to the sentiment of the audience. (There is enough thickly sweet sentiment in every chapter to make Cicero proud.) I could go on, but I'm already leaving this review barren of specific examples in order to deliver as much warning as I can in as few words: this book is nothing more than an irrational emotional outburst against computers and the Internet. It contains no compelling argument, and will drown you in sentimental prose as eye-rolling as any grocery store romance novel. Do not expect Stoll to be your rational, level-headed guide to the dangers of technology. Do not expect thoughtfully compiled evidence, articulate and clever argument, and a reasonable conclusion. Should he have had anything to say, he abandoned it from the first sentence of his project to a weak, wandering essay on "feelings" alone 
 I like flavor! I love to eat good food! And I am all about saving time but come on- does this mean I have to use so much tasteless processed food! Very disappointing 
 I had high expectations for this book but I was let down after reading the book.  Power eating throws a lot of information at you in a very unorganized manner for the first 200 pages.  There are many times when the author contradicts herself especially in regards to how much protein should be eaten.  And in the end there is a diet plan that is very confusing and unclear.  This is not a very usefull book at all and I would not reccomend it 
 Truly.  I bought a used copy and was surely glad of the savings.  I would have hated to waste full price on it.  The basic issue/problem with this book and probably more specifically, its author, is that it ignores the most important of all facts concerning the Celtic church:  it was Orthodox.  Yes, Big 'O'.  In other words, Mr. Hunter appears to be blissfully unaware that his theory of "pub churching" is so erroneous as to be almost blasphemous, as entertaining as it may seem in a popular culture.  It is in short, absurd.  Mr. Hunter appears to isolate minute detail and parade it through his pages as "facts" that "support" his theory.  The only trouble is:  Mr. Hunter's religion is only about 500 years old, bearing no resemblance whatsoever to that of St. Padraig, and Celtic Christianity dates to at least the third century, possibly the second.  (Depending on which history you lean toward and whether or not you accept the Coptic Connection theory. )   I dislike writing "bad" reviews.  But this one is so deserved, that I almost, but not quite, enjoyed writing it.  To enjoy bashing a book and/or its author, is to be un-Christian, definitely un-Orthodox.  Assuredly Celtic, however.    
 Way too chill for my tastes. Nothing very catchy about any of the tracks 
 Having read over 20 biographies of TR over the years, I would have to say that this is the worst. The author utterly fails to assess TR in his "context", though she claims that this is her intent. She judges TR based on modern, "politically correct" sensibilities, and, naturally, finds him wanting. This book is more appropriate as required reading in the Women's Studies department at Wellesley College than for a student of history or devotee of TR 
 Seems like WB method is nothing new - testimony - dispute - advocacy.  Sounds like Hegel's - thesis -antithesis - synthesis ? WB like Purdue and others see the collapse of history as a way of understanding ancient  Israel,but if all we have left are words,who would want to trust a god who  talks but doesn't do anything  
 The original version of this album that was mixed by David Bowie was one of the great classics in Rock 'n' Roll history.  It was shambolic, chaotic, amateurish and exhilarating - in short the perfect Punk Rock recording.  It was a one of a kind record, an unforgettable listening experience that made the works of future meisters like The Pistols and The Ramones seem almost commercial and pop in comparison.  A dirty and wild noise indeed.  The '97 mix is still noisy, but it's noise of the wrong kind.  Gone is the impression of a band falling apart at the seams and in its place is something dull and respectable.  It strikes me as being little more than a crass attempt at trying to appeal to a modern rock audience and just because "everything was in the red" does not mean that it's particularly radical.  One of the great things about the original mix is that it doesn't rely on EVERY SINGLE INSTRUMENT SHOUTING AT YOU as this one does.  Instead, sounds are accentuated and de-accentuated at various points, all entirely the result of Iggy's and Bowie's ineptitude and mistakes.  And mistakes are pretty much the sole reason for the evolution of music.   It would have been nice to have preserved the original mix (which after all was the one that inspired punk) both as historical artefact and to give younger listeners a dose of the uniqueness of The Stooges.  Punk was never about tidy professionalism.  It was about a wild expression of emotion and this mix not only violates that spirit but ultimately reduces the Detroit foursome to little more than just another loud Rock band 
 I am a long-time admirer of Malamud.  In my view, "The Assistant" and "The Natural" are two of the outstanding novels of the 20th Century.  I can still recall my gratification upon finishing "The Magic Barrel."  In the case of first-time exposure to a book,play,or movie, I believe that expectation frequently colors reaction.  Given my experience with Malamud, I began to read "A New Life: with a sanguine attitude.  The first page, carefully calculated to entice the reader's interest, validated this attitude.  Although my enthusiasm waned over the next 20 or 30 pages, I reminded myself of Malamud's literary prowess.  He's just having a little trouble revving up the engine, I thought.  Happens to the best of them.  My man will get off the ground shortly and we'll be soaring into the clouds.  Malamud's early take on Levin bolstered my confidence.  Levin is an unsuccessful teacher, a former drunk, a tactless, gauche klutz whose professional and intellectual capacity and social skills are, to say the least, limited.  The reader will identify with Levin, or root for him, or feel sorry for him, or simply connect with him, however attenuated the connection, WHEN LEVIN CHANGES. And so, the reader looks forward to finding out what manner of event, what shift in circumstance, will rehabilitate Levin, or trigger his turnabout, or spark his transformation, or signal some incipient but viable adjustment of his personality and character.  Or perhaps will reveal some redeeming quality, some suppressed side of Levin that is rational, perceptive, sensitive, sensible.        It doesn't happen.  Levin's self-destructive behavior accelerates, and the book plunges irreversibly into contrived farce and fatuous set-scenes devoid of credibility.  Contrary to Mr. Lethem's Introduction, the book is neither comic nor tragic; it is simply hollow in its core.  To revisit the credibility issue, Levin's attempts to insert himself into and influence campus politics are so maladroit as to be unbelievable.  His relationship with Pauline is self-delusional and empty-headed, and is not plausible.  The ultimate implausibility, of course, is the last segment.  The book does contain well written descriptions of scenes from nature.  But why so many?  Some of the dialogue is clever in a stilted way.  College-faculty environments are unquestionably as vicious as reflected, but surely the real-life intrigues are not conducted on the level of ineptitude depicted here.  Beyond those small plus-factors, the book fails in terms of plot, narrative, and character development.  Like Levin, "A New Life" is a loser.  Come to think of it, Malamud's purpose may have been to write the book as a metaphor for stupidity. 
 although there was some good skincare advice in the book and i am sure Dr. Kunin is very knowledgeable, it read more like an overgrown commercial for everything they sell on their web-store, which makes me a little less likely to trust the advice.  my point is: this may possibly be a very helpful book, but it is my opinion that there are plenty of other very helpful books that aren't trying to sell you what they suggest you buy.  
     I want to be fair, because there is material of value in this book.  The problem is that it takes so much energy to seperate it from all the anti-psychiatry dogma, endless references to philosophers, abusively harsh judgements of people who are living in great pain, that, in the end, I don't think it is really worth the effort to read.  An editor should have stripped away all the caustic negativity, rants and raves, and slimmed the volume down to about 100 pages or less.     With all due respect to the author, because I have bipolar disorder myself, I question whether she really has her illness under control.  Waking up each morning in a state of utter despair does not sound to me like someone has found satisfactory treatment.        It also bothers me that it is implied that mentally ill people simply don't use their will enough to better themselves.  While this may often be true, it is also often true that these people are exerting truly heroic willpower each day simply to stay alive.  To call them "wimps" really does not help anyone.      While her descriptions of severe depression are more or less convincing, her descriptions of mania are a walk in the park compared to what I have experienced and what many people I know have experienced.  Someone who is in a state of acute psychosis will not be helped much by repeating a prase such as "green frog."  I also question the assertion that the mind can only think one thought at a time.  If you beleive this, then you do not understand psychosis.     Thomas Szazs, and others that call mental illness an unreality...they are taking an armchair approach to psychiatry.  As when watching a football game, it is very easy to criticise from afar when you are not the one getting your bones broken by 300 lb defensive players.  Anyone who has first hand experience with severe mental illness knows that it is all too real.  The cause is irrelevant.  The fact is people suffer, people die, often unecessarily.  Being insensitive to their suffering only makes the problem worse.  Judging a person who takes medication, when you don't understant their life...is just ignorance.      Thomas Szazs calls mental illness a "metaphorical illness"...which makes him a metaphorical psychiatrist, since he did not actually treat any patients.  He was primarily a "philosopher," who really wasn't interested in working directly with the mentally ill patients.     If my review seems to be rambling, ranting and raving, then don't read this book...it is even worse.  I think the author is coming out with a second book, and it will be interesting to see if she makes any changes.      
 I bought this toy for my baby, it was his first birthday. My son played with the toy, he loved the toy.  I loved this toy, until the ears stopped working. We only had the toy for 3 weeks when they stopped moving.  The toy still has the music/voice working.  But it isn't the same with out the ears moving.  He doesn't like it anymore. I  don't have the packaging anymore to send it back.  I wished it still worked.  
 Like many of the other reviewers, I found this book frought with recipe mistakes (or are they just sloppily written?).  However, many of the recipes, with adaptation, become quite nice.... the problem being that you must have enough cooking knowledge to know how to adapt recipes.  What's great about this book, though, is the plethora of information about food itself, mini-articles about things like mushrooms, green tea and how to grow your own herbs make for some great and informative reading.    Interesting and a great idea, but very poorly executed.  A good and thorough revision would make this book wonderful, but this edition is just not that great 
 The dish works great. The only issue i find is when you open it to refill the food it takes a few secs to align the top properly, but it is only a minor proble 
 Very disappointed that the charger was not the correct one even though the web site indicated it was appropriate.  I'm sure it would work on somebody's car.  Now I am stuck with it 
 Luther Krank and his wife decide, since their only daughter has joined the Peace Corps and will be away, not to decorate for Christmas and go on a cruise instead. Their Christmas-decorating-frenzied neighbors are incensed by this and make life miserable for the Kranks--as if decorating for Christmas was mandatory and everyone has to have singing and dancing lights and a plastic Frosty on their roof to be happy. Then the Kranks' daughter decides to come home unexpectedly, with a boyfriend she wants to show her family's wonderful Christmas celebrations and the couple has to scramble to do things at the last minute and the ingrate neighbors are no help. Granted, Luther isn't the most likeable character, but I truly felt bad for him with this wretched bunch of insensitive, asinine neighbors, and his wife, who completely turns around and repudiates him. The only thing nice that happens in this book is something Luther does at the end to some neighbors who are having a hard time. I didn't find this funny at all; I found it appalling. If I were the Kranks, I'd pull up stakes and move the moment their daughter leaves again 
 This is not a "manual" in any sense of the word. A manual tells you how, where, and when. This is more like a tour guide of Applescript. Sure there are scripts, but few of them make the Mac easier to use than its own OSX interface. The information is presented in such a scattered form, that it is hard to follow for very long, and therefore hard to learn. It's like trying to learn to be a chef by watching the Cooking Channel 
 Now this books title is MISLEADING. It should be called "HOW I GOT BRAINWASHED INTO BEING A VEGAN"! Very little of this book has to do with women's health. It advice you to not to eat oil, fish, milk and meat, basing their "science" on statements, NOT FACTS! Very often source is not given or the logic is faulty. For example, at some point in the book you can find a statement like: your morning egg carries salmonella because chickens peck at each other because they are in cages.  BEWARE of this GARBAGE. What a waste of paper!! 
 I'm on my Mom's Amazon Account just to say my review for this CD. I don't have it, but I have all the songs on my Ipod that I like from it. Here's my ratings- Go The Distance- This freakin rocked so much. It's so emotional and beautiful! Color's Of The Wind- Techno sounds, love it! Find yourself- great. Two worlds- Nice.  Part Of Your World- Liked the beat. Kiss The Girl- I love this Pop Rendition! True to your heart- cool.  blah blah blah. I can't remember the rest only because I don't really like the rest so over all this CD was amazing!!!!! 
 This video has some amusing low-budget B-grade Hong-Kong action, but don't confuse it with a Jackie Chan movie.  There is a clip of about five minutes of Chan lifted from another movie, and Jackie Chan is NOT a character in this movie.  (Don't confuse it with "Drunken Master!! 
 Eww! I read this book because it was recommended in a well-known woman's magazine. Obviously, it was a paid review. Boring, unbelieveable, poor character development, I didn't care about the characters and the story was PREDICTABLE.  This is the only book by Norah Roberts I have ever read, and I have no reason to want to read others. If you like to read confession magazines and formulaic romance novels, perhaps you will like Montana Sky too, although it is a step down from the worst romance novel I ever read.  I read the entire book...I kept waiting for it to take off.  Don't buy this book, don't even waste your time borrowing it from the library. It really is that bad 
 It is a miracle that Misha was not hit by a car. Letting a dog roam free in an urban area for days is something your most common and average citizen would never do. But then they aren't involved in important experiments like Liz is.  Anyone with common sense could see that Misha, the Siberian Husky that Liz used for a completely useless experiment, could very easily have been hit by a car and either killed, or seriously injured and then try to find his way home in pain and fear.  No problem for Liz though. She's got research to do! What amazing irony that one of the dangers for Misha that Liz acknowledged was the "dognappers" who could have taken Misha for use in laboratory experiments 
 Having loved Annie Lamott's Traveling Mercies, I was thrilled to have stumbled upon Blue Shoe.  However, try as I might, I couldn't force myself to finish it.  I went well past my tolerance level, page 121, simply because I was sure Ms. Lamott would do something, anything, to make the plot move or at least make the characters likable.  This didn't happen (Maybe it did on page 122?  I couldn't wait any longer.)  The only redeeming quality of the book is the exquisite descriptions throughout.  My favorite was "She did not mind this weather [rainy], and certainly preferred it to the tyranny of a bright blue day, when old voices told you to get off your duff and go outside."  They are beautiful and rich.  However, it seemed that these descriptions were used in place of plot or character devlopment, so they eventually felt flat.   The main character, Mattie, is obviously struggling.  She's a mess, in fact, sleeping with her ex-husband, even after he marries and has a child with the new wife, in addition to having the hots for a married man.  I'm no prude, but there was nothing redeeming about Mattie to make me want to keep reading about this behavior, page after page, or think she might pull herself out of the pit.  I finally gave up hoping that she might redeem herself.  The other people around her offer little to like also: a son who is overly-emotional and bullies his sister, a daughter who bites so much at her wrist she creates and repeatedly reopens wounds, a mother who is emotionally available to everyone but Mattie and her brother,and  the memory of a father who was obviously a cheater.  Add to that an extended dying scene for a dog and constant problems with the house Mattie lives in...I'm getting depressed writing about it.  The only fabulous character, Angela, is mentioned only a few times.  She's a rich, robust character.  Too bad Ms. Lamott focused on the whiny, messy ones instead.  
 If you expect an action filled novel like the Ender series written by Scott Orson Card, you will be greatly disappointed.  I bought this book based on all the rave reviews I read here and I felt like a sucker.  I could not finish reading this book because it bored me to tears.  There are dialogs after dialogs, but no action.  If this is a movie, there will be only one scene in the whole movie, of people talking to each others. So be warned!! 
 I enjoyed this book and the history of this group. When compared to Maury Terry's book, "Ultimate Evil", you'll see the real true story of the world's most beloved animal sanctuary.  According to public records in the state of Louisiana, Best Friends Animal Sanctuary originated as The Process Church of the Final Judgment.  Incorporated in 1968, the name has changed several times throughout the years and this once apocolyptic/satanic cult is now a loving animal sanctuary.  So leopards can change their spots!  Their Articles of Incorporation show the same people still together after 35 years. Too bad this wasn't covered in this book 
 This book covers ALL cats in general, it's not specific enough for Persians. Dissappointing 
 this book is abselutely horrifying.this guy goes to the army and gets blown up............only he lives, well sort of.hes fully dismembered,and is blind,deaf,mute and horribly disfigured.he cant smell either because his face is all blown away.and the entire  book is about whats going through this guys head.its f'n sickening.eventualy he begans banging his head in morse code."kill me kill me kill me kill me......................".its truly sickening.and whoever that hippie is that wrote it should be locked up because hes demented 
 Adrienne Rich has to be the most over-rated poet in history. Her work would be completely forgotten if it was judged as poetry, but because she has been adopted as the ideological idol of PC fanatics everywhere, she has become an untouchable icon of the present. Rich is best compared, intellectually, to the literary drudges of Soviet Russia, who extolled the glories of the people for the Communist Party. The diffrence, obviously, is that Rich is not embraced by the State, but by the buddy system that is academic feminism. This volume, complete with the breathless worship -- oh, sorry, critical scholarly attention -- of the editor, is a very fine presentation of what is, for all practical purposes, the work of a transient figure whose prominence is entirely dependent on the current PC state of the American academic establishment. If you wandered to this book because it claims to be poetry, why not skip it and try someone with some soul adn some real poetic talent 
 I just purchased this book, and I was really excited when I received it.  However, after 5 attempts of trying to install the CD-ROM, I gave up, and... the worest thing is, I tried to visit the website the book provided, in order to get to contact with them & ask for help... I was not allowed to view the page... cuz they blocked a lot of IP address, and the cable company that I have is on their list.........   If you want to get a USEFUL CD-ROM for drug reference, don't get this book... it will cause you a lot of headache & troubles.  Get Nursing200X drug handbook published by Springhouse.  The software is good, and I never had any problem with it 
 I would normally give this book 5 stars, except I have a strong sense that this book is a fictional fraud.    It's the story of an 11 year old boy who hitchikes the country with his alcoholic, dead-beat father in search of a better life in California.  Of course, California is no better than any other place they've been and they take buses back to Albany where his mother lives with his two sisters, only to ***spoiler*** go back out on the road again with his father at the end of the book.    The book is well written and engaging, but only if the book is true, which I doubt.  The book often states what a good storyteller the father is and how good said father is at making up things to get what he wants out of people.  The author continually expresses his desire to be on the radio or in movies, not to mention how often he embellishes stories, so I wouldn't be surprised if the book was just one big lie.    From the outset, the author states how he went 2 entire months without a bowel movement, which I don't even know is medically possible, much less didn't land him in the hospital.  Plus he recounts in great detail names, places, and events that happened 40 years ago.  And somehow, all these events involve sexual predators, thieves, and other ne'er-do-well's.  Never any average people.  Nah, I don't think the book is true.  But if it is true, it's really well done

 This television movie, based on Stephen King's short story "Trucks" is a complete waste of time. Stick with "Maximum Overdrive", a better adaption of the story that stars Emilio Estevez. You can find Maximum Overdrive on DVD for a great price. If you really want to see this film, wait til it comes on Sci-Fi channel 
 No Rocky Top?!?  Why bother??  That's like warm beer & cold pizza, close but not quite 
 After reading Midsummer Magic, I frantically looked for other books by Ms Coulter.(Midsummer Magic is one of the BEST books Ive ever read!!!) HOWEVER.....this story i couldnt even finish......no story whatsover and just endless sex scenes.I waited for it to go somewhere but it just never did. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED 
 I bought this thing and it was so bad that the guy who sold it to me off Amazon gave me a refund and told me to keep it!  I then gave it to my sister who wanted it, and she gave it back to me.  I don't even think a Goodwill will take it at this point. It's completely impractical and useless and here's why: you cannot tip this thing lest you spill its boiling contents and give yourself 4th degree burns. Also, when using the steamer, you have to precariously hang up clothes on your door jamb and hope they don't fall off while you are "steaming" them.  And then, even if you can get the clothes to stay in one spot, the steamer doesn't even remove wrinkles!  It's totally weak. 
 I am disappointed with this author. There is too much theory to wade through versus application. I wish all of these want-to-be doctor authors could use Dr. Wayne Dyer as the example. If this author would of at least had a closing summary with each chapter, filled with applications and a good review, then I would have given this author a B+, or A, which would of been four or five stars 
 Had these pillows for 6 months, finally drained them and threw them out.  You don't realize that once you fill them with water how heavy they are!  Once they are in place on the bed you can't move them!  Try lifting them when you change the sheets!!!  But, you probably bought them due to a bad back, neck or shoulders and now you have to lift these weights to make the bed!  What was I thinking?  I was lucky I didn't wind up in traction from lifting these things.  My husband refused to use it after a few weeks, said he couldn't get comfortable and was unable to move it easily (they weigh a ton!)  I hung in there longer but wound up using a regular pillow on top of it just to be able to adjust it without having to get a crane to lift it.  We honestly didn't feel any better sleeping on it and having to deal with the weight of them was not worth any benefits we might have derived.  No one mentions this issue in their reviews, I have to wonder if they all have maid service 
 Life is too short to be spent reading drivel.  Stuart Woods was really off the mark with this book.  You shouldn't rest on your laurels Mr. Woods, your audience deserves better.  I've enjoyed your past books very much, but this one left a lot to be desired.  I was very put off by Stone Barrington's bed-hopping activities in this story.  With Arrington (mother of his son) one night, then with Holly the next, I don't recall him being quite that indescriminate in other books.  The plot was relly silly and contrived, it must have been that the publisher was pressing for a story, never mind quality.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 ...and I can remember some of the scenes to this day (i'm 49 now). I was 16;my friend,17 at the time. I used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days,and after that movie, I didn't-for a long time. At the time it was a really scary film,and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story,which only added to the starkness of it. Of course,as some have opined here, what is perceived as horrifying then and what's considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas."Horror-and-brutality technology" in films has definitely-and I use this word wryly-evolved 
 Someone gave me this book and told me how thrilling it was. Halfway through, I find myself still reading it mostly to laugh at the horrible writing and melodromatic style. It's a little depressing to think that millions of readers have made this guy rich and famous on such awful writing. It's good for me to pick up a book like this now and then to be reminded that by avoiding the most popular authors, I'm not missing much. 
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
  this book was dull, silly, and slightly offending. every single picture in this book was of blonde, gorgeous cheerleaders chatting up handsome white guys in track jackets. it seemed like the author had only concerns for white and beautiful people. whats more, the advice was not helpful and outdated.  
 From ethic historiography, sometimes to A point of incorporating elements from fictional literary devices describing entirely imaginary cultures. More commonly, however, elements are appropriated from a rapid process of reinterpretation and change that  transformed  `exotic' occurrences or beliefs, into an organic part of the new context.  Writers will attempt to stress continuity and disregard change, a legitimizing process that has its typical elements. For example what in the `syndrome' Matrix is termed  reduction, is used  to denote several related techniques of reducing the complexity, variety and contextuality of the traditions or situations from which elements are taken. Thus, `The Truth behind its Templar and Masonic secrets' esoteric, understandings of actually existing  traditions, e.g. Gnostics, the kabbala or Freemasonry, are radically pared-back versions of the originals, see(http://sociologyesoscience.com ).  The complexities of the Jewish kabbala, with its numerous schools, its arcane texts and its path of religious instruction stretching over many years, is reduced to a New Age / Da Vinci Code Syndrome kabbala, a  system of correspondences that now can be explained in a 'slender' best selling volume.  An influential presentation of the doctrine of exoteric versus esoteric religion in the French Occult revival is Edouard Schure's Les Grands Inities, published in 1899 when he was a Theosophist, later he became an admirer of Rudolf Steiner.  The distinction made by several writers between an exoteric and an esoteric form of religion combines several topoi common within the Esoteric-alternative milieu. It eliminates the relativism that one risks when facing the diversity of human faiths: behind the many masks of religion lies one single core wisdom. It explains the difference between various exoteric faiths by placing them within the various stages of Esoteric historiography, thus incorporating them into one of the dominating metanarratives of the  Esoteric milieu. It provides a place in the (emic) spiritual history of mankind for the initiates who have transmitted perennial philosophy, always making sure that it is phrased in a language adapted to the needs and abilities of the recipient.  But Hindu reincarnation is not the same as kabbalistic reincarnation. Among the kabbalists, Isaac Luria has a very different conception of reincarnation than does the anonymous author of the Zohar. However, a synthesizing Da Vinci Code Syndrome spokesperson intent on finding a perennial (`Gnostic') philosophy underlying  divergent traditions (example `Freemasonry'), has ample material from which to synthesize, and every- opportunity to reduce traditions to the grand scale on which the divergences can come to appear as insignificant details.  Typical of the development of Da Vinci Code Syndrome  religiosity is  its eclecticism, where  spokespersons like Dan Brown, attempt to combine the most disparate sources into a personal synthesis.  Among elements of this `Matrix' there is pattern recognition , a basic cognitive strategy, also in daily life we often form hypotheses that help us find order and covariation even in random data, and then apply a strategy of selective hypothesis testing to ensure that the existence of the patterns we have projected onto the data will be corroborated.  But in the Da Vinci Code Syndrome this then is done by adducing carefully selected and skewed data. Where a more attentive reader might suspect selective reading of the history, myths, and facts  behind such a claim. But considerable effort is spent on showing that these seemingly disparate elements in fact point to the same underlying reality.  For example a variety of symbols that may ethically appear to be selected more or less at random from the vast variety of options, can be claimed to be near-universal. I pointed out a few examples of this via symbols in the Da Vinci Code.  Other `Da Vinci Code Syndrome' books  for example have  the cross and the fire are central to traditions ranging from Christianity and Hinduism to alchemy, masonry, Platonism and kabbalism.  Typical  of Da Vinci Code  religiosity is thus its eclecticism.  Or another example, ever since Madame Blavatsky's "Secret Doctrine", the number seven  serves as a focus of pattern recognition: since many religions contain at least some doctrines describing elements grouped in sevens, they can be proclaimed to be essentially the same. "Brahmanical religion" believed in seven inhabited worlds; Egyptian religion believed in the transmigration of souls in seven stages; Mithraism had seven mysteries; several masonic lodges have seven steps. Yet Theosophy and other occult groups today, presents such similarities as due  to a common spiritual heritage.  More recently than New Age writers have added that since there are seven metals and, seven planets in Renaissance alchemy, "in reality", the alchemists worked with the `chakra' system.  When no overt similarities are to be found, correspondences can be forced upon the material. Even though the kabbalistic tree of life bears no obvious resemblance to the chakra system, in various systems of system of `hypnotism' and `inner alchemy' the two are said to be definitely related.  Thus Esoteric spokespersons  construct parallels in their attempts to join systems, creating patterns where the outsider sees none.  Crystals were a marginal point of interest in the Esoteric groupings until quite recently.  Esoteric spokespersons such as Madame Blavatsky, Rudolf Steiner, and Alice Bailey, do not mention them.  But today authors will frequently claim that "crystals leads us back to the ancient continent of Atlantis. It is supposed that the evolved inhabitants of this advanced race used crystals to channel and harness the cosmic force."  To give an (esoteric) 'Archeological'  example, last year, Gary A. David claimed a  definite relationships between  the Anasazi Indians of the American Southwest and Europe's Knights Templar. It seems just to obvious  Gary  David  argued that  the Circular buildings  found at Mummy Cave Ruin in Canyon de Chelly (traditional home of the Snake Clan) are no doubt related to the  round towers found in the European during the  middle ages and thus for sure evidence Knights Templar sealed to the America's.  Gary David also brought in (even more popular today than one year ago) an alleged  fragment from the Dead Sea Scrolls called The "Testament of Amram" where a certain "Belial" dreams of a  "terrifying in appearance, like a serpent..." and "his visage [is] like a viper..." The figure of Belial referenced in II Corinthians 6:15 means "lawlessness," "worthless," or "reckless" and is an appellation of Satan. The word "serpent," is synonymous with both the Enochian Watchers and the Nephilim, the latter denoting the "giants in the earth" from Genesis 6:4.  Gary  David has no difficulty to find  `evidence' to back up his claims by quoting  other esoteric/alternative `experts'. For example Andrew Collins in his `Archeology' and `Ancient History' book- Ashes of Angels (2001) writes (all backed up by similar circumstantial evidence as all, authors quoted above) that the Nephilim are also known as the sons of the Anakim. "The word Anak is generally taken by Jewish scholars to mean 'long-necked', or 'the men with the necklaces'..." In this context it is curious that the Hopi term naaqa means "turquoise necklace" or "ear pendant " and that anaaq means "ouch!", an interjection used to express extreme pain, such as that caused by a snakebite. Is this, then, a reference to the Indo-European Nagas, those snake-worshiping seafarers originating from the Indus River Valley? Are these the so-called Long Ears, who stretched their lobes with ear-plugs? Coincidentally, archaeologists found an example of this artifact in an ancient pueblo ruin known as Snaketown near modern-day Phoenix.  To intensify the mystery, the word "Chna," an English transliteration of the Greek word referring to the Phoenician land of Canaan, is homophonically similar to Ch'a, the Hopi name for the worshiped snake that initiated their biennial ceremony still performed today on the high desert of Arizona in order to bring rain. The biblical Anakim were known to have hailed from southern Canaan. In addition, Baal, the Phoenician rain god mentioned above, is similar in sound and sense to the Hopi word paal. Did the Phoenicians, the Anasazi in building the round towers, come to the American Southwest and establish outposts there in order to trade with the latter? Were the Knights Templar the recipients of this Naga/Phoenician legacy, carrying forth the ancient traditions bequeathed from Egypt?  Specifically, the djed pillar was known as the "backbone of Osiris." Morphologically similar to the round towers, this column symbolically channeled the kundalini (serpent energy) up the vertebrae. In Jesus, Last of the Pharaohs (1999), Ralph Ellis avers that round towers were modeled after the Benben tower located in the Phoenix Temple at Heliopolis. (The Phoenicians took their name from the mythical bird that rose from its ashes.) He also says that over 7,000 Nuraghi, or circular towers constructed during the second millennium BC, are found on the island of Sardinia north of the ancient Phoenician city of Carthage (modern-day Tunis).  Do these structures form a global network centered around ophidian fertility symbols? To return to our starting point, were the Irish round towers also "snake houses," or phallic temples used by a race of serpent people whom St. Patrick in the 5th century AD ultimately had to chase into the sea? (For case study purposes quoted from: http://azorion.tripod.com)  One can see that it would be easy for Gary David to make a trilogy just as worthy as the after all `fictional' novels of the Da Vinci Code, backed by `real quotes', and `direct references' to other, `non-fiction' bestsellers of a `recent' date...  Another strategy, closely related to pattern recognition, is synonymization. Whereas pattern recognition rhetorically erases differences between divergent elements of religious praxis and doctrines myth A is essentially the same as myth B, ritual X is merely a version of ritual Y-synonymization wields its homogenizing influence over religious terminology.  Synonymization utilizes the curious double role of words in a foreign language interspersed in a text written in e.g. English as seen in the example quoting Gary David. Who like many others no doubt `believes' is what he writes, and clearly is not doing this for profit only, a reason I took his website as an example for quoting what can be seen as common strategies of epistemology  we find all the way from 19th century  Blavatsky, to the most sophisticated of New Age (pseudo-)`scientists'.  Amit Goswami in the The Self Aware Universe claims  the same message was proclaimed by mystics as diverse as Catherine of Genoa, Hui-Neng, Ibn al-Arabi, Moses de Leon, Padmasambhava, Eckhart, al-Hallaj, Shankara and Jesus.  But why, then, do Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists and Christians disagree on so many issues if the "essence" of each religion is identical? Goswami's answer is that "mysticism is a universal enterprise".  Something hardly any student who completes a PhD today in Religion , History, or /and Sociology, would agree with.  But only certain cultures (even the choice is more and more expanding) are part of the matenal on which these writers draw. One might hypothesize that these are cultures that have points of overt affinity with the esoteric-alternative millieu.  The double process of selective choice and creative hermeneutics applies apart from mysticisism for the purpose of constructing an inner and as seen in the example quoted from Gary, and alternative-historians or the Da Vinci Code books, is myth.  But each tradition referred to nevertheless seems to have its own role in Esoteric historiography. Egypt is the land of initiation, of great mysteries; India is the source of concepts such as reincarnation, karma and the subtle bodies; Tibet plays the role of the homeland of sages and the repository of ancient scriptures. In a sense, however, the distinction between an Egyptian tradition and one based on a generalized India, Europe and the Knights Templar, or even an imaginary one such as the wisdom of Lemuria or the Atlanteans.  However neither Egypt, India, Atlantis or Neoplatonism figure in this story as representatives of their respective historical times and geographical locations as they are understood by historians of religion. 
 I previously had a black version and I lost them. They were pretty much what everyone else says about them. This pair was a joke. Everything sounded like a transistor radio. No bass at all! I tried them on all types of music and devices and finally gave up and returned them. I have purchased another pair. Hopefully, I'll be back to the first set 
 Too bad there isn't a 0 star rating. This was simply awful.  I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan for years - waded though a lot of her semi-readable stuff - waiting for another decent installment.  But I give up.  No more Kaye Scarpetta for me.  This book cured me - for good 
 I got this book looking to find more coverage on how dhtml/ajax works. I got a book very light on details and focused on very broad how-to/cut-and-paste type scripts. So, partly, it was my own fault for not reading the back closely enough - it was never meant for deep coverage.   Even given the premise of the book, it is very light on content. As another reader points out, wide margins and big fonts take up a lot of space. Also, he inists on repeatedly putting the same functions in every example - rather than pointing readers to a website with full source as almost every other book does.  There were a few interesting ideas in the book, which was it's saving grace. But the organization of the book was the give away, he claims that you can read chapters in any order. His coverage is so high level that there's no buildup of knowledge, even for his target audience of novice programmers. How can that be, you ask? The explanatations of how things work were very broad and offered no insight to how to use things outside the scope. A book like this, should have been a cheap tiny book, maybe that came with a cd, for ready to use scripts.  If you're looking for something one step above copy and paste, to garner some basic understanding of what you're doing, this book may be for you. For anyone with javascript experience looking for something more meaningful this book is definitely not for you. For anyone beginning in javascript looking to actually be able to program on your own, this book is not for you. Zakas' wrox book was much more in depth even for topics that his book doesn't profess to cover like CSS 
 Admittedly, I used Office 98 and bought this book primarily because it is the only one now available. I had a number of questions, including what did the new shapes the cursor assumed mean, and do.   Almost none of my questions were answered. There were not nearly enough visual images or screenshots to make explanations clear, and the level was so basic that I'm not sure who would get that much out of the book, rather than Office's own help system. It's a shame, because the help in this version of Office seems useless, far worse than the previous version.  Maybe some of the upcoming books will be better 
 Troy Taylor is without doubt an inept writer.  He rambles constantly about unimportant minute details while letting big concepts pass by.  His depiction of the witch varies from page to page.  At times she is nice, and at others she is mean.  However, during reading, the reader gets the impression that Kate is great fun to have around.  At one point, he goes into a complete tangent about Andrew Jackson that is completely unneeded in the story, and this complete history of Jackson was not needed.  Also, this book has little merit as a historical work due to the authors unending bias agains debunkers.  Many of the stories that he presents are postulations on "what people must have thought," and he makes his rather negative opinions of debunkers quite well known.  I will admitt that he did do a good job of presenting the basic parts of the Bell Witch story, but beyond that, he srewed this book up.  Also, for the love of God, he needs to learn to have someone besides a trained chimp to proof read his work.  These are mistakes that a fourth grader could have picked up on.  
 This book is so horrifically flawed on so many levels.  First, there is the erroneous uncritical thinking involved in dealing with the measurement problem, which despite David's attempt to address, is completely evaded via a multi-layered philosophical detours of an almost paramastabatory nature.  Second, on a technical writing level, David is completely unable to formulate one complete, coherent, and logically cohesive sentence.  His writing style is to riddled with repeated mistakes in basic grammar that it is genuinely embarrassing to read.  I would greatly encourage those interested in real science to read The Fabric of the Cosmos or The Elegant Universe.  -B. Green 
 Once you actually start reading the book, you'll discover that it can take up to four weeks just to get a response to your submission and could take much longer to get an actual paycheck. Oberlin writes in Chapter 6, "For this book, I've kept as a reminder - they want to make money...and fast." It should read, "I want to completely dupe aspiring writers into believing they can make money fast." Oberlin claims you can get published just from the information in her one chapter. In Chapter 3 she writes, "What I offer here will equip you with a basic knowledge of journalism, which is your ticket to landing assignments and earning income." It's completely unrealistic and irresponsible to imply that a person can be a successful journalist after reading one chapter in a how-to book. I also have a beef with Chapter 8. Becoming a teacher or proposing a noncredit course is hardly something someone can do quickly! Chapter 10 has a information on writing for online publications and creating a website. While writing for e-publishers can bring in money, creating your own website will help promote yourself as a writer, but it won't help you bring in "quick" cash. Chapter 11 has a chapter on creating newsletters. It takes a lot of time to build up readership and find people that are willing to pay for a newsletter! Chapter 12 is on writing books. This is definately not a form of writing that is quick either! This books fails to explain the different kinds of magazine articles that one can write, such as how-to, essay, or informative and completely ignores the option of writing and selling short fiction. I found the chapters on writing fillers and greeting cards helpful, but there are better books out there on this same subject that don't make unrealistic promises 
 Don't get me wrong.  This is a great piece of work and a lot of effort has been put into it.  But there are some serious flaws in the points the author tries to very hard to make and the chronology of his examples in the film.  For example, at one point he refers to Neo throwing up immediately after he is extracted from the power plant in the first Matrix (a specific action he uses to support his point) when really this was several scenes later, after he was revived, perhaps weeks after his initial rescue.  So the point he makes about Neo "purging the illusory world of the Matrix" immediately after he is rescued, resolves as a bit of a stretch.  The book is riddled with these types of errors, as well as several misquotes of the films' characters, which if they were quoted correctly would falsify the claims the author tries to make.    While it is easy to see how Vedic literature undoubtedly plays a significant role in the events of Revolutions, the author applies Hindu philosophy to every section of EACH of the three films, which after awhile gets very monotonous, and seems like an extended paper from a C+ philosophy student than a Doctor.  The philosophy present throughout the Matrix Trilogy is clearly a mix of so many religious symbols and ideologies, it devalues them as a body of work to say that just one set religious ideals defined the entire philosophical undercurrent of the films, whether its Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Gnosticism, Mysticism, etc.  However, while it is a predominantly narrow view of the religious influences of the Matrix Trilogy, it's an EXCELLENT introduction to Vedic Literature and The Upanishads, which I have delved into since, and find to be an INCREDIBLY interesting body of work.  So I'd say that the book was worth reading for that introduction alone.  Overall, if you are interested in an analysis of the Matrix Trilogy from a strict perspective of Hinduism, look no further.  If you are looking for a somewhat broader perspective, check out some of the other "Matrix and Philosophy" books that are avaiable.  There are a TON.  Also, I have to say that this book could use a second edition after it fixes its plethora of spelling and grammar mistakes.  They are hard to ignore 
 I had no idea that this book would be just a very long-winded advertisement for one specific garlic supplement. I donated this useless, promotional joke of a book to the local library 
 Ordinary looking steel mug. It does not have a lid which defeats the purpose of having doube insulation. I did not find the quality of insulation that great either. Too pricey for the features it offers. 
 this book was mildly funny but very juvenile... more of a gag gift sort of book than a hysterical read... i found it boring after the billionth f-bomb.. 
 This was arguably the longest 2 hours I have spent in my entire life ... it felt like much more ... I found myself more than a little angry with the overkill leadup to what could have been a compelling story.  The punch line took way too long to get to ... and when it came, it just wasn't enough to convince me it was worth the wait.  With each pregnant pause between dialogue (and guitar strings), I was sure I'd be getting up to leave ... I suspect the invested time (hours and hours it seemed) precluded me from doing so.  I wanted that punch line ... then, finally, it came ... and it went.    This one had a ton of potential but it just didn't work for me 
 My excitement to learn Haskell faded with every page turned. The Author presented the subject with such excitement comparable only to that of watching paint dry 
 This book is written in an engaging fashion for younger readers, so that's why I gave it 2 stars. But I found the attitudes conveyed towards slavery, Native Americans, and Democrats unsettling. I think there are some political motives behind this book. I think the author is trying to indoctrinate youngsters into ultra-conservative Southern Republican political ideas, and a brand of Christianity that makes people outside the church (you know, the OTHER people God loves) think Christ-followers are hateful and crazy.   For example, on p36 it states, "Although it is true that Native Americans were often treated badly by European settlers, they treated one another worse" and "We cannot feel so much pity for the Native Americans when we think of all this." Did they have it coming? They faught and killed each other like every other group of humans on the planet, so we shouldn't feel bad about the injustices perpetrated by white European settlers that the Natives have never recovered from?  And on the two pages that deal with slavery, it is mentioned that the slave trade was profitable for the traders, but "hard on the slaves" who were shipped to the colonies "under difficult conditions." A bit of an understatement.   And, on the subject of the Civil War, "Many people in the south did not own slaves, but they knew how quickly the Southern economy and standard of living would be damaged if the Northern politicians forced Southern farmers to immediately free their slaves." Yikes, what about the slaves' standard of living? No where is it mentioned or even alluded to that slavery in the US was BAD and WRONG. It's not okay to own another human being and treat him or her like an animal (or WORSE).   The reason the North abolished slavery? They had MACHINES to do the work of slaves, so slaves became obsolete. And I quote, "...why slavery was done away with in the Northern states. The reason is primarily that Northern businessmen did not need slave labor to operate their stores and factories because they made much greater use of the new machines that cut down on the amount of hand labor that was necessary to complete a job." No mention of how compassionate Christians (and others) were vehemently opposed to the way slave owners viewed, kept and treated their slaves, or what they did to abolish slavery.  Finally, the treatment of Democrats and Republicans is really unbalanced. The only things mentioned about Carter? How horrible he was for establishing relations with China, that he messed up with the Panama Canal, and his debaucling of the Iran hostage situation. "In short, our country had sunk to new lows during the Carter years." Clinton's claims to fame are creating a huge government against the Constitution and the will of the people (who promptly reelected him), meddling in Bosnia and other war-torn nations, promoting homosexuality, and Monica Lewinsky. (WHY are these last two issues in a book for 9-year-olds?) In contrast, the Repubs get ONLY positive press in this text.  Finally, the book also says on p178, "Sadly, our country's Supreme Court ruled in 1962 that it was illegal for children to pray in the public schools." That's not true. That law pertains to adult-led corporate prayer, but does nothing to prevent a CHILD from praying in school.  If this book is in line with your political views, then you might want to buy it. But I have a hard time believing that anyone in this day and age thinks SLAVERY was really not such a bad thing. For that reason, no one should by it. This text could be supplemented with something more truthful regarding slavery, like a parent-censored version of "The Slave Narratives," which records hundreds of interviews with former slaves about their lives as slaves and after emancipation. 
 The only explanation is that James Paterson churned this dog out to make a buck. I've read a number of James Patterson books and while I'm not a hard core fan, I've enjoyed most of them. I know this will outrage some Patterson readers but I'm not much of a fan of Alex Cross who frankly I find boring as hell.   As mediocre as Patterson often is as an author, readers should beware, London Bridges is especially bad. The novel reads like an abridgement, moving at a frantic pace without ever generating any suspense. The premise is ridiculous - super criminals with silly names join forces to blackmail world leaders (sounds like the plot for an Austin Powers movie - without any of the humour).   Patterson is not remotely qualified to enter the international terrorist thriller market. An author who churns out 3 or 4 novels a year doesn't have time to do the kind of research that is needed to produce a plausible terrorist thriller.   The twists at the end - "he's the wolf - no, he's the wolf - no, she's the wolf - no...." by the end, I just didn't care.   James Patterson has written some decent crime novels but his fans should beware. Quantity, not quality seems to be Patterson's priority these days. London Bridges is a mess from beginning to end.

 I purchased a 510 PowerShot in summer of 2005. After couple time of use the zoom on the cameras lens wouldn't work anymore. I cound't take any picture anymore. I contacted Canon over this and they ask me to pay shiping to send the camera to them to fix. 
 The books are getting muddled down.  It truly is a bad soap opera.  A place where women dont have enough respect for themselves to choose there own man. Where men fight like animals where cunning means will the dragon sword stike true or not.  When a writer spends 3 pages. 2 or was it 3 times in his book to repeat the exact same  words about how people dress. The question is Jordan writing these books on content or how much money he gets per page? 
 Most of the information is very "theoritical" and "limited" -- author focus mainly on her own analysis of her mother and her relationship with her.  ...  In a nutshell, the message is that a dysfunctional mother'll pass her emotioanal issues to her daughter(s), and in turn, the daughter(s) may pass that onto her offspring(s).  ...   
 I have always admired Chris Whitley and have seen him live several times.  But this CD...he must have owed someone some heavy money to put this thing out for sale.  Take a look at the photo on the cover.  It pretty much says it all.  It's like some sort of bizarre Disney ride, "You must be this high to like this album".  Sorry Chris, reload and try again 
 The World According to Waskow should be the title of the totally nonsensical, wretched collection of claptrap. Arthur "East River" Waskow should hold the title of "rabbit" and not "rabbi" because all he has done here is taken his personal political and pseudo-social agenda and coated it with a think shellac of Judaism. I took this book out of the library. I returned it. You should do the same 
 The whole game is very poor quality. The spinner is made of cheap plastic and comes apart when spun. You have to apply number stickers to the die. Instructions too confusing for the age group.  Very Disappointed 
 This movie was obviously made by Japanese fans of several American films.  It then tried to mix them all together in one film.   The main ones are the Matrix, Reservoir Dogs, and Night of the Living Dead.  Especially the Matrix.  We have several yakuza meeting at a specified location where they usually bury their victims, the location turns out to be a forest of reincarnation so their victims are coming back to life.  Then it is a dead-come-back-to-life genre gore film heavy with feuding Yakuza elements.  Our main character has the long black Matrix type coat and general emotionless demeanor.   The high-tech 360 camera movements of the Matrix are blatantly being imitated minus the high-tech aspect.  Instead it is obvious that the camera itself is being moved 360 around the action.  I really hated the Matrix so a film mainly paying tribute to the Matrix already has a big strike against it.  As for the other elements, they were all brought in awkwardly and it just seemed to constantly extend the story with another element of their favorite American movies that they wanted to include.  The gore was mostly uncreative and uninteresting.  Note that if you are looking for something different than typical American movies by checking out those wacky Japanese movies, you will not get it here 
 Great cover, enticing premise. I couldn't wait to read this book...BUT... Every one-star review before mine lays my feelings out perfectly. Let me add a couple more. Frannie grows up, decides to live with a man and writes home to tell her mother what she's going to do. What does her mother say? That's nice, dear. I trust you to make the right decision. Oh please!!! This is the 19th century after all! Then for good measure let's throw this one into the mix. After the indomitable Una shows understanding and makes decisions that earn her the admiration and accolades of every living person, famous or not, that she comes into contact with...she decides to buy into an oil well to help a friend even though everyone agrees that this is throwing money down the rat hole. An oil well! You must be kidding! Of course, she eventually recoups her money plus a bunch.  I could go on and on. I finished every page of this book although I must say I skimmed through the last 100 pages. When I finished and my husband asked how it was, the only way I could think to describe it was SILLY 
 The Author doesn't really demonstrate any long term problems of the "hook-up culture" and cites a discredited theory about women's bodies not producing oxytocin when they engage in multiple hookups.  She talks to a few women who have had disappointing relationships but doesn't really provide any compelling evidence in her conclusion 
 I was very disappointed to find that the version of Penthouse and Pavement on this collection is the 4:04 edited single version with a horrible edit of the intro.  The original version is something like 6:00, so there's nearly two minutes missing from the song.  Otherwise, most of the must-have Heaven 17 songs are here, but all the shortest versions 
 I purchased the DVD and the remote for my 7 yo daughter today.  The remote has to be programmed using your DVD remote.  This should be a 5 second process but took a good five minutes for it to finally program.  Once it was finally programmed we tried playing the games on the DVD.  First we went to Fairytopia, using the remote.  No problem. Then we had to cross the wall of bubbles. The remote is completely ineffective.  We even tried using the DVD remote, and it was also ineffective. So, it is impossible to go to Fairytopia gameland under the mini game selection.  Then we tried the Bibble dancing game.  Yeah, the remote works alright....but the response of the remote is so highly unpredictable.  It might work or it might not.  The Barbie has to be waved repeatedly for it to work sometimes.  Other times it works just fine.  Yes, we paid attention to our distance from the DVD player and aimed the Barbie correctly.  There's no such thing as repeating the steps of Bibble quickly.  The DVD remote works just fine for this game....the Barbie remote is too unreliable.  Save the $24.99 and buy some other Barbie item.  The only good thing about the remote is that the wings on Barbie do flap.  But, I think it is possible to purchase a Barbie at a cheaper price with flapping wings.  If anyone figures out how to cross the wall of bubbles let us know.  
 I first saw "Bob Roberts" in 1992, when it came out and when I was younger and further to the left than I am now, and I thought it was terrific. Looking back on it, I'm amazed at how easily manipulated I was.  The movie purports to be an expos of how conservatives exploit the media to pander to voters' baser emotions. But "Bob Roberts" does just that to pander to the paranoia and hysteria of the strident left, which has become ever more strident and paranoid since George W. Bush became president (see some of the five-star reviews of this movie, which use words like "Nazipuglican" to describe the writers' political opponents).  Various snipes of mine about the movie:  - Its actual hero, the "muckraking" left-wing journalist, can be found ranting on countless Marxist blogs these days. Robbins has the character murdered, but in real life the CIA has higher priorities than killing off loons who discredit themselves with their own lunacy.  - The preachy right-wing folk songs that Roberts sings are matched in their wooden polemics and poor musicianship by any number of preachy left-wing folk songs that can be heard on college radio stations and in coffeehouses across the U.S.  - The television producer's liberal assistant who shuts off all the electricity in the TV studio where Roberts is about to perform is no heroine. She's a censor, pure and simple, just like the campus morons who attend speeches by those with whom they disagree in order to drown them out with shouting, chanting, and booing. No wonder the audience in the [People's Republik of] Cambridge, MA movie theatre in which I first saw "Bob Roberts" gave her a hearty round of applause.  - But the part of the film that gets me the angriest, 13 years later, is the exchange between one of Roberts' campaign workers, a black man, and a liberal black woman. She essentially accuses him of being an "Uncle Tom." He asks her mildly, "Can't black people have differences of opinion?" She snaps back, "Oh, you're still black?" This mindset, promulgated by the Jesse Jacksons and Al Sharptons of this world, has done more in the last 30 years to keep black Americans poor than any Klansman has...and it's still going on, as can be seen by the left's ugly snipes at Condi Rice and, most recently, at Lt. Gov. Michael Steele of Maryland.  I'm giving "Bob Roberts" two stars, not one, because it did have its moments, and because was in fact something of a pioneer in Hollywood in illustrating the mechanisms behind political media machines, long before "Wag the Dog" came out. But if you want to see thoughtful moviemaking from Robbins, rent "Dead Man Walking. 
 I was very unhappy about the license take by the translators.  It is unbelivable how much they decided to add and take away to maintain the rythm.   They should have worked harder at it or refused to translate if it is not possible to maintain the integrity of the work 
  It is a shame that such a good magazine lacks so much in customer service.  I subscribed  in 2005 and only received one (1) issue which was informative, well structured  and beautifully illustrated.  When i e-mailed the company to find out what had happened with the rest of my subscription, Roseanne Tully's (CEO & Publisher to Intermezzo Magazine) response to my inquiry was that the next publication would be sent immediately and that "the rest of the 6 issues would be delivered even if it takes more than a year".  To date, i have not received a single issue since i made my complaint in March nor have i received a refund.   If you're a foodie as myself, and like to keep up with the trends in the culinary industry;  what good is it to subscribe to a publication that takes your money and does not deliver or delivers outdated magazines 
 I bought this book with much enthusiasm after reading reviews since I wanted to study more about power animals and be able to share some information with others.  Well, there are no water animals except "whale", "dolphin" and "seal" so when we looked up fish, crab, octopus, and frog, we found nothing.  My power animal is the cockatoo - well, there was not even parrot to look up. Bottom line, there are only 36 animals with information.  For those of you who believe in totem animals and power animals, you know that for each person, there may be several animals to look up.  This book is not for those who are looking for a complete selection (obviously, within each species you find so many but it would be nice to at least list the main categories).    "Native beliefs explain that a totem animal is one that is with you for life, often an animal with whom you share a connection, either through interest in the animal or your resemblance to or shared characteristics of the animal in question. A power animal or spirit animal is a spirit in animal form that comes through with a specific lesson for you, and will change throughout the course of your life." 
 There are so many useless books putting down lust and any sex outside of marriage that there is little wonder why teenagers are totally turned off with moralistic authors such as this one. As long as lust serves mutual pleasure responsibly, why should it be a problem at all? 
 Lonestar has accomplished one stratigic plan, have all songs sound like they belong on Lonely Grill.  Their newest album remains true to this belief. While it worked twice, it's getting a little tiresome not only for the ear, but even Richey sounds a bit bored as well.   Basically watered down pop, with no fizz. Try Lonely Grill instead 
 This Entire CD & HBO special is stolen material. All this material was originally written & performed by Bill Hicks. Buy Hicks DVD "Bill Hicks Live - Satirist, Social Critic, Stand-Up Comedian" if you want the material in its true form  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0004Z33FK/qid=1130712550/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-5459925-2315938?v=glance&s=dvd  Bill Hicks was also paid tribute on TooL's Aenima album 
 This was not the book worth for the money.  Some of the recipes were pretty good, but I was expecting different types of potatoes and more unique types of recipes 
 I'm sorry, but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film "Dick." "Dick" is funny, this is not. I'm sorry, but Dustin Hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like Kirsten Dunst (or that level of indefatigable cuteness).  Just go rent "Dick" instead. You'll thank me, yourself, and those fine ladies who saved our country 
 Andy Garcia (Twisted, The Unsaid) who has a few good moments in this movie, plays Jimmy The Saint who is assigned by a parapalegic Christopher Walken (Wedding Crashers, Envy) who's already played this character before only this time he has no feelings in his legs, you see and Walken, he tells Garcia to do a job and so Garcia assembles his crew of 4, William Forsythe (The Devil's Rejects, The Rock), Bill Nunn (Spider-man movies), Christopher Llyod (Back to the Future trilogy) and a crazy as hell Treat Williams (Deep Rising) but the problem is, of course, the job goes terribly wrong so Walken tells Garcia him and his boys have so many hours before his hitman, played by Steve Buscemi (Armageddon, Reservoir Dogs), who has the coolest name for a hitman, Mr. Shhh, comes and kills them all. Garcia then goes crazy, he also has falling in love with sexy Gabrielle Anwar (The Grave) and he doesnt want her in jepoardy and he also is trying to help out this girl who works the streets and so on and so for. Really empty drama thriller with an all star cast and the cast are the following: Jack Warden, Bill Cobbs (Air Bud), Fairuza Balk (The Water Boy), Glenn Plummer (Speed movies), Don Cheadle (Hotel Rwanda, Crash), Josh Charles (Four Brothers), Jenny McCarthy (BASEketball), Marshall Bell (Starship Troopers), Tommy Tiny Lister, Jr. (5th Element), Sarah Trigger (PCU) amd Don Stark (That 70's Show). All that in a so-so post Tarantino style movie 
 This is one of the worst game guides I have read in my life...and I've read a few. I got it back in '97 when the game first came out and spoiled everything (even THE big event at the end of the first disc). I later got the guide from Versus Books and it blew this pathetic book out of the water. It spoiled nothing and had twice the amount of useful secrets (including materia combos). Don't waste your time (and money) with this joke. Thankfully, BRADYGames realized its idiocy, fixed it, and got it right for FFVIII's guide (which basically aped FFVII's Versus Books' guide's style). Then they ruined it again with that awful, useless FFIX guide. I guess money grubbers never learn. And guys, you're supposed to be reviewing the GUIDE, not the game.. 
 It is a book about a dog. A cat liked a dog because he doesn't do dog things like bark at night,howl,beg and run away!There is a big suprise!I read some of the book so far and I liked it, so will you 
 more than half of the selections here are garbage. 
 Beware of this product.  It always freezes up half way though the download when transfering photos to my computer.  I have another USB 1.0 card reader that works perfectly.  I upgrade to get the speed boost with USB 2.0, but this product is fundamentally flawed and buggy 
 This album was a disappointment. I was looking forward to Muddy's covers of "Caldoinia" and "Kansas City" but it wasnt what I thought itd be. Dont get me wrong, Muddy himself was fine, but he gets  overshadowed by the musical collaborators. There is an overuse of harmonica  and organ, and the annoying presence of ACCORDIAN! Accordians and Waters do  not mix. This over-instrumentalization leaves the album sounding lame and  folky and not bluesy. If you're looking for Muddy's later work, try  "Blues Sky", with Muddy working with Johnny Winter and his back  to basics production 
 This review is specific to the Audio CD. I had both watched the documentary and read the book of the Smartest Guys in the Room, and loved them. I found this to have some new info, but I generally don't buy the idea in this audio CD, which is largely that Fastow was a criminal and that Skilling and Lay were just out of it. There are a lot of melodramatic moments in the audio CD that are obnoxious, like, "[Without knowing it, they had just given Fastow a loaded gun. And he was ready to use it]." The narrator does an okay job; he has a deep voice and sounds like someone on educational films, but you can only listen to these CDs for an hour or so before you become bored. And I say that as someone obsessed with Enron... For instance, quite a lot of the specific details regarding the off book partnerships show up in the audio CDs, which is not terribly exciting to start with. I also don't agree with Eichenwald's claim that this presentation is all very accurate, on the grounds that he has reconstructed actual conversations. Any reconstructions of conversations are necessarily biased or colored by the recollections of the participants in those conversations, and of course, by the fact that there are conversations about which the author probably never hears! Probably less honest, really, that someone who just admittedly works with a party (like Mimi Schwartz with Sharon Watkins) and puts forth what we all know is a perspective 
 I just stopped, bored. Maybe there is something here to grab someone,  but not this total fan of Unsworth's other work. I say, read the book he was trying to write when I wrote this one. Sacred Hunger towers over this like  Churchill over John Majo 
 This machine has plenty of power but the beater attachments leave 1/2" of dough/batter unmixed on the walls of either bowl.  I don't have the blind love for the "idea" of the kitchenaid brand that most of the self-declared gormet buyers have--it flat-out isn't worth it unless you need to be seen using one to fit in with your friends.  It's a great deal in dollars per pound and "old world" charm.  I have actually gone back to using my $60 consumer quality dual-beater mixer.  I think this mixer really shines when you bolt on the saussage-maker or cigarette-roller attachment on the PTO sticking out the front 
 Nuevamente, Coelho nos demuestra sin tapujos lo que es su principal interes. Ganar dinero con literatura barata y facilista destinada para dar a oir lo que se quiere oir sin compromiso, con una llanura mental rampante. Lastima de los arboles cortados para hacer el papel en el que se imprimio esta basura 
 I wouldn't call this a book. Softcover, 47 pages. Let's be honest -- this is a pamphlet.  Did I mention it's 47 pages?  P.S. It's 47 pages long 
 I just wonder if this would have been published without the author's being married to an author;  I find his stuff repetitively boring as well.  This is a simplistic story of an orphan wife who acts as though she can't stand her husband and seems to glory in anything she can do to upset him  Her friend in these endeavors is an obviously manic / depressive (sorry, term has been replace by bi-polar victim ) whose wealth seems to make her the star.  Their enemy is the EVIL (can't use that word either) Eagle Forum which is trying to close down the local store where the kids get their drug paraphanalia.  It seems that both ladies have problems (oops, not allowed any more by the political correctness police, I mean 'issues') with their male counterparts.  They act like they hate their husbands.  I'd recommend this to anyone who hates Religious people and loves to see kids getting in trouble with drugs.  A dog . .  
 Savage Run starts off on a note worthy of Carl Hiaason - a cow explodes and blows up Stewie Woods, environmental extremist, and his bride. The book ends with a good dose of Zane Grey as the protaganist and his companions are chased to an impassable canyon by a deranged killer. In between, two serial killers take out several well-known treehuggers in particularly humiliating ways. All in all, an entertaining concept for a mystery.  What I did not like about this book was the writing, which I thought needed polish. The author seems most interested in portraying the earnest game warden Joe Pickett, a good guy but  prone to costly mistakes. The serial killers are well developed also. But many characters have been drawn straight from central casting - the bad guy lawyer, the sheriff who wants to write off the crime and be done with it, the pretty wife who throws a hissy fit and stamps off to her room. In addition, parts of the book are thoroughly predictable. Will Joe forget to take the evidence and later find that it's disappeared? Is the wife upset because she was involved with Stewie in the past? You could answer without reading the book.  Another problem for me was the descriptions of the crime scenes. Although they include glaring clues, Box expects the reader to accept them as unsolvable. Whether you go along depends upon your tolerance for the highly improbable. Such as authorities wondering if the charred victim set the fire himself. Yeah. First he died, then he poured the gasoline and lit it.    Although I finished this book, I felt it didn't live up to its hype. Mine is a minority opinion though; the other members of my book club loved it.  
 I found this book to be poorly written and repetitive.  Needed some more peer/editorial reviews before going to market.  Could not even get past the first 3 chapters 
 Hes upset of successful people because they can use their subconscious for success but unlike martee/druggie tell amazon.com to delete him.Buy this dvd if you like 2 pac, i don`t like this dvd much but i respect the fact he used his spiritual subconscious for real success 
 Man, there's no way to describe this movie.  Slow, boring, unidimensional, bad plot, really bad acting... Really low-budget (in a bad way)  I'm not gonna get my time or my money back. I bought it based on the reviews, and they were really off... Even if you enjoy the gothic ambience, believe me, it's really bad.   You've been warned 
 Doll Revolution has one major flaw.  Only a few of the songs showcase Susanna Hoffs on lead vocals.  (I love to hear her sing.)  If you purchase this album and enjoy Hoffs' voice, you'll be left wanting more.  While I applaud the idea of trying something new, it didn't work here.  The Bangles need Hoffs on lead vocals.  It's just that simple.    
 This book examines the problem of financial misstatements with a special focus on Enron. The book is light on facts and analysis, but heavy on opinion. Most of the chapters just restate contemporary criticisms of contemporary management decision-making (e.g., greed). The authors have very little to say about warning signs and the accounting used by management to mislead investors. Those wanting a more substantive analysis of the issues and the perspective of an insider should read Arthur Levitt's new book, "Take on the Street. 
 It still amazes me that anyone takes Gould seriously. He is an admitted Marxist, and he allows his social beliefs to influence science. That is not science. Science is a dispasionate search for the truth. I get the feeling reading this book that Gould doesn't like what the truth is, so he wants to shape the way we see the truth. They used to do that in the middle ages when it started to look like the earth revolved around the sun.  Gould tries to claim that Samuel George Morton fudged his data on measuring skull sizes. This is not true. Morton conducted his tests with integrity, and only one error was found which actually benefited the measurements of a non-Caucasian group (Kevin McDonald, "Culture of Critique", 36). General intelligence is not a "statistical artifact" as Gould wants to promote.  Gould or any other scientist who wants to take Darwin out of biological sciences should be viewed with extreme skepticism 
 This is awful! The female characters seem to have no direction of their own.  Lindsay accepts her boyfriend, Todd taking charge of her life as  readily as she accepts being raped by a wealthy businessman who randomly  breaks into her apartment, rapes her, and is content to leave as soon as  she tells him she will have his baby. Her doctor feels that he has the  right to get into her files without permission due to his previous  knowledge of her, and she simply accepts this. One particularly disturbing  scene is a memory of Lindsay's father beating her severely for a childish  outburst at the age of 11, followed by Lindsay's holding her father's hand  to her heart in remorse.  The only man in this story who doesn't believe  that he has a right to interfere with the lives of these women is Lindsay's  husband John Henry - and he's in a coma.  This is the most depressing book  I've ever read in my life. Reading it is a life sentence 
 The notion that Jesus' values were those of corporate America and his "charisma" of the sort that makes insurance salemen is so laughably a fantasy that I hope the other reviews are meant as jokes. Portraying Jesus as a "booster," a kind of successful Willy Loman, is about as ludicrous as picturing Mother Teresa as a fashion model and Gandhi as a comic book superhero. The Jesus of the New Testament would have observed the conspicuous consumption of corporate America, the cultural gluttony of the Western World, with sadness and disgust.  Jesus may be the ultimate Rorschach. We look at him: Nazis see a blue-eyed Aryan beset by Jews and look for somebody to beat up; gays see their lifestyle affirmed in the friendhip with John; chickenhawk warriors somehow see endorsement of the hateful causes they want others to die for; the tenderhearted and compassionate see him surrounded by happy children; feminists see the women by his side; lying hypocrites see... God knows what.   The hardest thing for humans to do is to comprehend that their heroes are not just big versions of themselves. A hero should be something to push against, not a self-endorsement. Jesus told the rich to give away their money. He told his followers not to gather up treasures in the world. He said wealth is a burden that will keep the rich out of Heaven. He scourged the moneylenders. He was a freeloader. He is bad for business.  Today, as the most affluent country on the planet, we hear the Christian message as unhappily as the young wealthy Hebrew who asked Jesus what he must do to be saved. His answer was NOT "get an MBA." But instead of walking away, we invent new myths of a  Jesus more suitable, one able to see past his silly prejudice against money grubbers, to see that it is possible to be rich and really nice.  Barton's book is a bizarre anachronism; a last survivor of the Babbitt years of pious Philistinism and Pharisaic self-approval just before the Depression turned our complacent cultural narcissism upside down. How sad, that it's coming back into fashion. Read Jim Wallis' *God's Politics* for a theology less absorbed with self-justification 
 Mark Dery's writing style makes my mind wander and fails to pull me in. He mentions something about everything, from Ace Ventura's anal speech to the burning of Waco. "The Pyrotechnic Insanitarium: American Culture on the  Brink" gives short insight into life's odd episodes, freak shows, and  moments of insanity but misses out on making a statement worthy of  reaction. As I read, I kept thinking, "yes, I know, so what?" Give me  something, anything. I guess was expecting more 
 Like others here I bought the 5 piece set on the gold box deal.  What junk.  These are made in China knives that can be had for a dime a dozen at any discount retailer.  
 Pirsig mistakes mental illness for deep philosophical thought; he mistakes child abuse for some form of "real" child rearing.  I just read his interview in the Guardian UK.   Although it has been years since I have read this book, it still leaves an awful taste in my mouth when I think about it.  I have read philosophy from classic to contemporary; I have lived in Japan and practiced Zen archery and Zen meditation - this book has only incorrect views of Western AND Eastern philosophy yet Pirgsig, to this day thinks he has contributed to the philosophical canon. This is proof that Pirsig remains deranged.  Moreover, in the Guardian UK interview he still found the time to criticize his son who was brutally murdered; Pirsig then tries to elicit sympathy by mentioning his son's murder. Pirsig is a perfect example of someone with Narcisstic Personality Disorder.  Pirsig's son should have sought court protection from his monstrous father and largely absent and/or capitulating mother.   If you are one of the poor souls who finds something "deep" in this very large pile of verbal manure then I think therapy would be money well spent 
 I'm a white man that is interested in dating black women.  However, I don't want a black woman that dresses different to attract white men. I want a black women and not a white women with darker skin. And to hate and be negitive of black men is also moronic.  Wortless book! Save your money and go buy a DVD or something as you will be much better off than reading this rubbish 
 Serious Concerns is an 87 page collection of self-indulgent, cynical jabs at the publishers and commissioners, as well at the reader and at other poets.  It is one big in-joke that belongs in a very small circle in a  depressed part of Britain 
 Not to be disrespectful but are you people for real? I can't believe this book is getting 4 and 5 stars. There was nothing good about this book. A bunch of people in the book did not even matter, Bill Kendall's wife, the new anchor man Pete whatever his last name was, the boss Yelena, Eliza's boyfriend, the priest, even the soon-to-be-president and his wife, I mean what's the point in even mentioning them? They were not involved in the main events. She didn't even talk about what happened to them at the end. The judge is the only one that matters, and she didn't even write about him all that much. Really disappointing. As I said I don't mean to be disrespectful, but to give this book 5stars, you must have read either bedtime stories all your life, or not have read anything.  DON"T WASTE YOUR MONEY that's all i have to say. sorr 
 I am a big fan of Westerns.  I like old and new and I am always eager to watch something different.  This was a TNT original movie and as such my rating would be 4 stars which is to say better than most TV movies.  However, by comparison to theatrical releases this movie pales and I can only give it 2 stars which is being kind.  I loved the cast, but the acting was surprisingly bland.  The script was not bad, but neither was it engaging.  The action was weak, especially the shootout at the end which was edited poorly.  The only thing I found that the movie had going for it was an insteresting premise which halfway through the movie had already grown old.  When I see 4 and 5 star ratings and I think of all the great classic westerns, this just doesn't measure up.  Open Range, a Kevin Costner Western that is just a few years old shoots circles around this one.  I recommend watching this one first before purchasing, I wish I had 
 IN 1998 Clinton said there were weapons of mass destruction. Terrorist are americas greatest threat.  Clinton swept the first bombing OF WTC under the rug...The CIA/intelligence failed the american people numnerous times.  America fights terrorist who  are the true infidels.  They will kill, behead, drag our bodies down streets every chance they can........Americans, many are in total denial of how serious/evil terriorst in  Iraq, Iran, Syria and other countries are.  It is amazing how Americans can have such different views on our greatest enemies.   TERRORIST 
 I am not at all happy with this product. The instructions are terrible and the program is not at all intuitive. It was a total waste of my money and time. 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 What is the use of a USB port if it won't play the Ipod.  Also, the speaker wires aren't long enough 
 I just bought this camera and took it to one of my kid's indoor soccer games. The light was low, but not that low.  You should be able to take a picture without the flash. When I took the flash off, the picture looked fine on the preview, but came out completely black.  Yet the camera was able to take perfectly fine video at the same light level!  What a disappointment.  I am going to try to return it 
 I have had a major problem with this dock. Which is that I can't get it to work with any firewire cable except the one supplied with it. I've tried several cables (that I've tested and I know for certain work) but none will work. I can get power (the blue light goes on) but I can't get the iPod (60 gig 4th gen photo) to show up in the itunes window or in the mac finder (I haven't  tried it with windows). This problem is perplexing because I don't see any difference physically in the 6 pin firewire cable supplied with this dock and the others that I have tried. I've emailed maxell but they have yet to give me an answer to this problem (after one week). There may be a simple answer but I don't have time to make this dock work right. I need to use my ipod so I'm returning it. In short, a word of warning, If you need to connect this dock via firewire and need a cable longer than the two foot one supplied with it, you may be out of luck 
 I'll start out by saying that this book had a co-writer. That's not usually the end of the world, but in this case, it seemed to make everything sort of wooden and unfeeling. Not that I expected much more from an investing book (it was a triumph..I laughed, I cried!), but this was really at the edge of readability, in my book.  Which leads me to two huge pet peeves, which were violated in this tome.  First, penultimate means NEXT TO last. Some people, even to those that "ultimate" means last, think penultimate means "very last, or "really the conclusion last," but it doesn't. It means NEXT TO last. I learned this in school, in 7th or 8th grade, when we read some knights of the round table stuff (le morte d'arthur, the green knight (I think), and others). Uther Pendragon was King Arthur's predecessor, and he was, in shallowly veiled allusion, the "pen dragon," meaning the one before the dragon, who was Arthur. So remember- penultimate is not last.  The other complaint, which is somewhat esoteric, is on the definition of "inflection point." Inflection points are not places where the graph or plot peaks at highs or lows. Inflection points are specifically where the rate of change shifts from positive to negative. For example, if the market grew at 5% in year 1, then grew 10% in year 2, then grew 15% in year 3, then grew 10% in year 4, then grew 5% in year 5, then lost 5% in year 6, then lost 10% in year 7, the inflection point would NOT be sometime between year 5 and 6. The inflection point would actually be between year 3 and 4, when the rate of change of value stopped increasing and started decreasing. Another way to rememeber it is when the graph shifts from concave up to concave down. If your graph can hold water, like a cup, it's concave up, and the other part is concave down. I'm not explaining it too well, but if you really care, check out an algebra textbook or google it. I checked other investing sources about this, to see what they say, and most have confusing definitions, like "A point on a chart that marks the beginning of a significant move, either up or down." That's sort of true, but it seems to reinforce the Neff-like definition of an inflection point, which is "when the market stops going up and starts going down."  OK, done with that rant. Believe it or not, I actually thought this book was pretty good. The first part is a sort of autobiographical piece about how he found himself as a fund manager. The rest of the book is about what his fund did through every major market event, from the beginning until the 90's. A side effect of his Windsor fund summary is that it's essentially a summary of every major market event for the last 50 years. I admit, I started skimming in the late 70s, only because I've read other market histories lately. It was good- if that's what you're looking for.  Being a person that felt the pain of a huge stock market correction in 2001-2 (remember, I was the guy that thought I was diversified because I held most of my money in Fidelity Select Technology), I enjoy reading histories of other huge market. People that say everything has changed since things like "The Intelligent Investor" was written are up there with people that say value investing is dead. Neither is right, long term.  So, despite being annoyed at the little things, this was an interesting read. This is another book that I wouldn't recommend until you've read some of the classics first, though. I give it a weak buy 
 As the other reviewer said, the book have some wrong informations about raising a pet dog (like feeding table scraps). After reading things like that I'm really afraid of taking the info in this book in consideration, to care for my dog. The author seens to be more of a show dog owner, and puts that into the book, but since I know nothing about the subject, can't really tell if it would be good for someone thinking about show dogs 
 I bought this toy for my son who LOVES bubbles.  I put it together and can not make it work.  I checked it several times and the solution will not go all the way up.  I gave it to my brother-in-law to check out and he could not make it work either.  I can say that the Gazillion bubble solution is the best I have ever used 
 This is an OK book, if it's the first of the series one has read.  However, for those who have read Fluke's earlier "Hannah" mysteries, it is a crashing bore.  Hannah, her mother, sister, suitors, etc. are interesting, well-delineated characters.  The problem comes with Fluke's setting: her idyllic, Minnesota village is such a great place that readers of more than one of these cozies know from the outset that the crime was committed by an outsider.  This series has become the most formulaic I have ever read: Hannah will dither between her two suitors, Mom will continue to be charmingly demanding and eccentric, everyone will need block heaters in the Minnesota, and I won't read any more Hannah Swensen mysteries 
 As a big fan of the Postal Service (their "Give Up" easily makes the cut on my top 10 albums), I had high expectations for this Dntel record, as Jimmy Tamberello is one half of the Postal Service. BIG mistake. Listen to the samples: if you like what you hear, then buy it; if you don't like what you hear, don't make my mistake of thinking that the songs get better beyond the 30 seconds given. Worthwhile songs on this CD: 1)"(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan" (The Postal Service remix is available on iTunes, and is a better version than what's on the CD), sung by Ben Gibbard of Death Cab and Postal Service. 2)"Last Songs" is if anything, relaxing. I recommend getting these two songs on iTunes and leaving it at that, save some money.  The CD's too expensive for two decent songs.  Jimmy Tamberello has another digital project that he works called Figurine and (more recently) James Figurine, it's essentially a catchier, poppier version of Dntel, more in line with Postal Service 
 When I reviewed Franken's "Why Not Me?" I explained that I had read it because I loved "Rush Limbaugh is a Big..." but "Why Not Me?" had fallen short of my high expectations.  THIS book was even MORE disappointing.  The subject matter is worn and the material is not that creative, and sadly, just not that funny.  Honestly, I WANTED to laugh- I LIKE Al Franken, but this book just feels forced, the kind of thing that's churned out just to meet a publisher's deadline and get Franken's face back to the front of book racks (Pre- "Lies..." of course).  It's worth reading if you are stuck on an airplane, or an elevator, or something.  Otherwise, pick something else by Franken.  ANYTHING else by Franken 
 Basically a recital of accomplishments and events, with next to no detail about most of them.  The only thing he really goes into depth about was his trial before the King's Bench.  Also, it appears to be writtin almost on a 6th grade level.  Not impressed at all 
 Normally I don't take the time to write a review, but this book just bugged me.  When I finished I felt like I had run a marathon.  The book was just too drawn out and I felt the descriptions were long winded.  Faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem.  The plot was good, but moved slowly.  I am typically not drawn to Danielle Steel books and probably with good reason that I never seem to like them very much.  I am glad that this book was in a box of 30+ books that I paid $15 for at a used book store.  I would have felt like I wasted my money had I actually paid full price for it 
 Easy to see why this book didn't sell very well. Sorry, guys, but the kids in the Metallica t-shirts really did it. No, dem 'der hicks in Arkansas weren't just looking for innocent teenagers to execute 
 THIS ALBUM IS OKAY NOT THEIR BEST. A FEW SONGS ARE GOOD OTHER THAN  THAT THIS ALBUM  IS FAIR.PURCAHSE IT WITH YOUR MONEY INTELLIGENTLY!!!!!!!! 
 Now, I enjoy Victorian adventure fiction as much as the next person -- in fact, probably more than the next person, since the average "next person" hasn't ever read any. Tales of derring-do, adventures to unexplored distant lands, lost civilizations, great artifacts, etc. -- that's all good stuff. What's not good is this book, which is tedious in the extreme. On the surface of it, Haggard's followup to his hugely successful (and infinitely better) "King Solomon's Mines" has all the elements: a dynamic duo of scholar-adventurers (one of whom is descended from pharaohs!), a mysterious message from the past delivered by a dying man, an expedition to Africa, and a supernatural being who knows the secret of eternal life.  However, despite this promising laundry list, Haggard's execution leaves a great deal to be desired. A friend described it rather aptly as "a book with a lot of story, but not a lot of plot." Which is to say that in my edition, some 320 pages are filled without much happening. There is the initial mysterious set-up, the journey to dark Africa with the usual physical trials and tribulations, the heroes' conveyance to the "lost city", and then... and then things kind of grind to a halt. Lengthy descriptive details, lengthy internal ruminations, lengthy rambling speeches, lengthy everything -- but very little of consequence occurs until the very end, when the heroes make a dangerous journey to find the eternal fire which grants nigh-everlasting life.  I suspect much of the problem stems from the book's origin as a long-running serial in the Gazette. As I understand it, serial writers of the time were paid by the word or by the installment, and thus, it was to their advantage to spin their plots out as much possible -- hence the unhealthy ratio of action to words. Judicious editing could reduce the book to 1/3 of its size without any loss of note. Of course, as another friend pointed out, it's probably best to read the book is small chunks -- just as one would have done with installments. Spreading out one's reading of it over a period of time, he suggests, may serve to conceal the book's rambling nature. In any event, there are some nice scenes here and there, such as the moonlight battle between crocodile and lion and another involving human cadavers used as torches, but those are about all I'm likely to recall from this book in a year.   Of course, as is noted in the introduction to my edition, Haggard lifted the main elements of the plot, and even the the true name of "She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named", from several earlier adventure novels by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, so one can't even give him much credit for imagination. I suppose the book is worth reading by those interested in literary representations of the prevailing xenophobic sentiments of Victorian Englishmen: racism, anti-Semeticism, misogyny, fear of miscegenation, etc., but as entertainment for the modern reader, it falls woefully short of the mark. 
 Moore sets out to blame guns, rather than the people who make Prozac and other 'designer' seditives for the massacre at Columbine High School and runs afoul of Mr. NRA himself, Moses, better known as Charleton  Heston. Heston, gentlemanly as he is defeats all futile arguments Moore, an anit-gun (mostly) leftist has v. the Second Amendment. Long live the second Amendment, otherwise the First Amendment is gone, too! Moore should wake and wise up. Better Moore efforts that are highly recom- mended are: The Big One, Fahrenheit 9/11, Roger and Me and even the un- derrated Canadian Bacon 
 I heard this CD for the first time at a friends house and loved the beat.  I love reggae!  I was unable to listen to the words/meaning of the songs, while I was there.  I just knew that it got my head bobbin.  I bought the CD the next day, and was quite surprised when listening to the lyrics.  I wasn't aware that I had bought such a religious CD.  My friend had warned me that matisyahu was a jewish man with strong beliefs, but I wasn't expecting EVERY SINGLE song to be based on it.  You definately have to be a religious person to enjoy this CD, otherwise, just don't buy it.  I kind of feel out of place listening to it because I don't relate.  If matisyahu used his beats for something other than preaching, I might purchase that CD.  He does have talent, I just haven't been able to connect with the music 
 The actors spend too much time just staring at each other without speaking. The story is too unbelievable too. It was a waste of my money to buy it. 
 After two weeks on this diet plan I could bearly lift my head up.  I nearly fell asleep driving home from work nights...not to mention hardly staying awake while at work.  I thought it would be a pleasant change from the restrictions of Atkins, but I was never tired on Atkins.  I don't know if it had something to do with insulin from the sudden onslaught of carbs...or what the problem was.  All I know is I am happily following Atkins and losing much more rapidly than I did on this CAD plan.  In two weeks I lost 6 lbs. on CAD...14 on Atkins.  You figure it out 
 I'm in agreement with the previous viewer.  The sound is okay but what exactly makes this a Cape Cod Cd 
 It's just that simple.  There is NO credible clinical evidence that chelation therapists do anything for patients except lighten their bank accounts.  If any chelation therapist wants to sue me for writing this, BRING IT ON!  
 if god is what you want, this is the book for you. If is a way to seperate your self from the horror of alcohol abuse, look else where.This is a book review, not a whos right or wrong blog. After reading this book, I have deducted that the teachings are cult like and support no scientific fact. The version of the book has been updated over time, but still contains the premise originally written over 69 years ago. 69 years? You are going to treat a behavior problem with a technique that old? Its like cutting off your leg to treat a broken ankle. Things have changed, along with the treatment of substance abuse. About the authors, You have the internet USE IT. William Wilson, writing the book was going through withdrawls and under the influence of a drug called belladonna. Any one would report "seeing god" under those circumstances. Wilson was also unfaithfull to his wife, with new members of AA, this is called 13th stepping. Most of all he plagerised other authors to develop his program. The Steps were stolen from a man named Buchman, who wanted control through his religous beliefs, (the Oxford Group) and was a Hitler supporter. Please, if you are getting mad at my review, Check the internet or other books that support my statements. I know, people are going to say, it works for me. I support you, congrats. As a book it is out dated, sexist, and misleading 
 While I only am a little over half way through this book, I'm finding myself hating Will.  He's pathetic and boring and not at all a character that I can cheer for.  This book has been a tedious read overall.  I keep pushing through because I feel like it has to get better, yet so far it has not.  I'm happy that I checked this out from the library, so that I can return it and not have it collect dust on MY shelves.  The only reason why I'm even writing a review is that I'm so shocked about all the positive comments this book has received thus far.  I looked on Amazon to see if my thoughts were shared by others; I'm surprised that they are not.  I usually like this genre of fiction, but in terms of this book all it is is a bunch of whining and self-loathing 
 It says a lot when a young band's debut album is copy-protected. The record company seems to broadcast to the entire world that Kasabian are the next big thing, so you better get in line and BUY the thing now. Thanks to my local library, I found out the real reason for slapping a copy-protection on this album thereby moving more units: Kasabian are lame.  We are now officially in the 21st century. And as a listening audience, we're hard-pressed to be taken by brat rock anymore. Yeah, Kasabian have an attitude. They mouth off about other rock stars, good for them. They also play innocuous, vanilla brit-pop that takes a simplistic, single idea and drives it into the ground. After listening to this label-guarded turkey, these are the only merits that come to mind for these guys.  It's all getting to be a bit much. Every couple of months and we're treated to another juvenile band from the UK who think they can dominate the world by singing about 'gihls.' Between this and the Artic Monkeys, when will it cease? Where have you gone, Blur?  Even if this didn't have a copy-protection on it, I don't consider it to be CDR worthy 
 I should have paid closer attention to bat hunters review since he gave it away when he said; "It took me listening to this disc about 5 times before I could really start enjoying it all the way through." Heck, I was lucky to make it all the way through the first time! This release is extremely repetitive and simplistic with lame lyrics and just plain bad singing. Now, if you enjoy bad singing with real musicianship, then I highly recommend The String Cheese Incident.  While I mean no offense to anyone, this band comes no where close to the direction of King Crimson or Pink Floyd.  As a former radio DJ who specialized in jazz/rock fusion and jam bands and appreciates great music and musicianship, I find this release has absolutely no sustenance to sink your teeth in to and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  With a name like Perpetual Groove, I expected a lot more. A jam band they are not 
 Ms. Spurling has done a lot of research, and clearly knows a lot about Matisse. But for a newcomer to Matisse, her presentation is confusing and frustrating. The organization of her materials is very poor, her writing is  a breathless, hyperactive stlye that is difficult to endure. I learned a  lot about Matisse, but I didn't enjoy it, and I'm confused about much that  I read. Overall, I'm disappointed 
 Superheroes are adolescent power fantasies. They should not be taken seriously by anyone over the age of 10. After that, they should only be read for laughs and kitsch value. This book is just silly. Comic book superheroes cannot and should not be compared to real mythology that has lasted untold generations and has literary merit 
 This book was conceived from an incorrect perception of "America". United States is not only America. What about the other countries such Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Argentina, etc. Maybe, the correct title for this book is "Some surnames in United States of America". Since the United States of America were forged with immigrants, the author did not respect the particularities of other surnames established in the United States as jews, russians, germans, frenchs, irish, among others 
 I am a huge fan of Dr. Seuss since he was a favorite of mine as a child.  When my 3-year-old first took "The Cat in the Hat Comes Back" off the shelf, I was happy to read it to her.  However, I was not happy when the Cat reveals little Cats A-G, only to have them whip out guns, explaining "My cats are good shots.  My cats have good guns.  They will kill all of those spots."  Then after he unveils the other little cats who are armed with bats and rakes, they continue to state that they will "Kill the spots!"  I don't approve of this kind of language or imagery in a children's book.  It's bad enough that there is violence all over the media - on television, in video games, and even children's toys.  I keep my child away from these influences, but thought I could trust Dr. Seuss with his whimsical charm.  Unfortunately, I can't. I just wanted to give this heads up to parents considering this book 
 I read this book years ago...or, rather, tried to. I'm sure there are better examples of the truism, "When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail," but not many.    If you're another 12-step 'bot who peppers your conversation and decals your bumper with slogans like "One Day at a Time," you'll probably really, really like _When Society Becomes an Addict_. I myself found it to be one of the worst self-help books I've ever seen ... and in a genre glutted with self-indulgence, pseudo-science, and hidden agendas, that's saying a lot.    If there is anything we emphatically do *not* need more of in politics, it's therapy. Lift your head out of your 12-step cocoon and look around you: We've got people using various and often spurious diagnoses to shirk responsibility for everything from proper child-rearing to murder. We've been bringing back censorship with a vengeance in the last few decades because of a misguided belief that the world must cater to the delicate psyches of the traumatized, the easily offended, the "oppressed," and, most of all, "da chyldrun." And no politician dares run for any major office without drawing lots of attention to his or her "sensitive side," often with short, sappy, pseudo-heartwarming "personal interest" films.    Schaef may indeed have claimed that men are no longer the problem, but obviously she still claims that we need to feminize American society more. Uh, when little boys are widely and heavily medicated just for acting like little boys, I think we've feminized society quite enough. And I'm a woman with a good many feminist sympathies.    Too bad it had to take September 11th to wake so many people up to the fact that we need more than consensus-seekers, empathizers, and nurturers -- we need leaders, individuals with the courage to make unpopular moral judgments, and warriors and heroes. Of both sexes 
 This book is less about the Jerusalem that Bellow visited and more about himself.  Indeed, his presence is so pronounced that he appears more fascinated with his own perceptions than he is with what he is witnessing, or so it seemed to me.  While the writing is clear and vivid, I can now recall virtually nothing of what he describes, except for himself and his personal reactions - it is he who sees things more clearly than his hosts, etc etc.  After 100 pages, this is boring.  Alas, I got nothing out of this and it is also badly dated.  Not recommended 
 I was quite disappointed to find this "book"--pamphlet-sized, large fonts spreading out over sixty plus pages, roughly a paragraph per page--living up to its title. It is really no more than a glorified lecture from an established philosopher who, it would seem, has become big enough to pull a con job on his readers. In the end, Frankfurt takes all this time to reach the conclusion that BS is different from lying, in my opinion hardly worth the paper it's printed on. All in all, an inconsequential and not very entertaining analytical exercise by an emeritus academic with too much time on his hands. If you want to read a work that lives up to being called "entertaining" and "enlightening" you could try "From Lowbrow to Nobrow" (2006).     
 This was a "notorious rip off".  This was a misrepresentation of Lemony Snickets Series.  Amazon intentionally leaves out the fact that this is a blank notebook and is not the latest release in the series.  People who are waiting for the release are being duped into buying this worthless book with the expectations of receiving something else.  This is switch and bate and Amazon has stooped to it. Good way to loose customers pulling this kind of business!!! By the way, there should be a spot of 0 stars 
 I bought the book, expecting to know the solution on how to raise my kids so that they become good members of the society. But what I got was just a guideline that I should teach my children well during their early years. It's all too simple to hear from such an expert. There is nothing new on how to raise a moral child compared with what I can get from a good how-to-raise-a-child book. The quality of contents in this book is no way near Emotional Intelligenc 
 While the story is good and well done, the quality of the DVD itself was disappointing.  Certainly offered no sharpness as one expects of digital technology.  Also the scenes changed suddenly as though the whole thing was done from a Video tape of the production with the advertising cut out.  Not good to watch at all.  We were expecting the customary quality that one associates with DVD 
 I sympathise with the theme of this novel and I really wanted to like it. The ugly face on neo liberalism should be exposed more often.   Unfortunately, the exploration of the idea is studded with cliches and the  writing is often too self consciously cute for comfort - Billy Bragg songs  cover the same territory with far greater ease 
 I was hoping for something much more layman in explaining the great quantum physics. It is not an easy read. I have found other books that were more easy to read on the subject 
 Obviously any book that claims to tbe the hundred best of any genre of books is an automatic target for potshots from committed readers.  But this book is a fatter target than most.      Any children's librarian at any public library, and any bookseller at an independent bookstore, will give a parent far more help than this, and for free.  Some of the choices are so obvious that it's sad to waste space on them -- what parent really needs to be told about Pat the Bunny?  As to the overall selection of books, let's just say it's banal and uninteresting and leave it at that.   Some of the choices are  obvious sops to political correctness -- viz. Johnny Tremain.  And any book claiming to list the 100 best children's books that doesn't include a single title by Arthur Ransome does a major disservice to parents trying to buy good books for their children.  Save the price of the book and just spend a few minutes with a preschool or elementary school teacher, a librarian, or a good bookseller 
 Huge problems with the LCD screen, two cameras within one month after purchase showed the LCD "shattered." One has already been shipped for service and the other one will be going in tomorrow.  Sure it is easy to use and produces great pictures, but the LCD problem is a definite negative. 
 While the author has some good ideas for start-up businesses, she is behind the times.  Keep in mind it was most recently published 6 years ago.  Read it to get ideas, but don't count on it to reflect current trends.   According to the author, typing, word processing, old school computer  languages, and pagers are all in hot demand 
 This is one of three Iris Murdoch books I have read, as a good friend of mine is a big fan. I have yet to see why. I found Nuns and Soldiers silly and overwrought, an extended but inexplicable love story filled with  improbable and self conscious conversations. Do people experiencing a coup  de foudre really sit around and dissect their feelings? I don't find the  philosophical or moral underpinnings of the story to be compelling, either.  Social requirements versus individual desire, I guess 
 The cover of this film says "If you loved THE MISSION and THE APOSTLE(which I did!) then you will LOVE MOLOKAI!"........Sorry....I didn't!This film cannot even begin to be compared with those wonderful films.Paul Cox's direction of such talent as Sir Derek Jacobi and Peter O'Toole is an utter travesty.David Wenham is positively laughable as Father Damien.The screenplay dialogue is sheer dribble and the film is as static as static can be.What SHOULD have been a riveting retelling of Hawaii's "dirty little secret" is reduced to pure nonsense and cliche deplorably acted by all parties.Even the breathtaking cinematography of the Hawaiian Islands (which was minimal at best) could not bring salvation to  this leperous bore!Even the film BLACKROBE was better than this 
 So not at all what i was expecting. I had heard a lot of good things about this movie over the years and when i finally sat down to watch it,i was terribly disappointed and confused.  
 and none i haven't seen elsewhere in my other DIY garden project books. I was NOT inspired 
 Generation Rx" begins by musing over an article in the House and Home section of the New York Times reporting the rise in popularity of "triple-wide" medicine cabinets - taller, wider, and deeper.  Cause of this phenomena - the average number of prescriptions/person was 7/year in '93, 11 in '00, and 12 in '04 - despite enormous uncertainty about their benefits and safety.  (There are an estimated 106,000 deaths/year from serious adverse drug reactions from just those properly diagnosed and taken.  Drug-induced liver disease is the most  common cause of acute liver failure - more than viral hepatitis.)  A major source of this growth is the increased amount spent to advertise prescription drugs to consumer - from $2 million in '80 to $4.4 billion in '04.  Protecting these investments and sales is an additional one-half billion/year spent lobbying by pharmaceutical firms.  So much for the interesting part.  The vast bulk of "Generation Rx" is a rambling series of anecdotes guaranteed to put the reader to sleep.  I instead would recommend "The Truth About Drug Companies," and "Overdosed America" - both written by eminent physicians 
 The premise is great - man on a mission to save his long-lost love on a dying world - but the plot went downhill from there, at least for me, and the ending was completely unsatisfying. There was no real resolution, and what does the hero have left at the end? I didn't like his love interest at all, and she seemed vapor-brained to me - putting herself into a culture where she was essentially a sex slave to both her mate and his bondsman. Ick. George R.R. Martin is a brilliant writer, but this left me cold 
 I enjoyed the story of Chi Chi Rodriguez and how he over came illness & poverty, however, I lost interest when I read vulgar quotes from a gay recording mogul. I should not have to pay to be offended. I will not buy anything from these authors again 
 ...essentially you get what you pay for. This book is certanly NOT representative of what I have come to expect from National Geographic.   I had eagerly anticipated the arrival of my book, but was dissappointed to find within the first few pages that it is uninspiring at best. Most of the pictures are poorly executed and at times seem amateurish. In the past I've found photographs by professionals like Steve McCurry ('Portraits')visually arresting. Not so here.  At least it only cost me $20 oredering from Amazon. If I had been able to preview it beforehand, I would not have thought it worth even the discounted price 
 I actually threw this book out.  I never do that but I'd already wasted my money and I didn't want to waste any more of my time or that of anyone else.    It's so terribly put together--typos galore on every page, Sawyerisms double-spaced as space fillers, no original thinking and simple regurgitation of info readily available.  I've also never felt so compelled to write a review...and this marks my first.    P.S.  I would've given it 0 stars but that unfortunately wasn't a choice 
 The hook up and downloading the software was very simple.  There was a error problem with the drivers.  My computer is fairly new with windows xp.  I called there support and was told to try it on another computer. I install it on my neighbors computer and the same happened. I sent it back to Amazon and credit my account, and bought an other brand.  Amazon is so great about handling returns. 
 This man is another example of our over-affluent society's attempt to distract itself from existential angst via the myth that we should all be happy and feel good. Deepak Chopra has grown very rich catering to the alienation of misguided Marin County yuppies. Sleep is important, as is taking care of our bodies and minds, but do we need a smarmy swami to tell us this? Basic common sense (drink a lot of water...) is sugar-coated in pseudo-spiritual jargon, insulting the intelligence of anyone other than self-help-junkies and cult-bait. Can't sleep? Use the 17 bucks to buy a real book, and read it in bed. Or buy a vibrator 
 I had rather high hopes for this books but it turned out to be a huge disappointment.  It had a lot of promise-- starting with a love affair between Maria Lucas and Colonel Fitzwilliam and the secret past of Lady Catherine's late husband, Sir Lewis.  These plots just fizzled and turned out to be annoying.  I also thought that since Lady Catherine and Mr. Collins were in the book it would have been entertaining, but I was wrong.  Aiken didn't know how to play characters like that.  Mr. Collins had a brief cameo and Lady Catherine wasn't nearly wonderfully awful as Austen would her out to be. I don't suggest this book.  Not at all.  If you have a compulsion to read it,get it from the library and save your money 
 I expect a lot out of anything with a Disney association, and in many ways this does not disappoint. However, I believe it has a fatal flaw that makes it less child-friendly. I love to read with my children, but I view these read-alongs as a good alternative so our young children (3 & 5) can "read" a book on their own. However, none of these stories include cues to let a child know when to turn the page! This leaves them guessing and was a severe disappointment for all of us 
 The Winner and Absolute  truth made me continue reading Baldacci books.His last few books Christmas Train and Split Second were awful.Now Baldacci takes his left leaning anti american feelings and tries to shove it down our throats.That was the last money I ever spend on a Baldacci book,I even threw out his good books. Shut up Baldacci and write fiction books. Your ideas do not get through in this non fiction world 
 I received this book as a gift, and found it unreadable. For example, EFS says cost/benefit analysis "is a procedure by which the higher is reduced to the level of the lower and the priceless is given a price". This is meaningless rhetoric to me. It also assumes that only economics provides a guide to human behavior. Or that all economic analysis is totally rational. Schumacher questioned every assumption of "economic science" using theories from the anarchist tradition. Schumacher claimed neocolonialism is the result of politics, not economic principles. But doesn't class and sectional interests drive politics? His advocacy of a search for inward spiritual space, and a rejection of the real world of politics and economics, makes this book part of the problem and not part of the solution.  The 'Introduction' says Gandhi wanted to use "labor-intensive manufacture and handicrafts" (p.5). Milovan Djilas said it was important for newly liberated countries to use mass production ("The New Class"). The historical record over the past centuries should tell you who was right or wrong. Liberating revolutions result in more production and other benefits for the people; else they're not liberating. Unlimited economic growth overlooks the availability of basic resources and the capacity of the environment. But there's always some natural problem that causes a correction.  This is a very verbose book whose arguments rest on unquestioned assumptions. Since it was published in 1973 Thatcher's regime destroyed Britain's coal industry to make them dependent on imported oil and gas. We've seen what happened after they divided and privatized the railroads. But who benefited from these political decisions?   Part II Chapter 3 notes that western Europe "deliberately destroyed nearly half of their coal industries". But the economy in neocolonialist countries will always suffer to benefit the imperialist ruling country. American was a net petroleum exporter until 1967, and influenced Saudi Arabia and Iran (just like Great Britain did previously). You can also consider the actions of Jimmy Carter against nuclear reactors. France and Japan use nuclear power, they have no oil. Saudi Arabia uses nuclear power so they can profitably sell their oil abroad. Those who criticized this book showed good judgment and wisdom. You can read this book and judge its worth for yourself. 
 Miss Reeve's book is written well enough--at the knee of mentor and Svengali, Noel Tyl.  However, in astrological terms and usage, the information here is next to useless, and something of a joke in the astrological community.  The book attempts to raise a minor aspect into the majors, and it simply won't wash.  It's a puff piece for Tyl in a way, and really, astrological students would be so much better off reading the works of John Frawley and other cutting edge astrologers.  Kudos to Reeves for getting the piece published (by Tyl's publisher) but it's best used as a coaster or doorstop 
 This book didn't work for me, though I like Nutshell books.  I think that alphabetical approach didn't work this time. It might be good for utilities and commands, but for Tasks and Concepts? It's much easier to find what you want on topic basis. And why on earth to use alphabetical approach if most books have good index? I have discovered another book, "Mastering W2K Server" by Mark Minasi. That book is great. I have found there everything I needed. It has a lot of cross-references to NT and even 95/98 without boasting much about it.  Nutshell book arrogantly states that you have to be very good at NT to read it. I think that might be just to cover up the confusion created. True, Minasi's book is 50% more expensive, but it's twice bigger also, and much more useful 
 Heinlein, best known for his science fiction, was over his head in the fantasy genre.  He has many die-hard fans that are loath to criticize any of his stories, but believe me, the fantasy is second rate at best. Try Jack Vances Lyonesse trilogy for high fantasy at its best 
 In my usual perusal of the thrift shops for 25 cent novels, i came across this interesting find summer of 2005.  from the very first page, the book had me hooked. merricat blackwood is a girl i could relate to on first degree. in her family, she's a bit of a misfit, and as  a consequence, finds herself and her older sister constance locked away in their large old house as the town freaks after the *mysterious* death of their entire family at dinner on night.  everyone hates them and wants them gone. merricat braves walking to town to buy groceries for her sister with cash from the vast amount of wealth they keep hidden in the house. the towns people sneer at merricat and ask her to leave and she, head lifted, tries bravely to remain unafraid.  it is an all together marvelous book for anyone who enjoys the cryptic events that go on behind the scenes of creepy old houses.  
 In this world of endless struggle and crisis, you need a book that would get you along in the world of accounting. Unfortunately, this book is a disappointment to the GAAP. Like my good buddies said, the author did not  organize the topics well...this and that mumbo-jumbo. I have to teach it to  my students my own way. Right now we only use the book for the questions.  The questions are so hard too for my students. Everytime the homeworks are  due, people come to me and bug me. People like...well..I don't wanna  mention names here. In conclusion, people of the world unite to overthrow  this book from academic acceptance it currently enjoys and on to the pile  of rubble 
 This book was not funny at all.  I consider myself an open person.  If a mother wants to breastfeed, then she should breastfeed.  If she prefers formula, then use formula.  There can even be a happy medium (I used both).  This book made breastfeeding mothers sound like selfish, nosey, busybodies who have nothing better to do than dish out unwanted advice.  It implied that mothers who chose to use formula were victims.  I found the material and language to be offensive and insulting. 
 Very disappointed.  Purchased 6 of these for an 1100 sq. foot apartment to eliminate the common spider and occasional ants and insects that appear in the Spring and Summer time.  Well, I think these units INVITE the ants in.  We've never had more ants than we do now despite following directions to place these units on opposite walls in the same room, etc.  These devices do not phase them at all - they continue to parade right by 
 Bells Are Ringing had everything going for it. A good lead actress, repmise, plot, screenplay, and well-written lyrics. But the way that these were used where some of the worst ways you'd ever imagine. The 2001 revival recording of this is 100 times better, and Faith prince does so much better then Judy Holliday. This CD has some things that still work, like the screenplay and lyrics, but as a recording, this is just plain dull 
 I have a kitten I can't keep up with and thought this would be a great idea. Wrong, he figured it out and lost interest in the first day. He will play with it for a few minutes but then looks to see where the beam is coming from, figures it out and walks away. A whole 2 minutes of fun 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 why should anyone else???  Her own daughter says it is filled with inacurracies and indeed, the author makes it a point in every page to make himself the ONLY friend Lucy ever had.  As Lucie Arnaz herself said, "skip this one".  
 Life is too short to be spent reading drivel.  Stuart Woods was really off the mark with this book.  You shouldn't rest on your laurels Mr. Woods, your audience deserves better.  I've enjoyed your past books very much, but this one left a lot to be desired.  I was very put off by Stone Barrington's bed-hopping activities in this story.  With Arrington (mother of his son) one night, then with Holly the next, I don't recall him being quite that indescriminate in other books.  The plot was relly silly and contrived, it must have been that the publisher was pressing for a story, never mind quality.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 I started this book because I love the quote about writing being but a different word for conversation.  Yes, there are moments of great wit.  However, they are lost within a mass of verbiage so dense that it makes your mortgage agreement look like a Little Golden Book.  It's not the sublime non-linearity of Joyce's writing or Ornette Coleman's playing.  It's the amplification of the self to an unbearable degree.  Certainly a unique achievement, I guess.  But so is Lou Reed's "Metal Machine Music.&quot 
 ...to see just how bad it is. Unlike it's predecessor Heavy Metal 2k has one single 90 minute story arch talking place in the far future, using both hand drawn animation and very bad CGI, bad even for 2000. The basic plot is that a miner named Tyler (Michael Ironsides) stumbles across a green glowing crystal that is a literal key to the fountain of youth. The only draw back is that the moment he touches it Tyler goes completely bonkers and starts killing a lot of people.  The "Key" draws Tyler to a settlement called Eden, full of people who haves traces of the life giving compound in them, giving them a healthy good looking looks, Tyler probtly kills half of the population and kidnaps the rest, a lone survivor of the raid Julie (Julie Strian) begins a blind quest of revenge.  Everything that could be bad in any given movie is bad in HM2K, the dialog is terrible, both written and performed, the camera work is terrible, there's no back story to speak of, tere are loop holes that even a baby can see, not even a connection to the first firm with the Loc-Nar, which the key is suppose to be a shard from, except that it's green. Also there are not special features on this DVD!!!!!  I don't mind the violence or the nudity, in fact I want to see more of that in western animation, but this movie is just as forgettable as any other movie that Julie Strian stars in.  
 Picked up a copy of this not long ago and it is truly a developer's guidance for code management, as told by the authors.  It is not a book on configuration management whatsoever, as some of the other reviews have indicated.  It does not cover any of the CM discipline doctrine at all.  The fact that the authors have chosen a very rudimentary tool such as CVS should indicate clearly that this is not for the more mature development shops whatsoever.  This tool hasn't an integrated change management, release management, baseline management, etc. built into it as it is strictly a version management tool.  So in a sense the title of the book is very misleading.  If you want to see how to try to improve the management of your code base because your development area is rather out of control this might be a good place to start.  If your looking for more informative books on the SCM/CM doctrine then this is not the book to purchase.  This isn't the book if your on the SW-CMM/CMMI, ISO9001, ITIL, or any other model journey either 
 The young voice is missing on this one. I have some of the same songs on vinyl records. If I had listened to it first, I would not have bought it. It might be OK for someone not familiar with the original recordings 
 I was looking for a book how to deal with teachers that are uneducated about ADD, my son has it and they just want to classify him as mentally retarted. I need more info.       This book is more for the child than a paren 
 Because of its popularity and its subject matter, I was very excited to read Chalmers' The Conscious Mind. I was horribly disappointed.  First, Chalmers' discussion of supervenience and intension in chapter two is horribly convoluted. Of course, Chalmers asterisked some of the more technical parts of this chapter so that the lay reader could skip them, but here's the problem: if you skip these sections, you are no longer able to critique the most crucial parts of Chalmers's argument!   Second, Chalmers engages in bizarre and fallacious reasoning. One of his central arguments runs like this: It is possible to imagine a zombie---that is, a being who is molecule-by-molecule identical to me, but who lacks phenomenal conscious experiences (i.e., qualia). Since imagining this involves no obvious logical contradiction, zombies must be logically possible. Since zombies are logically possible, qualia must not supervene on physical facts--that is, qualia are not logically dependent upon the physical. Since this is true, there can be no possible reductive, materialistic explanation of consciousness.  This argument is preposterous on its face, as many reviewers have noted, and it is only the hocus-pocus about supervenience and intension in chapter two which lends it even a little credibility. For example, let's assume that reductive explanation X can fully explain consciousness in terms of brain functioning. Even if this is true, it is STILL possible for us to imagine zombies right NOW---purely because of our ignorance of X. Since the zombie argument is a central pillar of Chalmers's text, its failure is a failure of the book as a whole.  Third, Chalmers has not done his homework when it comes to the arguments of other philosophers. For example (leaving aside the technical details), I would suggest reading Quine's essay "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" in From a Logical Point of View. Then, read Chalmer's discussion of Quine's arguments in chapter two of this book. Then reread Quine's essay (it's a tough essay). Chalmers utterly fails to refute Quine's arguments, and these arguments are absolutely fatal to Chalmers's entire enterprise--especially his ridiculous zombie argument.  Finally, Chalmers does not address previous attempts to explain qualia (phenomenal conscious experiences) reductively. Daniel Dennett, for example, spends an entire chapter of Consciousness Explained trying to provide just such a reductive explanation. Since Chalmers's whole point is to argue that the existence of qualia specifically makes reductive explanations of consciousness impossible, his failure to spend even two pages on Dennett's explanation is ridiculous. (Briefly, Dennett argues that qualia just are the sum total of all a person's visceral, cognitive, emotional, etc. repsonses to a particular object of perception.)  In its foundations, its approach, and its failure to address important arguments by Quine, Dennnett, and others, this book is an abject failure. Instead, I would strongly suggest purchasing the wonderful and varied essay collection Explaining Consciousness: The Hard Problem.   
 This may be a fine book for parenting/motherhood, but it is not Lao Tzu's tao te ching.  His classic text has broad applications to many areas of life, but the stretch to motherhood is too great 
 I am forever disappointed with the artists Mr. Moore pairs up with. I really wanted to like this book, I'm always thrilled when sex, especially female sex, gets the treatment it deserves as an acceptable, some would say necessary, part of fiction. But I've really had it with the artwork. Time and time again I've suffered through the graphic novels touted as fill with high literary standards but third grade artwork. I sincerely wish Mr. Moore would just write a prose novel as the artwork in this particular collection is so astoundingly bad that I could barely read it.  I believe that good graphic novels are a mutually beneficial pairing between good text AND good art; but what passes for good graphic novels, the ones that college professors feel comfortable regarding as art and literature, tend to be ONLY good text. Where are the standards?  I wish I could say I'm astounded that hardly anyone else has mentioned how bad the art is but it has been my experience that, for some reason, the masses cannot tell good art from bad. Or perhaps people are just so eager to flatter the V for Vendetta writer that they don't care what the art is like just so they appear avant garde and deep.  If you're looking for an interesting story and have no artistic bone in your body, then sure, buy it. But if bad art makes you cringe and weep, then you'd better leave the Lost Girls on the shelf 
 This book, like the Atkins approach in general, has part of the picture, but is certainly incomplete.  Moderation, not virtual elimination, of carbohydrates, when paired with lean protein, plenty of omega 3 (fish and flax oils), and monounsaturated oils (like olive oil), has been shown to be the healthiest diet (a Mediterranian type diet). The Atkins approach does not advocate moderation, instead prefering to vilify an entire necessary macronutrient - carbohydrates!  Certainly the old fashioned 1980's style high carb low fat diets were a disaster, and brought out diabetes in susceptible people - but the answer is balance - good quality, naturally high fiber carbs, paired with protein and healthy fat - not virtual elimination of carbs.  Inadequate carbohydrate intake can lead to fatigue and reluctance to exercise.  Dr. Vernon herself continues to struggle with her weight, despite following the Atkins approach. Most Americans will initially lose weight when starting on Atkins because most eat FAR too many carbs.  But they also eat too much saturated fat (animal and dairy fat, for the most part), which has been show to worsen insulin problems and diabetes, and aggravate cholesterol and artery inflammation, worsening risk of heart disease and stroke.  Atkins addresses one of the these culprits (excess sugar), but not the other (excess saturated fat).  Americans need to cut down on these, and then add more good fats (fish, nuts, olive oil, avacado), lean protein (to cut down on saturated fat), and not be afraid of healthy carbs in the form of whole fruits (not juice), vegetables, and whole grains (not white bread or sugary low fiber cereal).  That, plus watching the calories, and daily exercise (at least 30 " of moderate cardio, five days a week), and diabetes will DRAMATICALLY improve.  Try it and see! Health is not just about weight - its about healthy body fat and muscle ratios, and what is going on inside your body - in your arteries, your brain, etc.  The studies all support healthy balance.   
 I am very unhappy with this panasonic model as well. The battery never gets fully charged even though the indicator says someting different. The phone keeps indicating tobe placed near the base even when it is like a hairline of a distance away. This phone can die on you and I have changed the batteries for both my handsets 2 times in the last 8 months! I would never recommend it 
 Just completed a hiking trip to California, September 2004. I am a weekend hiker from Ohio. I was looking for a guide for the best hikes to take - FOR SIGHTSEEING. I thought that this book would lead me to the most scenic hikes in the Redwood area of Northern California. BIG MISTAKE. The point of my review is this: you CANNOT Trust this book to get you to the Best Hikes.  We did 5 hikes recommended in this Book. Two Costal Hikes, which were nice. THe book was helpful, and the rating Equitable.  We then did 3 hikes in Redwood Country. Two of his recommendations we a total bust, and a waste of TIME.  While the book has impressive reviews from newspapers and other sources, I offer my real world examples. It is my great disappointment in this book that has lead me to warn potential buyers. Not based on how it is written, but on my actual experience, IN THE FIELD, of going out, using the author's reccomendations, and hiking some trails.  1. Redwood Hike - Toumey Grove Trail Hike, rated a 9, at Richardson Grove State Park. What a joke. Nothing special about the hike. The Redwood Grove that you reach is very smallish, and not all that spectacular. Rest of the hike was nothing special either.  2. Redwood Hike - Rathert Grove Hike at Grizzly Creek State Park, rated a 10. Same story as above hike. We did speak with the camp host family, who directed us to the Cheatham Redwood Grove, several miles away, which was truly magical. This is where they filmed Star Wars, "Return of the Jedi." Not a lengthy hike, but this Grove of old Redwoods was truly magical, and the best Grove that we saw, espically after having just wasted TWO HIKES on Tom Stienstra's suggestions.  3. Redwood Hike - Prairie Creek State Park. While book lists one hike here, Fern Canyon, rated a 10, which we did - it was OK, he doesn't even mention the most magical, lengthy hike THERE. We did the James Irvine Trail, which was THE BEST REDWOOD HIKE that we did on our whole trip. We hiked the Irvine Trial to the Clintonia to Miner's Ridge, which brought us back to the Visitor's Center. About 4.6 miles of hiking through old growth, Costal Redwoods. This is another hike we would not have done, without the recommendation of the local camp host family.  4. Coastal Hikes - we did two mentioned in this Book. They were good. We did the Tomales Point Trail, at Point Reyes National Seashore - very nice, and the Bodega Head Loop, also very nice.  We began our trip in San Francisco, heading north, along the coast. We started off with a couple of coastal hikes that were nice. Once we got further north, to Redwood country, the hikes recommended were a complete waste. We had limited time, energy, and the hikes highly rated in this book were a complete disappointment. This became apparent when locals directed us to other, BETTER hikes in the area.  While this book is a decent resource for some basic trail information, you had better look to other books and resources to prepare for hiking in Northern California. When you only have a limited time in this part of California, you simply cannot afford the luxury of wasting time on crappy recommendations for hikes.  Does the book cover the whole state of California? Yes. Some good information? Yes. But after my experience with this book, I would NEVER recommend this book to any hiker, UNLESS it was the second or third source that they were going to use. Otherwise, you too may run the risk of hiking on "so-so trails," while missing some stunning beauty in the same area. That was certainly my experience with this book. What a shame 
 I am furious with this book. It's 300 pages of advertisement you have to pay for.  What it says is this: "Hey, the Quigong exercises by Chunyi Lin will heal the planet, but you'll have to buy our $250 self-study course to learn it." There are two exercises included in this "book", half-assedly explained. The rest is Chunyi's story and page after page of testimonials (yes - TESTIMONIALS! Like the cheesy ones on those webpages where people are desperately trying to sell you things). Ye Gads! Why did I buy it?  Bottom line: If you really want to learn this system, don't waste your money on this book - rather, get the self-study course from learningstrategies.com or attend one of his classes 
 I found myself after reading the book. Sincerely hoping the movie will have a different spin. This is an unsatisfying sequel to the novel Get Shorty. I love Elmore Lenord novels but this is a dud 
 this film was funded by the centeral intelligence agency in the 1950s and was maipulated to suit the need of a capitalistic propoganda machin 
 I think if you've lived life under a rock, watched a lot of soap operas, and enjoyed life playing out in neat formulas, this book will appeal to you.    It makes me angry to read this book; not because it's fiction (and I'll call it completely fictitious garbage), but because James Frey tried to pass it off as nonfiction!  He writes this book with an underlying tone "I'm better than all of you."  Not because he thinks AA is BS, but because this theme runs throughout his book, in so many situations, that after awhile it becomes laughable!  He prances around feeling vindicated for all of his actions and everyone else is just a plain a-hole, except his tough guy "friends."  I ask you, if Leonard has such a reputation... where's his protection?  People would be after him in such a vulnerable (read: no security) place like rehab.     I think if you sat back and read this book you as the reader could discern its BS by feeling its predictability.  It reminds me of a comic book where the tough guy is actually the hero who comes in to save the little people, yeah, he's got problems, but he'll prevail because he's James Frey!  No thank you.  I absolutely hated this book, but I read it so I at least deserve credit for trying. 
 We all know what we need to do.  Some of us know it better than others, but we all have a certain amount of self-knowledge and a certain understanding of our place in the world.  Caroline Myss seems to think a more perfect understanding of yourself would help you be a better person and to better fulfill your purpose in life. But if it was that easy, wouldn't you already be doing what you know you should be doing?  What Caroline Myss writes will not help fulfill your "sacred contract". Self-knowledge is not the same as power, in the same way as a driver's manual is no help if you don't have gasoline in your car. 
 Strengths: Soundtrack by Christopher Franke, performance by Andreas Katsulas in 1st half. Interesting idea of weapons system.  Weaknesses: Plot was mostly stupid. Tragic underutilization of G'Kar as a character in the second half. Unconvincing sense of scale for the Leanndra (Why call for "a healer"? How many healers are on board this tiny ship?). Felt more like a pilot for a new series than a standalone movie 
 Hard to install, ridiculously confounding installation directions, and when you're done, it's flimsy. Don't waste your money 
 The first 50 pages of the book are thrilling, is a murder conspiracy and they made everything to complete their assignment, but when Mary decides to be the ambassador of Romania, the book get boring and boring unless you want to know how an ambassador must behave with everybody everywhere, when the book starts explaining this, you will get lost of the main story that has to many voids, of course as in these kind of books the end is a fairy tale and the epilog is made to keep the story open, sincerely I don't recommend this book, there are many spies books much better than this one. 
 Well, this game... I mean, this movie is about... there are a group of... sorry. Don't waste your time. Nothing to see. Even my boy, after seen the movie, decided to put the game on the shelf, without finishing it 
 I found her style of writing clumsy, tired and long winded. She is not a polished writer.   I guess you can admire her steadfastness to complete her mission to date 80 men despite having found The One earlier on. That's when the plot gets very dry as she seems to go thru the rest of her dating spree in a trance without any joy or open mindedness to discover other people. She seems to write off every men after finding The One with very quick strokes.   The rest of the men were portrayed to look like pathetic fools wanting to date her rather than she being gratified that they were still happy to date her after she made it clear that she had met The One.   It was a disappointment to find out that it was not a cross-cultural, cross-ethnic dating experience. She went after Caucasian men only. So, why the pretense in dating 80 men around the world??? I don't think u need to travel around the world for that. Europe & States would suffice.  I think there are better stories out there on dating than this one 
 Shaw, who more than any of his contemporaries dealt provocatively with the crucial issues of his day, has not worn well.  In a 1971 encyclopaedia I had as a child, the entry on GBS called him the greatest dramatist since  Shakespeare.  That's better than Moliere, Sheridan, Strindberg, Ibsen,  Wilde, Jarry, Chekhov, Brecht, Ionesco, Beckett!  Such a laughable  proposition is untenable today, and we can now see Shaw for what he is - a  superficially amusing farceur, who squandered this modest gift on deadly  social comment, deadly because he reduced issues that effected real people  to theorems, and reduced those people to mere mouthpieces.  There is no  subtext in Shaw - everything is expounded tediously and teeth-grindingly on  the surface.   ARMS AND THE MAN is one of his better efforts, and, after an  uncertain start, settles into some nice old-style farce - hidden  identities, buffoonish heroes, scheming servants, crusty old majors; when,  though, the puppets start lecturing us on war, idealism, class, gender  etc., one's heart sinks, not because what Shaw says isn't true, but because  a letter to the Times would have been a better place to say it.  While  Wilde's plays grow with the years, seeming richer, more meaningful,  brutally satiric, bursting with complex and fluid themes, Shaw's work, in  their steadfast refusal of mystery and ambiguity, seem chilly and remote 
 I wasn't very impressed with this book.  The games for infants suggested are very obvious, common sense ideas, like picking your baby up and flying her in airplane style.  I don't think anyone who has an imagination will  get much new out of this book.  Also, it gives you song lyrics without the  tunes/music, which isn't very helpful.  While there are some good ideas,  they are too few to make this book very worthwhile 
 I had this mug in rotation with two others from different makers. It may have went through the dish washer (top shelf)  three times in about a month and a half. The rubber bottom fell off. The inner cup seperated from the outer liner. I've tried to hot glue it back together with no luck. Definetly not worth the money. Incidently, the two other cups - one was a promotion item from a trade show, the other was a gift from Starbucks that came with a gift card.  I've used the two other mugs, dishwasher and all and they have held up. Incidently. I bought the mug along with a Cuisinart Grind and Brew. now that is a great product 
 maybe i'm just too picky because i'm fond of the quality of recent bbc films.  i did not think much of this movie (pseudo-artsy, in my  opinion..very drab and plotless).  the characters are flat and boring.   honestly, i can't believe i watched the whole movie 
 I agree with others! Season by season BOX SETS of Beavis & Butt-Head are what we fans want! With all music and B&B commentary and no damned edits of anything!  Until then, Mike Judge & company, I will NOT buy anything B&B related, relying instead on my own VHS recorded episodes(limited in number of episodes as they are at least they're the complete original episodes)that I've transfered to DVD.  I want each and every episode uncut and in their original broadcast order.  Who's the brains behind the lame "Mike Judge Collection" series anyway?!? Some dumbass idiot working at Burger World???   Just from a purely greedy standpoint you'd make way more greenbacks by doing it the right way for cryin' out loud! Not to mention retain the show's and your integrity.   Hell, even Beavis and Butt-Head'd think this "Collection" concept'd be lame and stupid!!  Get with the groove Mike & Co. and give us what we want already!! 
      Don't get it wrong -- I like the ideas and spirit of Buddhism. It is a religion, and yet it is not insistent on belief. My own view of it is that what people do is much more important than anything they believe -- but will be shaped by what they believe, at least in part.       One of the things I like about a religion is when it emphasizes doing good. I like it even more when the religion does not call upon people to have faith in something; faith in the good outcome of good works and good attitudes is enough for me.      But I found myself struggling with one clear, inexorable truth: This set of DVD's was not well put together. Normally, a tape or writing of the Dalai Lama is most interesting to hear or read. But this seems to stem from some educational conference where what is being done is one of the most republican of all ventures, preaching to the believers. It is partly marred by the need for translation. That would be very appropriate at an educational seminar. Unless you are in the mood to go back to school again, I would recommend anything else taped or written by or about the Dalai Lama.      Recently, I have done little to suffer more than listen to and stop the world while hearing these two DVD's about the existence and cause and end of suffering. Yes, the intelligence and good spirit of the Dalai Lama is clear in the DVD's, but if the presentation is wrong, even a William Buckley would seem boring. In these days of cheap electronics, for instance, I would recommend hiring a videographer who has access to good lighting and audio control and is able to cut and paste a little.       In the context of these DVD's, Buddhism would almost seem to be as dogmatic about these Four Truths -- all related to suffering and it's cures -- as some others are about the Holy Trinity. As a somewhat non-religious admirer of Buddhism, I am able to stand back and say clearly, buy something else, anything, about, by, or regarding the philosophy or religion.       At the same time, I must state that I would be more nervous and clearly on the receiving end of more knee-jerk criticism for my critique where I disecting the views of some other famous religious figures, whose followers would be so likely to have "faith" that not only would the criticisms fly by deaf ears, but the shouts would be geared to drown out even so slight a criticism as to say that a set of tapes or discs is boring.      Trusting that I will not lose my head over this, it would seem to easy to be critical. To the contrary, it is a hard thing to do, as I am an admirer of most everything that I think the Dalai Lama stands for. I would only pray -- if you will -- that next time there's a seminar like this, they pay more attention to detail in the production.    
 does anyone know the song thats played when Brian is chasing the guys on the dirtbikes near the end of the film? i would really apresiate it. = 
 I understand that the whole idea of this book is to make the reader think for himself about 'quality', which is a very interesting philisophical concept...this is presumably why Pirsig makes time for the reader to think about it by making 90% of the book as boring as possible.  This book falls between reference, fiction and biography and satisfies none of these forms. It's quite amazing how by using the right words Pirsig can make a simple theory seem extremely complicated 
 I bought this book online without seeing it based on the online reviews.  However, I was disappointed with the recipes, most of which did not seem very appealing.  
 This book contains a few interesting and potentially helpful tidbits of  information for the treasure hunter.  However, most of the information  about the "7500 locations" is often little more than can be had  from reading the "Welcome to..." signs found as you drive into  town.  If you expect to have a handy collection of ideas to keep you and  your metal detector busy, then this book will be a disappointment 
 The series started off so well, it's sad to see it end so badly. This book is just a collection of random events, there really isn't a plot. None of the questions raised throughout the series are answered.  The first book was great, I wish I had stopped there. 
 How could anyone who lived such an interesting life write such a boring book? (...)It's like the only point of this memoir is to score points off his contemporaries. And in so doing, further puff up his already inflated ego.  The guy clearly has no self-awareness whatsoever. Like are we supposed to admire him when he claims he is 100% top in bed and cares not a fig for his partner's satisfaction? Very admirable, Mr Vidal. What a prince amongst men!  His "life partner" is referred to in passing approximately three times in the entire book and is otherwise notable by his absence. As are friends in general. Did Vidal have any? No, just famous acquaintances he could pick apart, if this memoirs is anything to go by.  The structure of the book is as self-consciously clever-clever as is the title. A grab bag of memories scattered like cushions over the overstuffed horsehair sofa of the ultimate prissy literary queen. 
 I had a crush on a chick that liked this cd....then i found out how she was....hmmm oh yeah slut! anyway yeah garbage good thing i never considered buying or downloading any of her music....oops she did it again create a garbage. Oh and to add on for my not so well absent minded avril lavigne fan. "which sucks" she bought the cd and got spyware on her computer.....thanks again britney!!!  P.S: Another girls gone wild britney and madonna....lma 
 Only Michael Ironside performance is worth watching. Linda Purl and William Shatner plus the lead nurse should all have been fired for their telentless performances. This movie is a waste of a good premise, less bad mugging performances more gore and suspense would have made for a better slasher movie. Avoid unless you like wasting money, so many better slasher movies than Visiting Hours. Terminal Choice is a far better example of a hospital based slasher, why could'nt Anchor Bay release that instead  
 While thought provoking, Fingarette often misses the nuances of meaning in the text of the _Analects_, which limits the accuracy of his understanding.  Further, Fingarette underestimates the difficulties inherent in dealing with a text which clearly is the work of many hands over a longer period of  time, not a treatise in the western sense.  This book is worth reading, but  must be approached with great skepticism 
 This story starts out pretty successfully. We are shown the life of the brothers in the abbey and their daily routines. This seems to set the tone for a dull plot. Then, the reader experiences the sickness of a brother of the abbey and the mood of the story changes from the placidity of the abbey life to the chaos of trying to help the brother. This livens the book up some, but not enough. Very few exciting events happen between that point until the death of Rhisiart. After Rhsisiart's death, we are thrown back into that state of low-action; only this time, with the added commotion of trying to figure out the murderer's identity. The ending wasn't a huge shocker. It was almost too predictable from the beginning. So, all in all, I would not recommend this book unless you wanted to be easily put to sleep 
 We purchased this for our 2 yr old son for Christmas.  If you create a perfect track (amost never happens) and don't have too many turns, Thomas will follow it most of the time.  This was a complete waste of money.  It really dosn't work as expected.  If I had a chance to try this product out I would never have bought it. 
 "Misery'n" is also available on JANIS 3-CD digitally remastered and without 80s instruments 
 I've read a lot of the books in the series, and Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers, but I have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries.  My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one.  I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up.  
 I know APR is supposed to be one of the better poetry magazines out there, and I think it has one of the highest circulations of any poetry magazine, but it's more of the National Enquirer of poetry magazines. It's a large, newspaper-style format that contains mostly bad poetry and dull articles. You'd be better off subscribing to Poetry, The Hudson Review, The Texas Review, Tar River Poetry, or any number of other journals 
 Competent piano playing, but I had hoped this kind of prissy, superficial playing went out with Rosalyn Tureck and her ilk. Bach shouldn't sound "pretty"! Listen to how she drains all the drama from the gigue of the E-minor suite, then listen to Murray Perahia play it with amazing rhythmic sublety and drama, letting all the voices speak 
 This movie has been terribly hyped-up, for reasons unbeknownst to me, perhaps politically, I presume, in the usual Hollywood fashion.  It has got to be one of the most slow-moving, boring, uninteresting movies I have had the pain of having to waste my time on ~ while attempting to sit through it.  However, the one and only good thing about it is that Ralph Fiennes is in it ~ but that is all.  Don't waste your money and time on this dud, as I'm sorry I did 
 During fourth of july vacation, I had a chsance to see an old college friend, who is a vice president for a large computer hard drive firm... he was showing offf his new Toyota hybrid when we began talking about the market forces, which interfered with large companies responding to the emerging needs and changes in the marketplace.  I was fascinated as he explained to me the difficulty of an older company attempting to incorporate new technologies, while maintaining a profit margin necessary to please investors.  It was during this explanation, He recommended "The Inovator's Dilemma".  All I can say is that his verbal synopsis was far m ore interesting than this dry two-hour lecture on CD. I can only surmize that there must be another book by the same name 
 I paid almost $600 for the 14" version of this TV last year, and liked it fine until the DVD player (lightly used) eject function failed. The 1 year warranty has expired, and Toshiba customer service tells me it will be $350 to remove my DVD and repair the player. Check out Consumer Reports and you will find that Toshiba has a terrible customer service record on their TVs, even when the warranty is in effect. If you must have one, I recommend an extended warranty at the least 
 "Battle" appears to be written as a direct challenge to Victor Davis Hanson and John Keegan, two of the world's best known military and classical historians.  Dr. Lynn's book is well written and well organized, and provides a fascinating overview of his thesis on how cultural discourse affects the waging of war by societies.  He aggressively asserts that there is no "Western" (or other non-Western) Way of War, rather that each culture's interpritation of war and battle shapes its values and how it fights its wars.  His work deserves great consideration, but I will not go so far to say that he necessarily "disproves" the analysis put forward by Hanson or Keegan.  Regrettably, his book would receive more stars were it not for his Epilogue concerning the War on Terrorism.  The Epilogue reads more like a treatise from the editorial pages of the New York Times and less like a sober understanding of the challenges this unique War presents.  His choice of source material for the Epilogue includes Maureen Dowd, Richard Clark and Gen. Anthony Zini.  Dowd cannot be taken seriously, and Clark has been thoroughly discredited.  Zini is in the mold of Gen. Wesley Clark.  By stepping in to this highly politicized debate and adopting the positions of those so firmly on the Left, it undercuts my opinion of his otherwise interesting and informative work.  However, it deserves to be read by those who share Hanson's and Keegan's analysis, as it is a worthy challenge 
 My 3 and 4 year olds just were not really interested in this book.  Wish we'd just checked it out at the library instead 
 Firstly, this is a really quick read. I read the entire book on my lunchbreak. IMHO anytime one can do that there wasn't lots of thought behind the writing and this book holds true to that rule.   I thought the book smacked of a huge ego with a touch of arrogance. Mr. Vincent mentions his most famous line "Go home and get your shinebox" from Goodfellas, at least eight times over the course of a few hundred pages. Do we really need to hear it again and again? I think not.  He also talks down to his audience in such a way that if you are not spending $25 for your Double R Davidoff cigar or dropping $250 on flowers for your date then you are not a "man's man". Not all of us are working actors who earn six figure incomes and can afford such luxuries. Most of us are regular guys making $40-60K per year who are in need of a few tips hear and there.   I know it is a tongue in cheek kinda book but Mr Vincent should come back to reality when it comes to how much you need to spend in order to impress your date. If all it takes is money to impress then most of us are out of luck. And if all she is looking for anyway is a sugar daddy then who really wants to be with her in the first place?   Save your money and wait for the paperback or better yet, get it from the library 
 Naturally, my hair is wavy, with very thin strands but piles and piles of it. My hair is somewhat difficult when it comes to straightening -- usually it looks fine when I leave the house, but comes completely undone after about four hours. So, when my last Conair straightener broke, I went out and invested my money in this one.  Overall, it's okay. It straightened my hair in one stroke, which is rare for me. However, it seemed to just suck all the moisture out of my hair, leaving it extremely dry and dull (which is definitely not good for a vegan such as myself, since my hair is already dry enough!). The movements were clumsy with this, and I occasionally snagged my hair or burned myself due to the plates unexpectedly shifting toward me. It didn't break, and it's still going just as strong as the day I first bought it.  This straightener had problems dealing with smaller amounts of hair, or the fine "baby hairs" around my forehead. And sadly, it couldn't keep my side bangs straight to save its life -- they were as wavy as ever two hours after I'd straightened it. This straightener does the most minimal job -- at least it straightens your hair somewhat -- but save your pennies for a straightener more worthwhile. 
 I had heard alot about this movie when I was a kid. So when I saw it on DVD I though it would be a good time to see it. I was wrong this movie is Bad and Boring. My advice, don't boy this DVD! 
 Dow Jones is still going through its major corrections after the roaring 80s and then the 90s. We are experiencing the same cylical phase that happened in the 70s - when war, energy crises, international market expansions, and demographic changes were gradually driving the economy to a malaise.  The main difference is that the country was in little debt 30 years ago. We are now owing other countries trillions of dollars, and the trade deficit will continue to soar. The economy may sink as a result, but it has nothing to do with bubble bursting. That was already done in the stock market years ago. Should the economy finally collapse, it will have to do with our structural economic problems.   Most probably prefer a soft-landing rather than a hard collapse. It will take some sacrifice and some political leadership to achieve a peaceful and endurable transition. It will be about our committment to paying down the debt, ending our oil dependence, and educating the workforce to take on the jobs of the new century that are not to be "outsourced" to other places.   As this review is being written, the alleged "greater bubble" has yet to be materialized. However, stocks will NOT emerge into a greater bubble unless the American people can become optimistic about the economy again. Dent has been wrong in his past predictions, so please do not take this book too seriously either 
 I can't fathom why this book is beloved.  It's just awful.  Alright, that's a little strong.  The first third-to-half of the book is just awful:  tedious, depressing, tiresome, plotless.  Indeed, Lawrence put a sentence in that, amazingly, perfectly summarizes the first half of the book:    "The days seemed to grind by, with curious painfulness, yet nothing happened."  That really does say it all.  The protagonist plods through her dreary, depressing life, and nothing happens.  At times during this book, I got the feeling that Lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist, because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story.  For a while I had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant I'd never heard of, until I finally just gave up.  Eventually, in the last third or so of the book, it starts getting a little more interesting.  But sadly, while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing, in the end nothing very much comes of any of it.  But we DO get long, windy, insufferably self-righteous political nattering, of a Rousseau-ian nature:  all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed (in reality, life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short).  This is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken-little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in 100 years unless we give up industrialism/capitalism and all.  Well, the book came out in 1928, so he's still got some 20 years to not look like an utter nincompoop.  But I could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good.  It is not.  The biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it.  This stems largely from the fact that Lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people (so much so that I strongly suspect  that he was emotionally crippled himself).  Every character is decidely neurotic, each in their own special flavor.  The closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be Mrs. Bolton.  The central character Connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book, but it sure takes her long enough.  I just could not identify with these people one tiny iota.  Repeatedly I just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes.  To its credit, the book does advocate an unabashed, unashamed joyous love of sex, something with which I am totally on board.  But that's about the only good thing I could find to say 
 It's great that Dr. Weil recommends that we get fresh air, exercise, eat lots of vegetables, avoid fast food hamburgers,  breathe and think positive healing thoughts.  But that's the extent of his good advice.  He also gives some very bad advice that is effectively shredded in 2 new books that have come out.  "The Whole Soy Story" by Kaayla Daniel and "The Fluoride Deception" by Chris Bryson.  Between soy and fluoride you'll have a wiped out thyroid in 8 weeks (+ or -) and that doesn't bring optimum health.      
 It didn't bother me that she did stupid things in her youth; it bothered me that she continued to do them when she was no longer young and, more importantly, after she had a child dependent on her.  She bounced from one quack religion to another her whole life.  One guru told her he "saw" that she would marry another member of his religious group.  (Someone she had never met.)  She totally bought it.  She was planning on giving up her career, uprooting her 13-year-old son and marrying this guy and the only reason she didn't do it was because this member didn't really like her son that much 
 While I found this book helpful in the general sense of the word, it was  aimed solely at the "outside" sales rep who sees his/her customer  face-to-face. It provided good reminders for seasoned sales reps, but  wasn't revolutionary in it's ideas of selling. It was a short read - no  more than 4-5 hours. It demonstrated very good closing tactics and  objection handling, but all of this is after you make contact. It didn't  explain how to get past the secretary screen, how to get the appointment or  even how to find out who the decision maker is. Most of the sale, if not  all of it, is done over the phone and that was completely overlooked 
 I read this book about 20 years ago in high school and hated it. I just tried to read it again for a book club discussion. I thought that 20 years of life experience and growth may have changed my attitude toward this classic. It didn't. I made it half way through and decided to quit wasting my time. The characters are self-serving, and I just didn't care about them. The stream of consciousness style of writing is not my thing. 
 Being a long-time Nancy Drew collector, I really looked forward to reading this book, but I found it to be very disappointing. I've read a lot of the 'tart-noir' wacky-gal mystery series, and this book seems to have all the standards - sexy, ditzy gal who just can't seem to get it all together, hunky boyfriend, obsession with glamorous flashy clothes, the need to keep secrets from the police, and on and on. But Cece Caruso just doesn't come off with any realism to me. She's too over-the-top, and she's not even a good detective. By her own admission, over and over throughout the book, she keeps missing the point, and the clues, and everything else that would lead her to understand what's going on and solving the mystery.  Cece is a biographer of mystery writers and in this book she is writing a book about Carolyn Keene, the author of the Nancy Drew books who was and still is a group of ghostwriters. There is a lot of Nancy Drew collecting info in this story that was, for the most, taken from some speculative fan-made guides, honored by some collectors as The Truth but frowned upon as hypothetical by the rest of the bibliographic world. It also seems the author made up some of her own. Her depiction of Nancy Drew collectors at their annual convention in Palm Springs is really unflattering. Believe me, they are not the strange, nerdy, boring people she makes them out to be. For some reason she found it necessary to compare their boring get-together with a wild swinging convention of golf-fan lesbians at the same hotel.  It's disappointing that the first major piece of fiction published about Nancy Drew collecting and Nancy Drew collectors is such a mediocre book that plods along for the most going this way and that in directions that lead nowhere or that Cece just doesn't 'get'. Her obsessions with vintage clothes, gourmet foods, alcoholic beverages, art, and on-again-off-again boyfriend are all pretty interesting, but she and her gang need more characterization, and need to be a little less fabulous-in-every-way to be believable.  Nancy Drew fans who read this book will probably be disappointed. It's less about Nancy and more about Cece and friends and how 'hot' and 'cool' and too-fabulous-to-be-true they are. Let's hope the next author who takes on the Nancy Drew mystique will give it a more interesting treatment 
 I find it hard to believe that the author has even visited Cuba, let alone lived there. Not being an American, I have legally spent quite a bit of time in Havana myself - and not as a tourist, either - and there are so many glaring inconsistencies between this book and the realities it describes, I would have sworn it was written by someone who was only going on third-party descriptions and their own wild imagination.  Jineterismo is indeed a gaping wound in Cuban society, but it certainly doesn't work the way this book describes it - quite far from it. There is a lot of uncommon ground between Cuban-style jineterismo and generic western-type prostitution, and this author's take is remarkably closer to the second one. To give an example: no Cuban jinetera would be "sitting by herself" anywhere, let alone at a "cafe near the Habana Libre Hotel," and with a "stack of papers" in front of her no less. That picture is straight out of the US, and anyone doing said things in Cuba would never, ever be mistaken for anything other than a foreigner, not even by the naivest American tourist. More importantly, the jineteras sell romance more than they sell sex, which is amongst the most alluring things about them. One may pay them, but one is always left with the impression that they're being generous and "helping out" someone with whom they had a good time, not contemptuously paying a professional for services rendered as described in the book.  The book may be enjoyable as a read - I don't know, as personally I was unable to finish it for being so annoyed with the false picture it paints. My own impression is that it is naive and rather sophomoric. If you do choose to read it, please keep in mind it is pure fiction. If a literary glimpse into modern-day Cuba (shocking underworld included) is what you're after, there are far better books out there by Cuban authors, and even an excellent relevant collection of short stories and book excerpts 
 Hardly being a serious look into the (supposed) simulated world, Simulacra and Simulation unnecessarily confuses, compounds, and over-estimates the reality of simulation, and implies simulation in virtually everything while failing to give any real evidence or examples for this phenomenon. Through and through, Baudrillard fails to adequately define his terms, concerns, and sources for his critiques. While never settling on one particular point, his arbitrary method of critiquing never moves beyond the realm of opinion. Critical analysis of the subject matter (whatever that is) is never applied, instead being sacrificed for ever more obscured superficial observations. Baudrillard gives us no example as to the cause of his concerns (whatever those may be) let alone giving us any real solutions as to how we may pierce through our alleged self created illusions. Nor does he give us any real insight as to how these critiques can be applied in any useful way to our education or our daily life. If this is what is passing for philosophy today, I can only imagine how useless the field will become in fifty years if we continue to look to Baudrillard as the top of his field. Superfluous and meaningless double-talk is all you will get out of this useless excuse for a book. For anyone interested in reading "Simulacra and Simulation", I would sooner recommend Dr. Seuss "Green Eggs and Ham." You will have more fun reading it, and you will probably learn more as well 
 There is one aspect of this book about which I DO have firsthand knowledge - and that concerns my first cousin  Jim Channon, about whom Mr. Ronson writes at great length.  I know Jim Channon to be a highly imaginative and creative visionary artist who sincerely seeks to influence the human populations of this planet to cooperate rather than annihilate one another in acts of senseless warfare.  I know from firsthand discussions with my cousin Jim that his First Earth Battalion concept is an attempt to unify the military establishments of this world in an altruistic common cause - to substitute worldwide cooperation in preserving this planet in place of the centuries of bloody conflict which has historically been centered around violently competing religious ideologies.    An earlier complimentary book reviewer of "...Goats" - Constance E. Cumbey - has penned her own scathingly biased hit piece (Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow) which decries the "New Age" movement and claims that its proponents' desire for worldwide cooperation rather than religiously motivated warfare would somehow lead to "barbarism".  (What???)  I suppose she believes that the centuries of bloody warfare which HAVE been fomented by the differing beliefs of the three worldwide religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), - each of which claim to be the ONLY correct way of following the dictates of their version of the "God" of Abraham, - would be preferable to worldwide cooperation?!  No surprise there.  All religious fundamentalists apparently believe that ANYONE who disagrees with their chosen form of worship is going to "hell", anyhow... so why not just kill them all and send them there posthaste, right???  Heaven forbid that modern secular idealists would rather seek a means of worldwide understanding and mutual cooperation instead of conventional military industrial warfare! My god!  Haliburton would go bankrupt!!! 8-P  Mr. Ronson mischaracterizes my cousin Jim Channon as an incredibly wealthy and seemingly insane man who owns a mountaintop in Hawaii and behaves like a warlord in his neighborhood. Rubbish!  This is not only ridiculous - it is libelous.  Jim owns three acres at the top of the hill in a rural Hawaiian community, on which he has constructed a beautiful outdoor garden amphitheater (where his daughter was married), a guest house, a yurt, and an open-air and open-beam rustic residence in which he runs no air conditioning and communes with nature to the extent that he kills no creature that chooses to inhabit it with him.  There are geckos clinging to the walls.  There are occasional spiders in the corners.  There is a kitty cat.  When his sister, my cousin Elizabeth Channon Jones, asked him why he didn't even choose to kill the spiders, Jim replied, "They're creatures too!". Does THIS sound like a man who would recommend or condone the practice of attempting to kill animals or human beings with mental or psychic energy?  A 'flowerchild', perhaps... a true 'nature boy', perhaps... but a nutcase who thinks he's a warlord? NO. I'm afraid that with this "Staring at Goats" book Mr. Ronson qualifies as a Spin-Meister and practitioner of hyperbole for purposes of profit.    Jim Channon trusted this man, opened his home, and shared some of his most personal and heartrending experiences in Vietnam.  In return for his trust he was smeared in this sensationalistic little exercise in spin.  The First Earth Battalion is Jim Channon's imaginative, futuristic, and creative concept for a worldwide cooperative military force whose mission would be to preserve this planet for posterity and to replace conventional warfare with visionary tactics of mind-expansion and compassion.  The non-lethal tactics he proposed, based upon new age psychic research and experimentation prevalent in the 1970's - `80's, was never intended to be utilized for purposes of torture.  It was intended to be mind-altering and mood-altering in the hope of dissuading prospective combatants from killing one another.  Idealistic?  Certainly.  But this man (who won't even kill a spider in his own home) never EVER intended his suggestions to be used for purposes of killing innocent animals... or for torturing prisoners.    Subliminal suggestions have been proven to be successful.  Sound does affect one's equilibrium and state of well being. But ask Senator John McCain if he believes that being forced to listen to the "Barney the Dinosaur" song: "I love you, you love me, we're a happy family..." constitutes anything remotely approaching "torture".  Give me a break!!!  This does a gross injustice to the likes of Senator John McCain and anyone else who has genuinely experienced TORTURE.  McCain's bones were broken... his joints were dislocated... his face shows the scars.  If listening to "Barney The Dinosaur" singing for several days in a row induces some potentially suicidal/homicidal religious zealot to spill the beans, I'm GLAD.    So based upon my personal knowledge concerning Lieutenant Colonel (ret) Jim Channon and his imaginative First Earth Battalion THINK PEACE (pun intended), I take this entire "Staring at Goats" book with a large lump of rock salt.  I sincerely hope that we DO see the day when my cousin's visionary concept of dedicating the world's manpower to preserving this Earth (instead of wiping each other off the face of it) comes to fruition.   
 This book is very helpfull for my job (my english is not good, I hope you can understend me 
 I expected to love the book.  I love horse racing.  I ride horses.  I'm not troubled by slow, dense, books.  So I'm very disappointed to find that this book did not engage me, and I have to throw in the towel and put it back in the stack.  I've read quite a few horse books including Horse People: Scenes from the Riding Life, but Michael Korda, and some by Rita Mae Brown - the Virginia Fox hunting series, and of course, Seabiscuit.  This is a character driven, rather than a plot driven book.  Nevertheless, I didn't find that I enjoyed any of the characters, particularly Al and Rosalind - whose marriage did not float my boat.  As I forced my way deeper and deeper into it, I found myself saying - I don't Care about these People!  The setting didn't grab me.  I didn't feel the 'feel' of the racetrack, the feel of the saddle under my seat, the smell of leather, the rumble of distant hoofbeats.  Even the environment of the working class/hired people didn't provide a compelling 'atmosphere' for the story.  I did like that the horses and animals were given page time.  The animals were more enjoyable than the people.  I'm sure its just me.  Maybe if I wait a year then I'll pick up the book in the right mood to have it take hold of me.  But for now, I can't read it, and I'm passing my thoughts along in case there is any body else out there like me 
 I can not believe that Nora Robert cheapens herself by writing such drivel. This is the first and last J.D. Robb book I will chance reading. I only read it half way through. It was so unclear, seemingly written with the pretense of intelligence. I thought the constant empty dialogues were wasted breath. I have read seven books by Nora Roberts and I will have to wonder if she has a twin sister living insider her mind who must be writing the J.D. Robb stories. She seems to me to be wandering from realism in her Roberts books to total abstract in her Robb books. I think in her Robb stories she must be letting her hair down with all of the unnecessary swearing and attitude the female characters have. There is a lot of rage there. I will take Nora Roberts over Robb any day. Sorry Robb fans, I just think it is all to shallow to waste my time going there again. Just like paintings from abstract to real, different strokes for different folks 
 I am so sorry that I bought this book.  It is unfortunate that you do not have a Penguin or Everyman's Library edition.  First of all the book is too large to read in bed.  Secondly, whoever did the proofreading should be fired.  There are so many typographical errors that it really upsets and disturbs the reading.  If the postage were not so expensive from Israel, I would return the book to Amazon 
 George Page is a journalist, not a researcher. Unfortunately, that does not save him from taking the posture of one who knows better. He dismisses whole fields of discourse with offhand remarks, for example: "Eventually behaviorism melded with the equally notorious sociobiology as formulated by E. O. Wilson." (p. 29) For an accessible yet scholarly exploration of animal cognition, I recommend Marc Hauser's "Wild Minds." Hauser is a scientist, who specializes in primate cognition. His writing is more lucid, and less affected. He addresses the same questions as Page, with an appreciation for subtle variaritions in the possible interpretations of evidence, which is lacking in Page's presentation. One comparison between the books: Page's bibliography is 3 pages long; Hauser's spans 30 
 The Moviegoer is a book about a 30 year, disaffected businessman.  He's successful and liked, from a rich New Orleans family, but bored with life. He doesn't know what he wants, and doesn't know what to do about it.  This description, however, sounds like Binx Bolling, the main character, is actually doing something to figure out what's wrong.  Unfortunately, the book just follows him around through his life over the course of a week and describes his boredom and dissatisfaction with the things around him.  While interesting from a theoretical, philosophical, existential point of view, it makes for boring reading.  In addition, the book, released in 1960 feels badly dated, about a time and place that no longer exists, so while I have experienced my own bouts of existential angst, Binx's problems are not mine and the book is not written in a way to help sympathize with his plight. This is in stark contrast to Kafka, for example, whose stories of frustration and nothingness from 19th century Prague can bring me to tears.    While the novel is set in New Orleans, there is little description to make the unique setting visible other than the names of a few streets. Similarly, Binx remains a faceless everyman, and the women he dates so interchangeable that Binx himself can barely keep them distinct.  The title, too, is misleading.  "The Moviegoer" made me expect a story about a person who lived his life through characters in the movies.  While Binx does attend movies regularly and describes people in terms of long forgotten actors, I have to assume the title refers to Binx's problem of watching life around him without participating the same way as we watch a movie.    Like the existential play "Waiting for Godot" this story is mostly about the lack of a story, and though things happen, there is little sense of suspense or caring to carry the narrative forward.   If you're looking for an existential novel, I'd strongly recommend Kafka's The Castle or The Trial instead.  And if you're looking for an enjoyable novel that truly distills the distinctiveness of New Orleans with a truly memorable set of characters, A Confederacy of Dunces (John Kennedy Toole) (which Walker Percy was instrumental in having published after the suicide of the author) is among the best novels of our times.  But The Moviegoer is a hard slog for little payoff.  
 This was hardly a diet book, rather it is an infomercial posing as literature.  Every other sentence seems to be about the virtues not of the diet but of a specific product.  Macademia Nut Oil, and not just any generic macadamia nut oil but instead only one specific brand.  Not too surprisingly other reviewers have indicated that the good doctor apparently is the owner of the company.  I can't believe the positive reviews here, they had to be posted by someone in the author's employment.  This book was such an insult to anyone with intelligence.  Another reviewer refered to the author as a SNAKE OIL salesman and I highly agree.  Please save your time and money and don't buy this book 
 There is no information in this book that I haven't read or been told before.  This morning I tried to make one of the recipes from the book, the "Wholesome Whole-Grain Muffins" and they were a disaster.  Behan instructs that this recipe makes 18 muffins, but I used 18 muffin cups and the batter overflowed and made my kitchen smell terrible (not great when a pregnant woman is feeling nauseous anyway) and they are burnt on the edges and not quite cooked in the middles.  This is coming from someone who loves to bake and has a little experience behind making muffins.  The batter was very watery and the small taste I took (what I could stand after smelling burnt batter all morning) was very, very sweet.  I would not recommend purchasing this book 
 Ritter flip-flopped his WMD position after finding a place on Al Jazeera's payroll.  Al Jazeera is openly sympathetic to Islamofascists, who aim to kill us.  Ritter's arrest was not his first pedophilia-related entanglement, and it's a bit too "black helicopter" to think that local law enforcement sleazebag round-ups are really plots to silence political enemies 
 You know you're in trouble when the "meet cute" scene is rude and obnoxious.  As other reviewers have noted, this is a drama with funny moments, not a comedy with dramatic moments.  In drama, the world is allowed to fall apart, in comedy, you expect a happy ending.  Everything about this movie is ambiguous and edgy.  You don't know if you are supposed to like him (Vince Vaughn) or her (Jennifer Aniston), the set pieces are cruel, the redemptive moments inadequate...the movie fails because the characters aren't lovable on their own or together.  This was a movie that needed another re-write, either to tone down the farcical elements or to play up the happy and gentle moments.  While both actors could do both comedy and drama (and Vaughn does convey some surprising real character development), they can't bridge both in this movie.  The tone is off -- it's too heavy for their personas.  I would recommend this for folks considering a break-up who want to have a second opinion.  I would not recommend it for folks who are in the middle of a fight.  It will add fuel to the fire 
 This board is attractive, but has never been accurate. I've had others use it, and they think the same.  I do not recommend it 
 In some areas of this book there is misinformation on some of the types of alternative therapies.  This book is very slanted against any kind of alternative therapy.  By the standards raised in this book even modern medicine is against the Bible.

 Don't waste your time!  If you want to read a boring, poorly researched book of statistics at least four years old, then I suggest you buy it.  But the statistics are even out of date.  If you have lived on this planet for a few years, you already know about the examples he uses.  Pathetic writing.  If for some reason the examples are new to you don't trust them.  He says Ralph Nader advocated for a safer Chevrolet Corvette.  If the author doesn't know it was a Chevrolet Corvair, then he is clueless!  Read Greater Good by Claire Gaudiani if you want to learn something 
 I used this text a few years ago when I was writing a paper on ethics of pesticide use, and it certainly details information well. However, the general tone is often anal and the writing style is extremely drab. Most of  the diagrams included were generated using low-budget graphics software,  and  it shows.  At 811 pages, this is an overly long book and not all the  chapters (24 total) can be covered in a single Echem course. Also, there is  no solutions manual and the problems Manahan gives are challening (a  section of numerical solutions placed in the back of the text would have  been nice...)  This is a good reference text, but  if you're looking for a  semester-long or short-term text to use for an Echem course, use Baird's  text, not Manahan's 
 This book is based off of a complete misconception of the truth, it has no founding nor fact in our Fathers word and just goes to show how far people using their own imagination can go.  If you like fiction read this book. But remember its just that fiction.  If you would like truth, read and understand our Fathers word.   To get you on your way. Take any King James version of the Bible and read Mark 13. You will see the two tribulations that Christ defines there. Notice verse 14 defines the fake Christ and verse 24 defines the return of the true Christ. Also note how Christ defines the deception of the fake Christ in verse 19.  Also read 2Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 2-4 , you will see Satan must be worshipped as if he were Christ, right there in Our Fathers temple, before the True Christ returns.  Read revelation chapter 12 verses 7-9, you will see Satan is kicked out of heaven to Earth where he will war with the saints. Note he was kick out with his angles, he's not going to let some man be part of his show. No united nations chief will play the role of the fake christ...thats just complete stupidity.  Read Daniel chapter 7, Revelation chapter 7, Revelation chapter 13, and Revelation 17, You will find the truth in these verses about Satans beast (one world) system that he will use to deceive 99.8% of mankind with.  Heck ... Revelation 12:3 tells you he did it to us before. Further Revelation 13:11 tells us he will look just like Christ (the lamb of God) but he speaks like satan (the dragon).   Revelation 13:13-14 tells us he does great miracles and can make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men, and he uses this power to deceive most of the people...Now I don't know about you but I have never seen anyone leading the united nations that has this type of supernatural power...Have you?    Don't be deceived its Christs #1 warning in Mark 13. The very first warning he gives "Take heed lest any MAN deceive you"  So don't be deceived by this book...its not the word of our Father...its just fiction from the minds of men, not truth from the word of God 
 First of all, this manga is NO GOOD, IT'S AWFULL!!! Before I read the book, I thought this book was going to follow the story from the game. Instead, it is rushed, the battle scenes are not detailed, and the plot is no good (Since it seems a lot of the story is missing). Although the art is good, it is MUCH better to play the game than reading this book. 
 I Purchased the Winter Solstice Vol #3 thinking that it would be as good as the rest,was I disappointed. Tracks 5,6,7,10,11.13 are atrocious,the rest of the tracks are good.I cant get to my CD player fast enough to skip over them when they start playing.I now sample every song on the CDs and dont take for granted that all Winter Solstices are created equal.People,please start giving honest reviews and stop the false advertisement 
 This book so wants to demonstrate that music was a crucial component of human evolution, as if the author, Steven Mithen, wants to explain why he felt the subconscious need to spend so much money on CDs by Queensryche, but he ultimately fails to prove causality. There is nothing inherent in music creation that helped the human species survive the ravages of hunger, disease, pestilence, and war. There was no "battle of the bands" being waged on the prehistoric Serengeti plain to demonstrate defiance of environmental pressures to adapt. Much of this book is pure conjecture, and Mithen again demonstrates that scientists are the worst group of people to explain music to anyone 
  (Written for Worm's Sci Fi Haven by countezero, more of his reviews can be read here: www.wormsscifi.com/haven)   To readers of a particular mindset, specifically those who are outwardly contemptuous of authorities like government and law enforcement, Philip K. Dick's Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said (1974), will probably go down the gullet like manna. For readers less inclined to view their political and personal freedom as conditions that hinge on the whims of small-minded men in high castles, the novel may not be so sweet.   Dick, for those who are unfamiliar with him, wrote 36 novels and five short story collections-one of which, The Man in the High Castle, won the Hugo award in 1962. He died in 1982 of heart failure just months before the release of Ridley Scott's Bladerunner, which is based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?. Thanks to his timely death-and Scott's bold theatrical vision of his work-Dick suddenly became a "poor man's Pynchon," who, "may be recognized as the greatest American novelist of the second half of the 20th century." Not bad praise for an author whose novels never made him much money and were mostly out-of-print until Harrison Ford doggedly pursued an outlawed band of replicants through rain-soaked Los Angeles streets on the silver screen.   What I've written above is the accepted biography, the one published on the cover of his novels. It is factual, but it is also too polite. The whole truth and nothing but the truth, something which Dick professed simultaneously to worship, wonder and write about, is slightly stranger.   Would it surprise the readers of this review to learn Dick believed he had been contacted by pink laser beams from something called VALIS, or the Vast Active Living Intelligence System, which he described as one node of an alien artificial satellite network originating from the star Fomalhaut in the Pisces constellation? Further digging reveals:   "Dick claimed that he began to live a double life, one as himself and one as Thomas, a Christian persecuted by Romans in the 1st century C.E. Despite his current and past drug use, Dick accepted these visions as reality, believing that he had been contacted by a god-entity of some kind, which he referred to as Zebra, God, and most often VALIS. He saw Rome as the pinnacle of materialism, which, after forcing the Gnostics underground 1900 years earlier, had kept the population of the Earth as slaves to worldly possessions. Dick believed that VALIS had contacted him and unnamed others to induce the "impeachment" of Richard M. Nixon, whom Dick believed to be the current Emperor incarnate."   Biography can either add illumination to a reader's comprehension of an author's works, or it can muddle it. I've chosen to mention some of Dick's lesser known eccentricities because I believe it is almost impossible to understand Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said without knowing something about the questionable beliefs and obvious passions that drove the man behind the rhetorical curtain to pull the particular plot levers he did.   Beyond the paranoid details Dick sprinkles throughout the opening pages of the novel-America is a police state in which everyone must carry I.D. cards, college campuses have been closed off by the military and blacks have been sterilized to cut down on the crime rate-there isn't too much to gawk and gape at for the reader. A television celebrity named Jason Taverner, who is the idol at the center of "the big worshipping world of viewers," receives an interesting comeuppance from one of the attractive celebrity wannabes he's been spending some nocturnal hours with. Because Taverner has failed to land said Lady a record contract, as he promised, she shoots him in the chest with a Callisto cuddle sponge, some sort of life form which apparently has 50 feeding tubes that like to burrow into a person's chest. When he wakes up, alone in a dilapidated room, he discovers no one has the foggiest idea who he is. Even, his fellow celebrity lover, though Taverner possesses her private phone number and can describe a number of intimate details about her. But what's worse, remember folks he's living in a police state, is that there is no official documentation to prove anyone named Jason Taverner ever existed.   No celebrity, no status, no identity. "I don't exist," Taverner mentally moans. Existence being one of Dick's favorite topics, it's hard to read this line and not smirk. Taverner does exist, of course. He thinks, therefore he is. What's bothering him, beyond playing cat-and-mouse with the police, who know all about the forged papers he is forced to acquire, is that nobody recognizes him as Jason Taverner, celebrity extraordinaire-at one point, Taverner even discovers a selection of his records, but when he plays them they are blank.   Had the novel stayed with the idea of identity it might have worked. After all, what is identity? Are we are all self-contained solipsists, whose identities are totally the result of our own internal thoughts? Or are we shaped by our deeds and what other people think of them? Is a celebrity a celebrity simply because of the attention given to them, or do they possess some unquantifiable glimmer of brilliance? Certainly the people Taverner meets in the novel keep noticing special things about his post-celebrity-self, despite the fact they've never laid eyes on him before. He shines, he sparkles, he's handsome and he has a way with words and carries himself in a manner that defies ordinariness, even though for all intents and purposes he is no different than them. He's special, without having earned such an adjective.   But unfortunately, Dick abandons this promising narrative in favor of another. Enter Police General Felix Buckman, one of the police state's higher-ups who has a drug-addled, insane sister who ends up being the critical cog in the entire ebb and flow of events. As it turns out, Alys has been experimenting with a substance called KR-3, which bends time and space temporarily to create an alternate reality interlaced or superimposed over the actual one.   "Anyone affected by it is forced to perceive irreal universes, whether they want to or not...Taverner (who was affected with the drug) passed over into a universe in which he didn't exist. And we (the people he came into contact with) passed over with him because we're objects of his perception," Buckman's aides explain.   Perception? Now there's an interesting theme. Too bad Dick fumbles it when he is trying to wrap up his novel with the above explanation. And if those fine words don't quite wrap things up for you, it's probably because any reader who comes to the end of the novel needs to know something about the beliefs of Dick's which I mentioned earlier.   In an essay entitled "How to Build a Universe that Doesn't Fall Apart Two Days Later", Dick writes, "The two basic topics which fascinate me are `What is reality' and `What constitutes the authentic human being?'" To this, add and consider the following three statements.   1. "If reality differs from person to person, can we speak of reality singular, or shouldn't we really be talking about plural realities?"   2. "Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away."   3. "I like to build universes which do fall apart. I like to see them come unglued, and I like to see how the characters in the novels cope with this problem."   Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said presents a perfect synthesis of these statements. For Taverner and Buckman, the universe as they know it is certainly unglued. There is no one single reality in the novel, there are at least two. But both realities are "real" because both of them continue to exist when the characters who exist within them wish they would go away.   So what then are we to make of the ending, when a singular reality is ultimately restored? I was certainly baffled by it, until I read the essay I quoted from above and came across Dick's bizarre claim that the novel is inspired by the Book of Acts, from the Bible:   "A careful study of (Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said) shows that for reasons which I cannot even begin to explain I had managed to retell several of the basic incidents from a particular book of the Bible, and even had the right names. . . My theory is this: In some important sense, time is not real. Despite all the change we see, a specific permanent landscape underlies the world of change: and that this invisible underlying landscape is that of the Bible; it, specifically, is the period immediately following the death and resurrection of Christ; it is, in other words, the time period of the Book of Acts."   We are all, in other words, "fake humans" living in "fake realities"-with, presumably, Richard Nixon at the helm. Occasionally, we are given glimpses of the truth, or revelations, but most of our lives are spent dwelling inside a contemporary dream. Brush it aside as we will find Tiberius ruling over Rome, the apostles spreading the word. Exactly who or what has thrown the proverbial wool over our collective eyes, or to what end, I have not been able to learn in my brief bit of research for this article. Perhaps Dick, who seems better informed than any of us, wasn't privy to that information himself.   What does all this say about the plot of the novel, about Taverner's experience inside an alternate reality, which ultimate wasn't actual reality but an imagined one? To be honest, I'm not sure. The epiphany in the novel-and the scene from which the title is pulled, belongs to Felix Buckman, not Taverner. Exactly what revelation the scene conveys, beyond eliciting sympathy from the reader for a character who up until that point has been entirely despicable, I don't know. Felix cries. His sister, who he also happened to be carrying on an incestuous relationship, has died. This is sad, sort of, but to what end? Looking back at the essay one last time, I see Dick hints at what he wants his audience to understand, but see if you can follow his logic:   "(Buckman) is Christ himself returned, to pass judgment. And this is what he does in my novel: He passes judgment on the man sealed up in the darkness. (On whom? Taverner?) It was judged and condemned. Felix Buckman could weep at the sadness of it, but he knew that the verdict could not be disputed. And so he rode on, without turning or looking back, hearing only the shriek of fear and defeat: the cry of evil destroyed."   Only Taverner didn't kill Alys, Taverner is not convicted of killing Alys-what's more he didn't even know her in the novel's actual reality. He only met her in the novel's other reality. Is Dick saying we're guilty for the crimes we commit in both the realities he believes in? Are we judged in one world for what we do in another? I live those questions for my readers to answer. What I will say is that Dick's method has ultimately failed to convince me. His metaphor is strained and does not work. He misses, or very rarely chooses to focus on what is, or what might have been the core of an excellent novel. Instead, an ultimately empty "dream within a dream" scenario, something the professors who taught me creative writing in college told me to avoid is explored. Never end a story with "...and then I woke up," or its equivalent I was told in a stern voice by several different PhD's. With Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said, Dick does just that-and it's his zealotry for and his personal beliefs about the faulty nature of reality that have led him to such a disaster of flawed intent.    Two out of fiv 
 Is this a joke? Yea, all us feminists would create a terror group to chase you men down. I really appreciate how this 'cartoonist' depicted feminists (you know:the vote, equal rights, maternity/paternity leave, sexual harrassment/domestic abuse laws, reproductive rights, careers-all us evil women) would become crazy killers. 
 This CD is disappointingly one-dimensional.  Every song is presented at about 1/2 (or less) the tempo at which these songs are normally sung.  While it can be interesting to sing a song at an unexpected tempo on occasion, Ms. Sutton's decision to give nearly every song on this album exactly the same treatment results in mind-numbing monotony.  As much as I love her beautiful voice, I find this CD almost impossible to listen to all the way through.  I'm glad this was not the first Tierney Sutton CD I heard, or I would be convinced that she is incapable of any range or creativity 
 From a male/air sign perspective, let's just save some time and cut to the recurring themes:  Male = Air sign/Fire sign = selfish = Bad Female = Water sign/Earth sign = caring = Good (Except too much = weak)  Thinking = Bad Feelings = Good  Mixing the terms Venusian and Martian when talking about the zodiac and male/female is confusing though.  Venus rules both Libra (masculine) and Taurus (feminine) 
 Although this book has excellent pictures in black and white and gives some good information, many of the storylines in the descriptions of the movie ARE NOT TRUE. For example, I quote, "In response to the hypothetical question of what one should do upon finding someone's wallet, Edward suggests giving money to friends. LATER ON, Edward is caught by the police taking part in a break-in..." Anyone who has seen this movie knows that Edward breaks into Jim's house BEFORE Mr. Boggs gives him the pep talk on right and wrong. Even the movies are presented in the wrong order. They present Batman Returns before Batman. Many other mistakes are made. If you are a huge fan of Tim Burton like I am, I suggest reading Tim Burton(Virgin Film) by Jim Smith and J Clive Matthews. That one gives much more and quite better im formation  on the best director (in my opinion) EVER!! 
 Although this book is compact it is too heavy to carry if one is on a walking tour.  I can read a newspaper without glasses, but with glasses I had trouble with the type.  It is not in an orderly format nor is there is a good section on hotels 
 If there's one thing I learned from studying literature, it's that ethics are comprised by social context; and the context in a novel is largely CONTRIVED by its author. In an age of postmodern criticism then, it is  shocking to find this sort of flat, naive, victorian interpretation. Moral  realism. Yikes 
 The phrase "more efficient sourcing" means that Lands End is now buying these in China. The pants arrived with a strange smell (fishy odor), the fit was odd, and, after one washing, the fabric looked bad. They went back ASAP!  I bought khakis from Lands End for over a dozen years until this recent product change. Notice the past tense. Ownership by K-Mart Holdings is definitely making an impact on the company 
 I bought three DVDs(The Wood was one of them)and the DVDs were in European codes which means they won't play in the United States unless you own a "special" DVD player.  I'm very unhappy with my purchase.  My recommendation to you is that you read every single piece of information before you purchase movies that were formatted for another country.  This is the catch when you buy movies at cheaper prices

 As Walter Laqueur observed in The Atlantic in his March 2002 review of this Gilles Kepel book, his " obituary of Islamism was written before September 11."   What seemed truly astounding when I read this book four years ago was the extent of Kepel's knowledge--and his fundamental ignorance. I hadn't realized, as I read, that the original French edition of this book came out in 2000. Still, it is extraordinary to think a scholar as widely read as Kepel could be so wrong, as he is here, as to pronounce radical Islam and jihad on the wane.   As the intervening years have proved, nothing could have been further from the truth, and of all people, Kepel should have known it. But it was not Kepel's lack of knowledge concerning the origins of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt of the 1920s, or the writings of Hassan al-Banna and his heir, Sayyed Qutb (whom Nasser hanged in 1966) that lead to the author's blindness.   It was most likely Kepel's lack of understanding of the fundamentals of Islam itself. Like so many writers before and after, Kepel blamed the rise of radical Islam on the backwardness of Middle Eastern society, and the lack of political power of the rising middle class.   As Laqueur noted in The Atlantic, Kepel laid the attractiveness of Qutb's radical "message and in particular his appeal to violence" to broad swaths of Egyptian society to several mostly economic and intellectual factors. Qutb resonated for "students who could not find jobs; the religiously observant lower middle class, distrustful of modernity; and, generally speaking, all those disaffected by the state of affairs in the Muslim world who had become intellectually homeless after the failure of Arab nationalist ideology and of Marxism."  Actually, however, both Qutb's philosophy and its attractiveness to Egyptians and other middle eastern Muslims were powered by the same force--the fact that Qutb based his thinking and writings on the classical jurisprudence of Islamic scholars across the centuries. And in this respect, Qutb was no different than many of the other radicals that Kepel covers, including the violent Iranian religious revolutionary, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and Pakistan's Mawlana Mawdudi, among others.   To understand the rootedness of these "radicals" in Islamic religious precepts and Islamic history, Kepel ought to read Dr. Andrew Bostom's Legacy of Jihad.  Certainly, Kepel is right about some factors that encouraged Islamic radicals to pursue their goals at the specific times that they did: In the 1980s and early 1990s, Khomeinist fanatics terrorized Iran unchallenged, Islamists seized power in Sudan and their cohorts had attempted coups in Algeria and Egypt as well. But more importantly, ragtag Afghan Islamist armies eventually defeated the Soviet Union there, and built a very successful propaganda campaign (though undoubtedly not entirely truthful) as a result.  But Kepel did not understand how Islamists saw their defeat and alienation from the Algerian majority, Egypt's mass arrests of terrorists or Sudan's surrender of Carlos the Jackal to the French, for criminal trial. To radicals, these were merely temporary setbacks, not the heralds of permanent defeat. Nor were the radicals at all discouraged by the rise of Iran's so-called moderate, Mohammad Khatami (who was never really moderate) or the protests of Saudi women for the right to drive cars independently.   Worse, Kepel did not understand that many Islamic scholars--whom he and many foolhardy others  presume to be "reformist" thinkers--are themselves reputedly central figures in the Muslim Brotherhood, and in any case, fundamentalists in their own right.   Take Tariq Ramadan, the grandson of MB founder Hassan al-Banna, whose visa application the U.S. State Department has twice, rightfully, rejected. Kepel accepts him as the "reformer" he pretends to be. But this is utter nonsense.  As J.C. Brissard recently noted on the Terror Finance Blog, ample evidence suggests Ramadan has links to terror. A 1999 Spanish police General Directorate memo, for example, stated that Ahmed Brahim--who last April received a 10 year sentence for incitement to terrorism--maintained "regular contacts with important figures of radical Islam such as Tariq Ramadan."  Likewise, Djamel Beghal--sentenced to 10 years in March 2005 for participating in a foiled attack on the US Embassy in Paris--in September 2001 aligned his religious "engagement" to the 1994 time when "he was in charge of writing the statements of Tariq Ramadan." Beghal later said he had also "attended the courses given by Tarek Ramadan." And "brothers Hani and Tariq Ramadan," according to a 2001 Swiss intelligence memo, together planned a 1991 Geneva meeting between Al Qaeda leader Ayman Al Zawahiri and Omar Abdel Rahman, mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center attack. This was confirmed by the member of a Geneva mosque, who heard Hani Ramadan announce the upcoming meeting.  While Kepel conducted extensive and sometimes useful research, his conclusions are unreal.  --Alyssa A. Lappe 
 The Sennheiser PMX70 had excellent sound quality and volume compared with others I'd used recently. I had high hopes on first listen. However, these semi-in ear headphones were moderately uncomfortable after only about 20 minutes. I later took them on a 40 minute run. The design is such that in any position I adjusted them, the speakers tilted slightly upward in my ear. Once I started perspiring, my sweat poured right into the little speakers. I had to stop every few minutes to shake the collected sweat out of the earpieces. The right speaker was filled with sweat and non-functional pretty much the entire run. Who designed these? Consider these headphones only if you 1) never plan to exercise while using them and 2) will be keeping them on for 20 minutes or less 
 4 of "their songs" are covers of S Club 8 & S Club 7 songs, suprising that SC7 & SC8 are all from the same company!! 
 I bought this book after hearing Randy Cohen on NPR. In extremely small doses, he is sometimes amusing as he addresses topics that made me think. However in book form his "style" translates into simply being annoying. The author may think he is being funny in how he tries to insert his own political views (whether it has anything to do with the topic at hand or not), but I don't. Save your money and just listen to him on NPR 
 Robert G. Allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer.  If you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like I did, he will send you several junk emails a day.  Unsubscribing doesn't work, and trying to block the sender's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time.  The funny part is that the emails aren't even coded properly.  They always show up as just a bunch of html code.  Would you really take internet money-making advice from a guy who can't even code html properly?  Anyway, his spamming practices are completely illegal and it's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him.  But that shouldn't come as any surprise considering that mister Allen has been in trouble with the law before.  He's had several run-ins with the IRS, lawsuits against him, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I would also stay away from his Nothing Down real estate methods.  Many of those practices are illegal, and the president of the Nothing Down club in Atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it.  For more info on Allen, visit johntreed dottcomm, click on Real Estate Investing, then click Real Estate Guru Ratings.  Bottom line, don't trust this guy and don't buy his books. And if you're reading this Mr. Allen, take me off your @%#&*$ mailing list!! 
 not very good not worth getting it is not good pokefan is wrong and im right not the same as original boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo bo 
 Although well-researched, this book is really little more than a book of quotations lifted from several primary sources. The result is rather monotonous and fails to provide the detail and context that makes those primary sources so informative. A much better idea is to simply read the memoirs written by the men who were actually there (and there are plenty of them). They provide much greater insight into the life of a German Landser than this second-hand account 
 The series started off so well, it's sad to see it end so badly. This book is just a collection of random events, there really isn't a plot. None of the questions raised throughout the series are answered.  The first book was great, I wish I had stopped there. 
 If you are interested in information about real estate training programs or how to get a job in real estate this is the book for you.  75 pages of at 225 page book are dedicated to listing of different real estate  programs, most of which are located at community colleges. The rest of the  book is dedicated to finding your first job in real estate.  I did not find  this book very helpful.  I found "Your Successful Real Estate  Career" by Kenneth Edwards to be much more useful 
 While this book may be helpful to children who are seen as "special" or "crippled," I would never recommend it, because of the title,  which is bad as "The Nig**er Lamb" would be. Get it?  I'm an advocate for people with disabilities, the preferred term, and can assure you that a book called "crippled" and terms like "special" will have the opposite of the intended result and could cause  children to be perceived even more as "special" instead of different but equal 
 Roger Ebert is a great movie reviewer and he is the most famous film critics in The United States, but this book will be an unnecessary waste of money.  To find all these reviews, a film lover just has to go to Ebert's website on the Internet.  There, the reader will find all these reviews and many more!   
 I am not going to comment on the compilation, it is OK. The sound quality however is terrible. The supposedly rerecorded bass on the older tracks is quite weak, most of the recordings sound horrible, with a lot of distortions, elevated highs, clipping, suppressed midrange and muddy bass; "Paranoid" sounds like it was recorded with a microphone hidden in somebody's purse. I have quite a few CDs with hard-rock and metal recorded in the 70s, and they all sound better. This CD is a pain to listen to 
 sure, on the cover of the cd they look very "pretty" but when it comes to singing it is horrible. The instruments they used were messed up. my very favorite piece in pirates of penzance is "I am the very model of a modern major general" and somehow they managed to mess that up too. the people who sing this are either out of tune or they are singing too slowly. If you want to hear real and good pirates of penzance than i suggest getting the older version (the one with a drawing on it).when it comes to an opera (especially gilbert and sullivan operas) looks can not be everything . Being able to sing is a must 
 There are no really good songs on this cd.  i am not writing an indepth review of each song because all are just self indulgences for Kate Bush.  This is an ode to her ego.  The only true great cd which I bought 3 copies were 'The Hounds of Love'.  Nearly every song was great.  And the video of 'cloudbursting' from the cd was wonderful with an apperance by Donald Sutherland as her father.  Her next album , I beleive 'Ruberband Girl' had one good song written for an 80's movie 'She's having a Baby' called 'This Woman's work' as the only great song and a few were decent.    But her new CD is frankly bad.  But since I loved 'Hounds of Love' so much, I still have hope for Kate and gave her two stars.  Just don't stay away fromm the studio so long.  It's like everything else, practice and perfect your kraft or lose the talent 
 I read parts of this "book" until my intelligence was thoroughly insulted and I immediately returned it to the library. What a stultifying simpleton this man is. He is someone who wants to appear to have all the answers without having any foundation of intelligent ideas. And unsurprisngly, this dolt absolutely embarrassed himself during a recent appearance on the "David Letterman Show" and what made matters worse was just how oblivious he was to his infinite stupidity. First, he claimed that no one should criticize President Bush "because we're at war and it's no good for the country." Come again? I say that such a statement is "no good" for democracy, which is something this submental gasbag has forgotten about. The right to openly disagree with an alderman or a president is guaranteed by the First Amendment. And this man is a graduate of the John F. Kennedy School of Government? Also, he insisted that Cindy Sheehan, whose son was killed in Iraq, not have the right to be publicly upset with President Bush and the invasion of Iraq because "she's connected with left-wing elements in this country." What left-wing elements? I feel that Cindy Sheehan is as connected to left-wing elements as much as Bill O'Reilly is associated with logical reasoning. 
 This movie is so bad! Julia Ormond is so beautiful it's like  sweet agony to watch her slink around in fabulous clothes, at least in the first few scenes. But then the plot begins to fall apart, and really, there is nothing going on.   The story starts out fairly logical, a little boy fell off a roof -- was he pushed? But soon stunning Smilla is babbling about meteorites and worms from outer space and corporate bad guys who all look like Richard Harris, old and ugly and with one foot in the grave. You will laugh and laugh if you wait through the end to see what they really want you to believe happened to the little boy. (SPOILER AHEAD) Uh, gee, Richard Harris, 80 years old and drunk, chasing a six year old boy up six flights of stairs? How about no, Richard lurches out of his limo falls face down in the gutter and dies on the spot?   What makes it even more laughable is the stupid reasons given for the great Meteor Hunt, which is a laughable premise to begin with. In actual, scientific fact, there is no reason a meteorite might not contain precious metals like platinum or gold. This has been known to occur. But no, THIS meteorite is filled with killer worms that eat people's brains! And so of course the Sinister Corporation must move heaven and earth to get the worms, and use them to . . . to . . . uh, they don't quite explain!   The plot makes no sense, but Smilla looks lovely in her cute little couture outfits. You'd never know she was a rebel, the way she's such a fashion junkie. And what's the deal with the way she's always tormenting her father's luscious young trophy wife? I wanted Smilla and Benja to stop arguing and have some steamy lesbian sex, with 90 year old Richard Harris watching through the window and his breath fogging up the glass!   When the movie is set in Denmark, early on, it's okay. But the plot gets less and less believable as Smilla, the stunning beauty, stows away on a tramp steamer bound for Greenland. The crew doesn't notice they have a lovely stowaway, and when they do see her lurking about they sort of shrug it off.   Gee, sailors must have changed a lot! 
 My first Grisham novel, and it reminded me of why I seldom read fiction.  The plot has numerous barely-believable twists, the most ridiculous of which is the protagonist's attorney assisting him in eluding authorities after escaping a juvenile detention facility.  Said lawyer then drives from Memphis to New Orleans with the little delinquent in her car basically at the kid's mere suggestion.  Absurd!  No attorney in his/her right mind would do such a thing!  The "storybook ending"just prior to the boarding of the FBI Director's private jet is implausible as well as gratuitously sappy.  Also, I highly doubt that the FBI Director gets personally involved in many -- if any -- such cases.  Thankfully, I paid only 25 cents for this book in paperback form at a garage sale 2 weeks ago.  Given that it's written at about a 4th-grade reading level (and I have no children), it'll make good fireplace kindling next fall.  First Grisham = LAST Grisham 
 Actually, this book wasn't what i expected, you'll get bored from all that reading.  Also, iaido is not a straightforward art, i don't see that emphasized.  Every situation has a different bunkai, it's really a mental building system. And that's why i like books like e.g. Aikido: Harmony of Nature by Saotome Sensei.  Also i'm quit sure there are some mistakes in that book regarding the naming of some kata's 
 Having read both the Doomsday Book and To Say Nothing of the Dog, I thought that nothing written by Connie Willis could go wrong.  Unfortunatly, this book shows that perfection is not a constant.  I don't  know how this got through (maybe the publishers were eager for another  Connie Willis book to sell), but this book for me was uninspiring,  pointless, and confusing.  Although the interaction of the characters were  humorous at certain time, for the most part, I was left wondering if  anything was really happening.  Another problem I had (and maybe i'm just  too dense) was the fact that none of the characters were introduced.  I was  halfway though the book before I realized that Fin was female.  Unless if  there was a prequel that explained it all, anyone could be left wondering  if a name belonged to a person, place, or a thing. All in all, this book is  a disspointment from someone who has won Hugos and Nebulas for her works,  but then nobody should expect perfection all the time and should be  grateful for the other books Ms Willis has written. : 
 Tina Modotti had a fascinating life and she is a great role model for women because of her independence and strength. I think this book does not really make her come alive and concentrated too much on her lovers. I had  read a lot of the details on Tina's life in other books on her and I didn't  like the way the author uses facile, pop psychology to explain a very  complex woman 
 The topic is too abstract for my level. SQ is hard to measure. People with a strong religious background might find this book more informative. I prefer concrete theories 
 I was looking forward to a some good new recipes and have to admit that I was disappointed with this book.  First of all when I opened the box I saw that this book was a really small paperback book that was poorly made.  I was further disappointed when I read the recipes and saw that one of the recipes for the "Best" dips calls for canned bean dip.  The book doesn't cost that much but it's still not worth it in my opinion 
 In the beginning, I thought this was the best novel that Sue Grafton had ever written.  There was a great plot, numerous twist and turns and just enjoyable reading.  Then the end of the book came and what a disappointment.  It was confusing and left you feeling that you had just wasted your time reading the book 
 just to make the plot work.  Not very realistic.  If you want a realist cop character, try Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch. 
 This book is inexplicably influential, probably due to its catchy but ultimately meaningless title. Barber fails to convincingly analyze an interesting thesis, instead delivering an exasperating 300 page-long list of every single thing on Earth that he disagrees with. Barber contends that natural human political behavior results in smaller and smaller ethnic enclaves trying to separate themselves from the larger world, while unchecked global capitalism is erasing ethnic flavor with bowdlerized mass-culture sameness. Interestingly, Barber contends that these two contrary movements are actually in an unholy alliance, using each other's excesses as excuses for their anti-democratic behavior. That is a fascinating thesis, which makes the weaknesses of this book all the more infuriating.   The first part of the book is an interminable tirade of lists within lists, of cultural trends that Barber disdains, in an avalanche of complaints that is not analytical but merely selective and arbitrary. It's all tied together with attempts at "edgy" pop culture references, made-up terminology (like the annoying "infotainment telesector"), and pseudo-intellectual quotations and namedropping. All is lumped together unconvincingly under the anemic term "McWorld," which is so vague and all-inclusive as to become meaningless. In his never-ending examples of how recent cultural trends are damaging the freedom and intelligence of the masses, Barber merely comes across as a condescending snob who thinks his own interests are superior, or a curmudgeon who thinks everything was better back in the good old days, or both. In the second part of the book, Barber proceeds to throw obtuse political science theories at various world hotspots, in which tribalism and separatism are damaging the integrity of nation-states. His umbrella term for this phenomenon is the dangerously loaded term "Jihad." Note that this book was published back in 1995, so that word was not as prevalent in Western discourse as it is now, but Barber still uses the term as a loose descriptor which is likely to offend both devout Muslims and ardent anti-Islamists.  When it comes to the specifics, many reviews here and elsewhere list out the numerous flaws in Barber's arguments, and there are so many of them that a lot of reviews are necessary for the task. You can agree or disagree with various critiques of Barber's contentions based on your own personal politics. But everyone will probably conclude that in this book's final section he does not deliver on the ironic implications of his initially intriguing thesis (embodied in the book's title), and simply forwards borrowed theories on civil society and the public sector. Overall, this book is mostly the longwinded grumblings of a nostalgic know-it-all who portentously predicts doom for every single cultural and political reality of the modern world. [~doomsdayer520~ 
 I always make it a habit to read a book and pass it on, never expecting it to be returned.  My book is in the pocket of a plane in Paris, hopefully waiting to be thrown out.  I read, and read, and read, with my expectations never being met.  The book was shallow, unbelievable, and way too long.  She could have given her message in the first 100 pages, because there was no message.  I think that she needs to write journals in the areas that this doctor is familiar.  She should stay out of our "fiction" world. 
 SAVE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!!! One of the worst books, i have ever read. I will never ever buy another omar poopre book ever again. 
 Two of the short stories in this book, "Running out of Dog" and "Gone down to Corpus" are not new stories.  Running out of Dog is a spelendid example of what we expect from Mr. L. writing about ironies and tragedies of average people.  But, it should have been noted that 40% of this book is not original.    The others are average reads, over before we have any understganding of the characters Mr. Lehane writes so well about.  None of the others are full of tension, irony, comedy, tragedy, and suspense we've all come to expect. They are mediocre stores meant to sell on the author's excellent reputation.  We waited a long time for another Lehane.  This book certainly does not showcase his talents 
 We've had this timer for a couple years now, maybe a little longer. It's really cute. It does ring really loud. But lately it's taken to STOPPING before it should, i.e., it just STOPS! No ring! Nothing! We've known our food is done when we've smelled things burning! And it never WAS very good at timing things for less than 10 minutes...it often did the same thing, that is, just stop, without ringing. But it was SO CUTE! We kept it and dealt with it. But not anymore. Nope! I'm on-line today looking for a different style chicken timer 
 This is not a book and I have no idea what a "sourcing fee" is.  Save your money and don't buy this item 
 This turned out to be a cheap piece of crap. It didn't even work right out of the box.   I wanted a small AM radio and unfortunately this was about the only one available.  I would have gladly paid a little more to get a quality product, but none was available in the small size I needed 
 My real rating is 1.5 stars. The book won't put you to sleep, but it's not going to teach you anything you won't have known glancing through newspaper articles for a few years. Readers will learn nothing about golf if they have any acquaintence with the sport: though the closest I've ever gotten to golf in my 47 years is frequently passing by a club shop in my neighborhood, I learned almost nothing about the sport from this book save uninteresting gossip about golfers who are now no longer prominent. Feinstein makes no attempt at analysis and no attempt to fit any of what he writes into any context: what the reader gets here is a sketch of an insular world with no acknoledgment of that insularity. Hence, for any but the big golf fan who wishes cereal-box writing to pass time, the book will be useless. Bad points: besides that mentioned, the prose is (as mentioned in my title) in large measure cliches and reads, as other reviewers have pointed out, like a newspaper article knocked out under deadline and length pressure. For newspaper articles, such is no great handicap, but for a book is makes for tediousness. Next is a quibble, perhaps, but in the trade paperback edition I picked up the four photos on the cover are far better than the bubblegum snaps in the interior of the book. The book photos do nothing to enhance the content and waste paper. If you're looking for extremely light reading that will tax you none (as I was when I selected this book to read in a period of extreme exhaustion), "A good walk spoiled" will suffice. If you're looking for a good book, look elsewhere 
 i expected more from a book called the "definitive edition." the book contains a small amount of useful information regarding useful ghost hunting techniques but the majority of information in the book is essentially useless. i would advise serious ghost hunters to not purchase this book 
 Other reviewers have pointed out the errors Eric Alterman makes in this book, like saying that the U.S. was under the Kyoto Protocol.  That was particularly annoying.  He needs to stop writing his books on the back of cocktail napkins 
 I've watched Mark Bittman on PBS and really liked his style.  I have some cooking skills, but would like to be better and thought this book would be a good start.  I was wrong.  I tried a couple of recipes and they all failed.  The eggplant saute and the boiled shrimp were waaay off in their instructions and were inedible. This is not a good book.  I would recommend Cooks Illustrated magazine and At Blanchard's Table.  These have been great resources for me to help me improve my cooking skills and understand why certain things are done certain ways.  Plus there's always the Alton Brown show Good Eats on the FoodNetwork 
 I liked the music on this record as the music from the film is very pituresque it just seemed that it perhaps went to try and get too close to the prospect of been sranded on this desrted island like when theres the section with the waves on this disc you just wish it would shut up really and get back to the music, theres nothing wrong with waves just cut it down a little. They could really do with making the music longer on these discs taken from films as this genre of music in general is long and this is a good reflection on a long record but it's cut short, why?. Another thing is that if you want to buy the music from the castaway film alone you cant do that as you get back to the future and everything in this, this record just seemed to condescend and was a real let dow 
 I'm not familiar enough with the series to know for sure, but these stories sound a lot like summaries of BTB episodes to me.  The writing is bland, and feels like one must trudge to the end of each story.  I guess this book is innocuous enough, but lacks the imaginative language that would make a child want to read it for himself/herself.  Can we endure it?  Yes, we can.  But, hey!  Isn't that a Dr. Seuss book next to it on the shelf!  Let's read that one instead tonight.. 
 Reading through reviews of this text, I notice two main criticisms and will address them separately.  The first is that the book has some sort of liberal bias.  As far as I am concered, no bias of this sort is present.  I hold my textbooks to the same standard that I hold news outlets, and I found The American Pageant to be just as objective as the BBC or The Washington Post.  Dr. Bailey looks at both sides of controversial issues, does not, despite the beliefs of other reviewers, pan President Reagan, and has plenty of criticism of the left.  Why, then, the low rating?  This has to do with issue number two, namely Dr. Bailey's writing style.  It is, in a word, irritating.  He feels the need to bring ridiculously flowery language and bizarre metaphors into every situation.  I counted at least six comparisons of national banks, Wall Street moguls and railroad barons to octopuses.  Teddy Roosevelt had, according to Dr. Bailey, "mule-like molars" which he "bared at liberals and reactionaries alike".  It's extraordinarily difficult to cut through the (pardon my French here) merde and figure out what on earth is going on.  I'm not looking for a dry history book, really I'm not.  I believe American history can be interesting without bordering on the insane.  Dr. Bailey crosses the line from making his readers think that he may be insane to actually making his readers go insane.    I've not read any other US History textbook, so as far as I know this may be the best one.  I certainly hope not, for all of our sakes 
 Turn of the century continues to serve a most useful purpose, months after I gave up on it. I have a door that rattles if it's not wedged open and T-o-C is just big enough and heavy enough to do the job on its own. I struggled, oh how I struggled to try and even begin to understand some of the characters. I stirred the pages wildly while I waited for the plot to thicken. I fought against closing eyelids while the book became heavier and heavier. I searched my abridged guide to good grammar to see if I had missed a couple of chapters explaining that sentences after all don't need a subject, a verb and an object - or even a permutation of two out of three. I left it on the front doorstep hoping somebody would steal it. I offered it to my  neighbor so he could jack up his car. I considered lighting the fire with it. I wondered whether, if I took just a few pages a day, I could eat it and get rid of the evidence. I offered it to my mother-in-law for Christmas. I took it scuba diving with me instead of a weight belt. And then, eventually, voila! The rattling door! What a fine tome T-o-C is. Another few hundred pages [...] and I could have used it as a sea anchor for the Titanic 
 I thouth this book would tell me how espionage works--the real kind, not the 007 kind.  How could a book about a class at the CIA NOT tell me about CIA's inner workings?  Unfortunately (and perhaps for security reasons) there was little detail.  It did share a bit about how covers are protected, how officers avoid surveillance, and a few other things, but always in overly general terms.  Unfortunately for the reader, Mr. Waters is annoyingly patriotic, which got WAY too sappy at times.  The book also spent too much time on his personal life.  Okay, so being in the CIA is hard on your personal life--so what?  There was NOTHING interesting about this guy's life outside of his work; his s attempts at "personalizing" the story amounted to little more than filler, and pretty dull filler at that.  
 The text seems like it was dictated into a word-processor, shuffled a little and printed with no editing and no research. Portions of text are repeated exactly in different sections of the book.  The tables and diagrams are reprinted from random product literature and have no relation to the text.  The entire content relevant to home heating installation and maintenance  could be compressed into a pamphlet.  Perhaps the team responsible for this book learned from the same school as those who prepared Saddam's perplexing weapons reports.  This is the worst textbook I have ever seen, and a waste of time.  
 Although Anne made some excellent points, it was still one-sided. She still speaks of Republicans in general as being better which is wrong because many of them are just as hypocritical as Democrats (and some are worse because they know what God commands but don't actually care), and although she gives some explanations as to why Republicans are the better party, they are deceptive and wrong.  For example that Republicans are better because they promote Chrisitianity and are specific in their arguments: yes, that is true in some ways, however many promote false Christianity and make it look bad because many of them are not truly Christians but putting up a show. That needs to be said otherwise people get the impression often that all Christians are hypocrites and that it's all about financial gain or vain glory. And merely having a specific argument doesn't make an argument better. For example I can say, "Democrats are out to get your kids and the poor because they want to raise taxes on the poor and give tax cuts to the rich and want to force children to learn white wash" but so called Republicans like George Bush want to do that too and have done that.  I would like to say that this is a good book to give to a young girl, because it shows you can still be fememine, wise, and a Christian, and yet not be a fool or knowledgeable and emotionally immature (in other words a nerd), but it has too many big errors.  It's helpful howewver for everyone in general who wants to know what is wrong with some type of arguing and how to argue constructively. Although she doesn't give a thorough explanation on that subject, it's very good and concise. And I just happened to be comforted by her words because the day before had been attacked with vagueries by a pastor from an AOG church 
 I had this book in my college algebra class, and non of the students liked it.  It didn't explain things well enough to enable you to do the chapter problems.  The teacher explain everything in class using her own notes and only used the book for us to practice the math problems.  If anyone missed a day of class, they were in trouble because they missed the teachers notes, which was the only way to understand the problems in the book.  I hope the school stops using this book. I'm sure there are other better college algebra books out there 
 I am a 7th grade student and we use this book for health class.  Most of my friends and I think that the lessons don't make sense.  We did the  chapter on emotional health this week.  I had to ask my mom who is a  counselor to explain the lesson and even she had difficulty understanding  what they were trying to say.  This is a very confusing book.  We were  going to buy the book so we could work on the lessons at home but it costs  too much 
 Without a doubt the season had some pivotal moments. But too few and far between and without a clear story arc for Sydney. The return of Ms. Lena Olin gave it a shot in the arm, but too little too late. Dull villains and dispensing with the cliffhangers were major mistakes that effectively rendered the show toothless. A relentless snorefest considering the brilliance of previous seasons 
 First of all, consider the question that Lewis is trying to ask. What went wrong with the 'Middle East' and their 'failure' to modernize? And now think about how big this book is, about 150 pages. The 'Middle East' is a huge area extending from Morocco to Iran and he attempts to explain their 'failure' to modernize by reviewing the last years of the Ottoman Empire. That is just plain lazy work on the part of a historian who is supposed to be revered in his field.   Another issue is that he constantly refers to the 'Middle East' as 'Islam' as though Islam is homogenous or even centered in the Ottoman Empire. Granted the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire was also the Caliph but the Twelver Shi'is don't consider him to be legitimate anyway. To consider Islam to have some kind of collective thought process when encountering the 'West' is reprehensible. Consider now the fact that the majority of Muslims don't even live in the Middle East or the Ottoman Empire. How can Lewis truthfully use the term 'Islam' in his book to refer to the entity that 'went wrong' when the area he's speaking about doesn't even constitute the majority of Muslims in the world!?   This book is a quick read for people who aren't in the field to think that they're informed about what is going on in the scary area known as the 'Middle East'. The worst part is that the only people who would know that this is full of holes and lacking greatly in background and professionalism are the people who wouldn't normally read it anyway. This is a dangerous book because the name Bernard Lewis is synonymous with Expert in Middle East affairs. This was a lazy, half hearted attempt to cash in on people's ignorance and only perpetuates the wrong ideas in people's minds. Bad Lewis, very very bad. Any 'liberal historian' who suggests this book should be beaten with this book, unfortunately for us the book is very thin so it will take a while to bring him down with it.  If you want better sources, look to John Esposito, Albert Hourani and Nikki Keddie. All of them have published widely and lack the obvious political biases of Bernard Lewis. Check them out. 
 I will not lash out against anyone, and I will not use specific names of individuals or organizations that replace the search for truth with a situationist relativism based on vainglorious, ostentatious egotism. That said, let me merely point out that the absence of necessary historiographical context makes Jesus of Nathareth's solutions extremely difficult to accept. First off, it doesn't do us much good to become angry and wave our arms and shout about the evils of Jesus's morals in general terms. If we want other people to agree with us and join forces with us, then we must provide a trenchant analysis of Jesus's codices. The key point here is that Jesus's older analects were deluded enough. His latest ones are undoubtedly beyond the pale. Jesus's peuplade appears to be growing in number. I indisputably pray that this is analogous to the flare-up of a candle just before extinction yet I keep reminding myself that Jesus has found a way to avoid compliance with government regulations, circumvent any further litigation, and violate his pledge not to condemn innocent people to death -- all by trumping up a phony emergency. His desire to control your bank account, your employment, your personal safety, and your mind is the chief sign that he's a slaphappy caitiff. (The second sign is that Jesus feels obliged to force me to undergo "treatment" to cure my "problem".)   Perhaps I'm reading too much into Jesus's ravings, but they don't seem to serve any purpose other than to destroy the natural beauty of our parks and forests. Jesus's précis are Pyrrhonism cloaked in the rhetoric of truculent, noxious feudalism. That's pretty transparent. What's not so transparent is the answer to the following question: Does Jesus's oversized ego demand that he condone illegal activities? A clue might be that every time he tries, Jesus gets increasingly successful in his attempts to have a serious destabilizing effect on our institutions. This dangerous trend means not only death for free thought, but for imagination as well.   Jesus's eccentricity is surpassed only by his vanity. And his vanity is surpassed only by his empty theorizing. (Remember his theory that the cure for evil is more evil?) Jesus of Nathareth has an agenda -- a political, social, and cultural agenda. And that's all I have to say.  
 I like what Phil Rogers said about CETACEAN. But to me, CETACEAN doesn't sound surfadelic so much as cheezadelic. As a matter of fact, it's arguably the apotheosis of mod-a-go-go cheezpop. SUSAN doesn't impress me. I don't hear what nicjaytee hears in it.  CJ & The Fish also did a few tracks for a soundtrack called ZACARIAH. And ZACARIAH isn't included at amazon. So allow me to say something about it here. Ya know all of those song lyrics wherein the singer brags about the modesty of his needs? Well, let it be known that Barry Melton wrote a parody of that obnoxious mentality in a tune called ALL I NEED: "All I need to have a good time is a reefer, a woman, and a bottle of wine. With those 3 things I don't need no sunshine. A reefer, a woman, and a bottle of wine. All I want is to never grow old. I want to wash in a bathtub of gold. I want 97 kilos already rolled. I want to wash in a bathtub of gold. I wanna light my cigars with 10-dollars bills. I'd like to have a cattle ranch in Beverly Hills. I'd like a bottle of red-eye that's always filled. I'd like to have a cattle ranch in Beverly Hills. 
 This book was served a good point, but the plot was what really hurt it. The plot developed slowly and the climax was not much really maximum intinsity or enjoyment. The end was to slow and depressing. The group in the book call themselves the "Good People", but it seems when the interfear things just get worse 
 I read the works of folks like Vince Flynn, Lee Child, and, I thought, Nelson DeMille, for the escape--the action--intrigue. Someting to make the plane flight go faster.  I don't read for thinly-veiled, current-events, quasi-political commentary.  (There are recognized exports available for that sort of thing.  For example, a tour-of-duty in Vietnam gives neither me, nor Nelson, "expert" status on the conduct of warfare.)  DeMille, as he matures as a person and a writer, has taken to slipping his "agenda" into his storytelling.  Consequently, the "story telling" aspect of his craft has, in my opinion, atrophied.  He, of course, has that right. But I, for one, am done reading his books. There's always the news if I want current events commentary. And better suspense writers if I desire an entertaining escape.     
 I wanted to give this book an honest chance, really I did. But in this case "honest" meant "Take it back to the bookstore. This one's no good." It doesn't deserve the lowest rating. There is actually some decent historical material. But it's darned close.  Mostly, this book is predictable. There are plenty of testimonials from True Believers. There's the usual trashing of evil materialistic impatient Westerners who lack the refined sensibilities of the Middle Kingdom. There's a fair bit The Emperor's New Clothes; if it doesn't work on you it's obviously because you aren't sufficiently perceptive. It's all shades of Dillman's no-touch knockout. When a skeptical physicist just stood there, uninjured and fully conscious, it had to be because the researcher was crossing his toes and thereby blocking his chi flow.  The most insulting part of this tract is the chapter titled "The Great Debate". The Great Debate, of course, is "Does this stuff actually work." As any reader of Skeptic or The Skeptical Inquirer or even fans of Penn and Teller's B******t! can tell you the answer is slippery. There's proof, but we don't have anything to prove. There's proof, but only our paying students are worthy of it. Or, closely related, you will believe when you've invested three to five hours a day for several years practicing and having faith in it. There's proof, but all the incidents happened long ago and far away once upon a time in China. There's proof, but you're a crass unenlightened boor for doubting us, and you have no sensitivity to chi. There's proof, but you could get severely injured so out of compassion we can't show you.  In short, these guys aren't going to be walking away with a million bucks from The Randi Challenge any time soon. Don't waste your time on fraud and self-delusion 
 High marks for accompanying the nature of the film well (pure action), but I miss the subtlety of the previous soundtracks.. 
 This book is by far the worst proofed book I've ever read in my life. I can't believe I'm writing this as a review, because I can normally overlook a few typos. However, the typos in this book make for an almost impossible read. I can't believe I paid money for it 
 A much too simplistic look at a complex issue- intergenerational-management. To read this book, you'd think that Gen X and Baby Boomers are dinasaurs with attitude problems and that Gen Y comes to the work place with nothing but exceptional skills and enthusiasm. It would have been much more valuable to compare positive work styles and philosophies of these different generations, rather than using the extremes of one generation representing the nightmarish boss and the other representing the bright young professional. Keep shopping for a better book 
 This book spells out what areas to organize and thats it.  It covers everything from files to designing custom closets--but with very little detail. I went through this in one night and felt very cheated.  I did get  the use of one good tip--how to get rid of my magazines.  But that's all!  Either this book is very elementry or I am extremely organized--and I know  the latter is not true.  If your really serious about orgainizing, keep  looking.  I wish I did 
 the material is nice, but the size is too small.  I usually wear size XS for tops but for this tee, the sleeve is too short 
      WOW !        This can only be described as Dyke-lit.....Deranged Dyke-lit.       WOW !!!       Mary Daly is nothing short of a feminist version of Louis Farrakhan, only that Daly is far more extreme than that.         This is a 417 page raging screed of man hate. It's unreadable drivel. Daly dissects words, and turns them inside out to form linguistic bludgeons. A little of that can be taken as entertaining, and at least somewhat factual, or at least plausibly factual. 400+ pages of it....???  It leaves me thinking of the kook in front of my local Post Office who keeps trying to run for President. He rants complete nonsense too, he just hasn't written it down, and had it published.        As a man I find this to be not the least bit threatening. You can't even take this stuff seriously. "Gynocide" .... hun???  "Gynocide" ????  This chick has such a gyno-centric view of the world she doesn't have the faintest clue as to what makes men tick.     It's a travesty to give this thing even one star.        
 There is no objective advise here.  While I've worked in Cosmetics and know there is a lot of hype, there are great products out there that she just completely destroys - mostly anything plant based.  Not all here descriptions are valid and unless you have terribly sensitive skin, you can just ignore this book.  The truth is keep your reciept! Take a tack and pin the reciept and box to a bulletin board and try the product your interested in, if you don't like the result, return your products to the store.  If in 4 weeks you don't see ANY difference, it's not working for you!  But this book will simply scare you, when most products are perfectly safe without reactions 
 People wonder why hip-hop died/is dying. You don't have to look any further than this. There are too many rappers out there bringing shame to the game. The line in his hit song where he says "I could sell a mill' saying nothing on the track" is probably true, he says absolutely nothing on any of his songs. Everything he has rapped about has been rapped about many times before (and better I might add). This guy is a complete disgrace to NYC hip-hop. Avoid this garbage and buy something else from the glory days of hip-hop, like an old Jay-Z, NaS, or B.I.G. album 
 We rec'd the Splash dvd and were quite a way into viewing it when it just went digital garbage -- all our other dvd's seem to work alright and we have a laser disk cleaner and try to run it through regularly -- i already threw away the container -- we will run the cleaner thru again and see if it clears up the problem - this is the first time we've bought a dvd that had a problem - we've always been very satisfied with the amazon service -- and products as well.  thanks for asking  pgammon 
 the tongs where hard to grip..so what I did to avoid sending them back.I took a pair of very small plyers and bent just the pointed ends inward..like a claw. Now they are excellent.grip great. love the long handle...and heavy duty soft rubber.hope this helps those of you like me who hate sending stuff back 
 I wanted to like BROTHERHOOD, for the simple reason that nearly every New Order fan this side of the galaxy has dismissed it, usually with a faint whiff of snobbery (or at least apathy). Turns out they were right: BROTHERHOOD is half an album. Most of its nine songs feel unfinished, as if the band wanted to cash in on the success of their 1985 smash LOW-LIFE and didn't care about the end result. BROTHERHOOD is a rush job, plain and simple, but there are still glimmers of hope within this bare-bones effort.   "As It Is When It Was" overcomes the album's overall muddy production by dint of being mostly acoustic, and the melody is quite lovely. "All Day Long", the emotional centerpiece of the album by default, is an intelligent (if half-hearted) protest against child abuse. While "Angel Dust" lacks a decent hook, its subtly danceable beat and effective synth noodlings will at least briefly hold your interest. And the toss-off "Every Little Counts" has a charming sense of humor that is too often lacking in New Order's work.  The most popular song on BROTHERHOOD is, of course, "Bizarre Love Triangle". So good it seems to belong to a different album entirely, "Bizarre Love Triangle" is truly New Order's masterpiece. The solid beat, slick sequencer work, and gorgeous melody showcase the band at their best: catchy, danceable, and downright euphoric. (Imagine how well it would have fit on LOW-LIFE.)  Sadly, the rest of BROTHERHOOD is unremarkable. The album's production neatly mixes rock with electronic flourishes, which has become New Order's signature sound, but the songwriting doesn't measure up. Buy the album if you're a trainspotter, but casual New Order fans would be better off picking up LOW-LIFE or 1983's POWER, CORRUPTION AND LIES. This one is just a footnote. 
 Watching the show I thought that Jonathan really cared about hair and its no doubt that he does still but his shampoo leaves alot to be desired. For example, even in the hot, very humid atmosphere of Houston, TX it left my hair feeling dry and unhealthy, even after using his conditioner (alot of it). My hair looks awful after using it. And the bottle claims that it doesn't use toxic ingredients like MEA but it DOES use three different types of PEG, a petroleum based thicker found in most bath products that can erode wooden tables in just minutes. This is just as harmful as MEA, especially for people with sensitive scalps and hair. And it claims not to strip your hair but the products that are supposed to cleanse are much less apparent in the product than the PEG products. Since PEG is a thickener, you're also getting a diluted, toxic, solution. Even though Head and shoulders uses MEA I find that that even that works better than this. My hair doesn't feel like it has any more of its essential oils and I've switched back to the other hair products Iv'e been using. It's not worth your 20 dollars, its barely worth 5 dollars. My hair stylist also recommended Dove products if you need hydration. DON'T BUY IT! 
 I ordered this to give as a gift. I rec'd the package, opened it up and it was completely the wrong thing. Haribo had mislabled the box and what I rec'd was 5 lbs. of sugar coated gummy apples instead. I was very diappointed although Amazon was very understanding and refunded me the total amount. I hesitate to order this item again 
 This game was put together with a nice concept, be a CTU agent and help Jack Bauer stop the terrorist attack.  Also, I liked the fact that there is a mole and that someone right next to you could destroy the whole game.  However, the interactive games and such used to get more clues are not made well.  Though you try to do what it tells you to do, it doesn't seem to work.  Since these interactive parts are so simple, yet not made in a way that one can control what is going on, you waste your time trying to do them and you never get to the end.  I had three college students and two adults try it adn no one could seem to get it to work correctly.  So, if some bugs were worked out, this game could be a much bigger success 
 This man needs to look inward to see who the enemy is that will destroy America.  Christ would puke the Bushtians from his mouth as the new pharasies.  Pat is living proof that maybe he should "whack himself".  Also living proof that cousins should refrain from intimate moments.  This dated piece of tripe is proof that in 2005 the "enemies" he names are now the hacks he supports.  The reader would be advised to search to the Saintly writings of John Paul II to find the meaning of the Saviors teachings 
 This book is a disappointment.  It is of some interest to Raider fans, but it doesn't really have much in the way of special information.  However, the first chapter is fantastic.  I'm sure the author's editor told the author to take that chapter out of chronological order and make it the first chapter because it's a great story 
 As soon as I put the case on it ripped! Then I contacted the seller and after a BIG hassle they sent me a different case. When the Case arrived it was already broken. Now I am stuck with 2 broken ipod cases. I would strongly recommend not buying from this store 
 This was a very disappointing story. I listened to the unabridged version and fell asleep on parts of the story without feeling like I missed anything. It took quite a while to get into and understand what was happening with the mysterious blue light, which is never truly explained. Chance, who tells the story of the blue light, is not a character that you come to care about, he's one of many people with a confusing story connecting him with the blue light. The other protaganists did very little to help push the story along, and I could not figure out the reason for the antaganist, Greyman (who by the way was corny). Though parts of the book was interesting, the ending left me highly annoyed. It was over 9 hours of wasted time 
 Len Sweet usually writes more with more passion and intelligence that he evidences in this book. Snipets of insight into an eclectic alphabetized list of topics result in a whole lot of next to nothing.  BUT Sweet et al still have a few fascinating things to say -- just not many 
 I thought Tom Clancy was a  great writer after reading Hunt For Red October and Red Storm Rising. But this novel I found virtually impenetrable. It takes hundreds of apges for anything to actauly happen. Japanese men soaking in hot tubs discussing economics isn't my idea of a gripping read. And for the family killed in a car accident to we really need to know that the baby "did a job" beforehand? To me that's simply pointless detail that slows down the narrative to a crawl. And at 1000+ pages that style of writing is going to really wear a reader down. In all truth I skipped about half this book out of tedium. 
 Though this book was written much better than Foundation's Fear, I wasn't very impressed. You know how movie studios always do re-makes of old movies? Well this here is a re-write, basically of the first chapter of Asimov's classic original Foundation book. What a waste of paper. If you already read the original, then you already know what will happen at the end 
 I am not sure but I believe the part in the book about Pryor being influenced by Monty Python was written only AFTER Pryor died late last year. I have been everywhere on Google trying to find evidence of Pryor being influenced by Python and could find none. RichardPryor.com shows no evidence of this alleged influence. I believe the writers of this book just included that in to make Python sound more influential than it really was and to appeal to african-americans more too. I believe the book's statement on Mr. Pryor to be totally false!   And to the poster named Spiney. I am not kidding at all when I say I believe the book is indeed taking bad advantage of a dead celebrity in a vain attempt to appeal to african-americans. 
 The Prisoner of Azkaban  Young Harry suffers as an adopted child and family servant. An insulting relative is blown away, and Harry leaves too. A magic bus takes him away. The special effects are extravagant, but seem senseless. The oddities are like something out of "Star Wars", amazing but irrelevant. The `Hogwarts' school seems to be overproducing the amount of wizards needed for their economy. Or do they have a short life in their future? Great power may create great faults.  The computer generated images are what makes this film interesting. The hippogriff looks great! Let's hope it doesn't drop anything on the students. Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban, where they keep the wizards who have gone bad. Black is said to be going after Harry Potter! This time we see the game of quidditch played in the rain. The winter scene and the invisible Potter recalls "The Invisible Man". Overall there is a creepy feeling to the adult characters in this film. The story begins to drag in the middle, but a big black dog shows up to drag Ron into his underground lair. A tree comes to life and attacks Harry and Hermione. Then they find a secret tunnel that leads to the castle and a surprising revelation. [Does any of this make sense to you?]  Special effects are no substitute for a good story. It seems confused and meaningless. Can the wing loading of a hippogriff support three people? All seems to end well given the prior events. Professor Lupin resigns, his secret life-style has been found out and the parents of his students won't approve of this behavior. Parents don't like a teacher who exploits the students. "Harry Potter" panders to children in giving superhuman powers to a select few who aren't fit to handle these powers. Or is this a subtle criticism of the aristocratic ruling class? 
 I read all the reviews & thought this would do the trick. My daughter does not like the results at all. It does not straighted her hair as it states. I wish I would have spent a little more $$ on a better one 
 This novel started out pretty good in that I didn't know where Koontz was going with Martie's panic attacks and fear of herself.  It seemed to take FOREVER for anything to actually happen. The antagonist was a caricature.  So over-the-top, it was a job getting through each page. If this had been my first Koontz novel, I probably wouldn't bother with a second. 
 More garbage that subtly steers the reader away from the idea that Washington had "No Idea" about the 911 attacks and that they merely screwed up. This book is for cowards that are afraid to look at the hundreds of glaring pieces of evidence that point to Washington pre-knowledge; actually,I think Mossad did the dirty work. I get sick of reading junk like this that serves to only mellow out and support insecure people that cling to the phoney American Dream while they wave their stupid little flags that are made in Red China. The complicity of the American sheeple is beyond belief! Every body is willing to become a suck up like Stalins Yezhov or Beria believing everything that is said to them, then Bang, right in the head. What will you Sensible, moderate sheeple say when the North American Union 2010 and Shafta steal your job and corporations steal your retirement. Another similiar piece of garbage that advances the "Innocent view of the CIA and Washington" is E. Howard Hunt's Book "American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA" Completely sanitized of any useful information. If a book has any truth to it, it will be either "Out of Print", Extremely expensive or the Author will have died of lead poisining ( Gary Webb, Gurudas, David Allen 
 As if Fiddy Cent wasn't enough to make me break some bones, this horrible trend of Kayne West comes in. What is there to be said that hasn't been said? Nothing, really; my work has been done by all the one-star reviewers. All I have to say is that I hope this rapper fades away from the universe sooner or later.  Want good rap? Go for Tupac (R.I.P.) or Public Enemy 
 More time could have been spent in Ney York City for this movie. Like with Friday The 13th Part Seven: The New Blood, all of the good gore scenes were cut out. But still, this is a terrible movie and I am willing to bet that not even gore will help it be better than part five 
 1998's "Lost in Space" is just a mediocre sci-fi movie that's full of plot devices we've already seen in droves of other sci-fi outings.  Nothing new here.  And we've already seen this exact same idea executed in the 1960's TV series.  Why do we need to see it again?  Just to see the improved video game-like visual effects?  But this movie only seemed to be made as a marketing ploy to sell toys.  They didn't even bother with a sequel, and the movie ended with a strong hint that there would be.  They really need to stop dusting off old TV shows for movie ideas, and start coming up with some original ideas again 
 Nothing written by Newt Gingrich could possibly be any good.  I have word that Kenneth Starr has an upcoming historical novel about the Dahlgren-Kilpatrick Raid 
 I rented this on a whim and it brought back a lot of memories from my 1970s days in elementary school.  This video made its rounds in the public schools.  The songs are catchy and the film quality is good.    But make no mistake, this is propaganda aimed at children.  I will not be showing it to my kids.  Despite the freewheeling title, the message is that girls will find happiness only if they mimic boys.    Case in point:  Atalanta, a princess, finds happiness when she competes with men in a footrace and when she rejects marriage so she can travel the world (on her father's horse).  She also designs and fabricates rocketships in her spare time.  Juxtapose that story with another cartoon where a femine girl in a pink dress and curls is devoured by tigers when she follows the custom of "ladies first."  The tigers abide her request and throw her into a boiling cauldron.  The narrator advises us that the boiling girl makes a very tasty meal.  Our "hosts", infant puppets voiced by Mel Brooks and Marlo Thomas, are revolting.  There should be a law against using Mel Brooks' voice for a baby.  Apparently, I repressed memories of these creatures, but seeing them again brought back the horror.  Needless to say, I fast forwarded through the disturbing puppetry.  Overall, this DVD is fun for thirtysomethings but should be kept away from children 
 The first X-Men movie was fantastic. The second movie sent chills down my spine and was even better. This third movie was absolute trash and I will never buy it 
 sympathize with the storyteller or the subject.  They both seemed too cold.  ...this well has lukewarmness.    I wanted to walk away from this bio having found out cool little anticdotes and I'll I got was the story of two men who couldn't find their way in this world 
 This is horrendous movie. I will never claim it as the movie of my generation. It's one of the many reasons why I absolutely hate the "80's". The others are:Breakdancing, The Yuppie lifestyle,Power hungry businessmen/women, Women with manly handshakes, New Wave Music, and junk movies like this. I know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself, and what he can get out of life. He ridicules his friend because he's sick, and doesn't feel like driving Ferris around...especially in a Ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage, so what am I left to believe I have to wonder if this is where Ice Cube got the inspiration for "It Was A Good Day". I don't care what decade it was, or what was cool back then, or now manipulating your friends is "NOT" I repeat"NOT" cool. I know with John and Johnette Q. Public this is something of a sexual relase. I could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie, and I find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny. 
 Unless you enjoy movies that are not funny, not scary, and have the worst actors this side of rodeo clowns, DO NOT WATCH this series of horrible flicks.  Putrid!  Not even "so-bad-it's-funny". Absolutely the worst films in the history of mankind!  Heed my warning!  SUCKS!! 
 I'm a Card fan, so I was eager to read this book.  Talk about disappointed.  I'm honestly baffled by all these good reviews.  "Treason" is every bit as ridiculous as Marian Zimmer Bradley on a bad day (I'm thinking specifically of MZB's story in which two women handcuffed to each other PUT SHIRTS ON, THEN TAKE THEM OFF -- unless Darkovan blouses have incredibly interesting sleeves, that's physically impossible!  It killed the book for me).  Card and MZB have a lot in common:  When they're good, they're very very good, but when they're bad, they're unreadable.  For me, "Treason" is an incredibly painful read.  Bad, bad, bad 
 This movie would get 5 stars if it were not carressing with one hand - portraying  the Gospel of John beautifully through the movie - and slapping Yahushua/Jesus and serious scholars in the face with the other hand.  The so-called "scholarly" comments, for example about how the Gospel was written 200 years after the events, are by and large intellectually dishonest and quite simply inaccurate.  Even the lowliest of Bible scholars, if honest, will realize this. It is very sad to see people making a buck off the Bible, while trying to tear it down at the same time.  The worst examples of Scripture put downs are in the 3rd DVD.  I gave the movie to a relative without that add on 
 "You get what you pay for"  Most of the time that cliche is true, but there are products out there that break this rule.  The Philips DVP642 is one of them, a great quality, versatile product selling at a bargain price.  This is not.  I was hoping the same of this product from all the "glowing" reviews on here.  However, this quality of this monopod is very disappointing.  First of all, you have to ask yourself, why do you need a monopod over a tripod?  For myself and most, it's because we need some stability and portability for our telephoto zoom lenses.    However, telephoto zooms are long and heavy so the monopod should be designed strong and solid to live up to the task.  This monopod doesn't even come close.  Here are it's bad points:  -The aluminum construction is very cheap quality.  The leg segments wobble laterally when you extend and close them.  It feels like thin, cheap aluminum and the monopod feels it could break in half like a toothpick at any time.  -The head is very cheap and not solid.  No matter how tight I tightened the head, my camera would slope down.  The workmanship of the head is so cheap that at any point, you think that you're going to break the PLASTIC tightening screw if you tighten it too much.  I think we've all experienced that in the past.  -The leg locks are not tight.  When you push down on the monopod, the leg segments slide back into themselves.  In the end, it was a risk I took hoping that I could get a high-quality product for a cheap price.  Sometimes, you can get away with that.  Walmart sells a very decent functioning tripod for only $30.  In this case, I should've bought a REAL monopod.  Oh well, I wasted $16 that I could've used to help pay for a higher quality monopod 
 I despise this album. I know that's enough to give all you indie/Punk/Post-Punk elitists all the more reason to buy this album and pretend you like it, so proceed to buy your tasteless little hearts out. But this fact remains: Second Edition is a waste of money. The semi spoken-word song called "The Suit" is interesting and worth hearing just for Lydon's rare, non-shrieking monotone, but screw the rest of the album. I prefer Lydon's melodious wailing from PiL circa 1983-1992. His solo dance album is tops as well (Psycho's Path, I believe). What else can I say; I'm happy with his lovely pop-infused work. I suppose I'm easy to please (unlike all you embittered pricks pretending to like something like Second Edition that Lydon purposely made to be unlistenable)  
 Calling Cards... Long gloves vs Afternoon Tea gloves... How to prepare a proper wives luncheon complete with quiche???? WHO DOES THIS!!! As an Enlisted wife (And I find that most of the wives looking for help ARE Enlisted) you are going to wind up chucking this book right into the trash. The place on base that people keep mentioning as being useful is the Family Support Center. They have FREE reading material that is 400 times more useful than knowing what kind of gloves to wear to lunch. WHO WEARS GLOVES TO LUNCH?!! Half of the wives I know who "do lunch" end up showing up in jeans so where do the gloves come in??? I gave this to my best friend who is an Officers Wife, thinking that the Upper Crust might do these 50's style luncheons more than us enlisted people... as it turns out, they don't "do lunch" with gloves either.   Seriously, if you're COMPLETELY new to the military, this might help you learn some of the traditions. But it gives you the WRONG idea about what the military is like and, in all honesty, I've been married for several years now, was a brat before that, and the only pair of gloves I own are for winter weather. And the only reason I even HAVE calling cards is because, as a Jew, I'm forbidden to write on the Sabbath and sometimes I want to give my number to a new friend. I have never once needed more than the back of a reciept and a pen to give my number to other military wives, I have never served quiche at a get together and don't know anybody who actually EATS the stuff outside of their parent's house, And   If it's history and tradition you are looking for.. there are WAY more books out there to give you an insightful look at the military. If you're in your 50's, married to an officer, and you're the type to "do lunch" in a formal setting, you will get off on this book. But if you're anything like me (an Enlisted wife under 30) you're better off just going to the FSC, a library, or a Spouses Club meeting for all of the information that's in this book. Also, it helps to MEET the wives because then you will see that they are not a group of hat wearing, quiche eating old biddies who do tea. 
 This book is great! Assuming you already have a Ph. D. in Political Science. Otherwise this book is best reserved for drop quoting, or light reference. The author shows bias towards the United States' form of  Democracy, as is to be expected in such a book. The simplistic nature makes  the reader annoyed more than informed. The childish approach is suited for  school children, but not as appropriate as other books for real analysis 
 Completely fails to discuss the most fantastic and least logical idea promulgated withing the last 200 years, that life in all of its variation evolved from a series of random accidents.  As for criticism of the aquatic ape theory, it's far more logical than other "mainstream" theories and most scientists have ran from this theory without even attmepting to evaluate it. After all, it was written by a woman in a man's profession so why should it be taken seriously 
 Despite what appears to be the vast majority of opinions on this book, I found this book very difficult to get through. What De Pree writes as "authoritative" leadership concepts, I see as nothing more than common sense. Perhaps I have been blessed to work in a company that touts similar values and beliefs or perhaps I am just a person that already believes that it is the diversity of people that is what makes a company successful. But I found dredging through De Pree's long lists of leadership principles exhaustive and frustrating. I didn't find this book revolutionary (which is how he seems to write it) or even particularly interesting. "Man's Search For Meaning" is a FAR more compelling leadership read... 
 Think about Christianity.  About Catholicism, and about Protestantism.  Think about it entirely dispassionately.  Think about it removed from its major role in shaping Western society.  Think about it removed from all the Christians you know, or whether you yourself are a Christian.  Hopefully, at this point, you will realize that there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to subscribe to it.  Christianity, in its purest essence, is submitting yourself to a mythical authority that you will never see, hear, touch, or truly know.  It is the intellectual laziness of assigning all that you cannot explain about the world as the creation of an entirely unexplainable being - in other words, refusing to admit the general ignorance of yourself and, indeed, the human race as a whole by claiming that the only reason you can't explain something is because it is inexplicable, thus saving yourself the frightening strain of having to actually make an effort to think about anything.  And, if God is indeed as arbitrary in his predestination as Luther and Calvin claimed, why follow him?  (Claims about 'The Elect' are not an answer; in saying that God predestined only certain people to enter heaven, but in acting morally you show yourself a likely member of that group, Calvin merely gives the Catholic doctrine of "good works" a new name.)  As polemicized as the above may sound, it does have a purpose in the context of a discussion of this book.  Luther, in trumpeting more ascetic, predestination-oriented Christianity over the rich, material hypocrisy of the established Catholic Church, was merely  replacing a material, class-based slavery with a moral slavery.  In claiming that Desiderus Erasmus' promotion of free will is merely an invitation to sin, Luther shows his true colors.  He demonizes choice and diversion from "the true way" in order to convince others to follow him and add to his power.  Funny, he wasn't quite so opposed to free will when he himself chose to defy the established Catholic order.  It is not wrong to enjoy alcohol, sex, or material possessions.  It is wrong to have these things while also preaching against them, as the Catholics did, but it is not wrong to enjoy the material pleasures of the world.  In Luther's steadfast opposition to other people enjoying themselves, and advocacy of instead living your life according to a supposedly otherworldly moral authority which conveniently seems to have been revealed only to those who gain power, we have merely the cynical and, yes, thoroughly materialistic manipulations of a man too bitter to acknowledge others any kind of pleasure, independent thought, or deviation from Luther's arbitrary set of standards.  The Catholics cynically exploited the masses by selling indulgences and fake relics through promises of a nonexistent paradise (see:  The Pardoner's Tale in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales).  The Protestants cynically exploited the masses by demonizing anything that might distract those masses' attention for one second from doing exactly what the Protestant leadership said (see: John Calvin's nightmarishly despotic Geneva).  Neither was any better than the other, and both attempted to squash dissent mercilessly.  Luther's book is just another one of these attempts 
 I read a lot of biography and I have tremendous respect for Sandra Day O'Connor.  I thought, for sure, this was a win-win combination for this book.  Sadly, I only made it three quarters through before I donated it to the local library.  It is well written but dry 
 I thought this was going to be the story of the soap "Dallas".  I returned the book as soon as I saw it wasn't what I thought it was ging to be 
 Only one song on this CD is good -- and it's very good!  Iko is a favorite to anyone with a dance feever 
 This was a horrible product, it was difficult to manuever and control. It did nothing but immediately cause my arms, shoulders and wrists to hurt. I felt absolutely nothing at all in the target area, my stomach. Not even a little. It was boring and pointless to bother.This machine was a waste of time to ship back and forth and I do not recomend it to anyone who wants to work their stomach muscles. Its a misleading product and very uncomfortable on the back also. It hurt my spine to bend in the way they said. I felt the machine digging into my spine. I was so focused on the pain and the pain in my arms I could not continue for more than 5 minutes at a time. Dont waste your time buying this product. Its expensive and not worth it. 
 Gets a star for pointing out that writing is scary, but has nothing to offer in terms of advice beyond "do it anyway, risk-taking is good."  So now we need a writer oriented book on risk-taking, I guess 
 Opera is intended to be seen - a true multi-media art. But a fascinatingly perfect stage setting aside, this is one production better heard than seen. Sonically, the performances please, but this rates as one of the more visually disturbing casts I have witnessed. A 58-year-old Plcido Domingo is simply unconvincing as a young soldier. Aprile Millo, as a well-fed version of the Ethiopian slave girl (in ridiculous black face), Aida, defies the costumers' best attempts to provide a waist line. And Dolora Zaijick mirrors a middle-aged matron more than the Egyptian princess Amneris. A fine performance by the ballet troup only draws attention to age and fitness disparities. Like an emperor, the Metropolitan Opera stands as a respected authority. Perhaps this is the impetus behind overenthusiastic curtain calls which prolong the end of each act, but the emperor has no clothes - or at least they need ironing.  These are the type of miscastings which turn neophytes off to the idea of opera. Huge fans of these performers who can suspend disbelief may well be pleased, but those craving contextually appropriate performances will find this one age inappropriate 
 After years of hearing about what a seminal work this is, I finally broke down and bought a (used) copy.  I expected something like the anti-Simon, an exhaustive documentation of how we are inevitably headed toward doom and collapse unless the government steps in to intervene with specific recommendations.  I was extremely surprised to find that this book is nothing more than a long description of the authors' computer model!  Is that it?!  Apparently so.  The authors assembled a computer model of all human activity and natural science, complete with feedback, time delay, and other parameters (yeah, they really present it that way!).  Then they ran it through a computer and found what they expected - quite a surprise, eh?  Then they tweak on the basic model and find that almost nothing leads to a rosy scenario.  Humanity is going to collapse by 2100, and there is nothing we can do about it.  Well, almost nothing.  Apparently, if we stop procreating, stop economic growth, and spread the existing wealth evenly, everything will be ... well, it won't be great, but it will be "okay", sorta like the warehousing activity that we call public "schooling".  I think there is a book that describes the resulting society, ... I believe it was called _Anthem_.  I gave the book a couple of stars because of its canonical status, but it certainly doesn't deserve the attention it has gotten.  A major flaw is that they don't describe the model they use in any significant detail to allow you to run the numbers yourself (they refer you to another article, and you can find the original model on the internet if you're perseverent enough).  If someone is throwing this into your face as proof that we are headed to certain disaster, fear not.  There simply isn't enough substance here, some of the information and assumptions are dated, and you can certainly point out a few holes in their model assumptions that tend to undo their long-term analysis.  If you are thinking about using this to support your world view, please reconsider.  Try something a little more grounded in reality, without the breathless hype, like any environmental economics book by Tom Tietenberg 
 I agree with Jodi (see her review further down) -- Teitelbaum is confused into thinking that the chronic fatigue he experienced as an overworked medical student is the same as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  True CFS (which involves neurologic, endocrine, cardiorespiratory and other abnormalities, not merely extreme fatigue) has far more symptoms than just fatigue.  It's generally a result of a virus, not "burn out".  For those who have real CFS, some of the advice can be hazardous. Experts concur that exercise is detrimental, especially to those in the advanced stages who have viral damage to their heart muscle ... I know several patients who've been rendered permanently bedridden after following misguided advice to exercise their way to health.  In fact, reaction to exercise is one of the ways the experts differentiate between CFS and depression.  (see www.cfsfacts.org for details on this diagnostic shortcut)  I've tried Teitelbaum's Fatigued to Fantastic formula; even at maximum dosage, it didn't put me to sleep.  It might help if you have chronic fatigue (the symptom) from insufficient sleep, but Chronic Fatigue SYNDROME is not sleeping too little, but not feeling refreshed when you wake up even if you've slept 20 hours.  See Jodi's list of good books about the Syndrome (not the symptom); I'd add David S. Bell's "Doctor's Guide to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome" as one of my top picks 
 Bought this a month ago for use with my DX4330 kodak 3MP digital camera. It worked for 2 days.After that, everytime I on the camera, it wanted me to reformat the card,WTH is that? Now I can't use it at all.... I'm always so confidence with my previous purchases from Amazon.One mistake I made,I threw away the shipping and product packages once I tested out the card, thought It worked and It would be OK.I can no longer return it now. Needless to say,I'm too over confident with LEXAR's products. Buyers beware... 
 Listened to the audiobook version of this James Patterson novel in the car -- simply because my spouse bought it off a remainder table cheap and I figured we should get our money's worth.  Twenty minutes into it I wanted to chuck the first tape out the window the writing (and the audiobook narration) was so overwrought.  But then I listened longer as I realized how amusing the bad writing was.  A wonderful text here for a creative writing class:  how to write junk fiction that sells but which you'd never want to put your name on.  Sad that someone can write as poorly as Patterson and sell oh so many books 
 It's just that simple.  There is NO credible clinical evidence that chelation therapists do anything for patients except lighten their bank accounts.  If any chelation therapist wants to sue me for writing this, BRING IT ON!  
 I am a cyclist and runner and I was looking for something to suppliment the Rodney Yee (the BEST yoga DVDs available) DVDs that I have.  I bought this one specifically because it claimed to have workout designed for different sports.  Well, it was a major let down.  This tape is for absolute beginners only.  It has zero flow and it frustratingly slow.  They spend several minutes on each pose, and not holding the pose, but just slowly getting you in the pose and then holding it for 10 seconds after two or three minutes of explanation.  Its maddening.  There's no continuity.  I would imagine that if you are an true beginner this DVD might be marginally useful but once you mastered the basic poses it offers, you would then lose interest in it because of it's painfully slow pace.  I personally did half of a one hour work out and couldn't finish it, it was driving me nuts.  I went back to my Rodney Yee and the world was right again.... 
           The major prediction   made by Glassman and Hassett in this book,written in 1999,was that"A sensible target date for Dow 36,000 is early 2005,but it could be reached much earlier"(1999,p.140).This fantastic science fiction forecast,like the similar 1999 fiction forecasts of Abby Joseph Cohen, Elias(1999)and Kadlec(1999),was mathematically and economically impossible since the single best predictor of future stock market values is the rate of growth in gdp(gross domestic product).To obtain a Dow of 36,000 by 2005 at the latest would have required continuous quarterly gdp growth rates of 7%-8% from 1999 through 2005.Starting in late 1999(Sept.,1999) through March,2000,the 3 wisemen,Warren Buffett,George Soros,and Peter Lynch,liquidated all of the stocks in their portfolios and exited the market.They transferred their cash to other assets.Unfortunately,far too many financial investors failed to follow them out of all of the stock markets and ended up losing about 8 trillion dollars.The best long treatment of stock market behavior is the 3 rd edition of C.P.Kindleberger's Manias,Panics,and Crashes(1996).His major point was that you automatically have a bubble once you start hearing  claims that there is a new economy that represents a complete break with all past market fundamentals.This was precisely the claim made by Gilder,Laffer,Wanniski,Glassman and Hassett,Elias,Kadlec,etc. Paul Samuelson's 1996 prediction-"Sometime in the next five years you may kick yourself for not reading and re-reading Kindleberger's Manias,Panics,and Crashes"-hit the nail on the head.The best short treatment is still chapter 12 of John Maynard Keynes's 1936 The General Theory of Employment,Interest and Money 
 I was not really impressed with this CD.  The previous 2 CDs(Mission to Please, Eternal) were so much better.  R Kelly is a great producer, but did not write the best songs for the Isleys for this.  2 Bad !!! :(  Isleys were better off with Jam and Lewis from the Eternal CD.  Listen and Buy at your own risk 
 The novel was recommended in a Swiss newspaper and it sounded like an interesting book. However,  I found it rather disappointing. The plot is weak and the ending contrived and implausible. To my mind Sharpe didn't succeed in mixing satire, social realism, psychological insight and fantasy into a literary satisfying text. There are some real highlights, individual scenes and descriptions and dialogues, in which the author shows talent. But there are not enough to create a great novel 
 Elementary discussion of land development.  Lacks detail and interest.   the accompanying "checklists and forms" are not in a format that can be manipulated.  Nothing is in Word as the description suggests, all in PDF format.  Not useful at all.  
 There are some nice frog sounds on this CD, but the red-winged blackbird noises are intrusive.  They evoke a sunny daylight pond, rather than the dusky atmosphere I was hoping for.  Even in the third track, which features a thunderstorm, the redwings are chirring away.  They overshadow the frogs at times.  Do birds even sing in the middle of thunderstorms?  I'm starting to wonder if the recordings are authentic as presented, or whether the rain and birds/frogs were patched together at a later time 
      My major gripe about this film comes down to the issue of easily exploitable weaknesses on the part of the vampires. These extremely frail villains get reduced to ash with the flash of a u-v lamp, vaporized with the slightest touch of silver on their skin, and melted down in less than a second by the light of the sun. Vampires are supposed to be scary, but how frightened of them should I be if one can be taken out by throwing a clove of garlic at him. Writers for future vampire movies should work on making these creatures of the night a bit more formidable. The first Underworld movie would be a good model.                                 
 Perhaps reading this book from the vantage point of 2006 is a mistake, but I thought I'd enjoy Drucker's big picture thinking about the topic of the knowledge economy.  Drucker's discussion of the rise of the knowledge worker in today's society was only a quarter of this book.  This book is really a series of essays that lacked coherence as a whole.  I would recommend "The Essential Drucker" instead, to the reader looking for a good compilation of Drucker's insights.  
 ...and I'm the father. The day before my 13-year old daughter and I were to see an excellent concert by EWF, I bought this album. After listening to about the first five tracks, my daughter turned to me and said, "There's not much Earth, Wind & Fire on this CD, is there?" Sadly, there isn't. If you're looking for Earth, Wind & Fire, you won't find much of it here. Thankfully, the band played nothing from this album the following night! So if you get a chance, see them live! If not, buy Spirit, All 'N All, I Am, Faces, Touch the World, Raise, or any number of other worthy efforts, but avoid this one 
 As a big Feelies fan and a big Galaxie 500 fan, Luna would seem like the perfect band for me. And they were, for 2 releases anyway. This band has run out of things to say. Dean Wareham's lyrics grow more inane with each release. Ex-Feelie Stanley Demeski is gone, replaced by a rather indistinguished drummer. Buy Lunapark or Bewitched instead...Penthouse is okay, but the decline started there 
 I think I've burnt out on Jayne Ann Krentz.  The chemistry between her main character never sizzles, it just slow simmers.  And I'm so tired of her cliched characters: the cold, uptight, calculating, corporate male hero and the emotional/spiritual, free spirit heroine.  Tired, tired, tired.  On top of that, the plots are boring.  I give up on this author 
 I am an early interventionist, working with several infants and children who have Down syndrome. I found this book to be somewhat incomplete and misleading. For example, it contains a developmental milestone chart for typically developing children. This chart caused no end of worry to the parents I work with. More accurate, Down syndrome specific information is available elsewhere. 
 Unlikes his other book "the perfect mess" this book starts out with strong and very good ideas, but then progressively gets worse as you flip the pages.  The author has about 3 good examples in the book, but keep reiterating the same points he covered at the begining of the book.  The final 3 chapters felt like a last attempt to fill the book with pages.  Skip this book if you read "the perfect mess".  Get it if you've never seen the other book 
 These guys did the music better than anyone could come along and ever do.  To do a tribute album is nice but production time and effort put into the originals puts anyone behind the eight ball from word go.  You have to really work hard to ever update these songs if it is even possible.  Never understood these types of albums.  I mean the original did them right why remake them 
 I enjoy a lot of exercise and eat well, but I thought I would brush up on my knowledge and remotivate to do more exercise than I already do - I selected this book as the BP concept seemed interesting. I put the book down after about 15 pages - for good. It seemed very apparent to me that the author has some serious mental issues with people who are overweight, and boy, he doesn't let you forget it! I did read that he was overweight himself at one point and he developed low self esteem as a result of this; well, it certainly shows. This book is extremely condescending - if you are an intelligent, positive individual, then this book isn't for you. If you want to be indoctrinated into the "thin is in" mantra, by all means, buy my copy (please!) 
 This book is fun and educational if you are interested in performing a DEMONSTRATION regarding a scientific concept.  The examples have nothing to do with conducting an EXPERIMENT that one would present at a Science Fair.  The "problems" listed for each example can be answered by opening an encyclopia.  Generally a problem/question that begins with the word, "how" can be answered in such a way.  The purpose of a science fair is to conduct ORIGINAL experiments involving an experimental group and a control group.  There are other guide books on the market that take a more scientific approach and steer the student in the right direction 
 I have several dozen books on various aspects of success and failure and this book is the most mediocre of them all. Each page has about 100 words at best and there is no detail to any of the stories of the effort and perseverance required to actually succeed. So some slightly famous someone you have heard about had a bad day once. Big deal, there is no lesson to that. The real lesson is in reading about the depth and breadth it really takes to succeed - real commitment, not just a simple piece of good or bad luck.  If you have a friend who just doesn't like to read at all, this would be a suitable gift. I'm not saying that to be a book snob...we have all been in "their" houses, where the heck are the books? If you have a friend or relative who is trying to achieve something great in his or her life, but they are just not the type to read, then this book would be an acceptable choice. My younger brother - whom - I admire a great deal, is trying to succeed at a very difficult career path and I will be getting this book for him for his Christmas present. However, if you want anything more than the most superficial read, choose a different book. 
 I bought this with the hopes of consolidating/backing up files for home and work PCs.  I already had the drives, so this seemed like a good idea.  It took about 2 hours to configure the device the way I wanted to - a 200 MB mirror and a 50 MB non-mirror.  The mirrored partitions seem to have real problems.  The speed reading/writing to the mirror are very slow, and the mirror partition keeps getting corrupted.  To fix the problem requires that you download and use a command line application.  I am technically capable, but I really don't like having to 'fix' the mirror partition whenever I want to use it.    I have one PC that can't even run the application to attach the drives - it crashes when I open it.  Also mentioned in previous posts - it is annoying to have to load each PC with software to attach to the device.  The fact that it doesn't use NTFS or CLI format is another really annoyance - I have to copy these drives to another NTFS drive in order to recapture the files I have on this device (Windows, Linux, and Mac can't read the format of these drives).  Summation: I would not buy this again.  I am now looking at the Linksys product; it would require me to buy two HD enclosures, but at least then I could actually use it 
 I thought this book was a stiff and hard to read I don`t this is a good read for a parent 
 if i could, i'd give it no stars!!! lame book. lots of errors. even though it is a guide to the friday films, it glosses over several of the latter movies. why? too much trouble???? and I have to agree with previous comments laugh at alot of the reviews here, most of them likely written by the same person! that's just sad, and kinda lame. 
 I don't know about the other songs but they have no right to make a Marilyn Manson song sound so bad, how dare they!!!! I am out raged! I love his version, wait, I love him too!! He he he!! He is gorgeous and very very sexy!! Now where was I? Oh yes, this album sucks big time, don't buy it other wise I will come after you and eat you, only kidding!!! Ha Ha Ha. Now you are probably going to buy it just to see if I will come after you because you think I am insane. Well I am telling you it is a mistake! It's your choice. Bye for now 
 [Joshua 6:23,21]Joshua said to the people of Israel, "The Lord has given you the city of the all silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the Lord: They shall come into the treasury of the Lord. The people utterly DESTROYED ALL THAT WAS IN THE CITY, BOTH MAN AND WOMAN,YOUNG AND OLD, AND OX AND SHEEP, AND ASS, WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD.   Deuteronomy 17:3-5 "And he should go and worship other gods and bow down to them or to the sun or the moon or all the army of the heavens, .....and you must stone such one with stones and such one must die."   Romans 1:20-32 ....32. "Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them."   Numbers 31: And the Lord said unto Moses, "Avenge the children of the Mid'-an'ites.. They warred against the Mid'-i-an'ites, as the Lord commanded Moses, and they slay all the males. And they took all women as captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods. And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire. Moses said, "HAVE YOU SAVED ALL THE WOMEN ALIVE? NOW KILL EVERY MALE AMONG THE LITTLE ONES, AND KILL EVERY WOMAN that has known a man by lying with him, but all the young girls who have not known a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves."   [Quran-60:8-9] GOD does not enjoin you from befriending those who do not fight you because of religion, and do not evict you from your homes. You may befriend them and be equitable towards them. GOD loves the equitable. GOD enjoins you only from befriending those who fight you because of religion, evict you from your homes, and band together with others to banish you. You shall not befriend them. Those who befriend them are the transgressors. 
 Mere Christianity is a book often recommended to atheists by Christians and is touted as a rational, logical case for the Christian religion. Unfortunately, well-informed atheists will find that Lewis quickly uses a god of the gaps argument to explain his concept of Moral Law. Lewis's Moral Law argument will not fool anyone with a basic understanding of social evolution. All cultures have some prohibition against stealing and murder as well as some glorification of selflessness and compassion, but this is due not to a Lawgiver but to social evolution. The reason we have these moral characteristics is because they helped us to survive. Any tribe of humans who permitted murder or glorified betrayal would fall apart and die out quickly.  A warning to all atheists who pick up this book: Don't bother reading past Book 1. The Moral Law is the keystone of Lewis's argument. Without it, everything else he says is meaningless to atheists 
 We used Lonely Planet guidebooks all over Europe while we were there with our kids for 7 months.  This book was the first time Lonely Planet let us down.  The book is organized badly and it was full of bad information.  Two of the restaurants that were recommended in the book (both of which sounded as if they had been there forever) were nowhere to be found.  In fact, one was a pile of rubble.  This was very frustrating when you're hungry and you're dragging four kids around the city looking for a place to eat 
 Thomas Sowell continues his simpleminded interpretations. His so-called refutations have not changed. He is a clown. He learned obviously at an early age how to make money by proclaiming he is not Black.And he is right! He is not! 
 I thought this was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read.  The whole plot is just plain ridiculous.  Bored middle-aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime.  When the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years.  Such rubbish--don't people see how contrived and unrealistic, not to mention immoral, this is?  Avoid this one 
 I have found that this book was a weak and uncreative attempt to brand "BLUR" as a modern innovation of conducting business when it has simply re-spun and devalued traditional business practices into a dot com unsustainable ideal. This book preaches that there is little need for the tangible bottom line for the intangibles of business out weigh the value of the actual assets. That may be partially true; however, what actually happens when that model is embraced is uncontrollable corruption in the market. If you are a beginner in the business world and have trouble reading, you will find a few good business ideas and examples within the double spaced, trivially written text. However, as it was published in 1999 most of the ideas are now a BLUR of the past. There are better books out there. Don't waste your time 
 I have never liked the character of Nefret.  I wish it had never been introduced to the Peabody series.  I hope the future books are better than this one 
 I may be in the minority, but I think these books are absolutely horrible. My twin's teacher reads them to the kids at school, and my daughter loves them. She brought one home to read to me, and I was appalled. I think they are tasteless and have no redeeming value to them at all. The grammar is horrible (this is how Junie talks), and although I know it is suppose to be funny,  I just don't get it.  The subject matter is even worse. I think kids are too young to worry about boys, and I do not believe I want my kids reading books that are so mean spirited. With all the wonderful choices in children's literature, why choose this 
 My kids started reading the Left Behind Kids books, and because I was concerned about the message and theology of the books, I started reading them also.  Then I decided to check out the "adult" books from the library.   I am a born-again, pentacostal believer in Jesus Christ, and parts of the theology are not what I read in the Bible.  OK.  I can stil enjoy a good book, one with interesting characters, realistic dialogue, and a good plot.  The issue of plot is difficult for the Left Behind books, I admit, because we know who wins if we've read the end of the New Testament.  As to the rest, it fell flat.  Most of the dialogue didn't ring true.  After a few of the books, I was interested in some of the characters, but by the end of the books, there were only a few of the original characters left, and they were some of the least interesting to begin with.  How many times do we have to read through the same sermons from the exact same scriptures in Revelation?  How many times do they have to tell us about the almost affair that someone had back in Book 1?  There is nothing new and interesting in this book. The last book is just boring.    It would have been nice, at the end of the book, to wrap up everything.   Jesus comes back, and everyone should be reunited at the end after the battle is over, right?  Some of the characters that were important early in the books are either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all.  It was an incredible let down.  I felt like I had invested in these books only to see what life would be like for everyone after the battles are over.  Nothing.  We stick with that one main guy, and everyone else is left in the dust.  It should have had a really, really happy ending, but even that was boring.  If I had my time back, I would stick to the kid versions, if only to discuss theological issues with my children.  At least in the kid books, the sermons are shorter.  And I will know not to get my hopes up for happy reunions at the end of the series 
 Read "As Nature Made Him" by John Colapint 
 My six-year-old got this in her Easter basket.  She loves all kinds of art so we thought this would be something fun and different for her.   Not so.  The first page worked and she loved it, but the markers started to dry out very quickly.  By the time she got to the second page, the markers no longer worked well enough to dissolve the black coating.  My daughter colored over the same area about 100 times and still got only the faintest bit of the neon to show through.  She was very frustrated and heartbroken that her Easter present was such a dud.    I'd expect quality like this from RoseArt, but not from Crayola.  What a complete waste of money and time 
 i have no idea how this movie managed to garner the reviews it has.  that this has been as heralded as it has shows a serious lack of respect for the genre.  this is a movie that has high aspirations, but low standards, disappointing both the cinema connoisseur AND action geek within me.  i respect what this movie was trying to do.  it wanted to be a crime thriller with a twist of hong kong action.  i've got no problem with that, and in fact i've been waiting for a movie like that for years.  but the movie failed to execute this plan properly, borrowing the wrong aspects from each of its derivative genres and turning it into the poster child of movies cited as reasons why action cinema deserves no legitimate consideration.  the basic premise was to make a crime drama, but for the violent sequences to be choreographed into stylistic martial arts fighting.  the problem came when the filmmakers tried to mesh the two- they didn't know which elements to use from which genre.  the crime drama is filmed like an assembly-line fight movie, with a confusing jumble of flashbacks ruining the pretty opening shot: pulse-light clips of a criminal being released from prison with 'hard' music behind it, followed by a two-years-in-ten-seconds montage of a man adopting a little girl with 'drama' music behind it.  i was willing to forgive all this, because the acting is actually very good here, and i convinced myself that the explosion of violence i was anticipating would make everything worthwhile, sort of 'equilibrium' style.  now, i've got a straight-boy crush on donnie yen, his action is top-notch, but what he tried to do here was ruined by the directing/editing.  firstly, the fights are sped up SO MUCH that i had a hard time figuring out what was going on!  people ran into each other, became a blur of hands, then broke apart, one of them maybe holding a bloody nose or something.  this is unneccesary.  katsu shintaro taught me that you don't need to speed film up for a man to be lightning-fast on camera.  'oldboy' taught me that you don't need to speed film up to have a totally captivating hand-to hand fight.  this movie couldn't wrap up the fight scenes fast enough.  second, the fights broke into the ridiculous on occasion.  i don't like wires, i don't like cg, and i DON'T like movie scenes that look like they were drawn by a manga artist.  the guy in white who used a knife looked like he walked straight out of 'blade of the immortal' into this movie.  now, if that was the kind of movie i was watching, i wouldn't have had any problem with that.  but as mentioned, this movie was also trying to be a legitimate crime drama, so having skinny donnie yen THROW sammo hung over his head into a glass statue kind of tends to ruin any dramatic merit they may have earlier built up.  so, since the brush of action had already corrupted the dramatic template, i still would have forgiven the movie if the action had been good enough.  mind you, i'm thrilled and content to have one single fight scene in a movie, so long as it's well filmed and the rest of the movie is good enough to watch as well.  but this movie was filmed like an action movie, so i unconsciously came to expect there to be more action than i got.  the fights were few, fairly compacted together, and entirely too brief.  when they happened, i had no idea what had just occurred, only that two of the men who HAD been standing were now lying on the floor.  the ending was terrible, i'm sorry to say.  i like a good surprise, but not when it comes at the cost of surprising the screenwriter.  it's like everybody got up to that point and couldn't figure out how to arrive at the ending they wanted, so they resorted to one of those age-old comic book deceits that even hong kong cinema has left behind at this point.  i'm sorry.  i REALLY wanted to like this movie, and i tried to do so throughout the entire thing.  the credits were pretty, the opening and closing shots were actually beautifully filmed, the acting was better than the writing deserved, and the fights probably WERE pretty good, if you watched them in slow motion.  but my expectations were as high as the filmmaker's aspirations were- and my final impressions ended up as disappointingly low as the filmmaker's standards did.  'the protector', also available on dragon dynasty, is a much better martial arts movie, featuring possibly the first ever filmed battle between capoeira and muay thai styles.  'oldboy' is an exceptional crime drama, with legitimate film merit, that happens to have an amazing fight sequence somewhere in the middle.  'breaking news' is a hong kong treat that properly showcases how to have a thoughtful action movie.  there's better out there.  don't be fooled by great reviews or, as i was, by a drool-worthy trailer.  kill zone disappoints, which in itself is a disappointment.  i expected so much more from this line-up 
 This was a total waste of money, it's a real cheapo like something out of a cracker jack box. 
 if you are a scientific illiterate. Lubenow's assessment of the fossils doesn't even agree with other creationists. Hopefully, anyone interested in the topic will seek out some books by actual paleontologists and paleoanthropologists, and maybe even read an actual scientific paper or two. Lubenow has one ax to grind, his religion. It's not science 
 To Meister Brau's credit, at least it used to be $.25 a draw at O'Shea's in Las Vegas.  When you lost 99% of your coin, at least you could enjoy about 14 10 ounce cups of the stuff to make you feel a little better, even though it was one of the absolute worst beers ever brewed.  That is more enjoyment than anything in 'Beerfest'.  In fact, this might be the worst movie ever made.  The mark of being one of the worst movies ever made is when it's supposed to be a slapstick comedy and the muscles in your face don't work once over the course of 1 hour and 45 minutes.  There wasn't one laugh in this movie unless you like seeing actors who aren't funny try to steal Mike Myer's formula for making fun of German's on 'Sprockets'.  He had talent, these guys do not.  The plot is asinine, and the two lead actors are absolutely atrocious.  These guys never even drink any beer throughout the movie and then we're supposed to believe that they can compete with (and defeat) English, Scottish and German folks?    Place your six year old kid in front of the tellie and maybe they will find nearly two hours of people belching hilarious.  Maybe.  Pathetic feature 
 The authors of this slim volume have collected some charming old photographs of people with their dogs.  Identifying the subjects was nearly impossible, so while they sometimes had a date to go with the picture, they rarely had much more.  So, they paired the photographs with quotations from diaries and memoirs, seeking to more fully describe the meaning of the picture.  Unfortunately, and surprisingly for historians, the quotations are often from another time period.  I wish they had trusted the images to tell their own story.  I also wish there was some kind of informed presentation about human relationships with dogs over time.  Veterinary practices were much different at the turn of the century for example, and certainly impacted how animals were treated and regarded. The formatting of the pages is visually awkward, and sometimes the reproduction of the photograph could have been more skillful.  This is a cute coffee table presentation, but not much more.  
 I find it difficult to believe that any serious writer would feel comfortable using this overly simplistic approach to character development.  A character created from a mish-mash of bullet point-ed traits would be very flat...existing merely as a stereotype.  And I can't decide whether to be overjoyed or dismayed that librarians are not included (omitted perhaps to leave room for the 'careers' of "kept woman", "corporate wife", or "shadow mom").  Perhaps some "types" of people are already so stereotyped that Dr. Edelstein felt no need for inclusion.  Oh yes, and did I mention that use of eyedrops and incense is a sure sign that the character is a marijuana user?  Please 
 Criticizing the treatment women usually get from authors, Krull writes, "Traditionally, historians have talked most often about what powerful women looked like." Unfortunately, she then proceeds to share with us that Cleopatra wore pastel robes of filmy silk, Isabella took only two baths in her life, Elizabeth was a flirt, Catherine the Great rubbed her face with an ice cube, Marie Antoinette was passionate about feathered headdresses... Each chapter, about one woman of significance in history, is broken into the main section that gives very little insight into the woman's character or why the author considers her significant; the meatiest information is in smaller type at the end of a chapter, whimsically titled "Ever After." The author does take care to present women from more cultures than most authors do. But overall, I was disappointed in this book 
 I thought Lennon was supposed to be a genius.  If he was, it really doesn't show in this performance.  First, the CD is way too short -- is 11 songs the best they could do?  Second, he doesn't sing any of the songs, the entire time John screams the lyrics.  Atleast Elvis was kind enough to sing 'Hound Dog.'  It almost gives me a headache to listen to him screaming out all these songs.  As a matter of fact, the only song he doesn't scream on is 'Imagine.'  The third problem is the last song, 'Give Peace A Chance,' is SHORTENED!  The full song is 5 minutes, but on this album it fades out after 41 seconds.  For shame.  Thankfully, however, the complete song is available on the Imagine soundtrack.  Otherwise I wouldn't know what to do.  All in all, save your money and get the John Lennon Anthology 
      I think Mr.Williams touches upon a few very interesting topics. He has apparently read the works of several authors in his admirable quest to learn unusual,controversial points of view. However, with all due respect to the dignity and intelligence of this author,I must say that I have never in my life come across such a poorly written work as this. The entire book is plagued with an atrocious number of spelling errors, rambling thoughts, and poorly worded, gramatically incorrect sentences. I think, Mr Williams, with proper training, could develop the capacity to be a truly professional writer. His energy, motivation and apparently impeccable self esteem will truly be his greatest asset. I wish him all the luck in the world; but, in my opinion, this book should be viewed as an absolute disgrace by both author and publisher 
 I appreciate the historical significance of the Kabbalistic writings in this book, but I find it to be mis-titled, since it is dealing mostly with the conjuration the angels, and the only parts pertaining to daemons say to use to power of Jehovah or whatever to "caputure" the daemons and force them to do your bidding.  This is, obviously, a very bad idea.  Daemons do not appreciate such insult.  Secondly, it is ridiculous to dapple in both angels and daemons and again, a very bad idea.  
 This film is basically about drugs and killing. I did not really find a plot behind it. I did have a story but it was not a very strong one. I kind of like 50 Cent so I thought that it was going to be an ok movie. I was wrong. I do not hold the same respect for 50 cent that I have because I cannot beleive that he starred in such a meaningless film.  The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I did want to see what happened in the end, so I watched it and payed attention. Other than that, I hopefully will never see this film again. 
 Mr. Water's book is both ill-informed and near worthless.  He failed in his training as a clandestine officer, was rated below satisfactory (the lowest rating possible) in a number of his exercises and was not certified as an operations officer.  This is merely his way of making a few bucks 
 This book was horrible for what I expected.  Almost an entire chapter was dedicated to calculating BA, OBP, and SLG.  Come on!  The author felt the need to spend an entire chapter on his mind-numbing strategy for betting on baseball games.  Bet when you think the true odds on a team are less than the actual odds.  Wow, that's ground breaking stuff!  Also, bet against the teams that have a large following and you will get better odds.  Ya think?   
 This is but a short "add-on" to Timothy Kearney's excellent review of this book.  I found The Writer's Guide to Character Traits merely another textbook formula for creating wooden people.  Stereotypical.  Gives you nothing that would enable you to maximize these traits--qualify them for  inclusive fitness into your story.  At best, this book is good for (occasional) checklist purposes only.  Far and away, in my opinion, the most USEFUL book on characterization is Karen Hood's Creating Character Emotions.  #####  Before buying this book I would recommend reading Timothy Kearney's review. Re-read it. Then read it again.       
 I bought a couple of pair of these for my wife for "everyday" ear rings. The tiny stone fell out before she could wear one pair. The earring is so small it makes it difficult to get on. DO NOT BUY THESE. 
 If you enjoy a good, tightly plotted thriller -- read something else. This flabby, clunky and completely unbelievable story labors to its silly ending wheezing and gasping like an overweight commuter trying to catch the 8:45.  All of the characters are two dimensional and if you don't figure out the ending hundreds of pages before it arrives you are unconscious.       
 The most untalented producer in the business. Honestly the only tracks that shine is all the ones with Biggie and Black rob's only one hit. The rest of this is trash. Especially those chickenheads Total. And once again Puff tryin to eat off Biggie carcass. Dont give this bum anymore money, Just listen to Biggies two gems and "f" the rest 
 I've read all the previous Rita Mae Brown/Sneaky Pie Brown collaberations, so I was excited to see a new one at my local library.  Being a murder mystery fan and cat lover, I've truly enjoyed reading the series.  The best parts are the animals speaking (I love Pewter) and I have a special fondness for Mrs. Murphy because that's who I am (Mrs. Barbara Murphy).  I love Harry, and I don't mind that she's not at the post office anymore.  Her new adventures in grape growing and farming is who she really is--a country girl brought up on a farm.  But I have to say I also forced myself to keep reading this book assuming (hoping) that as I went further, the plot would get better.  I believe it took well over a 100 pages (or maybe it just seemed that long) to get to the "murder".  It also seemed that many of the "regular" characters were missing or barely mentioned especially Miranda, who is a big influence in Harry's life.  I think it was because of the way Ms. Brown went on and on about the biological terrorism, etc--it was like I was reading Time or Newsweek, not a fun, fictional murder mystery.  The winery settings and grape growing were interesting, but some of the conversations that took place between Fair and Harry, or Fair and BoomBoom about the diseases, etc. just didn't seem realistic.  As the story moved along, it did get a little easier to read, but I have to admit, for the first time, it was too obvious who did it and why.  I enjoyed the ending with all of the animals from the barn getting into the mix.  Well, I see another book is coming out early next year.  I'm still looking forward to reading it. 
 My wife purchased an HP Photosmart 8450 Printer as a Christmas present for me. I installed it and it worked perfectly for one week. Then the colors started to change. Photos had extreme amount of yellow in them, such as yellow faces and hands, no proper flesh tones.   I call HP support and was told that my printer was out of warranty because the warranty starts when the printer was manufactured, not the purchase date. I was offered one free call but my call was interrupted because of an appointment that I had. I was given a case number, but when I called HP back stating my case number, they said that this was no longer a free call. I explained it was an extension of the first call, but they refused to work with me.  I think HP warranty policy stinks, and would not purchase another HP product as long as this policy stands.  
 A fan of the Notebook, I was dissapointed to see that Sparks has hit cruise control. There we no surprises here, and the depth of the characters could be measured in centimeters - especially the doctor, who is very one dimentional. I think it wouldn't have taken him that much more time to flush out the story, but, well, he didn't.  It doesn't mean I won't keep reading him, I just hope that he gets  his bearings back. So far, the Notebook is still my favorite 
 1. The subject of this book is great! 2. The writing style is a bit wobbly at times. 3. The author jumps around and discusses way too many famous literary figures who have little or nothing to do with Mary Lamb's personal triumphs and failures. 4. Very little is actually told about Mary Lamb, who is supposed to be the featured character of this story! 5. The author inserts a lot of modernistic idealogy that would have been unknown to English men and women in 1795. 6. Gives a quick summary of a very complex woman.  7. Gives an even quicker summary of a very changing, difficult, and dramatic period of English history 
 A few years ago I spent nearly a year travelling around Australia, and returned curious about some of the strange things I had seen there.  I  asked for this book for my birthday because of the good reviews it had  received on Amazon.com.  However, when I finally got it none of my biggest  questions were addressed.  Previously, most of my knowledge of these  subjects came from reading the little natural history bits in my Lonely  Planet Guide or by watching certain T.V. documentaries. I wanted a source  of information that went beyond these and revealed some of the underlying  explanations and science involved. I wanted to know the origins of some of  the famous landforms such as the Bungle Bungle or Ayer's Rock.  I'd also  wanted to know what shaped the dry interior.  I heard it was the bottom of  a sea at one time.  What the book does talk about in the geology section is  the split up of Gondwana in multi-paged depth, and gives no more special  attention to Australia than other continents.  None of my questions were  addressed, and the facts listed were not interesting to me.  In the section  on animals the author gave no real overview on their origins, and just  listed a number of the most popular species and gave a little  characterization of each.  In many parts of the book I found that my  tourist's range of knowledge actually included some things the author  didn't mention, such as how aboriginal burning shaped the ecology.   Also,  it often seemed that the author did not thoroughly know his subject matter,  but was just quoting from one of his sources. Eventually I began to loose  confidence that this book was written by an expert on the natural history  of Australia and more by a publication-hopeful writer (this is my opinion  based on his bio)who compiled an incomplete list of facts from numerous  sources, some of which were pertinent, others more randomly picked. The  book read like one giant research paper where the student sits down with a  stack of books on his subject and quotes pieces verbatim from all of them.   It also reads like an almanac.  That said, this book does list a thousand  things previously unknown to me, just not exactly the things I was after 
 This item is advertised as boufant and oversized. It is anything but.... The shower cap is so tiny, it would fit on a grapefruit.This kind of false advertising is what discourages us from ordering on line 
 Once again I'm amazed at how the reviews were so highly in favor of this product.  These are terribly uncomfortable (for my ears) and don't really provide that great of listening experience. The frequency response seems muted until you use the largest possible "surrounds", and then they become distractingly uncomfortable.  But of course, this is just my experience, your mileage may vary, as they say.  Personally, I found my Apple iPod 'phones to be better 
 Bill Maher is as politically correct as they come. Our two party dictatorship allows only two points of view ranging from the loud mouthed, cowardly Rush "knows who butters his bread" Limbaugh to the communist "It takes a village crowd".     Even nutjobs like David Icke are a refreshing change from these clowns.     
 I do agree that books containing racist positions should not be given to children without a strong and fully aware comment. But I simply cannot stand to buy a sanitised version of a book without being aware of it. This is called censorship, and it gives me the creeps. As a parent, I have had enough real life opportunities to prove racism wrong to my children. So to realise that somebody has been cheating on me, trying to do my job so that I did not have to explain how society has evolved, how difficult it has been for minorities to be recognised and respected is just a fraud. this review is about the Harper collins Edition , edited by Patricia C. and Frederick L. McKissak, illustrated by Michael Hague 
 The usual anti tradition garbage. Little biography here more of a thesis of liberal pope=good pope traditional pope=evil pope. Bad biography, any real church historian knows John XXIII never wanted the garbage that happend after vatican II i.e. he never even wanted a mass in the vernacular. If you like real catholicism and beauty ( or for that matter are looking for a bio of John xxiii) then skip this book, If you want a book about why churches should continue to look like empty garages and homilies should be given by a butch nun about how we need to call jesus she then this ones for you 
 I bought these sheets in August of 2006, and after just a couple of washes and a few weeks on the bed, they pilled.  They're soft and the color goes really well with our color scheme, but unfortunately, they were extremely short-lived.  The 20 dollars spent on them should have gone into a better set of sheets 
 This is a well written book, however, I feel I should point out several issues I have with this book, which seems to follow the formula of the "modern teen problem novel".  This novel "explores difficult emotions" such as selfishness,jealousy, and alienation from God. All characters who are devoutly religious are portrayed as either uneducated or mean, and any "enlightened" characters or heroes are portrayed as not being religious.( Does anyone really know any Christians who go around , Bible-in-hand, accusing other women of "whoredom"?) And what modern teen "problem novel" would be complete without some sexual themes, and at least a brief discussion of menstruation ?  At the book's end, our main character chooses to continue in her career after the birth of first child. Parents should also be advised that Sara Louise's "coming of age" includes rejecting religion.( Although, to be fair, the book does not portray Sara as a happy person, but I think this subtlety will be lost on children.)  Judging by other reviews, most child readers did not pick up on the fact that Caroline was a much kinder and more likable person than Sara Louise.  An adult reader who is wise to the anti-religious bias may enjoy the book ( if they're not grossed out by the idea of a 14 year old having a crush on a 70 year old man). If you are looking for a book about a normal child, with normal child feelings, dealing with her "perfect" sister, read Little House on the Prairie and leave this book on the shelf. Appropriate reading for adults, who can understand the bias against religion, but not at all recommended for children. 
 I was a huge Prince fan when this movie came out and I remember how excited I was about it! So I took my girlfriend to it and was embarrassed for Prince and myself for dragging my girlfriend there. It was painfully unfunny, convoluted, poorly directed with terrible sets...ugh it's a terrible mess and doesn't deserve to be preserved 
 There are many different opinions about this book. I did read Hotel Paradise but don't remember reading Cold Flat Junction, so that may account for the reasons why I had a hard time getting into this book. I have read Grimes' other novels and numerous Jury books, and I like her style of writing. This book is just not up to par with the others 
 Since I am post-menopausal I thought I'd really enjoy this book -I ABSOLUTELY did NOT!  I found the main character exceptionally dull, and her friends sterotyped.  This book was more about her friend's problem and emails about grandchildren rather than a REAL mystery 
 Midway is our Navy's greatest victory, won against overwhelming odds and a battle-tested and hardened foe with superior aircraft. However Kernan considers our handling of the battle to be atrocious and holds many of the men who fought there and the Navy in disdain.  The press release states, "Alvin Kernan, who was present at the battle, has written a troubling but persuasive analysis of...aspects of this great battle, that it is a story of avoidable mistakes and flawed planning, revealing enormous failures". From this one would presume we lost at Midway.  The promotional material offers up he was there and he was there - as an enlisted flight crewman.      The underlying theme of the book is incompetence and it is implied the navy was made up of drunkards, buffoons or arrogant Academy types. Never mind that these same "buffoons" took on and defeated the greatest carrier force assembled in history and reversed the course of the war in the Pacific. Even worse is his carelessness with facts. The author states at Leyte Gulf the Japanese managed to get several escort carriers in their sights but were driven off.  This spurious treatment of facts ignores that TF Taffy 3 was comprised of 6 carriers, where one escort carrier, two destroyers and one destroyer escort were sunk in a desperate running gun battle. He states the Yamoto had 18 inch guns when they were 18.1" as well as getting the Yamoto's weight wrong by thousand of tons.  If you can't get the easy facts correct, it casts doubts on your credibility.   It is too bad for there are some superior areas like his analysis of the flawed carriers constructed due to holding down costs with the Depression.  This same construction would prove to be a fatal flaw. His analysis of the flaws of the Mark 13 torpedo and torpedo doctrine are telling. He misses the point why the Navy did not do more practice with the torpedoes since budgets were so tight because of the Great Depression.   The American Navy knew after the Coral Sea that the TBD was outclassed by the Japanese Zero.  The author does not grasp that you often go to war with what you got - such as us having unarmored HMMWV's for Iraq. When he complains of our doctrine that led to the slaughter of the torpedo squadrons, he implies Japanese tactics were better.  Kido Butai (their carrier strike force)  doctrine was launch a simultaneous strike from all carriers (mass) that was to arrive simultaneously.  Good in use of the principle of mass but inflexible and took longer to launch a strike - that led to their destruction at Midway. The friction of war caused our strike to go awry.    With an editor and a military historian to look at his writing and assertions with a critical eye, this could have been a great addition.  As it is, the book offers some interesting insights in training and the torpedo squadrons specifically but promises more than it delivers.  
 Not the best compulation I would have come up with. Only had one or two songs on it that I liked. But oh well Its in my collection now. Maybe it will grow on me later 
 This book reminded me why there are certain authors I refuse to read because of their lack of respect for the craft and art of writing. Gonzalez has been added to my list.  Can you say "redundant?" The author flips back and forth on different pages covering the same ground as before, leaving one wondering if the author is in the moment or in the past. Distracting, to say the least.  Can you say "cardboard characters?" I must admit Diana was well-developed, but the rest of the characters, even the main ones, were hardly more than a name. There didn't seem to be much, if any, characterization to give one a sense of who they really were and have the reader empathize with them.   Can you say "too many people" crowding the plot? Characters appear and disappear at the turn of a page, leaving you scratching your head as to why they showed up to begin with. Two of the characters even had the same name. Relatives appear out of the woodwork: cousins, in-laws, nephews, nieces, grandparents, children - in short, all the furthest reaches of blood and marital relations.  The action is slow, especially when wading through toward the end. Just like a horror movie on TV, some of the most important characters do really stupid things, jeopardizing not only their lives but the lives of others. Other elements of the plot are unlikely - like the mysterious stranger who shows up to explain everything.  The only reason I gave this book 1 star is that the paper it was written on must be worth at least that much 
 I'm a pediatrician and have seen most of the physical and behavioral consequences of corporal punishment, many terrible and long-lasting.  There is never, ever, a need to strike an animal or a child.  Rather, the approach called "Inductive Discipline" is far more effective.  Discipline is not synonymous with punishment, and the approach takes note of the common word root (disciple) and the priority of maintaining, not disrupting, the loving relationship.  I've summarized this approach and discussed the downsides of spanking in the following chapter from my book on raising boys, "The Men They Will Become." (...)   
 Kate Moss?  That gawddamn rollerskate song?  Oh, no.  The spoken tracks are equally repelling.  There is really no atmosphere to this album 
 I love very short stories, but found Micro Fiction a disappointment.  Most of the stories were too abstract for me; stories not having a clear story line and some seeming to ramble on without much intent nor a conclusion.    The editor must have found stories like these of interest to place so many together in one book.    Other very short story book selections I've enjoyed are:  1) "The World's Shortest Stories of Love and Death: Passion, Betrayal, Suspicion, Revenge, All This and More in a New Collection of Amazing Short Stories-Each One Just 55 Words Long" edited by Steve Moss;   2) a second 55-word story book edited by Steve Moss;   3)"Flash Fiction: Very Short Stories" longer than the Micro Fictions selections, but less abstract 4) Many of the Barnes and Noble short story book selections. 
 The book is entertaining, and as long as you already know the correct use of the English language, you might enjoy the read. The author presents us with a self assured "I am right, and PLBPLBLB on those who may disagree..." type of attitude, which would be OK if only the author was correct. But the book is full of errors and opinions, along with correct and accurate information. So, if you can sort it out yourself, you're all set. Otherwise, I'd find some more qualified authors work to base my education on 
 This book is offensive and you can tweak and make up numbers all you want. African-Americans have a strong tradition of passing on oral history to their children. We know the truth and our truth does not have to be  validated by anyone. Further, de facto slavery continued well after the  civil war through the use of Jim Crow, where black women were still forced  to work like slaves and were sexually exploited. We know this because our  grandmothers told us stories about being maids and nurses for white folks.  We have an up close and personal view of white folks and your revisionist  theories are not going to wipe these memories away. If you want evidence of  exploitation, just look at our skin color. We didn't get so many mulattos  and quadroons through artificial insemination. A lot of "white  folks" are mixed and they don't even know it. The ignorance in this  country is simply astounding. One can only hope that this ignorance is not  passed on to young children. I would assume that this author also believes  that that the holocaust didn't exist; the jewish survivors are just making  up a bunch of stuff. I guess being in a gas chamber and providing slave  labor was good for Germany's economy, so hey that makes it o.k., right 
 Ok, let me first say I DID (cannot believe I am admitting this) buy this cd.  For ONE reason..."superman" has got a SWEET bassline.  THAT'S IT.  Eminem is a washed up clown, who happens to have become famous maybe for his ability to "rap" but mostly because of his skin color and contraversial lyrics.  How on God's green earth do we go from Manson to this guy.  Not saying Manson is any better lyrically.  But MUSICALLY.  Screw rap.  How much talent do you need to rhythmically talk in front of a loop.  Instead of buying this crap and possibly dreaming of following in his embarassing footsteps, do yourself a favor and the future of music a favor and buy a guitar and WRITE yourself a song that consists of a MELODY.  Or if you want music with intense emotion that ties into every human's instincts SCREAM in front of seething guitar riffs.  Because how many of us really care about mono-tone stupid G content. I'm not a gangst"a" and 99.99% of the mainstream isn't either. So stop lying.  Music has sucked since Eminem was even remotely compared to Kurt Cobain.  Artistically, no freakin' contest.  Children are getting more stupid.  As is the mainstream.  Please God send us our next meaningful BAND.  NOT MC.....A BAND.....that writes and performs music we can mosh to.  Or for musicians like myself have to put forth effort and time practicing in order to play. I cannot wait till the time comes when rap now is like 80's glam rock because THAT DAY WILL COME.  You watch.  Holy crap it's worse now though.  This music doesn't even require you to play an instrument or have a godly voice.  EVERYONE CAN DO IT!  yeah, that's talent. Maybe that's what people want in their lack of intelligence and ability this day and age. God help us all.   P.S. MTV "sells" us trends all the time.  Rap and eminem are very fashionable music items.  Not to mention all the gold around everyone's neck.  The american dream of money 24 hours a day but the only difference is it's them not you, stop paying these con artists.  That's right CON-artists........not artists 
 Knowing Gods word and that he changes not for our sakes I really really felt that this book at some point can be very misleading against Gods word even against Jesus teachings and instructions which he laid for us all saved or not yet as of saved Jesus love teaches that God loves everyone and that he pleads with us to come to him with our problems and give him our short comings and ask him for forgiveness when we sin against our own souls and against the father however this book Echoes of the souls states that if you don't get it right the first time in this life then guess what you can take care of it in the next life time as if God has granted us not just 9 lives but several which is totally against Gods word the Bible Say's that it has been appointed once for man to die. THE FATHER also lets thoes who hear his voice and even those who disobey his voice know right off that he sends false Prophets / Psychics  to test our love and loyalty to him please read Deuteronomy 13.( I AM NOT CALLING THE WRITTER A FALSE ANYTHING I JUST DO NOT AGREE WITH THE THINGS SHE WROTE) The Bible also says to test the spirit weather if it is actually from God or Not,  The thought of believeing in a reward for good behaviour is one thing we should all hope for but the thought of being rewarded with Good for hatred behaviour and murder, and sexual immorality and child molestation, Pediphila,adultry, Satanism etc . .  ROMANS 1:22 - 32 without true repentance and forgiveness is rediculous the book suggest that you will receive as many lives as you need in order to complete what is already been put inside of each soul sence the worlds ever exsisted  COMMON COURTESY AND RESPECT FOR ONE ANOTHER AND LOVE AND NOT TO LEAVE THIS EARTH WITHOUT KNOWING AND ACCEPTING THE TRUE SACRAFICE FOR OUR SINS WHICH IS JESUS OUR LORD, SAVIOUR, AND OUR BROTHER   The Bible says there are vessels of good and vessels of evil and vessels that God created for destruction How do you get your people to repent ? Make an example out of thoes who would not listen to you HELL IS REAL and you have but one chance to get it right he is God and he can do whatever he feels will get his point a cross for those who hvae embraced this book and live life FAST and Corrupt and IMMORAL and do not believe in a Hell this scripture is for you LUKE 16:19 this man begged to have a second chance just to atleast go back and warn his brothers which was not granted to him he went to HELL Period and was able to see paradise from HELL which made his torment worse.  For thoes who believe in a heaven and a Hell but fully agree with the contents of this book this scripture is for you GALATIONS 1:6 - 9  For thoes who are strongly wondering why would God or Jesus allow such revelations from this book these scriptures are for you DEUTORONOMY 13:1 -  and LUKE 22:31 Satan has the right to test your loyalty to the Father God to see if you are a child of God or of something else in nature. If you are a child of God you will make mistakes on a dailey basis trust me but you will also grow and learn and excel above your mistake and will have your sins forgiven in Jesus name and will be called a Child of God  This book attempts to explain Homosexuality and lesbianism as follows  A Boy soul can end up in a Female Human body and a female soul can end up in a boy human body   I look at it this way either you believe in God or you Do not GOD DOESNT MAKE MISTAKES LIKE THAT HE IS PERFECT IN EVERY WAY  HE CREATED THE SOUL AND GAVE IT A BODY AND THE SOUL AND BODY A LIVING SPIRIT and given FREE WILL The best gift of love God gives all of his Children is the will to love him or reject him this is the right to choose  Now I am not saying that a young man cannot develope at some point more female traits in him then male I must go back to genetic with this one which is the fact that during ovulation there are 2 eggs released in a womans body not one remember in the Bible ADAM saw that each beast had a mate and after realizing that God put him to sleep and created WOMAN in so doing I believe that the woman of those days to quickly populate the earth had the ability to produce in every birth TWINS  In the situation of a man having more female traits then Male is simple in a single birth the contents of the second child in early stages of uteral in some cases are consumed in the 1st childs genetic code therefore the child is left feeling more female then male and grows up being put down for it NOT THE CHILDS FAULT AT ALL But here is a SCRIPTURE EVEN FOR YOU  EXODUS 15:25  HEAVEN IS A PREPARED PLACE FOR A PREPARED PEOPLE.  And with that said I leave this  Romans 12:1 - 
 I made it though Chapter 2 before I gave up.  The story is dull and the writing is BAD 
 This is a "sweet" book that is very reassuring  and interesting to read if you don't have anything better to do.   But as a mom, who has time for this?   Don't we all look up things in a state of diress, hoping to find concrete useful information delivered rapidly in the least words possible? Well, you won't find that here.   This book is full of very nonspecific, sometimes outdated information delivered in a very wordy style. The whole book is written in long paragraphs.  There are very few tables or charts.  IT's VERY wordy.   Just to give you an example, I looked up Fluoride supplementation. It addresses the topic using nearly a FULL page, but never tells you the actual amount your baby should have depending on his age! More concise and concrete information is available in pediatrician Dr. Ari Brown's "Baby 411"!  I gave this book one star because aside from being too general, some of the information in it is outdated, or in the category of "old wives tales" ! Save your money and skip the "what to expect" book 
 This comeback was a big letdown.  I was really exited for Curt's return, and was hoping for some revolutionary music from T4F...Like "the Hurting" or "Songs from the Big Chair"...but instead i was really disappointed, as this disc of songs are quality songs... but they are so much like Beatles songs that I cannot tell if it is an homage/tribute, or just lack of original ideas (or fear of them).    This is a CD that does not compare with their early discs style and originality.  "Everybody Loves a Happy Ending" is like the song "Sowing the Seeds of Love", but more extreme in it's imitation of the Beatles style/sound.    It wasn't a happy ending 
 Jung wasn't known to be strong on developmental theory, and he proves it in this collection.  Sparks of illumination but not much developmental meat to the book 
 ok 1st off this collection & Best of Vol 2 are a jip HOW IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT'S FUNKY CAN YOU HAVE A BAR-KAYS HITS W/O SOUL FINGER????  Answer this to me please? All the songs on vol 1 & 2 Hits packages are awesome & the only way i could give this or Vol 2 5 stars is with Soul Finger.  That is like having a Skynyrd Hits w/o the 2 REDNECK ANTHEMS on there Sweet Home Alabama & FreeBird  what a shaft!!! 
 This is a curious book. To start with, it is short. Without the Notes section, it is about 220 pages. There is no index or photographs or illustrations. The text has the feel of a random selection of magazine articles thrown together. There is an attempt to hold the whole thing together with the author's own personal observations of rats in an alley in lower Manhattan, but the author tends to spend more time discussing what he was wearing or drinking than about the actual rats in the alley. I am fairly certain that you could rearrange many of the chapters in virtually any order and the book would not significantly change. The writing style is occasionally humorous but for the most part seems like an attempt to be erudite rather than an actual success.  As to what you will actually learn about rats, there is very little here. You will learn more by going to Wikipedia, and the writing there is no worse. Many of his "facts" are prefaced by, "According to one study...", "By one estimate...", "One rat expert theorizes...". This might not be too bad if the source of these "facts" were cited but they aren't so there is no way to verify any of the information provided. And when an author is making fairly outrageous claims such as that one-third of the world's food supply is eaten by rats, the reader would like some support other than just the author's word. Also, the author tells us early on that there are only about 400,000 rats in New York but then he interviews an "expert" that he admires who tells us that there are millions of rats living deep under the city who never come to the surface. Is there any support for this? Is it 400,000 or millions? And even when he gets his facts right he gets them wrong. For example, the author writes about the rats link to the Black Death but fails to note that the Brown rat that is in the city is not the rat that carries plague and in fact, probably can't carry plague. The rat of the Black Death was the Black Rat which is not the rat the author is writing about.  Which brings up the side trips on the journey. Almost anyone in New York who has something to do with rats is a potential target for a chapter. Many of these people are not the least bit interesting and the claims they make are unsupported by any evidence but the author simply reports them as fact. His writing fails to cover any subject in any depth. He writes a chapter about John DeLury, for example, who was the head of the sanitation worker's union in the 1970's with very little detail beyond what you would expect in a typical obituary. And then he ends the short chapter with excitement that a friend of a friend is a grandson of DeLury. Ho-hum. He tries to interview people who might remember so-and-so who had some remote link to rats years ago but the interviews go nowhere. A typical response he gets is, "I didn't know him personally but I understand that people spoke highly of him." Excuse me? Why is this even worth writing down? Is the author that desperate to pad his book?  Overall the book does not educate the reader about rats, does not provide much in the way of historical detail, and barely entertains. I would not recommend that anyone waste their time on it. 
 This is a post-modern waste. Full of catchy and titillating drivel that goes in circles until it feels like you, not John Self, are the one with the hangover. Might have made a good short story; instead we've got this bloated thing.  The reviewers who say this captures the spirit of the Reagan/Thatcher era read the blurb on the back cover if nothing else. There is nothing in this book that remotely resembles a depiction or criticism of 80s culture. The book isn't even about money (though Amis tries to make it so by inserting the word as much as possible, often without any sensibility) or greed or culture or society. It is about a very boring man who drinks constantly. Crude does not equal interesting.  Shameless post-modern cliches and neo-beatnik romanticism of excess drug use...for nearly 300 tedious pages. Read Pynchon instead 
 I have to admit that my wife read this book first and said it was slow.  She didn't say how slow though.  But rather than take her word for it (why should I?  After all, she's my wife) I bothered to pick it up and read it.  How I wish I had listened to her and left it in the box of stuff for the rummage sale.  I cannot stand Baldacci's juvenile charactor dialog, but finish it I did though most of it I could have read through closed eyes and not missed anything.  I'll stick with my Nelson DeMille from here on if I want literary junk food 
 In desperate need of a light read and curious about the multi-author approach used with this novel, I dove into "Naked Came The Manatee" with anticipation of the fun and excitement typical of Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiassen writing.  The story unravels the mystery behind two heads, both with a great similarity to Fidel Castro that are lost in transport from Florida to Cuba.  Each of the thirteen authors writes a chapter of the novel, with Hiassen and Leonard attempting to pull the story together in the final chapters.  The characters are odd and criminally inept as most characters in Hiassen's and Leonard's writing but the story is underdeveloped and lacks the immediacy of a great crime mystery.  If you have nothing else to read and this book happens to be within reach give it a try. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed 
 After reading all of the reviews on Hoopi Shoopi Donna, I figured it would be a quick and easy read (since so many everyday people had seemed to enjoy it).  Unfortunately, my hypothesis was quickly proven wrong after only two chapters.  The book was slow moving and incredibly frustrating.  Reading the book took so long that I found myself constantly falling asleep midsentence.  Not only that, but when I rarely was able to stay awake, I often found myelf having to go back and reread entire pages to understand what I had just read.  The Polish words and traditions offered help, while the impossible circumstances and events crushed the books believablity, and the author's credibility.      If this book hadn't been chosen by my group to read for my high school Comtemporary Literature class, there is no way that I would have finished it.  The book was frustrating and the characters caused me to hate the book even more than the slow pace.  Their actions and reasoning were so unbelievably frustrating that it made reading the book feel more like a chore than a choice.  After finally finishing Hoopi Shoopi Donna, I came to the conclusion that I will NOT be recommending this book to anyone unless they've been having trouble at night, and are looking for a guaranteed sleep aid 
 I was wondering why you have asked me to review this particular book, since you sent me notice that you had to cancel this order?   At first you said it was cancelled because I did not respond to say that a delay was OK.  I explained to you what had occured.  Then, you said you had to cancel it because the book was out of print.  I am not at all upset with you--you continue to provide such considerate customer service!  But, I guess I was really hoping that this book had turned up somehow, and that you had or would be sending it to me!  Oh please!  Oh please!  I would appreciate hearing from you about this.  Thank you,  Peggy  Wisema 
 I TOTALLY agree with "A Reader" that posted on January 10, 2004... titled." What Would Sue Monk Kidd Do?" This reviewer captured my thoughts exactly. WHY would anyone want to read a spiritual book written by a woman who abandoned her Christianity? Please! This author has one book that is good..."The Secret Life of Bees," and it's fiction! Stick with fiction, Ms. Kidd. You seem to do it in your own spiritual life, so writing it should be simple. 
 have you ever thought of the fact that after the first few weeks or months, babies NEED a good nights sleep as much as their parents?  children dont like to go to bed, but they need to anyway.  Anything a mom can do to incourage a good nights sleep in the longrun is not a "selfish mom" but an effective one 
 I made the mistake of purchasing the 4 handset version of this product before looking at any reviews.  I thought Uniden produced quality products, but man was I wrong.    First of all, 20 hours to charge seems like a very long time.    Second, only one handset can be used at a time; so my wife and I can't talk simultaneously to someone on the other end.  Disappointing, especially during the holidays when we are trying to talk with our families.  Third, calls must be transferred from one handset to another handset for use.  So If I answer a call for my wife, I need to know the handset number of the phone she is going to use before she can pick up.  Unfortunately, there is no way to know what handset she has, unless its plugged in to its charger, making the remote feature of this phone useless.  Keeping track of four interchangeable units is a tall task, unless I write the handset number on each phone with a Sharpie.  I haven't had any problems with static as reported below, but I never took the remote far from the base unit.  At least the phone has a call timer, so I could track the 23 minutes and 47 secs Uniden's customer service took to answer my call. . . .   Anyway, this poorly designed and engineered product is already back in its packaging, heading back to where it came 
 I first picked up on the Anita Blake series a little over a year ago. I was absolutely enthralled. Not only was the main character witty, intelligent, and kick-butt, but there was a memorable set of supporting characters to see her through. Who can forget Zerbrowski's antics (even in the worst of times) or the cold-hearted killing of everyone's favorite bounty hunter? After reading my share of the books and floating around to some of the other reviews here on Amazon, I am left wondering the same thing many of the other fans are: what happened?  I just finished Narcissus in Chains. Normally when I finish a book, I'm left with a sense of fulfillment, like I've accomplished something. Unfortunately, that was not the case. I've always found this series to capture me from the get-go, but trying to convince myself to read this one was hard. Not only was the plot rather weak, but Anita seemed to keep on debating the same situations over and over. Jean-Claude, Richard, Micah, and even Asher seem to plague her thoughts. And although she will do anything to save a member of her pard, or anyone else for that matter, her focus always seemed to drift back to the boys. And did anyone else notice the repetitiveness in the writing? Hamilton used the exact same wording for certain feelings or actions throughout the book. Unlike the earlier part of the series, the writing in Narcissus in Chains is less imaginative and less memorable. On top of it all, come the end of the book, we have this bad guy who I can't even remember where he came from in the first place!  My favorite part of the books has always been Anita's police work. I am honestly ten times more interested in her career than I am in her love life. I miss having a tight, intense plot that flows, instead of drifting around like some kid with a short attention span. And as pointed out in the book, the charming Anita Blake we used to know and love really has become a monster. A literary disaster of a monster.  Although the reviews for Cerulean Sins are probably just as grim as the reviews for Narcissus in Chains, I plan to go ahead and continue the series. I can't give up on something that has such great potential, and from the sound of it, this next one has a more recognizable plot. I can only hope. Unfortunately, I believe that Obsidian Butterfly was probably the last of one of the best series and best characters ever created 
 My credit card was charged $97.89 on Feb 3.  No book ever arrived.  I can't believe that the correct price is that high for one single book.Please advise 
 Jesus, I'm not sure that they could have picked a worse cast for this terrible movie.  The only redeeming thing about it, was Mia Kirshner who gave an amazing performance as elizabeth short.  But besides her I the story was windy and contrived, too many characters and nit enough convincing acting to really pay attention too closely to.  Mia Kirshner is the only reason this movie gets two stars from me.    
 This movie was awful. The main reason was, it is just too unrealistic. You have "angels" played by people like scatman crothers and Charles Durning as well as the Devil played by the now later Oliver Reed coiming into the middle of the scenes and "fast forwarding" and "freezing".......just not realistic at all. Plus you have travolta as an inventor. Edible sunglasses? Yes I know not all movies have to be 100% realistic but this movie just goes too far. I watched it because Grease was such a great movie but this movie just is pathetic, even compared to an average movie, let alone Grease.  On the bright side however, the theme song "twist of fate" is one of the best songs of all time and the video is equally awesome. I think I may have just bought the movie to hear the theme song 
 I don't have academic training on philosophy argument and thus the book becomes a long and winding essay that is difficult to grasp.  You can read the first chapter from http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/titles/7749.html and see if this is the kind of books you would like 
 I bought this coffeemaker as replacement for my Starbucks model that I accidentaly damaged. Unit stop working after a month. Quality and taste of coffee could not compare with my Starbucks machine which unfortunately is discontinued (I am not sure who built coffe maker for them, now they sell Kitchen Aid and Delonghi) I took my coffeemaker to local authorized repair shop. They told me that this is nonrepairable model and that I will receive replacement in 4 weeks, I even had to pay $12.50 for shipping. Its been more than 8 weeks, deLonghi customer service will not deal with customer and repair shop told me they are out of stock and there is nothing thay can do about it. Most of electronics stores have 30 days return/exchange policy and if your unit fail within this period, return it and buy something else. I did not do my homework since I did not consider coffemaker purchase to be major one but after reading horrible reviews about this product I would like to warn future customer of making same mistake 
 The book is good & inspiring BUT I found too many grammar mistakes & misspelled words (which makes me wonder... was it ever revised or read???) That is why I ranked it low -- how can you publish a book with sooooo many mistakes??? 
 Wow. I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but somehow my negative review just disappeared from this page. Perhaps the book was not selling enough. What's up with that, Amazon? I really didn't like the book and the review didn't contain anything inappropriate. In an attempt to reconstruct the review...I thought that the book lacked an audience. There was not remotely enough detail for a regular reader of popular science books. The single chapter on entanglement in Brian Greene's "Fabric of the Cosmos" was much more enlightening than this entire book. I also don't see how a beginner would get anything out of this book. Too many things were just glossed over. Despite the dearth of detail about the main topic, the author saw fit to pad it with descriptions of Cantor's work, which is covered in many other books, including one of Mr. Clegg's. When referring to the uncountability of irrationals, he refers to them as "decimal fractions" and at one point, misleadingly, as simply "fractions", which are of course rational and countable. The book is a perfect example of the trend toward small, rapidly and inexpensively produced 250-page popular science books. Mr. Clegg is not a practicing scientist. He appears to be more of an entrepreneur and this shows in the quality of the book. I think my original review might have been pulled because I mentioned that I felt cheated because I bought the book on the 5-star recommendation of a particular UK popular science website, which appears to be an objective book review site. I found out that this site, which heavily pushes Mr. Clegg's books (he is always the featured author), appears to be controlled by him. He gives all of his books very high ratings of course. This seems incredibly deceptive to me. He has recently changed "featured author" to featured author/editor", though, perhaps in response to my original review. The web site is mentioned at the front of this book. So Amazon, in pulling the one bad review for this book (I've read about 100 popular science books in the past few years) left only the good reviews, including the first few 5-star reviews which are quite obviously planted by concerned parties. This seems deceptive also. Put your money into books that are a bit more substantial and took a bit more effort to write. BTW, the title is an unoriginal ripoff of Leon Lederman's wonderful "The God Particle". Mr. Clegg's book is a mediocre book about one of the most interesting (possibly the most interesting) phenomena in science. If this book had been written by Simon Singh, it would have been a winner 
 Rosalie is a member of the "First Borns" a theater troupe of mostly ivy league-educated 20-somethings including aspiring director, Evan; gifted actor (and Rosalie's sometimes lover) Cam; heiress Belle; and the good girl-bad boy coupling of Grace and Jake.  As preparations begin to rehearse a play by an Irish playwright, Declan Pearse, Rosalie enters into an affair with Belle's father, Berglan Starker. He wines and dines her in all the finest restaurants and hotels. I can certainly appreciate a nice May-December romance, but there is absolutely no chemistry between the two. It is more of a father-daughter relationship, particularly in the way they communicate. Of course, Rosalie is falling for her old man. He senses this, and ends the relationship.  Declan deduces that Berglan is her paramour. On a trip back from Boston, they meet up on the train and get to know each other better, finding out that Declan has a fiance back in Dublin. She is not sure how to take this news. When Fiona comes to NY for a visit, Rosalie wants to dislike her, but cannot seem to.   I have mixed feelings about this book. I liked the premise of the story, but I thought that the actual characters lacked depth; I got no real sense for their motivations, and the only one that was remotely interesting was Declan. I had a really hard time sticking with it. I found the advice letters that preceded each chapter to be annoying, and finally started to skip them altogether. Even the ending was less than satisfying.   The fact that this drivel was even published reeks of nepotism. 
 This is an excellent story well told in script and action. However, it is quite different from the version I saw on a big theater screen. This DVD has speeded up the action  and the English translation dialogue is presented in such rapid changes that it is virtually impossible to read and follow the dialogue. I was very disapointed in this DVD version and would not recommend it to friends 
 I was disappointed in the quality of the recording. The needle noise in the recording was more prevalent than on a c.d. that I had burned from an old vinyl record 
 People who enjoy this book seem to characterize it as an original work of sci-fi/fantasy and a thought-provoking exploration of insanity, which interests me very much.  However, I found this book to be neither original nor an adequate account of someone's "descent" into or recovery from madness.  The premise is intriguing enough as the novel begins, gradually revealing the story of an amnesiac/schizophrenic patient being admitted to a psych ward, who turns out to be a professor at Cambridge.  Immediately, the reader is thrown into 50 pages or so of stream of conciousness ramblings that were quite frankly difficult to trudge through.  This put a bad taste in my mouth, possibly tainting the rest of the book for me.  The remainder really wasn't terribly interesting; I found Lessing's writing style to be excruciatingly boring and lacking any sort of insight.  Other reviews of this book tend to fall to the extremes of loving it or hating it; I guess that means I hated it.  So maybe I just didn't "get" it...personally, I don't think there was anything to "get".  
 Overly flowery and melodramatic language predominate in this novel about a dysfunctional family in South Carolina, yet the subject itself, physical and emotional abuse within the family, is poorly explored.  The characters are one-dimensional and inconsistent.  The plot is not very well developed with a number of gaping holes the reader is expected to believe will be understood later, a later that doesn't somehow come, while some preposterous situations are given many pages of romanticized nonsense to fill in the gaps.  I can't imagine where all the good reviews come from because I found this to be a boring and pointless read.  The dreadful ending just caps it all off.  A real waste of time 
 I bought this book because I'd read and enjoyed some of Alexandra Robbins' others.  But man, was this one boring.  Slow moving.  Repetitive.  You get the picture.  I couldn't even finish it.  Of course, for a book airing the views of twentysomethings, I guess I shouldn't have been expecting dazzling insights or anything.  As an age group, judging from this book, it appears we don't really have much to say for ourselves, sigh.  The sorority one and the Yale secret society one were much more interesting 
 If you've ever seen the great movie (Thirteenth Warrior) that was based on this book, "Eaters of the Dead" will just not measure up. Maybe the structure of the book was the problem. Crichton wrote it in the style of an medieval manuscript to try to convey the authenticity of an actual 1000 year old document. Maybe he was too successful with that conceit. It was usually the aim of medieval chroniclers to present the dry facts of an event rather than to strive for dramatic tension, character development or an elevated literary style. Unfortunately, those qualities are necessary in a novel.  This was mostly a bore. Don't bother 
 I may be alone on this boat, but my thoughts on this book are more on the negative side than positive. Although the story presented traits of originality, human flaw and truth, I couldn't help but think it was all too predictable. One could imagine what would happen from the first mention of an experimentation that would increase a person's IQ incredibly. Like that saying, "What goes up must come down." right? I found Charlie's efforts of finding an answer to what was going to happen to him next were stretched and unrealistic.  All in all, ignoring the predictability, this a phenomenal example of realization, "coming of age", and loss of innocence. Charlie's yearning for intellect slowly turns into yearning for emotional maturity as his IQ raises. He notices that with his new intellect, people started treating him differently. He realizes that the world wasn't as nice and comforting as he thought it was  before 
 This book reveals the ideology behind new American unilateralism and the philosphy that underpins the Bush doctrine;  "Might is right" or machtpolitik.  Kagan's (sometimes sneering) analysis of the European world view is a simplistic one.  He contends that Europe favours diplomacy and international channels before military action not because that might be a altogether preferable way of conducting diplomacy, but rather because Europe is militarily weak.  Kagan assures us that, if the EU had the muscle of the USA, it would be as quick to dismiss internationalism and embrace a more militaristic and unilateralist foriegn policy, just like the USA does today.    In otherwords, European objections to the Iraq invasion were due, not over concern at the motivation for it and the shoddiness (now laid bare for all) of the intelligence that supported it, but simply that the EU doesn't have the military might to conduct such operations.  The benefit of hindsight illustrates how preposterous and, well, wrong, this idea is.  This is the central and oft repeated tenet of the book.  It would seem to me that the target audience for this book seems very much to be readers who already agree with current US policy.  The arguments are facile, hollow and repitious.  I cannot imagine it convincing anyone, not already of Kagan's persuasion.  Kagan refers to "Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction" as a pretext for military action with the same assured certainty with which he talks about how the EU is living in a fantasy paradise secured by American power.    Looking to the future he sees only decline for the EU as a power and continued dominance for the USA.  It is a measure of how flimsy some of the arguments in this book are that he fails at this point to even mention the gargantuan and record-smashing  defecits the USA is currently running as the Military Industrial complex gorges itself once again on taxpayer money.  It's a very short book, but gave me a better understanding of the dangerous views that are shaping the policies of the current administration 
 Touching in parts, but I thought only character that was close to being well done was the little boy/protagonist; others were too sketchy or incomplete, although author tried but just didn't get there. You knew people were in pain, but it was like you could only observe them through a window, not reach out and touch them...Perhaps not my cup of tea. Any 9/11 novel deserves a better effort than this... 
 I thought this would be a list of adult grahic novels, like those of Harvey Pekar.  A few were, but many were for children or comic book collectors.  I do not think some of them really qualify as graphic novels.  From the term "your library" I understood my own personal library, but seems it is for public librarians serving a mixed public. Fine, but I did not see that in the editorial description 
 I decided that I had to write a review about Newsweek this morning, after I came across yet another biased, over-hyped cover story. This particular one is entitled, "Rethinking the Marriage Crunch," and goes back on everything they presented 20 years ago about a woman's chances of getting married later in life. This was undoubtedly very easy for them to do as they probably had no evidence for their assertion the first time around, and neglected to have any on this occasion. I really think another reviewer's comparison to People is quite apt, but Newsweek also provides a reliably pro-sexual revolution and pro-sixties counter-culture take on almost every issue. Two years ago, we were made privy to another bit of front page sensationalism concerning "Infidelity Chic." Yes, it seems, according to their sources, spousal cheating is all the rage even though they argue, without even a hint of contradiction, that everybody still wants to get married as much as ever before. I find the magazine to be [...] as they offer opinion instead of news; theirs is a mission of persuasion. Overall, there is little of which to recommend this publication as it is geared for a readership of trivial people who possess the depth of a kiddy pool. 
 "Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West" is a history of that villain we all love to hate from the L. Frank Baum children's classic, The Wizard of Oz. I hate to write a completely negative review, so I'll start with something good. I finished it. Even that is not saying so much, since I rarely abandon a book in mid-read.  My most lasting impression of Wicked is that it just doesn't fit with the characters as I know them. In this book the Wizard is a corrupt tyrant; the Wicked Witch of the East is an (admittedly disliked) political leader and religious influence in Munchkinland; Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, cares more about fashion and society than true good works; and the central character, the Wicked Witch of the West, is not really wicked, nor is she technically even a witch, though she is still decidedly green. The lengthy philosophical discussions of politics, religion, animal rights, the nature of evil, and the presence or absence of souls felt empty and out of place with the colorful and imaginative Oz I love. Here, Oz seems dreary and unrecognizable. I don't dislike philosophy, but I missed the fantasy. In author Gregory Maguire's telling, life in Oz is bleak.  I had hoped this book would give me a new appreciation for why the witch (named Elphaba--a take on L. Frank Baum's initials) is the way she is. What I got instead was a mostly uninteresting character whose story went nowhere. I admire the attempt to humanize a villainess, but presenting her as a (somewhat) complex and (somewhat) sympathetic character makes her actions against Dorothy, not all of which are documented here, so much the less believable. Sometimes the villain just needs to be a villain! Confusingly, Maguire has taken too many liberties with the original The Wizard of Oz, ignoring some key scenes and reinventing others to suit his purposes.  It's nearly impossible to separate this book from its roots in the work upon which it purports to be based, but even as a stand-alone novel, it fails. Maguire hints at ideas and plot points that either never come together or are completely abandoned. The bottom line is that I love books I can't put down. This one put me to sleep. Literally. I finished it, but only because I really wanted to like it and hoped for some redeeming conclusion. It simply did not live up to the potential of its intriguing premise 
 I have been drinking green tea for years, and love not only the taste but the smell too.  When I opened up the box of this tea I thought I was standing over an old ash tray!  It's smells horrid and doesn't infuse well into the water.  I steeped a table spoon of it for five minutes and the water color barely changed.  I highly recommend you NOT buy this tea.  Exotic product aside, the plain old Lipton green tea bags from the grocery store are far better 
 I bought this DVD for my daughter who is from China and though I think Xiao Foo is adorable, I am disappointed by Big Bird's behavior. Not only does he seem frustrated every time the slightest thing does not go his way, but he tells Barkley at one point to "sic" the Monkey King and then later, again frustrated, tells the Monkey King to put his dukes up (as if to fight to resolve the issue). I am appalled by this.  Big Bird is also somewhat demeaning to the Chinese people he encounters--they don't understand him because he is speaking English and rather than explain the language barrier, he just gets upset. I love Sesame Street, and although I will keep this DVD to hear Xiao Foo sing in Chapter 7 (our daughter just loves her), I feel I will need to use Big Bird's behavior as an example of how not to act 
 I like some of the other Walden Farms products -- I gave their chocolate dip 4 stars -- but this one is not very good. I tried dipping different kinds of fruit into it, tried it in combination with the chocolate dip, and finally gave up and threw the rest of it away. The cellulose gel Walden Farms uses to give its sauces body seems to have a slight spicy/sour "bite" to it; it doesn't bother me in the chocolate dip or in most of their dressings, but here it ruins the flavor 
 This book fails to provide real content that is true to the title.  It is true that are many examples of companies who have gained impressive benefits from using stories, but they are brief references and provide no actual method or useful insight.  It seems that the book is written purely for the purpose of convincing the reader that stories have a benefit in business.    Like many other readers, I find this approach mildly insulting; I do not need a whole book to convince me of the value of stories.  I would not have dedicated hours of my day to the task of reading it if I was uncertain of the concept.  I was looking for practical advice and helpful suggestions on practice and implementation.    All through this book, I couldn't shake the feeling that the author was using it as reference collateral for her consulting business.  There is a ream of annoying business books that have a similar message- "hey look, here are lots of companies that are doing something and getting great results!  You should really be doing it too!".  They all fall short of the task of actually helping with the enterprise and provide little guidance for making similar achievements.  I still have faith in the power of stories despite this book, because I read "Stories Trainers Tell".  This has everything that "Wake me up..." does not.  It is excellent, yet also co-written by Lori Silverman, which suggests that her own content has far more value than the pieces she selected as an editor.  I am glad that I didn't get disillusioned with the concept and had the perseverance to read this far more worthy second title.  I would advise other readers to skip the first step and buy "Stories Trainers Tell" from the beginning instead

 ROBOT MONSTER is one of "those" classic Five Star One Star '50s horror movies. The problem with "C" movies is that they can't be rated by the usual standards. By its own standards its a gem.   But for the fact that this gobbler wasn't touched by Ed Wood it has all the guaranteed elements of bad moviemaking. Actually, ROBOT MONSTER was panned so severely upon release that director Phil Tucker attempted suicide afterward.  ROBOT MONSTER concerns the depredations of a fat gorilla-suited space alien in a diving helmet (Ro-Man from the planet Ro-Man which is populated by the race of Ro-Mans) who comes to earth and destroys virtually all of human life with the aid of a vacuum tube radio and a Lawrence Welk bubble machine.  Ro-Man is a grouchy, slow moving space visitor who talks with his hands and grumbles a lot. He lives in one of the more familiar Hollywood caves of Bronson Canyon, California.   The few surviving humans (a family of five) protect themselves by stringing aluminum foil around their house so that Ro-Man cannot use his death ray machine against them. Instead, he must dispose of them one at a time "by the process of strang-u-laaa-tion" if they are so foolish as to step outside of their Reynolds Wrap safety zone.    Given their current world political situation, the humans, Richard Nixon-like, are seeking "Peace---But peace with honor!" from Ro-Man. Hmmm. Seems reasonable. After all, Ro-Man has really shown restraint up until this point. Why shouldn't they trust him?    But wait! Even after atomizing everybody else (apparently including the film's scriptwriter) Ro-Man has developed a penchant for Alice, the eldest daughter of the survivors. Fortunately for us, Alice seems to have a corresponding yen for excessively hirsute and overweight men wearing fishbowls on their heads. So while Ro-Man is distracted picking a bouquet for his new girlfriend, the family figures out a way to finally finish him off.    Exactly how humanity is going to repopulate the earth with only the Father Knows Best kids around escapes me, but clearly someone involved with this film escaped from somewhere.  It's as bad and as much fun as it sounds.   
   A trouble some pooch who has reaccuring dreams of being something else, something far greater.... A man. After a series of silly events he begins to take these dreams seriously and goes off on an adventure to find his family and his old life before..... HE DIED.   While the story is very touching and has a very good moral too it it was far too too long for me and seemed kinda cheesy at some pionts they kept on reinfasizing reincarnation, reincarnation, reincarnation. It was interesting but at one piont it became very boring and I lost intrest. I have only been able to sit through it one time, because of this. It jusy seemed like the man was really in a coma and that at one piont that he was gonna wake up from this long boring nightmare but he never did.   A great move to show small children at bed time so they fall asleep and perhaps people with a long patience or perhaps people with  an intrest in animals and dogs would like to see it 
 The Phantom Menace suffers from a horrendous script,but it actually has a couple of scenes that are genuinely entertaining.On the other hand,Attack of the Clones is quite possibly the worst big budget motion picture ever made.The script is even worse than Phantom Menace (and by a long way),and the movie is tedious,almost beyond belief.There is no 'acting',to speak of,rather just lame pronouncements from the various actors.I borrowed a friend's dvd,just to give it a viewing,and I wanted to walk out,even while in my own living room.These movies illustrate,if there was any remaining doubt,that Lucas has lost whatever talent he may have once had.I'm of the opinion that he had very little to begin with 
 This book has some good information but you have to wade through the fat to get at it.  It may be written mainly for aspiring college students, but I feel it is not complete enough or deep enough for parents.  There are many other better books out there on the subject (notably Fiancial Aid for Dummies and Discounts and Deals at the Nations best 360 colleges) 
 I really hate to criticize another man's work, but when buying a book is involved, the reader should know what he's getting into before he invests his time & money in it.  That being said, I think Mr. Bower put a lot of time and effort into this book, and it shows with the numerous first-rate sources he quotes from.  Unfortunately, the story itself could have been presented in a more user-friendly manner.  I found the first 100-150 pages fascinating--I had no idea how sympathetic the Swiss were with the Nazis and how they turned their backs on the Nazis' victims.  What was even more appaling was the Swiss behavior after the war: refusing to give back the looted money, heirless assets or even acknowledge they did anything wrong.  But the 50 years between the war's end and the book's end could be summed up in one sentence:  people asked the Swiss to right their wartime wrongs and the Swiss refused.  Maybe it's because I never cared for legal dramas but it just seemed like he went on and on, page after page of American accusations and Swiss denials.  It made the book a difficult read and not something I looked forward to opening again.  At the same time it is a little biased--it is told primarily from the "crusaders'" point of view.  Very rarely does he flesh out Switzerland's position or make enough distinction that this was mostly a crime of the Swiss Bankers and not the Swiss Government or the citizens themselves.  Even so, it is difficult to have any pity for the Swiss after reading this, and you will cringe anytime you hear the words "Swiss neutrality."  The Swiss were hardly neutral in the war.  However, the book did have one positive side--by the time you get to the last chapter you are so frustrated that you are genuinely mad at the Swiss and feel a personal sense of justice when they are willing to own up to their actions.  Unfortunately the book ends abruptly and you don't get a true feeling of resolution...but at the same time I'm glad I learned a lot about this often-forgotten chapter of the 20th century.  However, I think there are many other books on the subject that should be looked at first...with all due respect to the author 
 Fuller is a minor talent of the Transcendentalist movement, marginally interesting for her proto-feminism. (Actually not at all interestingly). It is doubtful whether Emerson and Thoreau are not outdated; Fuller is best forgotten 
 I was reading about my son.  It all sounded familiar and the concepts and suggestions made good sense.  Really talked about a framework of letting the decision making (and the consequence of their decision) remain with the teen. Then half way the book screeched in a new direction.  All of a sudden the book went from experienced practitioner point of view to subjective parent point of view.  When it comes to sex the authors don't want you to leave the decision with the teens, they want to take that one back, which weakens the premise they present.  The authors danced around abstinence while never taking a really firm position - which I would have respected, if not agreed with.  Then in the middle of that chapter one of the authors invokes Christ into the conversation/solution.  If I knew this book was written in context of a particular belief system, I wouldn't have spent the $22.  I would have wanted to know that in advance.  Tripping over this midbook has completely disappointed me and diminished the content and message of this book.  Buyer Bewar 
 This book is terrible.  It is very hard to understand.  Not recommended 
 I am Bruce Swedien's daughter and I grew up in recording studios watching him work. I was 8 years old when he recorded a Falstaff beer commercial with The Cream at Universal in Chicago. They were on break so I started banging on the drums. Ginger Baker, a heroin addict, came flying into the studio, screaming "Get off my drums, you little (expletive)". I ran into the control room, crying, and a very kind man came in, handed me a pair of drumsticks, and said "It's alright. Here, take these." It was Eric Clapton. I have stories upon stories about Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones, Barbra Streisand, Mick Jagger, Paul McCartney, Donna Summer, Chaka Khan, The Chi Lites, Sergio Mendes, Franki Valli, Buddy Miles, Eddie Harris, and many more. Not only does my father's book omit these legendary stories, he omits the very fact that he has three children; two daughters and a son. You really shouldn't have done that, dad. The people want to know the truth. 
 If you want a well-written book based upon an unnecessarily limiting definition of creativity, you have found it.   On the other hand, if you want a well-written, real, been there, in-the-trenches with you, book on creativity, you must buy Eric Maisel's books. I have found Eric Maisel to be invaluable. He touches the creator's heart. I have read "Deep Writing," and "Coaching the Artist Within." Both are excellent and should be on any artist's shelf.   On to the review of Csikszentmihalyi's work...  I have read two books by Csikszentmihalyi, "Flow," and "Creativity." I highly recommend Flow. It provides a clear and understandable description of "optimal experience," something we normally refer to as "being in the zone."   I cannot recommend Csikszentmihalyi's book, "Creativity." Here are my reasons:  1. Definitions  Csikszentmihalyi identifies three definitions of creativity (pg 25-26). The second and third are pertinent here.  a. The second definition is what he terms "personally creative," that is the person who "exeriences the world in novel and original ways." This is what is ordinarily considered creative (see http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?s=creative&gwp=13). This definition honors the creative person and creative process very well.  b. The third definition is wholly contrived by Csikszentmihalyi. He states that those who "have changed our culture in some important way... are the creative ones without qualifications." This definition, while true for a few, is the basis of the book and is much too narrow for such a diverse and broad subject.  2. The book is based upon an analysis of interviews with people who are prominent in their fields and have a high degree of accomplishment. It was not an invitation across the general population. The interviewees were aged 60 or older. And, of the short list of people who were invited, 275, only a portion agreed to be interviewed (pg. 12-16). Again, the entire list of people studied was too narrow to do the full subject of creativity justice.   3. There is very little material in the book that is pertinent to the personally (i.e.; not publicly acknowledged) creative person. The personal creator may very well be put off by suggestions that one must study and work in a given field for decades before anything noteworthy can be produced. How discouraging for anyone attempting to create, especially late in life.  Csikszentmihalyi can certainly conduct a study and write a book on whatever he wishes. I applaud his productivity. But, I believe that for the reasons I mentioned, his book on creativity is difficult to recommend.  If you have read this far and have not searched for Maisel's books, do so now. If you are a creative person or wanting to be more creative, get "Coaching the Artist Within. 
 Words cannot describe how ripped off and disappointed I feel about buying this book.   Having read RDPD and CFQ in the Kiyosaki range previously and finding them great, I thought this book would be great as well. I'm sorry to say it's the worst book I've ever read. The entire book is a blatant sales brochure for all his other books.   There's all these annoying references where you get a little bit of information and then instructions that if you want to know more, you need to buy one of his other books. I didn't get any useful information and it's certainly not a 'how to' book. I thought I would be reading about him and his wife's story but all I got was the same few points said over and over again. He doesn't even try to say them in a different way.  The other annoying thing was his promotion of network marketing as a good business option. It was obviously done to help sweeten the deal he has with the network marketing association who recommend all his books to their members.   I could seriously go on and on about why you shouldn't waste your money on this book but I won't.  I have NEVER written a book review on amazon before as I have never felt so strongly about a book. I generally feel if I get even just 1 thing out of reading a book then it was well worth it. In this case I didn't get anything out of it and felt really used and taken advantage of which is why I decided to post this review.   I hope it saves someone else from wasting their money. Buying this book WILL NOT HELP YOU RETIRE YOUNG OR RETIRE RICH 
 What seemed like a good idea at the time became a near-genuine mess with Hallmark Entertainment's "Blackbeard." Marketing it as the "true story" of the most famous pirate that ever lived, the film is anything but. Except for a few moments of truth, the story itself is almost pure fiction.  Now, I understand that a film can never be 100% historically accurate. But unlike films such as "Braveheart, "Gladiator" and "The Patriot," the writing for the movie is very disappointing. The film suffers from a hackneyed sub-plot with Maynard falling in love with the step-daughter of Governor Eden, and his "serving" with Blackbeard on the Queen Anne's Revenge for a time. Instead of moving, these scenes turn out melodramatic and uninteresting. The fight scenes for the movie are disappointing as well, failing to keep a person excited. One of the few saving graces of the film is Angus MacFayden. Despite a tendency to mumble, he gives a fine performance as Edward "Blackbeard" Teach, penetrating the pure darkness of a truly dark character. He's not perfect, but he's good nonetheless. Richard Chamberlain also turns in a fine performance as Governor Eden. But the rest of the cast deliver hackneyed, uninteresting performances. "Blackbeard" isn't the worst film ever made, but it could've been so much better. Hallmark Entertainment had a great chance at telling a great story, and blew their opportunity. If you're looking for an interesting program about Edward Teach, then check out the National Geographic Documentary "Blackbeard: Terror at Sea." Heck, "Blackbeard's Ghost" is better than this. Other than for MacFayden's fine performance, "Blackbeard" is one to skip! Movie/DVD Grade: D+ 
 It is possible to enjoy a move that is all action, without any plot or character development due to the fast pace, and the visual stimulation that a movie has.  A novel, however, is a different story.  In order to enjoy a novel there must be some sort of character depth and development that, sadly, this novel lacks completely.  This was one of the most boring books I have ever read, and I'm still not entirely sure why I read this total piece of garbage all the way to the end.  Before reading this novel numerous friends of mine told me how good an author Tom Clancy is, and I completely trusted their assessment, mostly due to the wide success he has had in the literary world.  However, if this is representative of his writing then perhaps my friends, and the general public as a whole, needs to figure out what good writing is!  In fact I'm not entirely sure if Tom Clancy actually wrote this book, because the writing credits are for Tom Clancy and Martin Greenberg.  Did this Greenberg guy write this garbage and then Tom Clancy put his name, as a brand, onto it?  If that is so, then Tom Clancy is really hurting himself by being associated with such refuse.  On the bright side the cover is pretty cool.  I like the picture a lot.  Additionally there is a lot of technical information about US and Chinese submarines in this novel.  If you are interested in the technical specs of submarines, however, I imagine that you would be better served reading a technical manual, or some sort of nonfiction book about subs.  If you like an insanely repetitive story with ZERO character development, then pick up this book, otherwise try anything else 
 This is another book by the comedy duo Schroeder and Ostrander - the gullible pair who were obviously duped into believeing pro-Soviet hype for a "magic" learning system called "Superlearning" that they put together after so called demonstrations of wonderous and effortless learning in communist Bulgaria in the 70's. You only need to read my other reviews to see just what I think of the crap the Superlearning company produces! Anyway, it looks like they also fell for more hype and propaganda from Russia this time! Look at some of the titles in the book "Is it getting crowded on the moon?"!!! Come on! Some of the accounts they give are just so obviously contrived, such as the 8 foot alian who landed in Voronezh and took a stroll through a crowded square with his smaller companion that he called "robot". Robot? You mean he/it said that in English or Russian? Maybe it was Czech, after all "robot"is a word coined by a Czech author! It isn't Star Trek where every life form speaks English for our benefit! How they could be taken in I'll never know...or were they taken in? It's a good money spinner, after all! And just who provided all the statistics and experimental findings? It wasn't the same kind of people who gave them the "facts" about Suggestopedia and those convoluted retention rates, was it? I'm sure the Soviets were totally decent people who wouldn't dream of making things up, would they. Next the'll be saying that the moon landings never took place. I ask you!!! This title is another piece of idiotic fiction to add to your "Superlearning" collection 
 After anticipating the arrival of this book (that I ordered some time before publication after hearing of it), I was disappointed.  Although the subject is timely, the writing style smacks of academia and therefore, will not appeal to the mainstream (reader).  Because I'm tenacious by nature, I finished the book, but found my mind wandering throughout because it simply did not hold my attention.  Too bad - it could have been inspirational 
 I was about to buy this product yesterday, and the price jumped up (yet again!) from $49 to $72!   I can understand a little inflation every now and then, but, judging from other reviews, this is ridiculous.  Literally one night passed and now I can no longer afford this keyboard.  Thanks Amazon 
 Halliwell's is maddeningly opinionated and uneven.  Anyone with a passing knowledge of movies will find much to infuriate him.  For example, it dismisses James Cagney with 4 lines and Edward G. Robinson with 3 but squanders 11 lines on Jennifer Aniston and 12 on Winona Ryder. Here's what the author says about Gene Kelly, who just happens to grace the cover of this book:  "...his acting and singing abilities were minimal and his 'good guy' characterization wore a little thin."  It has a knack for finding the nastiest, cattiest quotes about the victims listed.  For example, one actress is called "a vacuum with nipples."  It tends to dwell on the more salacious personal details of the actors lives, much of which is of questionable veracity, especially gossip dealing with actors sexuality.  Also, I found many problems with the information listed such as the same quote attributed to two different people, no ending date for TV shows long off the air, and incomplete credits trailing off with "etc."  It does give helpful lists in the back of the Oscars, BAFTA, and AFI but anyone looking for a straight reference guide with dates, places of birth, complete credits, and unquestionable facts should look elsewhere.   
 Why would someone with such a low opinion of motherhood and babies have an obsessive need to bear offspring with a husband she doesn't live with and who, by the way, is the age of some great grandfathers? From the eye-catching title, I was expecting a humorous story about an older mom juggling career, marriage and motherhood. Instead, I found a disturbing glimpse into the life of a woman so unable to connect with her husband and children she lets readers in on her fantasies of killing them. Someone please alert social services!  
 I was very disappointed in this selection.  Maybe a MALE football fanatic would find something appealing, but I was VERY bored!  Take me back to court, to the lawyer's office, to the judge's chambers,...just about anywhere but these bleachers!! 
 Part of an underachieving four-album run (Speed of Sound, Back to the Egg, Mc Cartney II), London Town shows Mr. McCartney at loose ends. The song fragments don't work. I remember how frustrated I was the first time I heard Backwards Traveller- a short burst of infectious song followed by some uninspiring synth junk.  Earlier in McCartney's career, albums that received mixed reviews--Ram, Wild Life and Red Rose Speedway--all had enough gold in them to satisfy, nevertheless. By contrast, London Town--as well as Back to the Egg--very nearly miss completely.  Fortunately, Tug of War was four years off. But then, another drought until Flowers in the Dirt, and so on...         
 The Gunslinger is the first book in Stephen King's Dark Tower series. It is the story of Roland Deschain's quest to find the man in black, who will lead him to the Dark Tower  On this journey, Roland travels through gritty rundown lands, often times lost in thought, reflecting on his past and all that he has lost. And thus becomes the pattern of the story. Roland travels and thinks and travels some more.  I did enjoy one childhood story in particular. He challenged his teacher and fought with a raven as his weapon. It proved that he was willing to sacrifice others, even a bird in this case, to further his own cause. This is why when we meet a young boy named, Jake, we know his fate is doomed as well.  Jake's story fascinated me. He was in New York City and the man in black ripped him from his world there and dumped him in the middle of the desert in Roland's world. He is a small glimmer of hope to an otherwise jaded story.  I had a hard time reading this book. At first I thought it was because I don't normally like western flavored stories, but my love for movies like Tombstone and shows like Deadwood have proved that's not always the case. It turns out that I just don't like the hero of the tale.  I think Jake was added to show us a softer, caring side of Roland, but it fell short. He knew he'd betray the boy from the beginning and we knew it too. Only, I wanted it to be something big when it happened. The big scene was a big let down. I remember thinking, "Wow, that's it? Please tell me that's not it."  I know heroes are not all supposed to be charmers, and I'm not one to mind if the hero is crass and ruthless. But no matter what, I found that I just didn't care about Roland or his plight or anything in his world. I couldn't attach myself to them.  What I enjoyed most in this book was reading the introduction King wrote since I always love reading when he writes about creating stories in general.  And well that's that. I have the next 4 or 5 books in this series and I haven't yet decided if I will continue it. How can I read more if I don't like the hero, eh 
 Danielle spins the usual McRomance. Fairly decent for her, but sometimes there are situations in her books that are simply 50 years out of date. Example is the lady in a former book whose husband REFUSED to let her attend law school. Hello? 2004 calling? I remember a story about a character giving birth who was forced to give birth with her legs strapped down. This written in like 1985 and they stopped doing that in like 1965. Well, the throwback in this book is the two selfish girls who were "cruel" to the stepmother. Hello? 2004 calling? Like 60% of their contemporaries don't have mixed families? Like mom DIED two years ago? Like y'all are adults? The twist that irritates so much that it throws you out of the web of belief needed to enjoy a romance novel 
 It is an aptly named book.  Why?  Because this book is FULL of disinformation.  Just another book written to perpetuate the lie of why we "need" the so-called "war on terrah".  All of the "myths" this author outlines have already been debunked over and over again by better researchers via other publications.  
 As a professional historian I was appalled by this book. I have a pretty generous sense of humor, but Shenkman's weak attempts at debunking popular conceptions and his "breezy" wit were too much. He propogates just as much bad history as he purports to correct, oversimplifying such complex subjects as Alexander's conquests and the fall of Rome, and his section on Judaism could easily be called anti-Semitic. It should come as no surprise that he skips over relgions that it's not okay to ridicule--only Jews and Christians are the butt of jokes, here. As another reviewer said, Shenkman seems to like hearing himself talk--so true. His narrative style reminds of me those self-important people you hear dominating restaurant conversation so often. If you really must have something historical to laugh at, check out The Lowbrow's Guide to History, which, at least, doesn't pretend to be telling the truth. 
 I can't believe they would ruin perfectly good toilet paper on this. What's the world coming to 
 We absolutely loved "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs" (I highly recommend it) but this is nowhere near as good.  Most of the story is just rehashing the original book, with a little politically-correct "let's ship the extra food to the hungry" thrown in.  Lame 
 I am a computer professional although new to Unix.  Also I am a "for Dummies" book fan in most instances, but this one is a waste of money.   Wading through all the cutsie remarks is annoying.  Furthermore, cute remarks take up space that should be devoted to more comprehensive text such as explanations and examples of Unix commands and concepts.   A previous reviewer suggested "Teach Yourself Unix in 24 Hours" and I took his suggestion, and am glad I did 
 I was so disappointed with this book, and am surprised at the number of fabulous reviews it received.  Every page demanded that I revel in my "feminist roots."  For any would-be stay at home moms interested in supporting their husbands by keeping house, fixing dinner, and doing laundry in addition to taking care of the kids--this is not the book for you.  It encourages you to not "give in" to the stereotypes and does not acknowledge that there may in fact be jobs just for dads and jobs just for moms.  I know this is not a popular view, maybe I'm the only one around who thinks this.  Your husband, however, may not be overjoyed if you take this book to heart!!!  Also, for any mothers seeking a more spiritual path to staying at home, this book advocated TOTAL CONTROL by you in your decisions--really letting your own self-interests direct your routine instead of those around you or giving up those self-interests in pursuit of a higher calling.  Even though I consider myself to be a feminist in many ways, this book was TOO MUCH 
 I will not be passing it on to a friend.  The ending left me irritated; why should I close a book with questions in my head?  I will not buy another Picoult book.  I felt "snookered" by Keeping Faith and now I have been fooled twice.  I have to say I did enjoy the book up until the ending, but the Hannah ghost plot was unfulfilled and I was surprised to find out in the middle of the book that Ellie had short hair.  Why didn't I know that before?  Obviously, the characters would have benefited from better descriptions.  
 As a molecular and cellular biology major, I've taken my fair share of biology courses and know a good deal about the workings of the body and its cells/organs. The ways in which mitosis, nerves, etc. are described in this book are decent, but there's no argument as to HOW or WHY any superior force possibly would have created such a body. The author plays the chicken-and-egg game with too many topics and ultimately lumps himself with the Intelligent Design crowd. This book may serve as a biology primer for some, but there's no proof and very little discussion on God. Considering that the title and his previous books' titles mention God, why would this book have almost no discussion on God? The layout of the chapters is as follows: 20 pages of biological explanation, followed by a few paragraphs that ask questions about God or origins or something similar - but the questions make little sense and go unanswered. I went into this book with an open mind and was floored by his superficiality. Save your money and time 
 Like John Woo's other American films, "Paycheck" shows none of the innovation, excitement, storytelling or other qualities that made such movies as "Hard Boiled" so incredible.  "Paycheck" is a science fiction movie with no science, an action movie with very little action, a romance without any passion.  Even the McGuffin, which should be super cool, is just blah and unexciting.  The film makes no sense, includes plot holes aplenty, and doesn't have enough energy or fun to compensate.  Affleck, Thurman, Giametti - all of them are good actors that have made far better movies.  It's not their fault; lazy scripting and direction are the culprits here.  Spend your paycheck on a better movie 
 These guys are called musicians, but they don't do anything musicians do. They can't play their instruments to save their worthless lives. It's the same chord after chord, same mind deadening beats, the solos are as good as turds, and the bass player can't seem to get beyond three notes. I'm listening to the samples and I can't differentiate between the tracks. They get a token black boy to add something to the music, which is nothing because he sucks as bad as the main band members do. If he's a a main band member, then he's the laziest sack of crap in musical history. What's hilarious is they try to incorporate reggae, which doesn't help because they screw it up and reggae is pretty talentless too. I despise frat boy music. I guess I could tolerate this music if I'm drunk off my ass.   "I have no sunglasses as I step in to the sun."   You have no talent as you sell millions of cds to people who have no clue what talented music is. I would absolutely love to hear these idiots play something original, different chords, new beats, or actual solos. That will never happen. What's funnier is they go from dull frat boy rock to reggae to punk to laid back sissy crap. This shows they run out of ideas and have to molest other music genres to release a full length album.   Do I even have to mention how bad the lyrics are? I'll just they're just as mindless as punk, pop punk, rap, boy bands grunge, and pop hos' lyrics.   
 The plot is confussing and weakly held together by the detailed personal stories. I found little that was morally redeeming or outstanding in this book. Having grown-up in Oklahoma, I found the book unauthentic. I cannot recommend this book 
 I bought this for my god-daughter for Christmas.  I actually thought that I was ordering a Schoenhut baby grand, but for some reason I ended up with this.   Anyway, it is not a piano.  It is a toy, it doesn't sound like a piano, it doesn't play like a piano.  It just looks like one and that is about it.  Metal rods for the sound, doesn't sound good at all.  You hit one key and get multiple notes with very little clarity.  And I have to pound on some of the keys to get it to work well or have a clear sound.  All in all, I really wish I could return this item get my money back and spend the another 40-50 dollars on a Schoenhut or other good brand of childrens piano.  But the day I received it and checked to see if I could return it I could not.   I got ripped off.  By something else people, this technically isn't even a string instrument...and definatley won't really help in teaching a child music in my opinion 
 Waste of money.  Gardner is resting on his laurels.  There is so much that could be done with this title, but it was not.  Instead we get a recital of stuff already said elsewhere not particularly related to the extensive lore which Tolkien drew upon.  Way too little to do with the Realms of the Ring Lords, as if he was knocking off a book to exploit the popularity of Tolkien.   Pity, I was expecting more 
 Rest Stop (John Shiban, 2006)  Writer/producer John Shiban makes his feature-film directorial debut with Rest Stop, a slick little thriller that wants to be far more than it actually is. While this is an admirable goal, it's never possible to fully forget that the movie's trying a bit too hard. Still, it's a vast improvement over a lot of recent damsel-in-distress flicks.  Nicole (Watch Over Me's Jaimie Alexander) and Jessie (Joey Mendicino in his big-screen debut) have run away from their small-town Texas home and are on their way to Los Angeles when they pull into a rest stop. After the required bathroom break, Nicole comes outside to find Jessie has disappeared. She also discovers the rest stop is the home base for a particularly nasty serial killer who's been picking off young girls there for a very long time. She's forced into a game of cat and mouse with the guy, and finds herself questioning her sanity more and more as the game goes on.  Yes, there are plot holes big enough to drive a yellow pickup truck through. And yes, there are some awe-inspiringly stupid moments (especially the final scene) that make you wonder whether anyone at the production company actually read the entire script before bankrolling this thing (I kept thinking it was the filmed equivalent of a novel published by Xlibris). But Shiban was at least trying, and you have to give him a few brownie points for that. I mean, how seriously can you take a movie that casts Joey Lawrence as a cop? And how seriously are you supposed to take a movie that features the camper family to be found in the middle of this one? It's entirely possible that the most you'll get out of this movie is a few laughs, a few hours of nitpicking with your buddies, and some awesome eye candy in the for of Jaimie Alexander. Still, that's a whole lot more than you got from Haute Tension. * 
 A good story with strong characters lures the reader's imagination, inspires excitement and anticipation of what happens next.  This is not one of those stories.  It's not a bad book by any means.  Shining moments appear.  However, Taita is a character hard with which to sympathize.  All the other characters are as translucent as the page held up to a strong light, and the heaped action reaches a point of banality in its lack of specificity.  Did I mention it's predictable?  You should have expected that.  Pick up a Clavell or Jennings instead.  This is Soap Opera history 
 I am disappointed in this cookbook.  I have a hardbound copy that has fallen apart and only wanted to replace it.  The format is strange, a number of my favorite recipes are not in this 'newer' edition.  I also thought the spiral bound book would wear better then the hardbound, but it is difficult to turn pages and without the tabs finding what you're looking for is difficult.  Wish I had gotten the anniversary edition 
 Jesus this is horrible Cd. I loved Incubus when they first came out but slowly I realized there would never be another: Enjoy Incubus, Fungus, or S.C.I.E.N.C.E album ever again. This Cd makes me really think that they have run out of creative ideas and doing whatever they can to get on the radio 
 Let me just start by saying that I don't own "The Chosen Collection" but that I do own the original releases of all seven seasons.   Why review this then?   Quite frankly, I believe the combined sets to be a waste of money. I have seen the reviews of this set done by fellow reviewers, and it is was my experience that that the boxes for the previous sets are not much different than this - they are as flimsy as this set is, and just as breakable.  The set's discs appear the same as the previous editions, probably a rehash from leftover sets. A bonus disc may be the only redeeming factor, but since I don't own it, I haver never seen it.  I spent my money on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" once, and once is enough for me. Buffy is a endearing series, but why throw away DVD sets just to have them "return" from the garbage 
 This isn't really a book, or even an essay collection. Instead, the  publisher decided to put this out when Stephen Ambrose was at the height of his popularity. It's a collection of magazine articles and essays that Ambrose wrote over the course of about 30 years. Some are long and detailed (the first piece, on the Vicksburg campaign, is about 40 pages long, and 30+ years old) while others are much shorter, and some are very new. One (the piece on The Christmas bombing in Viet Nam) is a reprint from MHQ, the article there in turn excerpted from Ambrose's bio of Nixon.  For those who aren't familiar with my opinions (which is probably most of you) Ambrose isn't my favorite historian by any stretch of the imagination. He started out a conventional narrative historian and biographer, but tended to run with whichever trend or fad the historical community thought was cool that year. Crazy Horse and Custer, for instance, spends some time comparing the toilet training practices of the societies the two men grew up in, with of course the expected inferiority of white society highlighted when compared with that of Native Americans. A few years later, oral history became the watchword, and Ambrose essentially hitched his horse to that wagon for the rest of his career, writing five or six books that relied on this medium most or all of the time.  Unfortunately, here we don't even get much oral history. These writings are mostly from the pre-oral history era of Ambrose's scholarship, and the newer pieces focus on historical pieces as opposed to oral history ones. As a result, we get opinions on such topics as George Custer (whom Ambrose despises; anyone who read Crazy Horse and Custer already knows that), MacArthur, Grant, Eisenhower (of course), and various other figures and topics from American military history. Some of the pieces are now essentially useless: one titled "The Cold War in Perspective" is so out of date now as to be a waste of one's time to read.  That leaves us with some Ambrose opinions (many of them uninformed, at best) and a few pieces of good writing that cover topics you could probably find other material on. I wouldn't recommend this book to much of anyone, though there are a few pieces in it that someone might find worthwhile 
 I may get the chop for the following review, from angry fans and passionate guitarists alike, but hear me out.  These so-called "virtuosic" guitarists are indeed impressive to listen to and jaw-dropping when performing live - To an extent.    Endless frantic solos quickly become tedious, and lack the true feeling that goes into better, often slower solos.  Dave Gilmour's unforgettable exit to "Comfortably Numb" by Pink Floyd is a perfect example of the "perfect" solo in my opinion - full of heart, not TOO simple, and damn is it bitter-sweet.  Hell, Neil Young could incite more feeling playing the same note over and over than these guys could in a career!  However, the stylings of Joe and company take guitar playing to extremes, and often slaughter it.  Don't get me wrong, Joe can play like the devil, yet his, Steve Vai's and Yngwie's music has it's faults:  1. Lack of singer in songs - Endless shredding instrumentals are just irritating.  And these guys are guitarists, not singers.  It sounds awful when they try.  A solo should be part of a proper song, something to be looked forward to.  Some of the finest solos ever written are short, sweet 30 second numbers.  2. Ridiculous song titles - These make the songs pointless and almost pretentious.  With no lyrics and little emotion, there is little can be had from these songs.  They are not about love, do not tell a story, or make a political stand.  They give the impression the artist believes they can get away with anyhthing.  I mean, "the mystical potatoe head groove thing"!?  What the hell is that about!?  3. Big-headedness - This applies to Yngwie in particular, the obnoxious, big-haired, European boob!  He butchers the "Little Wing" solo on the G3 DVD, and swaggers about the stage like a pompous fruit!  Don't get me wrong; I love fast guitar playng.  And the fusion of classical and rock music is one of my favourite genres.  In proportion, it can lead to the production of some of the finest rock music; case and point, Racer X or Extreme.  Top knotch guitar playing, and some kick-@ss lyrics.  Beautiful.  In short, I'm not telling you, the customer not to buy this CD, or any CDs by the artists mentioned.  I just wished to warn you of the height of tedium that lies within.  Beware 
  This is a complex and detailed history chiefly of Cuban exiles in South Florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various U.S. administrations. In that sense, it is the story of two cities - Miami and Washington - and two peoples - Americans and Cubans.    I have an objection, though, with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously, even gorgeously at times, written. Didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and, worse, the result is a cold, humorless, colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup.   The author, in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose, apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers. It is, in that sense, a boring little disaster of a book.  
 Philip Slater puts forth with vehemence and passion his opinions on the trends of hyperconsumerism and overindependence that are driving rifts between the people of our nation and diverting much-needed resources from  instituations designed to create health and well-being. His observations  about how middle-class Americans are alienating themselves by placing far  too much emphasis on material possessions, individualistic thought ("I  am different from all of you"), and an economy that is powerfully  rooted in the need to simply consume and produce goods rather than increase  the quality of life are interesting, though a bit dated, and still hold  much relevance to the current situation today.    Still, the phenomena he  rages against are nothing new to the conscientious among us, and there are  many other views on the problems of loneliness and hyperconsumerism that  prey on us. Slater makes powerful points, and he clearly has a deep desire  to see change and the end of the injustices that characterize our century,  but I found his writing style and thought process to be scattered and far  too extremist to inspire me. His book seemed less of an empirical analysis  of the problems facing our nation and what we can do to solve them and more  of an emotional rant about what he personally feels is wrong and where he  feels we all went wrong. Nothing bad about that, it's just he seems so  angry and hurt about it all that he didn't come close to capturing me  (though the chapter about Vietnam and the last chapter were coming close).      It was a good book, but there are far better books written by far more  inspirational people. Carl Rogers ("On Becoming a Person") was a  psychologist who spoke beautifully and wisely for the healing of the  isolation and misunderstandings in our relationships with each other.  Barbara Marx Hubbard ("Conscious Evolution: Awakening the Power of Our  Social Potential") writes convincingly and with an uplifting sense of  hope about the problems we face as a people and a culture and what we can  do in the coming decades to move in the direction that Philip Slater longed  for. Both these authors, and many others, rationally describe problems we  all face, then offer warm and well though-out advice about what we can all  do. Slater seems like something of a ranter, and reading his book only  depressed me. But hey, read the book, then move on. Good luck 
 Okay, I had to read this book for a Fantasy Lit. class I am taking.  My teacher and all of my fellow classmates, it seems, find it hilarious.  I, however, am left wondering:  why?    I understand what he's getting at with religion and what not, I've just seen it done in a much better way by much better authors.  The characters are boring and flat.  His humor is downright stupid.  This book is not clever in the least.  If you don't know the things he's pointing out in a way which suggests he thinks they are quite witty, you really need to think for yourself.    I guess it might appeal to the great masses who can find nothing better to do with their time than go to the next big blockbuster movie and buy the latest crap novel.  But then, the back of the book does say he is a popular author, and like most things that are popular, it must be accessible to the public or else they won't understand.     
 What a co-incidence, my first 3D puzzle too.  Average difficulty for the average user. Would not recommend it for the beginner.  The panels are not hard to put together, but it is fiddly putting all the panels together. Once done, the model is quite magnifique. And got me started on 3D puzzles. Hasbro/Wrebbit should give everyone 1 free 3D puzzle, then everyone would get hooked on it.   None of the 3D puzzles can stand a lot of handling, however this Eiffel Tower actually survived a show and tell. Sadly it now rests in 3 pieces and I'm too lazy to put it back together again. Highly recommended 
 if your and adult and love the first movie  do not get this one it is stitch the movie, a movie to start the TV show.  check the rating lilo and stitch PG stitch the movie G  this movie is too happy no worry like the TV show.   no real drama like the first movie lilo comes from a broken family  and stitch a destructive alien  there has to be new problems from there personalities,  but the TV show has them have happy advancers.  l thank goodness they mad the real sequel lilo and stitch 2  and I wish there was a worning about the kids only stitch SHOW  I was a shock to see that a cool space fantasy/broken family  was tern in to a lets catch a monster show.  belive me I seen the episodes ther nothing like the first movie.   get the lilo and sitch 2  it had them at ther best with a even deeper drama.      
 A singularly dull book, the characterizations seemed flat and the peg on which the novel is hung, a South victorious with modern weapons, seemed too trivial.  The author has to make something compelling in that conceit or for the reader the book will mean nothing.  Unfortunately there seems little real purpose to the idea unless one finds the characterizations of historical figures believable and they are not.  The character of Robert E. Lee in the book is just too, too good to be sympathetic or even credible and the stock characters that pop up to lend support seem like cardboard cutouts.  I finally felt that the book was going in such an obvious direction that I put it down halfway through.  I am not sure if it turns out the way I think but frankly there was nothing in the first half of the book to make me care one way or the other 
 Reading through reviews of this text, I notice two main criticisms and will address them separately.  The first is that the book has some sort of liberal bias.  As far as I am concered, no bias of this sort is present.  I hold my textbooks to the same standard that I hold news outlets, and I found The American Pageant to be just as objective as the BBC or The Washington Post.  Dr. Bailey looks at both sides of controversial issues, does not, despite the beliefs of other reviewers, pan President Reagan, and has plenty of criticism of the left.  Why, then, the low rating?  This has to do with issue number two, namely Dr. Bailey's writing style.  It is, in a word, irritating.  He feels the need to bring ridiculously flowery language and bizarre metaphors into every situation.  I counted at least six comparisons of national banks, Wall Street moguls and railroad barons to octopuses.  Teddy Roosevelt had, according to Dr. Bailey, "mule-like molars" which he "bared at liberals and reactionaries alike".  It's extraordinarily difficult to cut through the (pardon my French here) merde and figure out what on earth is going on.  I'm not looking for a dry history book, really I'm not.  I believe American history can be interesting without bordering on the insane.  Dr. Bailey crosses the line from making his readers think that he may be insane to actually making his readers go insane.    I've not read any other US History textbook, so as far as I know this may be the best one.  I certainly hope not, for all of our sakes 
 I recently borrowed this from our library for our 3yo dd to watch.  Plus, I wanted to see if it was any good before potentially buying.  She watched it once, while I glanced at it every now and then while doing housework.  Since I missed some parts, I played it again to catch the parts I missed even though I wasn't very impressed with what I saw.  As I put the DVD in the 2nd time, my dd said, "No, not this one again!"  Obviously, my 3 yo has good taste too!  We own the 2 original movies, and a few DVD's of the episodes from the 80's and she MUCH prefers those.  She'd watch the DVD's from the 80's over and over in a row if only I'd let her!  I didn't care for the annimation style or the story plot.  Plus, since when did they make Funshine a boy?  I thought Funshine was a girl?!  We won't be adding this title to our collection.  Buy the original Care Bears or Strawberry Shortcake or Rainbow Brite. . . all of which are big hits with my dd 
 This CD is so-so, the only really good disco songs are Disco Inferno, Funky Town, and Rock The Boat. Y.M.C.A, and It's Raining Men are ok but kind of hokey, and the rest of the songs are hideous! I guess you have to be a major disco fan to totally like this CD, and I'm not a major fan as I only like a few disco songs! All of the disco songs I like are on the Pure Disco CD's and though there are songs on the Pure Disco Vol.1 and Vol.2 CD's's that I don't like there are also a lot that I do like and I just prefer those CD's to this one so I would rate them a 3 and this CD a 2 
 When you find yourself double-checking the bookjacket to see if the author you have enjoyed in the past could really have written this, it is not a good sign.  I can't even get into the book. I have read Catherine Coulter before, and while she isn't my favorite romance novelist, I have had only enjoyable experiences thus far.  That ended when I picked up this book from the library.   The dialogue is awful. There is no flow, they just randomly say things out of their mouths. There is no context for it either, no reason given for anything they say. And since what they say is so unbelievably corny, trite, or odd, you really need some kind of frame to put it in for it to have any meaning. I gather from the reviews that this contains characters from her other books, so maybe the context is there.  The whole conversation about discipline in the beginning pages also has no context. I found myself trying to picture this and trying to figure out what in the heck she really meant by discipline. Did it mean what I think it meant? Or something else? It wasn't super clear.  The man's character gives you nothing to work with. He's a womanizer and yet, he spills out a story about avenging his housemaid's demise.  Then he immediately blurts out "Why did I say that?" Why indeed? When he is questioning it, I know I'm in trouble.    And what is up with the whole "big girl" repetition? First, a big girl in my mind is someone with larger proportions--not necessarily someone tall. The "big girl" is gorgeous, but we have no idea why because the descriptions he pants about her don't describe anything. Just picture a goddess. There ya go. Got it?  Good.    Unfortunately I'm not going to make it to the whole "point" of this book, something about a treasure. I cannot, simply cannot get past these pages.

 While not necessarily a bad book, this selection just doesn't do what I need. I was looking for something to help me make a purchase from a tech persepective (e.g., where should I look for rust). What I got is "This  is the Jeep you should buy to make an investment and sell it for a lot of  money.&quot 
 One of the many problems with this book is the order in which the topics are presented.  Right off the bat, They decide to put linear equations ahead of all other types of DE's.  Are they really as simple to solve as seperable equations?  The entire second chapter is a complete mess and is very disorganized.  The forumla for the integrating factor of linear equations is difficult to ascertain, and it is never clearly stated (it's there, but their notation is convoluted).  I don't want to sound like someone who is just having difficulty with the math taking it out on the innocent textbook.    I have consulted other textbooks on the topic, and I have to say that I really like Zill's DE's for the logical way in which it is organized, and    Kohler and Johnson's text for its clear explanations.  My professor actually commented on how bad this book is.  All DE textbooks are NOT created equally, and if you are struggling through this one, try finding older editions of those other two from your University's library.    
 I hate to be rude but I have been building with FrontPage 2002 for years. It has so many templates and features but I thought it was time for an upgrade. I am thankful  that the original FrontPage is still running on my laptop or I don't think my latest sites would be up yet. Sorry, I don't mean to be mean. It may be like other programs that you can get training or have to take a class to do the things that FrontPages just does automatically. I'm sure it is fine as a stand alone creator software but to call it an upgrade, I don't know. 
 This collection pales by comparison to others.  The number of selections  is half that of other offerings for the same or less money.  A much better  selection of more than 20 of the best Sousa offerings is offered on the  fine Mercury recordings of the Eastman Wind Ensemble 
 Dave Barry's Bad Habits has comedy fiction writer Dave Barry trying his hand at the non fiction market.  Although he achieved quality work in this genre with later attempts such Homes and Other Black Holes, this book was clearly just cashing in on the success of his fiction with little effort put in whatsoever.  There's lots of references to Commies which either means Barry was extremely paranoid and brainwashed by his government of the time or he is retelling the same joke over and over again throughout the book, a joke that isn't that funny the first time and is really irritating when repeated and repeated and repeated.   Barry also insists on telling us his personal stories in this book, obviously the publishers had a word in his ear with future non fiction books as these stories are hardly evident in those books but unfortunately they are here and aren't that interesting.  Dave Barry can write some really good stuff, both fiction and non fiction.  Dave Barry's Bad Habits unfortunately is not one of those occasions. 
  The People of Sparks by Jeanne DuPrau is a horrible book that I would not recommend to people under the age of eleven. This story takes place in the city of Sparks. Lina & Doon have just lead the people of Ember out from underground. After coming to the city the Emberites are mistreated, malnourished, and misunderstood. So Lina goes out into the Empty Lands with a roamer that is looking for treasure. The Empty Lands are full of owls, coyotes, and other odd animals. There are also destroyed homes and buildings. Following this she comes back, and there is a large fight involving everybody. After that the climax is still climbing, and the most important part is ... I can't tell you!  	The above ground city of Sparks is an incredibly small city. The population is only three hundred twenty-seven and then to make matters worse, four hundred odd some people of Ember come to live with them. With food being scarce and people on the brink of war, Lina leaves with a roamer and goes to the Ancient City. This roamer that Lina left with is very rude, odd, and is looking for buried treasure that isn't there. When the roamer leaves, Lina leaves with the roamer's partner and head back to Sparks. When the two meet a new roamer, that is going to Sparks, they travel with him. The Roamer tells Lina the clues to the treasure, and Lina tells him that it is... I can't tell you, you have to read it.  	Truly, I thought the book was horrible, and weird because I don't like Fantasies, but if you like Fantasies you should read it 
 I guess I was expecting a Japanese, day before Pearl Harbor, Gorky Park. It wasn't. The problem with this book is that it did not hold my attention. I went back and reread more pages than in any book other than Michael Crichton's. In fact when I finished it I really could not tell you what it was about beyond ... the day before Pearl Harbor.  Buy it if you have insomnia 
 How do you spell 'sucks'? Easy - A-L-E-X-A-N-D-E-R!  I loved Stone's JFK, but this... Words fail me, but I'll try to find a few. Okay, the pros? Angelina Jolie. I've never been a big fan of hers, but, boy, was she the hottest woman alive in this movie! More pros? Hmmm. Certainly not the action sequences which were muddled and hard to follow. Certainly not the weird Irish accents the lead characters adopted. Certainly not the story.  This is just one of those films you believe can be so bad and that something cool is gonna happen the instant you hit the off button, so it stays your finger. My advice? HIT THAT BUTTON!  And I won't even mention the blonde wig! 
 The Roman World is an overview of Roman art and history (alot to cover in  one book). Without a solid background in Roman history it is very hard to  keep up with this book. Lots of gaps that a scholar might be able to fill  in but I had a very difficult time piecing everything together. Not for the  casual reader 
 This book has all old material and is outdated. I would recommend anything from Len Wilson and Jason Moore or Anthony Coppedge over this book 
 Hysteria.  **  I see great polarities in the reviews of this record. I fall in the camp that sees this as a overproduced microtargeted superficial pop record designed for radio and MTV. I consider that shrewd writing & marketing. Brilliance is a term I'll reserve for Led Zeppelin.  I tend to like my rock harder, with two arms and less cheesy. Sadly, this record doesn't fit the bill. For that, Pete Willis era Def Leppard suits me much better.  I don't need to give you a song breakdown by breakdown. The important factor here is what you enjoy. If you enjoy superficial 1980s MTV pop or mindblowing heavy rock - that distinction will determine your opinion here. This album is definetly the former.  I'll beg to differ with the Amazon reviewer - it *DOES* sound dated. Its a record thats signifigant for its hype. When listened for its depth. It is symbolic of the later part of the decade which it was released.  Prepare to be transported back to the spandex era on plopping this disc in

 Elizabeth Berg has written several humane, touching, so real they hurt novels about relationships: patient/nurse (the affecting "Never Change"), families ("Say When"): and she's  written them with uncommon grace, knowledge and understanding of what makes Us tick. The genesis of "We are All Welcome Here" was a letter from a fan, Marianne Raming asking Berg to write about her Mother who was stricken with Polio before Marianne was born. In the prologue to this novel, Berg at first recoils then warms to the idea, telling her fan: "(your) Mother's circumstances will serve only as inspiration for a different story that I will make up...if you want her real story to be told, contact a non-fiction writer." Unfortunately, Berg may have had better luck writing this book in the non-fiction form for as it is "WAAWH" is mostly flat and uninvolving except that the central story: a Mother trying everything that she can to raise her child despite being incapacitated by Polio and living in an Iron Lung, is without a doubt rife with drama and tension. Berg's novel isn't.  What it is, is flat and oddly enough very much like reportage.Berg, in her quest to avoid the trappings of non-fiction, falls victim to them nonetheless with the "just the facts" style of prose she adopts here. And then I read this gorgeous scene at the very end of the novel: "It's everywhere, she said and those were the last words I heard her speak. She meant redemptive beauty, I think. Despite her many obstacles, what my mother succeeded best in doing was appreciating the many forms of beauty in life...as well as its possibilities. And she relished perhaps more than any other mother could the growth of her daughter, seeing in me a part of herself set free." If only this novel as a whole could have been as elegant, as perceptive, as intelligent as these last few words on the last page of this book. 
 No truth to any of it.  Sickeningly manipulative.  Pure trite Hollywood garbage.  I never write negative reviews but shame on these people.  The only laugh I got was at the film's expense during the horrendous now notorious butterfly scene.  A complete insult to the intelligence of the American filmgoer (or any other nation for that matter).   
 The album is only 37 minutes, which is the first disappointing thing about it, but not the only. Unfortunately, a lot of the humor seems timely, as in: it wasn't funny to me because this isn't the sixties. I think a lot of the references and humor are based around  issues of that time or characters of that time. Our concepts of folk  singers, of artists, of actors have all changed--perhaps not terribly much,  but the cultural landmarks have shifted since this album. The 2000-year-old  man is pretty good, but not even that was as hilarious as I had been led to  believe. I'm going to give the album to my dad, as he knows the times (and  the material) first-hand and I'm sure would appreciate  it much more than  I 
 Exceedingly hard as it is to put "Yo-Yo Ma" and "truly awful" in the same sentence, this album does it with ease.  If you are looking for relaxing, smooth, easy music this one is NOT for you.  If you are in the mood for militant vocals (yes, vocals) and harsh rhythms with just a sliver of the elegant Yo-Yo Ma we all know and love, then this one is definitely for you 
 I was quite surprised and disappointed with this book.  It is not at all a horror story, not at all mysterious, really it was very boring.   Normally I enjoy Koontz books.   
 Although I am a Guns fan I did not like this album.The only song I like in this album is Since I Don't Have You. The overall album is not good.Still one of the few Guns albums.. 
 This book presents some fascinating ideas, but lousy arguments.  Kohanov argues that horses have a healing ability because of their special ability to see auras, communicated across distances, and similar reasons.  I was extremely annoyed by such reasoning.  Auras have no reliable, emperical data that I have been made aware of (if such evidence exists, please show me)  The idea of morphic fields strikes me as silly, once again, no data!  However, on the up side, the idea that horses are valuable as therapuetic tools, I agree with, but the argument can be made substantially stronger 
 The book never arrived--Instead I was sent (3 months later) a small paperback entitled "Helping Children Accept Themseves and Others" from Better World Books.  Perhaps Adam Smith would agree that this is the market at work but in the future "Better World Books" will not be my market 
 The glasses are well made but I found them awkward to use. They didn't fit comfortably and it took quite a bit of time to get them on. The gimmick sounded cool but didn't work well for me. Every head is different, so maybe they'll work better for you 
 I am a black woman who happens to be dating a white man.  However, when I first came across this book a few years ago, I was offended and frankly, shocked that something this blatantly racist and disrespectful could have been printed under the guise of a self-help book.  Whoever the author may be, s/he must realise that the way to make a rational argument to the intended reading audience of black females is NOT to insult black men, who represent her brothers, her father or her friends.  Another review on this board took the words right out of my mouth, when it stated that historically, it has been white-not black men-who have perpetuated the myth of the black [...], and who have been heavily invested in creating a sexually degraded image of the black woman in order to justify his sexual exploitation of her.  Half of me believes [or wants to believe] that this book is actually a satire.  I hope one day to have my hopes confirmed! 
 This book was required reading for my advanced placement english class. I consider myself a lover of the written word. I dream of someday becoming a novelist, or at least an english teacher. It usually takes me 3-5 days to finish a book, especially a good book. It has taken me 2 months to read this book. It is not only boring, but often times repetetive. Barbara Kingsolver relates everything to September 11th. Granted, this was a tragic day for our country and should always be remembered. But I dont see why Ms. Kingsolver found it necessary to write a whole novel about it. I find even less necessary for this to be required reading. Every once in a while Ms. Kingsolver finds the need to express herself with words that are a little more complicated than need be. It was a less than pleasent read and I wouldnt recommend it to my worst enemy 
 I just wonder if this would have been published without the author's being married to an author;  I find his stuff repetitively boring as well.  This is a simplistic story of an orphan wife who acts as though she can't stand her husband and seems to glory in anything she can do to upset him  Her friend in these endeavors is an obviously manic / depressive (sorry, term has been replace by bi-polar victim ) whose wealth seems to make her the star.  Their enemy is the EVIL (can't use that word either) Eagle Forum which is trying to close down the local store where the kids get their drug paraphanalia.  It seems that both ladies have problems (oops, not allowed any more by the political correctness police, I mean 'issues') with their male counterparts.  They act like they hate their husbands.  I'd recommend this to anyone who hates Religious people and loves to see kids getting in trouble with drugs.  A dog . .  
 Well, I guess it's been a while since I've been a college student. I'm a crusty old amateur radio hobbyist now. I guess all college texts have ridiculous prices. This book used to be the best reference I've ever seen on basic electronics for non-EE's, and even for non-engineers. It's not much of a cookbook - instead, it will make you sit down and work through the fundamentals of the circuits you're designing or adapting. The second ed. is getting long in the tooth, and since the book is used as a college text, it's preposterously overpriced. The one terrible thing about the book is that there are no answers to the (otherwise excellent) exercises, and you have to pay out again to get answers to the questions you're not sure about. It will be interesting to see what the 3rd ed. looks like. Maybe I'll start a web site and publish the answers online 
 This program is evil. It is easy to get sucked into watching Gantz, because of the unique and inexplicable situation that the main characters, who have all died, find themselves in. They have gone to purgatory, and purgatory is like an all-too-real video game. One feels compelled to continue on with the series to begin to answer some of these mysteries.  The art direction is decent. Visually, it doesn't look cheap. The English voice acting is embarassingly bad, especially the main character, but not as bad as the dialogue, internal and vocalized, that this character has been given to speak.   The worst thing about this series, apart from the juvenile humor about breasts and boners, is the "action" scenes. These inevitably play out with the people in danger standing around arguing and philosophizing about what to do, when the obvious course of action is to take the guns that are in their hands, and shoot at their alien adversaries like there is no tomorrow. After you witness a few of these frustrating situations on the video, if you don't feel like banging your head against the wall, you are made of stronger stuff than I.   This first set of episodes leaves the viewer with more questions than answers, and more frustration than satisfaction. Save yourself the pain. 
 Having just returned from three weeks in China and Taiwan, I can report that the Lonely Planet Guide to Taiwan is generally helpful and reliable, but it's hardly the ideal guide and often is entirely counter-intuitive.  For instance, there is a section on p. 31 consiting of five paragraphs on the topic of population.  And yet nowhere in that section do the authors tell us what the population of Taiwan actually is.  For that bit of information, we have to look at a sidebar on p. 19 entitled "Fast Facts."  There seems to be a presumption that the traveller will read through the entire guide from front to back, rather than use the book as a reference guide.  Similarly, the maps are less than ideal, and the spare use of color plates does little to provide any real information (color maps of Taipei would have been far more useful).  Given that the authors judge the National Palace Museum as a "must-see" (and they're right about that), it would have been nice if they had mentioned that the museum will be undergoing major renovations from 2004-2006 (providing a website address for the museum also would've been helpful).  Unfortunately, this seems to be the best option at present, and one could do worse.  If you're going to Taiwan, I would encourage you to buy a copy, but be warned: it will not be one of the better guides you've ever used 
 Or write.  Or, for that matter, think critically on the key issues of the day---wealth creation, unemployment, the war against folks who want to commandeer 747s and crash them into skyscrapers.   It is a Serious time, an age of great peril for our country, for our democracy, and for liberty in the world. It is a time for Serious men, with Serious ideas.  Sadly, Moore is not one of them.   Now: Michael Moore presents himself as the Angry Wild Man of the Left: brave, ferocious, caustic, intellectually independent, bound and beholden to no one---asking the questions that need to be asked, dammit, and the Devil take the hindmost!   What this self-anointed Crusader of the Common Man has produced is another story entirely: a kind of Populist Leftism for Dummies, written in crayon and featuring giganto-font type with SUPER-SIZED margins (evidently for the remedial reader, who would be content with pictures)---which ain't the only thing Super-Sized about this penny-dreadful.   And dreadful it is.   Moore's unfunny screen amounts to this: Bush is evil, capitalism is evil, the System is evil, it's all a bunch of nasty white men in suits who plot to send low-income young Americans to death and dismemberment in the sands of Iraq while Bush and Bin Laden hob-nob it over caviar back at the ranch in Crawford.   And that's about it: which is saying a lot, really all you can fit in a "book" half eaten up by blank space and margins.   The truth is, everyone knows a Michael Moore: he's the cabdriver from Hell, who picks you up at Newark and launches into a 20-minute harangue---with you, the helpless captive audience, sealed off behind dirty plexi-glass, trapped like a crazed weasel in a steel coffin hurtling along the New Jersey Turnpike at 90 miles an hour---a frothy, spittle-spewing sermon about how filthy New York is, how corrupt the politicians are, how things would be different if somebody took the "Man" down.   He's the slobby sales guy who gets in two hours late every day, and leaves well before 4:00---and who holds court at the water cooler, letting you know how many deals he would be locking down if only Management---you know, dude, the "Man"---would get its sh*t together.   He's like a shabbier, slightly psychotic, downscale version of Uncle Buck, who pops in for the holiday unexpected and clogs up the toilet.   So if "Dude" is meant as humor, it falls flat: the writing is stale, shrill, and strident, the sort of thing the mean local drunk spits out after a wild Night Train bender. Nah, this isn't humor: it's pure political invective, meant to elicit a "Preach it, Brother!" from its target audience.  But it's a little tough for Joe Six-Pack---Moore's intended reader, evidently---struggling to pay off his cable bills, fretting about the wife having to work graveyards, wondering how he's going to afford medical care---to yell "Preach it, Brother Moore!" from the sidelines, even as Brother Moore is preaching it from the back of a stretch limousine. Or a super-duper-stretch, in Moore's case.  And frankly, that's not even the saddest part of this walking affront to decency: I am certain that beneath all the calculated bluster and outrage, Moore doesn't believe a word he writes.   Moore spouts rebellion, civil unrest, rage against the Machine: he talks a good game.   But let's face it: the only street-theater he sits up late at night planning are midnight raids against the local, hapless In-and-Out Burger. Like PT Barnum, Moore is relentless, tireless self-promoter: he's hungry---he needs to feed!---and like the fat dorky kid in the back row in that political science class, he'll say anything to get attention.  The worst of it is really this: Ideas---however incoherent---have Consequences. Moore's greatest crime with "Dude, Where's my Country?" isn't his banality, nor even his delight at reducing the most complex social problems to lowest common denominator insults---nor even his lack of seriousness.   It's that Moore is deeply disingenuous. Take his contention, written with utmost condescension, that his readers will never be rich. No chance. No way, not in America!   That's not just wrong: it's deeply dangerous. If anything, Moore himself is proof of the American dream: a scruffy, uneducated, possibly unhinged refrigerator of a man, who went out into the jungles of corporate america with some cheap movie equipment and made some snarkily funny documentaries. Who plugged into the Zeitgeist of the age, who made one barbaric yawp after another, and got attention.   And made millions.   Now: the real conclusion from "Dude" should be---if Michael Moore can do it, my God---so can I!  Instead, we get whiney finger-pointing: it's the Man's fault you're living hard, eating catfood, and begging for spare change. It's not *you*, not your responsibility: the System did it, Dude.   Sartre once summed up his philosophy of existentialism by saying that Man should live so as not to contribute to the suffering. Moore takes the opposite tack: he's like Samara, the creepy-crawly little dead girl from the well in Ring: he never sleeps, he never stops, he'll never stop eating, and as a result---at least, without a damned good editor---he'll never stop spewing.   So is it too much to hope for that Moore, who can be a prodigiously talented, incandescently cynical filmmaker, when he wants to be---is it too much to ask that he will one day put his abilities to good use, really lay down a wicked little polemic that sets out a true battle plan for change?   Fat chance.  JS 
 OK... this book has action. However, it seemed to me that the action sequences were not written for the readers but rather to satisfy Author's need to be tedious and verbose.   Here is a question I want to throw at the people who read this book and gave it more than 2 stars.   "How did the military test Supernova to see whether it works or not in the first place before it was stolen?"   I sure as hell would love to know the answer to this question from the readers who are hyping this book and also the author himself.   This book is trash. Dump it and move on to the next one on your list 
 As a US citizen, I am both embarrassed and angry.  I am embarrassed that anyone in the Federal government, and particularly anyone with ties to the military, would treat remote viewing with any credibility whatsoever.  I am also angry that my tax dollars have been used to support programs of this type.  One does not have to be a "hard core skeptic" to understand that McConeagle has found a niche for himself deluding others about his so-called abilities.  The basic difference between McConeagle and other charlatans is that (1) my tax money helped pay for his activities, and (2) his "work" may have influenced some important decisions.  No "psychic" or "remote viewer" has ever provided signficiant assistance in any criminal investigation.  They simply stand back and make general assertions about the "accuracy" of their work after the fact.  The same is true of MConeagle, who fails to offer shred of credible evidence that he has ever successfully performed remote viewing.  He has hand-picked some events for which he can at least claim that there was some similarity between his "viewing" and the actual circumstances.  It's amazing how a rough sketch can not only fit the profile of the superstructure of a sinking ship, but can also be interpreted as the collapsed walls of a multi-story building destroyed by a car bomb.  As a matter of fact, I think it looks quite a bit like the unfinished Death Star from "Star Wars", too.  I'm giving this book one star instead of zero stars simply because I think that it's important for citizens to read this book and then take political action to ensure that programs like this are never funded again 
 This is a nice, easy going book.  However the claim which the book makes on the cover that it, "supplants all others, even the immensely successful 'History of Western Philosophy' by Bertrand Russell," is absurd.  Russell has a deep understand of philosophy, Gottlieb does not.  This book is a superficial (but enjoyable) account of philosophy up to the Renaissance.  If you've already read Russell (or have otherwise studied philosophy), this book is of little value.  If you have not, reading Gottlieb might encourage you to read the real thing.  
 This book is very light for those who are engaged in Science of the Mind or Louise Hay's readings. It doesn't say anything new to what we already know. I wouldn't recommend buying it. 
 This dvd was released everywhere in the world with the rare tv special "sports goofy in soccormania".     A 30 min special.   It was removed from the american release.  Why they did this is unknown.  The dvd lost 30 min and we lost a rare cartoon the rest of the world gets but not america!  Thanks alot disney 
 Ms. Reichs has lost the recipe, or at least the focus and formula that has brought her success prior to Cross Bones. Although not nearly as bad as P. Cornwell's last two or three misfires, Reichs is way wide of her usual high mark here. In this offering, Temperance is out of character, out of both style and focus, and the story is just overly convoluted and circuitous; a yarn that meanders around heading every which way except toward a finished product. Even the writing is unfamiliar and not of the same voice Reichs has maintained in her many Brennan novels. Having finally given up on Cornwell, after many years, I'll hang in there for one more Temperance Brennan dig; everyone is entitled to one gong 
 The bars look like mudpies, are very dry, and all three "flavors" taste the same, meaning that they don't have much flavor at all. I much prefer certain flavors of Balance bars. The only good thing about these Clif bars is that I don't get hungry for several hours after eating one 
 As some of the reviews below suggest (albeit approvingly), this is a one-sided rehash of the modern cliches about this era:  the Christians retaking their land are evil and intolerant; the Muslims who violently seized these lands in the first place are noble and benificent.  I look forward to reading Mr. Reston's forthcoming book on the bloody Muslim conquests of the Middle East, northern Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, Turkey and the Balkans, and their forcible conversion of millions throughout those lands, which were once predominantly Christian.  That should be a ripping good read.  I give it two stars because at least the prose is lively 
 There is nothing really new in this book. The advice and tips in it are the same old stuff that you have already seen a hundred times. Don't burn bridges; network; keep your chin up; be prepared for rejection. A lot of it is psychobabble handholding about soul searching and knowing what you really want to do etc. etc. I suppose if you have not yet seen this stuff in Dear Abbey it may be useful to you.  Some of the advice seems to be cut right out of a recruiter's handbook, and is actually bad advice. Here is an example from the book. The author is talking about how to update your resume to enhance your chances of landing an interview. The book advises to keep it recent, "limit your list of work experience to the last fifteen years" to avoid appearing old, I guess. And yet a main thread in the book points out that your long experience is a selling point. If you fracture your resume, you will end up having to explain the holes in it anyway. I would have advised to include the entire history, but keep the older information very brief.  Here is a particularly disturbing comment. "Skip listing the bachelor's degree you got in 1950 (or if you do mention it, leave off the year you graduated)". So what do you do if the job you are applying for requires that degree?   I just served on a search committee to find a director for our local library, and we reviewed dozens of resumes. In every case where the candidate left off the degree dates it aroused suspicion about what that candidtate was trying to hide, like maybe the fact that they are over 50 years old. The age was not an issue with us, but the trickery was. Don't do this. It is a red flag. And even if you do get an interview based on such a dishonest resume, you had better dye your hair and go for the extreme makeover as well so that they will not notice that you are old when you show up for the interview. And when they realize that you have tricked them into interviewing you, the trick may backfire. This is just bad advice.  I was hoping to find a lot more real-world, practical information in the book and was disappointed 
 This is one of the few instances that I have found in which the movie version of a novel is better than the novel itself.  This is a contrived work through and through, and one can understand why Bertolucci completely changed the ending for the movie.  Moravia here displays his utter sentimentality with an admixture of arm-chair psychology that is truly laughable....and this is probably his best novel 
 I thought it was good and sad. Sad because she didn't find her real mom. I think people should read it because it tells a lesson and it tells a happy ending 
 Wannabe tough guy vocals, repetitive guitars, weak drums, and flaccid lyrics deppreciate a rather overrated band. Avoid.  
    After years of reading "true crime" books , I have learned to appreciate the way in which a good author can take a marginally interesting crime story and turn it into a frantic page turner ...one you just can't put down until the last page is finished. Another skill a good author posseses is to find at least some redemptive quality in an otherwise tragic crime. In "Severed" , Mr. Gilmore manages to do the exact opposite. Here is a crime that has all of the elements ripe for a scary , gripping ride through the seedy world of 1940's LA. Instead in turns out to be a jumbled nearly incomprehensible cure for insomia. The narrative is so disjointed .....every few paragrahs I found myself backtracking to see if I could figure out what was going on or who the author was talking about. All the book seems to consist of are questionable "accounts" from every joe that ever gave Elizabeth Short a lift or bought her a drink ,randomly spliced together in no partciular order, coupled with some stories of competing detectives.....blah , blah.     And yes, some overly and unnecessary gruesome photos are included. The whole thing seems like a cheap and sleazy attempt to profit from someone else's horrible tragedy. The author should be ashamed 
 This book bears litthe relevance to the 'original' fourth edition book of the same name. There is no coordination with the text. Most of the concepts are explained in terms of economics not computer science, I have to wonder if the whole idea is a gross mistake or a scam. I feel cheated 
 Too juvenile for adults, and not likely that children would really enjoy it 
 This book may seem like a great intro book to those well-versed in Telecommunications. However, the book does a terrible job of explaining terms and jargon. A word, for example, will be used for several pages before being defined. There are very few practical examples and metaphors to illustrate concepts and add interest to the book. There are no photographs here either, only basic illustrations which do not clarify concepts, but instead require explaination.  All of my classmates are disgusted that we are required to use this text. Plans are being set for a post-semester Essential-Guide-to-Telecommunications bonfire 
 THIS REVIEW WAS WRITTEN BECAUSE AMAZON RECOMMENDED THIS DVD BECAUSE OF MY HISTORY.  The story line is interesting.  A woman becomes involved with a guard who was at her husband's execution.  But the reason behind the realtionship is one of desparation.  For this to work, you need to have actors that this is reasonable.  But Hallie Berry is just too beautiful and they have done nothing to make her look any less beautiful.  As presented, she would have no problem attracting a variety of desirable men.  There are a number of actress who would be physically better suited or they could have just made Hallie look plain but no, they had to not only go with the flavour of the year and make her look glamourous too boot.  Additionally, they give her a child that would never be hers and her husbands.  But was choosen again to further the storyline.  This is an interesting story that was ruined by casting for dollars.  While beautiful actresses have played plain characters (see Ann Margaret in Return of the Soldier) but they toned down their looks to be more realistic.  This was not done for this movie.  Therefore, my final analysis is good story but unrealistic execution 
 puddle of mud the nirvana of 2000 god these guys try to be tough hiding behind distorted and swearing and wearing their caps backwards OWWWW big men i can't cope with it killing me i think i'm gonna wet my pants at how lame this band sounds after their hit single "she hates me" has drifted away..and it's replaced with more media twoodle which will get the clones with their hoodies and chains in their pockets and baggy trousers going crazy and wetting their pants NOT COOL NOT ROCK AND ROLL AT ALL  are puddle of mudd really trying to re-vive grunge that they have to rip off all the riffs of the great bands i.e pixies, screaming trees etc  another band that nicks stuff just like oasis  hell i had to wind up the oasis fans aswell  i hate puddle of puke  avoided buy anything by the pixies, screaming trees the cult before this  only if your a ten year old hoodie year clone then you will think it's the greatest album ever made  well i'm a 19 year old and i think it sucks!!!!!!!!! 
 Although i am not a hugh country music fan,this album is a good listen    very well done    nice song 
 After  all Ive heard about this book was expecting something better.  Much of the book is dull and boring.  Not very well written.   On the other hand its very easy reading and at times enjpyable.  If you're looking to learn something about Japan there isnt very much in there you wouldn't be better off finding somewhere else that has more detail and accuracy.  He kinds of glosses over anything worth learning 
 I was truly annoyed by his random writing style and the book's lousy layout. Look at the cover---the inside is just as chaotic. I bailed after 15 pages or so. Too bad, as  he has some good things to say, but it wasn't worth the effort. As a design advocate I'm amazed that his book designs are so ineffective and shoddy. He loves design but not graphic design?.. 
 Recently i've been looking to buy a cheap curling iron. i came across this one and thought vidal sassoon was a brand that's been around for a while. well. after "curling" my hair it just looked like i poorly straightend it. seriously. i am taking this back immediatly. don't waist your money or your time on this. maybe if you have thinner hair it would work. i dont know. 
 Brainwashing is not a good way to educate young people about the world around them.  This is a blatant effort to wrench young children's emotions and therefore their perspectives  about the eeeevil effects of "global warming" by engaging their sympathies.  The only plot is brainwashing, using penguins as the straw man.  The penguin world is factually well documented if one is interested in teaching children about them.  As a responsible parent, I would avoid this entirely. 
 I was hoping to find some new Christmas crafts to use for decorating this year. I was a bit dissapointed to see that most of the crafts were ones that I've already seen in some older books. I was hoping to get some new ideas. The way the decorations were set up in the book inspired me, though. The rooms looked like an old-fashioned Christmas from my childhood 
 My overall recommendation is to read Bryson's brilliantly funny recent works, then go back to less recent works, then stop before you get to this one.  As other discerning reviewers have noted (especially Amer-Aussie, whose spot-on review you really must mark as 'helpful'), Bryson looks for the worst in America and, surprise, he finds it.  Sure, there's much that's funny here, but the humor gets swallowed up by the mean.  Let me add one more observation, which amazingly seems to have eluded all:  one of Bryson's worst habits--even worse than his penchant for telling you where he is politically (he hates Republicans)--is his smug disdain for and ridicule of religion, particularly Christianity.  Happily, Bryson's later books show a maturity absent in this one 
 The film was good and I liked the fact that it had cast interviews.  Still, the DVD could have had the making of shaft, deleted scenes and any other extras that come with the making of a movie.  The fact that it didn't was disappointing.  Hopefully one day, there will be a collectors edition of Shaft that will show all that went into concept & making of the movie.  
 Gleick would like us to feel that everything, EVERYTHING is going faster. Ultimately, whetever you are doing now, it will happen faster tomorrow.  Sure, life is getting faster, but that's not the ultimate goal. People want to do MORE, they do not want to simply go faster.   To ignore the need for more is to miss the entire point of why we want to do some things faster: so that we have the leisure to do other things more slowly! I would like to finish my work faster so I have more time to cook a gourmet meal. I like to commute via bicycle so I can combine my workout and commute, but I certainly don't rush!  This book has a lot of anecdotal data, which is all very interesting, but doesn't amount to much. Some of the individual chapters give very detailed analysis of specific people or technologies, but Gleick never pulls it all together.  In short, interesting data, but not enough to support his position. And certainly not nearly enough to appease a skeptic 
 The portrayal of the Bobo in this book, and, more importantly, the fascination and inner glee with which many will gobble up this portrayal, seem light-hearted and fun, but herein lies the reason that Dubya managed to win over the hearts and minds of good, average, working-class people everywhere. Shockingly similar to Brooks' depictions is the conversatives' and right-wing fundamentalists' portrayal of liberals and Democrats: as effete, latte-loving milquetoasts, who know little to nothing about the travails and tribulations of hard-working, ordinary folk. The resulting "cultural wars," based on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and separation of church and state, served as the perfect mask to the dark agenda that Bush and the right-wingers have planned: privatization of social security, revamping of the tax and bankruptcy codes to benefit large corporations and the ultra-wealthy, the destruction of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and the list goes on and on.  Although I will admit to having enjoyed many of the anectodes in this book, it must be pointed out that they appeal only on the basest, most superficial level, and for this I am ashamed. Diverted by all the gadgets, toys, and conveniences of modern-day living, and the incessant feed of so-called ideas from a putatively liberal media, the Bobos and the primates who poke fun at them remain blissfully oblivious to the utter economic and environmental disaster that we're headed toward.  Instead of spending your money on this book, I recommend that you sit down, find some well-written blogs, and read some (free!) critical commentary on politics and the state of our country, and then try to formulate your own ideas about our society today; in other words, THINK for yourself 
 I am not too happy with this item.  It has a handle, yet is heavy enough to hurt if a toddler drops it on their foot.  It is difficult to reach inside to get the shapes out.  And the vertical placement of the holes is difficult to use.  Other than that, it is attractive looking and constructed well 
   You know, sometimes you just hate the amazon rating system. Parts of this ponderous tome deserve a one. Others deserve, oh, maybe a three-and-a-half.   Well, everyone who dislikes Harold Bloom points out that he's pompous. So what. Pompous people are amusing. Besides, you have to be pompous to write 745 page book, and expect people to read it, while also whining about the lack of reading done these days. Besides which, I would not have picked up this book without being attracted by the extraordinary pompousness of the title, and the idea which I thought the book propounded.   Boy, oh, boy, I thought, as I staggered from the Barnes & Noble, carrying the book, a huge fat volume with a pompous title. This could be fun to read, because pompous people can be very, very witty, and interesting. You have to have a sort of laughing in your own sleeve humor, I assumed, to propound such things. It also takes guts, and courage, which I honestly admit that Mr. Bloom has.   A feeling of alarm began to take over me, however, when I began to read the book. I assumed, along with his thoughts on Will's plays, that he would skillfully, masterfully propound his theory on HOW and and perhaps WHY Shakespeare kindly invented the personality as we know it today. However, this did not seem forthcoming.   Instead, Bloom happily insisted that Will did so- you know, he "just did". The references to this theory seem to something like "If Will hadn't been, we wouldn't be like we are today."   Well! That was really simple. I think any idiot could say that Shakespeare has had a HUGE impact on our culture. Thus, if he HADN'T written, that impact would be GONE! Basically, that is the feeble idea Bloom bases his entire theory on. Hey, I might even agree with Bloom, if he had actually presented this Theory- instead of the lame idea that, well, yeah, Will kinda changed the way we now live.   There was a hugely amusing aspect to this book. That was Mr. Bloom's insane fixation with Falstaff and Hamlet. For fun, I opened the book at complete random, and in three out of three, found Hamlet and Falstaff mentioned twice together, and Hamlet once by himself. This is an acurrate summing up of Bloom's slavish devotion to these characters. NO ONE is better than these characters, NO ONE can accurately be measured until the ruler of Fal/Hal have been applied.    In completely different plays, SOMEHOW one, or both of these two are mentioned. At first amusing, one begins to doubt Bloom's sanity. Also, his honesty, because some comparisons are so strained, you wondered "So, as this guy PAID each time he used these guys' names?" If so, he was rich before the book was even published.   What I absolutely give a one, is Bloom's skill as a writer, which is this: nil.    Nil, nada, nothing.   Although you would think through his intensive reading, our Educated Author would have some idea of how to write, he doesn't. He rambles. Endlessly. I don't pinpoint that as an utter fault. Yet he can never, ever, ever, gather his ideas together clearly, and succintly. As a critic, this is the The Fault. He also makes hundreds of statements, apparently expecting you to simply accept them with no argument. Pompousness I can take. Sheer, encrusted, old-man arrogance I cannot.   I would love, love, love to have C.S.Lewis alive today. If Bloom's books are bloated, Lewis's are positively anorexic. Yet Lewis puts forth more ideas and logic in a chapter than Bloom can vomit up in a lifetime. The keen, cutting wit of Lewis could cut through the excess, and show Bloom as he is- an old man, infatuated with himself, and how many words he can place on the paper. As a critic, as he is hailed to be, Bloom is almost nothing. Even the ideas that seem orignal are never actually discussed- the other ideas wander on like those guys in that poem, the Ancient Mariner.    What amazes me is this. In the plays Bloom seems least fond of, he sometimes comes across as vaguely coherent. As evidenced by the slim 17 pages allocated to Romeo and Juliet, he obviously doesn't like a play the average person "gets". However, his idea that Shakespeare HAD to kill Mercutio was stated simply, and actually sparked returning ideas in the reader.   Bloom identifies himself with Falstaff. Yet, I would liken him more to Mercutio- in this sense. Here follows a quotation from Romeo and Juliet. The nurse speaks in reference to Mercutio, who has just been his delightfully rude self.   Nurse: I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his ropery?   Romeo: A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.   Only Mercutio is funny, charming even. Bloom is tedious. I do not say: Do not read this book. Its influence has been too wide not to at least have a vague idea of what this man says...over...and over...again. Bloom may be a terrible critc and writer, but he has got himself noticed, probably because of the fact that so few people ARE as well-read as he is.   So read the book for the ideas. Don't be surprised, however, at the very few ideas presented throughout such a large book. Orginality and creativity were obviously never this man's talent. The few he has, he clings to like leech, and repeats- repeatedly ( ha, ha)  
 This was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read... I say attempted because I could not finish it.  This book was simply not worth my time.  Hallie was immature, self-centered, shrewish and selfish and we are supposed to believe that Jason found this attractive?  I cannot believe Catherine Coulter wrote this trype.  The situation of the two of them living in the same house during this time period was ridiculous.  And this book was an RT award nominee !!  What were those people thinking  
 Agreed, the fan IS there, but I must admit they are actually singing well in the actual Solesmes style (based on these samples).  I have heard superb chant and frighteningly bad chant.  This is not as bad as it gets I assure you.  Try to find something from a Seminary or Monastery 
 I wanted to like this book---I really did. In fact, I wanted to like it so much that I kept plodding all the way to the end despite the fact that I found it boring most of the time. I love books about cross-country travel, but this one had so much of what I considered just "padding" to fill pages. There were a few gems in the book, but not enough for me to recommend it to someone. It's as if he felt a compulsion to record all of his thoughts regardless of how inane they were or how meaningless they would be to the reader. The book represents a great concept poorly executed. 
 What a huge disappointment and waste of money!  Janet Evanovich should be ashamed of herself, and I'll know not to buy any book by the co-author, Leanne Banks.  The 2 primary characters fell in love way too fast and for no good reason.  The only reason this rates even 1 star is because there was some mildly amusing dialog here and there.  "Pugg" should have been named "Pigg" because he was a disgusting pig and not at all likeable.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!  I can't say it enough 
 I'm not impressed with this book.  It was written quite a while ago.  It's not as true to life as most of Heinlein's work... this is just low-brow work for him...  Don't read it.  It's not worth your time 
 As a new Maple user, but a sophisticated software developer, I think the tutorial is better that comes with Maple. Going through that tutorial is faster, and it covers the same things as the book, but without errors.   It puzzles me why the package tutorial is only available for the old style Classic Worksheet. I suppose nobody bothered to convert it over? Why not? It's just a bit of stuff in plotting and some expanded stuff.   The book is OK, but I'll second what the teacher posted. Way too many errors. I was able to get past those errors faster than most would, because I treated it like a coding exercise, knowing what was likely to have been screwed up.   However, those errors highlighted something basic that I expected would be there in Maple. Why is it that a little highlighted popup parameter display doesn't show when you enter a recognized command? It's basic to things like Visual C++, Excel, etcetera. If that was present, then errors like this book has wouldn't matter much.   Similarly, I would expect a sophisticated tool like this to have automatic auto-complete with a popup dropdown list for multiple hits for any function that's loaded into the system. It's not like the names of things are easy to predict or not arbitrary. This is essentially a coding library with access to function names that people made up over the years. Some function names make lots of sense, others don't. So that should be better.   The book covers the ground. A 5 for coverage. But so does the tutorial seem to rate a 5 for coverage.   Another gripe is who on earth decided to print all those miniaturized screen shots that are so light? This really detracts from the book's quality and makes it seem cheap. At minimum, screen shots like that should be rendered in high contrast black and white.   This book is slipshod for a first edition. For a third edition, it's really not acceptable. 
 The game of golf is racist and sexist.  I get it.  In fact, I got it after the first twenty times Sounes whines about it 
 ABC-CLIO STEALS FROM THEIR AUTHORS, PAYS THEM NOTHING, AND ROBS THEM BLIND. DO NOT PURCHASE BOOKS FROM THEM OR FROM THEIR SUBSIDIARIES. BOYCOTT THESE THIEVES!! 
 I was very excited that one of My "boys" had bought Me this chair, but when it finally arrived, I was very disppointed. the motors are semi weak, it does NOT feel like 10 motors more like 6 if that. the chair's pic is also very unrealistic in My opinion, the seating it not attached, its a pad, very cheaply made not worth the price at all... I wouldnt pay more then 80.00 for this chair! 
 I bought this cd thinking the music from the movie was going to be on it.  NOT EVEN CLOSE.  Don't bother getting this cd, its not even worthed.  I wasted major money and Amazon should've had the songs on preview, but they didn't help either.  A Shame 
 Lots of big words, but little substance. I give it an "A" for effort, but the outcome is a big "D-" and that is generous. 
 I am embarassed to admit that I saw this video several years ago; I give it 2 stars.  I suppose the film quality is excellent, but in my opinion, a waste of film to make this.  The plot is forgettable, and, at the risk of offending those who like it, "I spent two hours out of my life watching this, and can't get them back again for something constructive. 
 I'm disapointed that I'm never getting back the 99 minutes of my life I wasted on watching "The Descent."  It's just as stupid as the Project Greenlight movie, "Feast" (horror/sci fi).  This one definitly goes on the list of movies I wish I DIDN'T watch.  VERY predictable...tried working off of sheer gore...and when that didn't work...well...I was kind of cheering for them all to die.  ;-)  The best part about this movie:  I didn't pay to rent it, my sister did!  Hahahaha...  P.S.  PICK SOMETHING ELSE...ANYTHING OTHER THAN THIS IS BETTER 
 This isn't just a romance.  It's worse.  Take a generic romance novel, with lame characters, and meld it with an episode of the old Knight Rider television show, and you've got it.  How and why could an author capable of the humor and wisdom that we see in the Stephanie Plum books, put her name on a book like this? 
 Maybe this book would be a good thing for an older child who could understand that the behavior described in the book might be meant as something funny and not be OK to try, but I don't plan to read it to my 2 1/2 year old.  It features a big sister who is having a tough adjustment to a new little brother (so far so good), but it goes into descriptions of a degree of negativity and acting out that I am not really looking to introduce my child to or read about over and over.  The new big sister is pictured leaning over the baby's crib saying:  "I hate you. You're ugly."  In our family, we just don't talk to each other like that.  The girl makes up a story for her brother in which she says he is a germ, a zero, like dust under the bed, like dirt...If my child had come up with doing this sort of thing on her own, I'd have to think hard about whether reading a story like this would be helpful.  Since she hasn't come up with this kind of behavior, I don't really want to plant the seeds by reading this together.  I thought Susan Winter's A Baby Just Like Me was much better, and my daughter loves that book.  I also liked Geraldine's Baby Brother 
  It is unfair to judge a children's film by the same non-technical standards you would judge a film made for a more mature audience. That said, I had a difficult time figuring out the intended target audience for Disney"s "A Far Off Place", an odd mix of "Alaska", "Walkabout", and "Blue Lagoon". Since each of these films had a different target audience (children for "Alaska", adults for "Walkabout", and teens for "Blue Lagoon"), "A Far Off Place" suffers from a poorly matched and confused mix of story elements, the attempt to appeal to multiple target audiences ultimately makes it unappealing to all audiences.  Despite some positive comments on this database, "A Far Off Place" did not impress audiences at the time of its 1993 release and has generated little interest since. Based on stories by South African writer Laurens van der Post, "A Far Off Place" is the story of three teenagers: Nonnie (Reece Witherspoon as a girl raised on South African game preserve), Harry (Ethan Randall as a visiting American boy) and Sorel Bok (as their young Bushman guide Xhabbo) who attempt to evade a gang of ivory poachers by fleeing into the Kalahari Desert. Ethan Randall is actually Ethan Embry from "Can't Hardy Wait".  Although recommended for ages eight and up, most younger viewers will be deeply disturbed by the early scenes, where the family's idyllic life is ended by a night attack on their home by the poachers. The house is burned and the parents are murdered. And more mature viewers will be deeply disturbed by the next scene where Nonnie turns into Rambo and kills most of gang in a sequence credible only to a horrified eight-year old.   At this point it begins to look like "Walkabout", a story of an Australian girl, her little brother, and a young Aborigine on his ritual journey to manhood. In a significant deviation from the book Xhabbo's wife does not accompany the group into the desert.   "Walkabout's" more adult theme of interracial sexual awakening is replaced by a "Blue Lagoon" romance between the two white teenagers, a reflection of the film's narrower values and more modest ambitions.  The scenes shot in the desert are almost the equal of "Alaska" for scenic beauty but "Alaska"s" more realistic survival challenges are superior to the blend of survival skills and mystic powers that Xhabbo demonstrates to his two companions during their journey. There is an element of "The Gods Must Be Crazy" in this clash of cultures but the film does not go very far (bad pun intended) with the concept.   Both "Alaska" and "A Far Off Place" insert the element of poacher violence into the journey, to the detriment of the basic story. 'Walkabout" did not need this and found sufficient story material in the enormity of the survival experience.  Bok is excellent as the young Bushman and Randall/Embry's performance is solid if unexceptional. Those interested in Witherspoon's early work would be better served checking out her great debut performance in "The Man In the Moon" and avoiding this career misstep. Those looking for a children/family story should stick with "Alaska".  Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child 
 This bookstand, despite the description, is not suitable for heavy books. If you put heavy books on this, the stand that props up the whole unit is likely to snap off. 
 Readers beware - this is not the complete text of The Wreck of the Golden Mary.  It only contains the first part of the frame story written by Dickens, leaving out the collaborative center section and the conclusion, written by Wilkie Collins, in which the passengers are rescued! 
 I have been a big fan of New Found Glory since "All Downhill From Here" came out. I bought Catalyst and loved it, so I bought all their old albums, loved them all too. I found out New Found Glory had a new cd coming out.....couldnt wait. So i go out and buy this cd the day it came out, I was that excited, I brought it home thinking "all right, this will be awesome!!!" Over the next 40-some minutes I experienced the biggest dissapointment of my life. Every song was a ballad, there were no fun songs like "Hit or Miss" "Forget My Name" "The Great Houdini" "Your Biggest Mistake" or even an amazingly well written song like "No News Is Good News." I basically got a whole cd of "I Don't Wanna Know" which in my mind was New Found Glory's worst song to date. I listened to this cd once, and I barely made it through to the end and when it was over, I seriously considered throwing it in the trash. This band has died, after all those years of fun and great songs, they have been destroyed. I will do my best to erase this peice from my mind so I can enjoy their old albums again 
 I bought the book because recently I have been into the personal mastery thing like increasing your memory, reading better, and so on.  Before I bought the book, I read the preface, and the the promises in it did not deliver.  Before I go on I assure you that unlike some reviewers I read this 390 some pages of this book.  This is definitely one of those books that Mortimor Adler in their book "How to Read a Book" describes as books that should challege you.  And quite a challenge it is.  Frances Yates assumes that the reader have knowledge of many things.  Like foriegn languages such as Latin, Italian, this book is rife with it and most of it untranslated.  Frances Yates also assumes that the reader know of various philosophical idiosycrasies of the known history of man.   The title of the book suggest that it is a book about the history of the art of memory and it is not.  I agree with the earlier review of hglee of Avoldone Estates in GA. Definitely pass on this one and move on and forget the title of the book 
 This book is very ineresting, accurate accounts of the battles fought during this period, This book brought back memories of the winter that we had to endure plus the Germans. I was there for most of the time and attest to the worst winter of the century. 
 I guess it is a good market now for anything about Islam. This is all old news, looks like reworked columns. Not insightful, not fresh, just tired old stuff mainly about middle to upper class women. Save your money.   
 This book was terrible!  DON'T waste your money!!!! There are many other good parenting books out there by people who are MUCH more credible than Ezzo.  Even though some say this book works for them, there are many more who know that it is a slippery slope. Visit www.ezzo.info/ BEFORE YOU BUY THIS BOOK!!!  Parents Beware. 
 I bought this for a woman who is a small size eight, one of those people who is just a touch too big to wear a size six, and normal medium sized clothes usually run very loose.  Not this tiny shirt. It looked all right when she opened the package, but when she wore it, it made the kid look as if she had flub.  It was inexpensive enough that I won't bother returning it, but the item, although well made, was sized so small as to be useles 
 According to the author, Australian history is 200 years of racism, sexism, oppression, dominance, exploitation. The victims are aborginal people, women, the early convicts -- and the environment.  The villains, of course, are white males. When the Australian economy dips, the fault lies with the U.S., world capitalism and neoliberalism. When the Australian economy thrives, it just means Aussies can waste more money on bourgeois geegaws. The tone is humorless, unrelenting, shrill, one-sided -- a prime example of what one Australian referred to as "black armband history". 
 Just as a note, I picked up this book at a local used bookstore, in one of the boxes by the exit listed as "FREE." I guess that would be a sort of portent for what was to come next.  The plot is simple and almost cliche enough: ten people gathering for a 30-year college reunion. Ten different stories basically, plus one recount of a dead graduate. These people are in their early fifties, with each little story/chapter reminiscing on their lives after college graduation.  As a previous reviewer has stated, yes, the major flaw with this book that had the potential to be quite good is that all these people are being whiny, whiny, whiny. Now. Of course, everybody has their own right to be sad and whatnot, but these people seem to take it one step further. I'm gonna just get to the point and state that I absolutely abhor the women in this book (except for two). The rest, sadly, are basically just emotionless bitches in some way or another: one thinks she's 'incapable' of falling in love (and note, she was an art major, haha), another is some blonde with 2 husbands because she wants it all, another, I think, gets what she deserves after cheating on her husband. And so forth. And the men? The men, they just basically sit there, brood a little, and take this BS from the women. Not that I'm saying to go and beat the gals up, but at some point, a guy will have to realize that he was being f***ed over by this lady, true love or not, and has to move on and stop wasting precious time over what has already been done.  So if this is adulthood, or rather, being middle-aged--a bleak overview of their failed love lives so far and nothing else--then I think I'm gonna kill myself before I turn forty. The ending was simply ridiculous and not really an ending at all. The conclusion, the characters, it all just made me angry. It could be that O'Brien's intention was to pick the saddest group of lovestruck losers you've ever met to poke fun at them. But if your some heartbroken idiot who can't get over your unrequited-love situation and wish to indulge in a story that shares your pain, this is the book for you. Now, on a personal note, I've known love too, and experienced its pain, but this is just ABSURD. If your fifty, feeling sorry for yourelf, and still aching over what happened years back, stop watching Lifetime and go read up on people who REALLY suffer; our fellow humans in third-world areas and countries that practice political oppression 
 This is the worst book in a long time I've tried to read and get a story out of it.  Ms. Steele rambles on for chapter after chapter---and not much of anything happens!!!  It's just plain BORING!  About 1/3 through, the book went into the trash.  After reading Nora Roberts' books, this book is abominable.  It's back to Roberts for me 
 Only the Nolte and Streisand characters are well-drawn; the rest are stereotypes.  The dialog attempts to be moving, but is more often cliche.  Even the climactic revelation has an ersatz, made-for-TV quality to it.  Not a bad film, just not a good one 
 This book reads like a PhD dissertation and focuses on making reference after reference to dozens of other academic articles and books, much like a college research paper. I wonder if these 5 star reviews are from sociology professors because this is very dry reading and I can't imagine a casual reader being interested in reading this book at all 
 This SD would not work in my  Nikon  Coolpix S6 camera (but the Fuji and Sandisk product did 
 I am extremely happy with this product.  It works like a charm for making pancakes and they never ever stick.  It's a superb design and I am very pleased.  I would highly recommend it 
 In his book Charles Schwab pretends to have opened his brokerage for American investors but it isn't for all because the Charles Schwab BROKERAGE REQUIRES $10,000 TO OPEN A BROKERAGE ACCOUNT FOR INDIVIUAL[retail] INVESTORS.Harrisdirect,Firstrade,Optionsxpress don't require anything to open a brokerage account for individual investors 
 I, too, bought this book on the strength of the reviews here, but I'm incredibly disappointed.  The book should be titled "Common-Sense Thinking," as all of its tips are pretty elementary--in fact, I recall learning many of them in elementary school.  If you haven't ever read any other self-help or marketing books, then this book might work for you, but otherwise skip it 
 Brannagh's film version of Hamlet blows away every other version, as well as every other Shakespeare based film. It's an easy 5 stars.  Now the DVD is a different matter.  Been hearing about and waiting for this for ages! Every lame-oh shlock film holywood cranks out shows up on DVD and usually big projects like this are milked for every $ they can get with fancy packaging and special editions.    I was part of the project through which a small determined group of fans was able to bring the one season wonder "My So-Called Life" to DVD and there must be close to as large an audience for this.  WHERE IS IT 
 I used this product once and it made it necessary to completely restore my IPOD . . . after much, much hassle 
 ...Wonder why there are so many used copies of this book for sale? I would like to sell my brand new copy, but there are already seven other disappointed readers out there trying to sell theirs! This book is filled with ideas which are too ridiculously silly for words. Unless you are a Brady family member, in which case you will think these activities are "super!". I couldn't even leave this book out for friends and family to look at because the ideas are so stupid. Really. I can't believe anyone who uses this book would play more than a few of these games. If you must buy this book, please help someone out and buy a used copy 
 What a disappointment. These people are prominent, but not for their connection to Judaism. Sarah Jessica Parker chooses to have a mezzuah because she thinks it's a cute good luck charm. Many of the people highlighted had no Jewish upbringing and know little about their religion.   Boring, disappointing. I expected much more 
 I purchased this product with a novis knowledge of electronics. I could not understand one page. If you are a novis this is not the book for you 
 I bought this for my boyfriend as a present. We both love the TV show and thought the game would be as exciting (without the live crowd, of course). But the game moves slow, no models - only picking case numbers. You can compete against one another, but its not really exciting.   Maybe you should try the board game version - it can't be any worse. 
 This is a childrens book and it is supposed to teach a positive message. It should have been tiltled the "jewish Mother " tree or something. So the message was Use me and use me and use me some more and after I'm all used up, use me some more and I will be happy. Thats something we want to convey to children 
 I thought it would cover two burners.  It covers the big burner and then the edges don't sit on any heat.  If I would have looked into it better I would have known this, and I would have just bought the square one.  I was looking for a two burner one for when I was cooking for more than tw 
 George Segal is a good actor, but he is out of his element in this type of movie.  He is much better in light-hearted movies like "Fun With Dick and Jane."  The biggest disappointment is the dialog by Harold Pinter.  The characters exchange meaningless small talk at cross purposes while nothing happens, and we all get bored.    This spy movie is not even in the same league with "Day of the Jackel" and "The Odessa File."  I threw away my copy of "The Quiller Memorandum" after watching it once.  I can't imagine ever wanting to see it again 
 This could have been written by a homophobe.  The writing is perhaps adequate...the story is lacking and the characters predictible.  Nothing of value, in this book 
 I purchased one of this bikinis a couple of years ago and it lasted about 4 years before it turned into a transparent suit.I ordered 2 suits through amazon.com, but to my surprise the size 34 that I ordered in reallity is a size 28, which makes it very unconfortable to wear. So becareful when ordering. Look at the manufacturer's sizing list (VERY SMALL LETTERS) to find the right size. By the way, I had to pay to return these items because I did not read the manufaturer's sizing chart.  Not a happy camper 
 I detest this printer.  I've bought quite a few printers in my day:  Lexmark, Canon, and have been quite happy with most HP's, but this was the pits.  The first one I brought home worked fine the first time but when I tried to turn it on the next day, it wouldn't cut on.  It just died on me.  I unplugged it, plugged it back it...then it worked for a little while before dying again.  This time for good.  I returned it, got another one...same problem.  Except this time it keeps going.  All I have to do is unplug it before each and every time I turn it on.  Nice, huh?    Now I'm browsing online again and I've learned my lesson for sure.  No more el cheapo models.  I'm at least going to shell out for a midline price with some heft to it that will last me a year or two 
 Before buying this book, I wished I had read the review below that says, "For every winner there is at least one loser. For every big winner generally there are a few losers. The successful ones do study the stock market in detail and they depend upon substantial understanding of the share market system but knowledge is not enough, you need something else as well. If it was simply knowledge and easy, then arrogant inexperienced fools like this writer who are obviously extremely intelligent would have made money instead of losing it."  For one thing if the author knew at least a little bit about stop loss techniques before entering the stock market, he would not have lost so much money with his stock purchases. Maybe he is just so frustated and wants to show how smart he is and that only a random market could beat him as it did. Maybe he just wants to show that with the mathematics he had all he needed to enter the market, that no additional domain knowledge would be needed.  But then he goes on to show how technical analysis is flawed and how smart he is to see this so clearly. As the other reviewer noticed, he quickly jumps to conclusion whenever things don't follow his logic. I could list many cases in this book where his very own analysis is flawed, where his arguments are not well constructed, where the next step is avoided whenever the path could lead to a different conclusion.  I have a Theoretical Physics background and the I-know-it-best position that the author shows does not appeal to me either. Most of his humor seems to be based on a deep-seated sense of arrogance.  Yet, he is an intelligent man. One can hardly believe that this is the same person who wrote his other good books, especially the excellent "Innumeracy". Well, they were more in his domain of knowledge.   But he thinks that knowing Mathematics he knows a lot more than he knows, and a lot more than the average Joe. And the market is unforgiving to people who behave like fools and without proper domain knowledge.  I have given two stars to this book because it happens to be an interesting book for people who works with technical analysis. To find the errors and flawed arguments of an intelligent man trying to beat technical analysis is intellectually gratifying.   It may also turn out to be very enlightening to see how the market turns an intelligent man into a fool if proper domain knowledge is missing. It is a lesson that many learn the hard way.  This book probably has a typo in its title.  
 Yeah, I happen to agree that the Bush administration is incompetent. Bush spends like a drunken democrat (Teddy K.?) and he's even slower than Democrat John Conyers. Watching grass grow is more exciting than listening to Conyers string out a simple sentence for five minutes. I do give Bush credit for nominating Roberts and Alito to the Supreme Court. Maybe they can marginalize the ACLU witch Ginsberg who was foisted on us by the pathetic, zipper-challenged Clintoon. Dean comes across like a jailhouse snitch. So sneaky, the way he ratted out Nixon for glory. Let's face it - a little break-in to the dem headquarters to snoop around is nothing compared to Marxist Hillary hiring the hapless Livingstone to secretly peruse hundreds of confidential FBI files on Hill's "enemies. And they said Nixon was paranoid? Then there's Bill Clintoon selling secrets to China and pardoning drug runners like Dan Lassiter and neer-do-wells like Mark Rich and on and on ad infinitum. Dean is just insipid the way he lurks on the fringes waiting to capitalize on the misfortunes and screwups of others. The recycled title sounds so self serving - Hey, somebody look at me! I'm the selfless, heroic sneak who exposed Nixon and I need attention. Buy my book and line my pockets. So blatantly opportunistic-- all IMHO 
 It is not good as  a mainstream movie , it does not have a good plot , some scenes are not relevant . Even as a soft-porn movie, it does not do a good job. Try watching "I like to play games" , its a much better soft-porn movie.  
 My kids started reading the Left Behind Kids books, and because I was concerned about the message and theology of the books, I started reading them also.  Then I decided to check out the "adult" books from the library.   I am a born-again, pentacostal believer in Jesus Christ, and parts of the theology are not what I read in the Bible.  OK.  I can stil enjoy a good book, one with interesting characters, realistic dialogue, and a good plot.  The issue of plot is difficult for the Left Behind books, I admit, because we know who wins if we've read the end of the New Testament.  As to the rest, it fell flat.  Most of the dialogue didn't ring true.  After a few of the books, I was interested in some of the characters, but by the end of the books, there were only a few of the original characters left, and they were some of the least interesting to begin with.  How many times do we have to read through the same sermons from the exact same scriptures in Revelation?  How many times do they have to tell us about the almost affair that someone had back in Book 1?  There is nothing new and interesting in this book. The last book is just boring.    It would have been nice, at the end of the book, to wrap up everything.   Jesus comes back, and everyone should be reunited at the end after the battle is over, right?  Some of the characters that were important early in the books are either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all.  It was an incredible let down.  I felt like I had invested in these books only to see what life would be like for everyone after the battles are over.  Nothing.  We stick with that one main guy, and everyone else is left in the dust.  It should have had a really, really happy ending, but even that was boring.  If I had my time back, I would stick to the kid versions, if only to discuss theological issues with my children.  At least in the kid books, the sermons are shorter.  And I will know not to get my hopes up for happy reunions at the end of the series 
 We purchased this bed with the intention of using it for vacations, sleepovers etc.  However, we soon came to realize that setting this bed up is no easy feat. It comes in four seperate inflatable pieces. You need to first assemble the footboard to the headboard which is done by fitting plastic pieces into each other and turning them. The only problem is they keep falling out. The battery operated ( 4 D cell batteries) pump that is included is painstakingly slow. Even with an electric pump which we used, there are many different air chambers that need to be filled and it is quite time consuming. This bed can not be set up in minutes as they claim and as far as taking it apart, to fit it back in the storage bag you need to completley deflate it. I would not recommend this bed to somebody looking for a travel bed. We ended up returning it 
 "Time and Again" was probably Finney's masterpiece, and the idea of a sequel is interesting.  However, this sequel is based upon a rather weak premise to begin, and it never really gets off the ground.  The problem with any sequel is that it is automatically subject to comparison with the original, and "Time After Time" just does not live up to its predecessor.    
 This is quick revisionism from a hired gun. Perhaps the events of the Clinton presidency are too soon for anyone, liberal or conservative, to be objective, but it will never happen if people keep buying books like this 
 If you like whiteboy rap with terrible flow, this cd is for you. I loved "steal my sunshine" but the rest completely sucks. They arent even good rappers and thats the genre most prevailent here. Just buy the single 
 this has to be the absolute, most boring, non-ending movie i have ever had the painful experience to sit through. i would have turned it off, but i wanted to see how bad it would be by the end (if i didnt die beforehand, as the movie lasted approx. 82 years). i usually love good old joan, but this really s***** 
 This movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makup on him! I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a kid it's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking "Auntie Zoe, what does that mean?" When are screenwriters going to figure it out? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP MOVIE!!! It's really hard to do both in the same film. It seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids, they end up appealing to nobody! Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo! 
 Lee Harris begins with the conundrum facing America: how to deal with an enemy that does not play by accepted rules of civility. Sadly his book degenerates into a bizarre hodgepodge of historical and philosophical citations that don't add up.    He justifies and advocates the use of unrestricted ruthlessness to ensure America's future standing.  Basically, he contends we can only choose to fight at the same crude level as those transgressing against us.  Much historical evidence, not cited in this book, show such strategies are only temporary at best and ultimately create a backlash, spawning the very "gangs" Harris deplores.  A much better book about the ethical dilemmas America faces is Michael Ignatieff's "The Lesser Evil: Political Ethics in an Age of Terror."  It prescribes more a judicious application of harsh force against terrorists while avoiding sinking to their level 
 Although it is blasphemy, and I can tell you that I feel really horrible and guilty about writing this, but "Sell Out" comes in with the bronze medal / 3rd best way to see The Pixies. I am a devoted fanatic of The Pixies.  I ordered this DVD well in advance of its release.  When I snatched it out of the mailbox, and jammed it into my DVD player, and waited for the magic . . . and waited . . . it never came - boy was I disappointed.    I have intentionally waited for it to sink in, before writing my review. Admittedly, nothing comes close to seeing them live, as I did in Raleigh.  I did not note the slightest lack of spirit at the concert, as I did in this DVD.  Adding to that, is the lack of extras ( as other authors wrote ).   But the very worst aspect of this disc, is a "country" ( ugggh ! ) sound, with which Black Francis' voice is now infused ! . . yes friends, this is what it sounds like to me.  If you listen to Frank Black's new album:  "Honeycomb", you will probably detect this "hobo" sound there, as well.  Friends, it hurts me to say these things - believe me - but I feel that it is true. Is this the new sound ? . . the voice that started out with a wild Hispanic sound, but now has become lazy and  "countrified" like a vagrant.  I think that is what the other unhappy authors here, have been trying to get across.  Perhaps Charles Thompson's real world voice can no longer hold up to the legendary Black Francis' singing ( if this is the case, it is a mournful tragedy ). The best, and only way to recapture THAT sound that we love, is to listen to the albums, or buy the other DVD - which by the way is superb ( contrary to some reviews ).  I thank whatever, that we have those recordings - rest assured that they still exist. The best DVDs:  1.  "Pixies" DVD, 2.  Austin City Limits DVD, 3.  "Sell Out" DVD The bottom line . . .  if you're a fanatic like me, you simply must own "Sell Out", and probably already do - if you're not, I would be negligent if I didn't advise you to look to other DVDs.  Update 04JAN2006: Over the holiday, I watched this DVD a few more times - it's by no means terrible, but I still feel that the U.K. Town&Country concert was substantially better, overall.  And that the PBS concert was also superior.  I'm sure that a cozy club ( like the Disco Rodeo in Raleigh or T&C in London ), has less of an influence on the nerves of a band, than a huge stadium in Japan or Europe.  Also, language was something of a barrier there, so there was less interaction and closeness.  I guess that I was just hoping to permanently capture what I felt when I saw them live, but alas, didn't get that from this DVD. Yes . . . Charles did look and sound younger in 1988 - didn't we all.  I love that original Pixies sound - the instruments haven't changed, but Charles' voice has - as has his style.  I've a copy of "Teenager of the Year" - don't care much for it.  I nearly bought "Honeycomb", but after pre-listening to it, I knew that it was not for me.  It ( and parts of "Teenager" ) has a slow growling ( rather than crazed barking ) country sound that I find disagreeable.  To these ears, the sound has drifted away from the animated-stirring-vibrant sound of the Pixies, to one that doesn't have the same frantic passion.  Oh, and to clarify:  by "hobo" and "vagrant", I mostly mean musical-home abandonment / homelessness.  To me, this sound isn't the same as I remember from the live concert or that was captured on the 1st Pixies DVD - I find this disappointing. Although the sound and "distance" have a definite influence on this DVD; luckily, they haven't ruined the experience.  Having stood 15 ft. away from the band, I can tell you that there is no substitute for the real thing.  Long live the Pixies  
 I purchased this opener 12/6/06 and the motor quit 3/5/07.  What really troubles me is that I probably only open five or six cans a week.  Please don't waste your money 
 What we have here is yet another Beatles fan trying to show off what he knows about their songs, and attempting to "explain" it all.  If more accurate histories are to be trusted, the Beatles themselves, particularly their prime movers, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, didn't have a great deal in mind when they wrote these songs.  Nevertheless, far too many authors, including this one, have churned out volumes of "explanation and interpretation" of Beatles songs, what they really mean, how they reflect the 1960s social and political scene, and so on.  The last thing we needed was another one, particularly by an author who, despite his credentials as a classical music writer, is strictly another amateur Beatlemaniac posing as an authority.

 I was very happy to discover that I could purchase an Asian Cabbage Patch Girl doll...it was for a little Korean girl....the doll pictured on the website looked like the little girl that it was purchased for (the hair). Well, I was excited to find one and I wanted to make sure that I would receive it in time to wrap it and mail it to Texas in time for Christmas.  I ordered in on the 27th and received it on Dec. 1st (I paid for faster shipping).  When I opened the box it was an Asian doll but not the one with the ponytails...this doll had short hair.  I called Amazon immediately and although they expressed being sorry they said that they could not guarantee that it wouldn't happen again. I have used Amazon before with no problems but I am extremely unhappy with the bait and switch.  I should have read the other reviews.  I will never let that happen again.  BEWARE...do not order things of this nature from this website.  You will be disappointed 
 I saw this movie yesterday thinking it'd be exciting. I sure am glad that I survived after watching this terrible excuse for a movie. There's no story line, the acting is pathetic, whoever gave Vin Diesel the idea that he can act. Like an earlier reviewer observes it's about who's dumber the guys who made this movie or the ones who gave it a good review 
    "Battle For God"  by Karen Armstrong  "But I mean no harm nor put fault On anyone that lives in a vault,..."  --Bob Dylan  from "It's alright Ma (I'm only bleeding)"                  **** TRY TO BE ME FOR A MOMENT... ****        Try to be me for a moment. I pick up a book...it doesn't 'feel' right. So I start thinking. There is no mention of the American Civil War. No mention of Henry Ward Beecher, the abolitionist. No mention of the abolitionist movement, which was a FUNDAMENTALIST movement in both England & America.        There is no mention of the fundamentalist BEECHER family and it's support of the early Women's Rights Movement and the BEECHER friendship with  suffragist  Susan B. Anthony.  No mention of the friendship between Mark Twain and the Beecher family,  in whose home Twain was a frequent guest.         Then I find that there is only a brief mention of the U. S. Constitution in Chapter Three. I also notice that Armstrong seems to have a different view of social "ills" than ordinary people. Fundamentalism is identified as a social ill; but it is highly convenient to depart from reality (if you are an author) when you don't acknowledge crime, violence, poverty, etc etc as social ills.       Then Armstrong gives a brief mention  (a single sentence!) of Oliver Cromwell and the English Civil War, in which PURITANS, by any definition, a fundamentalist sect, played a prominent role.        Five stars go to books that are fun, or useful, or highly informative. Armstrong's book might have been informative, but whether consciously or unconsciously, it reads more like piece of New Age literature. At any rate, it is not a scholarly work of history. No genuine scholar would ever be guilty of such comprehensive historical ommissions,  or   omissions of facts of law,   or  just plain IRRATIONALITY.          ***   WHAT THE AUTHOR DID ****            Here is what Karen Armstrong has done with  history. She omits  (1) the history of slavery,  and (2) the American Civil War.  (3)  The English Civil War (1642-1649)  and (4) The Bill of Rights of the U.S. Constitution,  and along with it, the First Amendment clause granting freedom of religion. What Armstrong does with Fundamentalism is to stretch the focus of her study beyond all scope and boundary, to eventually indict all of religion,  obscuring the distinction between religion generally,  and  FUNDAMENTALISM specifically.   The work is unscholarly because the omissions are nothing short of horrific,  and biased   because  the historical omissions create a false and misleading view of events from which erroneous conclusions are extrapolated.     Armstrong suggests that a just and righteous segment of European and American society, termed "Scientific Rationalists"   having possesion of  moral clarity,   have always  borne silent witness to the abuses of ignorant and frightened religious fanatics as they wreak havoc upon the societies in Europe and America.  Armstrong calls the religious fanatics, "Fundamentalists".    Examine this quote:   "...by the middle of the ninetheenth century the new secularist United States had become a passionately Christian nation. During the 1780s, and still more in the 1790s, the churches all experienced new growth and began to counter the Enlightenment ideology of the Founding Fathers. They now sacralized the American independence: the new republic, they argued, was God's achievement. The revolutionary battle had been the cause of heaven against hell." --p. 85 bottom paragraph, "Battle for God"   [This quote serves as an example of Armstrong failing to make a clear distinction between religion, generally, as distinct from FUNDAMENTALISM. This failing is an integral part of Armstrong's "history".  Notice how Armstrong is critical of the "CHRISTIAN" faith,  not a "FUNDAMENTALIST" sect within the context of Christian faith.  Throughout Armstrong's writing,  it is clear that FUNDAMENTALISM is not the subject;  but rather, RELIGION  in its most general sense is the subject, as this quote shows.  That is not good "scholarship"  and it isn't even merely a case of "sloppy" scholarship.  It is not scholarship in any sense at all.  It is however a prime example of historical revisionism.]     ****  OMISSION  OF   ENGLISH CIVIL WAR 1642-1649/  The PURITANS ***     Charles I of England,  spent lavishly on luxuries, and when the Puritans  protested his enforcement of  religious reforms,  Charles I had their ears amputated and their noses slit.  Charles I demanded  more money from Parliament, and upon  refusal,  closed the House of Lords & House of Commons,  precipitating the English Civil War,  1642-1649.  Oliver Cromwell,  prominent amongst Puritans,  raised a core militia of Puritan farmers and being an unexpectedly shrewed general,  brought victory for the common people.       Oliver Cromwell declined an offer to become King,  and struggled with some democratic ideal.  Our understanding today,  of a government of  three branches:  Executive, Judicial, and Legislative,  was only an obscure dream in the mid 17th Century.  Cromwell led England well as Lord Protector until his death.  The Monarchy was restored,  and many Puritans fled to America,  energizing the American drive toward a successful democratic model of government, including Constitutional guarantees against "cruel and unusual punishments".      Armstrong  mentions  fundamentalism in the context of Puritan Oliver Cromwell with a single sentence on page 75.  Notwithstanding,  even in the INTRODUCTION to "Battle for God"  Armstrong is critical of "fundamentalists" for not regarding conflict as some kind of  "a conventional political struggle". [see page xi, paragraph 1].  Well for the fundamentalists,  persecution was not part of "...a conventional political struggle."  It is easy for Armstrong to make such criticism,  because Armstrong is so cunning in her historical omissions,  that nobody need let the facts  get in the way of a generalized indictment of  Fundamentalism. Neither does Armstrong bother mentioning Charles I in the context of his tyranny over the English people.  She just broadly and generally indicts fundamentalists for not engaging in "...a conventional political struggle."  The fact that nobody in the 17th Century is engaging in  a "...conventional political struggle"  is a mute point because of this convenient omission.   *** OMISSION of SLAVERY & AMERICAN CIVIL WAR/  The ABOLITITIONISTS  ***   The omission of the history of slavery is convenient for Armstrong. That is how she can bend history to make it appear that "Scientific Rationalists" provided moral leadership in Europe & America and initiated necessary social change. In this sense, Armstrong strongly suggests that Scientific Rationalists are possessed of the superior qualities of human development, empowered by a compassionate heart, empowered by deeper insight into life's ultimate nature, and in fact, just as intwined in MYTHOS as the Fundamentalists that they so sharply reduce to spiritual primitives. It is more of a contradiction of actual history.   Fundamentalists are responsible for the ABOLITION movement however. The COMMITTEE FOR THE ABOLITION OF THE SLAVE TRADE was formed in England in 1787. The fundamentalists campaigned through public meetings, pamphlets and petition. This religious movement was eventually to reach the United States where fundamentalists also advocated the abolition of slavery. No mention whatsoever of this fundamentalist movement is mentioned in Armstrong's "Battle for God" nor does this "history" include the American Civil War. According to the author's dating outline, The American Civil War ought to have been in Chapter 3; but it is omitted, and they call this a 'scholarly' work?     ******REVEREND  LYMAN BEECHER's FAMILY of Litchfield, Connecticut"  *****      A most prominent omission in "Battle for God"  concerns the Puritan family  of Rev. Lyman Beecher, whose daughter,  "Harriet Beecher Stowe,"  wrote the  novel,  "UNCLE TOM's CABIN"  which inspired many Americans to reject the very idea  of  slavery.  It is Armstrong's omission of the role of the Puritans in the English Civil War,   and the American Abolitionist movement,   to  distort the role of religion in American History.        Again,  it is a problem of not making  a clear distinction between FUNDAMENTALISM and RELIGION generally.   Although the precise term,  "FUNDAMENTALIST" did not appear before the 19th Century,  the same doctrinal beliefs were in place;   for example,  Biblical literalism,  etc.  Reverend Beecher's family was Calvinist. Let's look at this family  to see how complex American religion is and how clear lines of distinction are confusing.       There is an account of Henry Ward Beecher,  who at about age seven,  walked by an Episcoplian Church in December,  1820. He was fascinated by the candles blazing in every window,  the boughs of spruce,  pine,   and arborvitae around each pew,  and a church choir singing joyfully the news of Christ's birth.  But Rev. Lyman Beecher's church had never engaged in Christmas celebration nor Christmas Carols,  for he was an orthodox CALVINIST,  and interpreted the Bible "literally".   For elder Beecher,  the decorations were gaudy, and dancing and theater were forbidden.  Rev. Lyman Beecher,  Henry Ward Beecher's father was the last great  PURITAN  minister in America.  His children grew up with the teaching that the devil roamed the earth and bad people would burn in the fires of hell forever.       "Christmas...was not known in the house of my father,  for he was a Puritan of the Puritans." --Henry Ward Beecher,   CU,  3 January 1872      Rev. Lyman Beecher's wife and 8 children started each day,  and ended each and every day,  with  prayer and  Bible reading.           ****  BUT WERE THE CALVINISTS OF  CONNECTICUT,  "fundamentalists"? ***       True,  the term "fundamentalist" is a 20th Century category,  but scholars even now have difficulty classifying sects as such.     Does the Calvinist Beecher family  strike you as FUNDAMENTALIST?  Consider what  contemporary RALPH WALDO EMERSON had to say on the matter:      "It is yet in all men's memory that,   a few years ago,  the LIBERAL churches complained that the Calvinistic Church denied to them the name of Christian."--"New England Reformers,"   a lecture read in Amory Hall,  Sunday,  3 March  1844 by RALPH WALDO EMERSON          ***** WHO DOES FIT ARMSTRONG's  STEREOTYPE?  ***       Wife of Rev. Lyman Beecher,  Roxana Foote  Beecher was a skilled artist,  an intellectual,  spoke good French,  and had a passion for history,  math and science. Of her children,  Isabella Beecher Hooker  was a women's rights activist.  These women,  Calvinists,  do not fit Armstrong's definition of "fundamentalist".   Moreover,  frequent guests in the home included suffragist  Susan B. Anthony and the irreverent author  Mark Twain.            Why did President Lincoln,  arguably the greatest American President,  choose the son of Reverend Lyman Beecher,  Henry Ward Beecher,  to deliver a commemorative speech at the raising of the Union Flag at Fort Sumter South Carolina,  the very spot where the Civil War had begun in April 1861?   Henry Ward Beecher was not the most radical abolitionist in the North;  but he did pursuade  many thousands of Americans to believe that slavery  was ungodly and unchristian, and must be purged from the nation.  Henry Ward Beecher turned his massive church into  a vital antislavery institution;  the leaven in the American lump.       On Good Friday,  14 April 1865,  Henry Ward Beecher spoke for over an hour at Ft. Sumter, South Carolina. So, did he rail,  rant, and condemn?  Hardly!  Beecher's speech said essentially,  "But for the people misled, for the multitudes drafted and driven into this civil war,  LET NOT A TRACE OF ANIMOSITY REMAIN."  So where is the "paranoia" and the hate characteristic of the Fundamentalists?         The point is,  that FUNDAMENTALISTS in America,  studied in the context of our actual history,  are the  apex of the national character.  This is the Puritan Legacy.       Where are the Scientific Rationalists in all of this?  The impressions are so confusing that you could reasonably assert that the religious people ARE the Scientific Rationalists. That is why by omitting the American Civil War,  Armstrong can offer an amputated American History of religion and make it look appealing.  Civil War Historian,  Shelby Foote claimed that the Civil War was the single event that defined the American character, and I support that idea.              All of this  might add up and make sense, this intellectuality,   Biblical Literalism,  Puritanism,  Calvanism,  combined with irreverence,  women's rights activism and suffragettes, and abolitionist politics,  if it is considered within the context of American history;  but....Armstrong simply omits this history altogether.  How can any history of American religion be undertaken and not include the abolitionist movement, which by its very  essentials is a FUNDAMENTALIST, and not,  a Scientific Rationalist event?                 ******   "DEEPER LEVELS  OF THE MIND" (or HAVING YOUR CAKE AND EATING IT TOO ) *****  [the quote from page 75]       "Thousands of men and women convicted of witchcraft were either hanged or burned at the stake before the craze burned itself out.  The new scientific rationalism, which took no cognizance of these deeper levels of the mind,   was powerless to control this hysterical outburst." p.75 "Battle For God"         "Scientific Rationalists" had   "...no cognizance of these deeper levels of the mind."    For that matter,  virtually nobody had much "...cognizance of these deeper levels of the mind."    Armstrong is implying that by "deeper levels"  leading to a deepest level,   there is a TRANSCENDENT level of mind,  which could even lend itself to being termed God.    In fact,  by way of the Platonic MYTHOS,  any model of MIND is a useful spiritual conveyance. This would include MYTHOS models inclusive of a Fundamentalist Kingdom of Heaven,  etc. or even claim that Christ is the perfect embodiment of LOGOS/MYTHOS altogether.  Is that just cause for  criticism of the religious outlook on "...deeper levels of the mind"?        A clear confirmation that Armstrong uses MYTHOS in a context that is contrary to the prevailing views of Scientific Rationalism is to be found in another review of "Battle for God" giving Armstrong 5 stars and a round endorsemnt. It says this about  Armstrongs adoption of Mythos for Scientific Rationalism,  while excluding Fundamentalists from any right to MYTHOS.      "...one can never separate the conscious and unconscious in any permanent way. Her explanation of logos and mythos draws immediate parallels to the real and unreal, the seen and the unseen, the rational and the subconscious, the physical and metaphysical. Western technology induces eastern spirituality much the way the visible requires an analysis of the forces behind the visible." --from a 5 STAR review of "Battle for God"      What is wrong with this claim?  It is a contradiction of the SCIENTIFIC RATIONALIST adherence to a strict EMPIRICISM.  Scientific Rationalists do not  affirm an Eastern Spirituality,  nor ANY spirituality,  no more than they endorse a New Age Mythos.   Philosophers call  this a LIVED CONTRADICTION:  What we deny in our words,  we presuppose in our living.  Scientific Rationalism seeks for PHYSICAL causes for human behavior,  not MYTHOLOGICAL causes. MYTHOS and Scientific Rationalism are ANTI-THETICAL.      The difficulty is that Armstrong allows for herself,  and for Scientific Rationalism  generally,  a great liberality in boundary and scope.  She allows herself  freedom to explore MYTHOS and affirm it with  conviction and historical justification.   In a contradictory manner,  Armstrong is critical of fundamentalists, for reasons that they prefer models deriving from Biblical MYTHOS. Is that fair?  Why are Fundamentalists to be deprived of their MYTHOS, while Scientific Rationalists are entitled to a MYTHOS that they deny in nearly every document and  book they author?  This is a clear violation of the Law of Non-Contradiction, or, in plain words,  it cannot be denied,  and then affirmed,  at the same time. Religion is either valid or invalid,  and Scientific Rationalist go to great lengths to deny the validity of religion. Religion is a form of MYTHOS.       That is probably why Armstrong  omits all but a passing reference  to the U.S. Bill of Rights,  because it is a Constitutional guarantee of religious freedom. [see p. 85]       ******   LOGOS & MYTHOS  and Misrepresentation of Fact  ***     Plato's  Logos  & Mythos is used by Armstrong to characterize the ancient duality of  PHYSICS & METAPHYSICS. Our Subjective side of life, i.e. [ "deeper levels of the mind" ] Religion, inclusive of Fundamentalism,  would fall in the category of MYTHOS. Consider  how Armstrong characterizes MYTHOS in modern life with a misrepresentation of fact as follows.      "Because of the dearth  of myth in our modern society,  we have had to evolve the science of psychoanalysis to help us deal with our inner   world."  --bottom of page xiii to top of p. xiv,  INTRODUCTION,  "Battle for God"     This is a generally false statement.  Psychoanalysis is highly interpretive, and not a core science either.  It basically died a long time ago.  Psychotherapy generally is a highly diversified field, including even POP-PSYCHOLOGY,  hardly a science at all.  Psychotropic drugs have pushed psychoanalysis to the periphery of science.  Finally,  I do not like the misrepresentation of Psychologists as practitioners of some kind of  role as   DELPHIC ORACLE,  PRIEST,  SHAMAN, REIKI MASTER,     or quasi religious authority figure,   guiding souls through a labyrinth  of  spiritual symbols, to reach  "...deeper levels of the mind..."  when the latter  does not even qualify in any context as part of the SCIENTIFIC RATIONALISM that Armstrong endorses elsewhere in her book. This is not only an Orwellian nightmare,  but also  a clear contradiction of fact.      This is also why it is so important that Armstrong qualify the meaning of her ideas concerning,  "...deeper levels of the mind."   Scientific Rationalists operate with such a double standard.  It's as though they deny that God or Heaven exist in any phenomenological sense whatsoever,  reject moralizations,  but then turn right around and suggest that something of the sort does exist,   and moreover,  claim  that PSYCHOANALYSTS   know what it is really all about, this MIND-MAZE or MIND-LABYRINTH,  and can classify precisely where every person is on his spiritual journey into Mythological symbolism.  Certainly,  Scientific Rationalists desire that ordinary religious people have no claim on  the  Heavens,  or "deeper levels of the mind."          *** ARMSTRONG's  PEDANTIC CRITICISM and the FAILURE TO IDENTIFY GOOD & EVIL  ***[the quote from page 85]     Observing this  author  attempt to impose a personal and vague morality upon the American people by implying that American church members have violated some obscure standard of GOOD & EVIL is ridiculous. In fact,  Armstrong fails to identify the standard of Good & Evil she upholds. It is not American Constitutional Law, I assure you.       Examine this quote:     "...by the middle of the ninetheenth century the new secularist United States had become a passionately Christian nation.  During the 1780s,  and still more in the 1790s,  the churches all experienced new growth and began to counter the Enlightenment ideology of the Founding Fathers.  They now sacralized the American independence:  the new republic,  they argued,  was God's  achievement.  The revolutionary battle had been the cause of heaven against hell." --p. 85  bottom paragraph, "Battle for God"           [This quote serves as an example of Armstrong failing to make a clear distinction between religion, generally,   as distinct from FUNDAMENTALISM.  This failing  is an integral part of Armstrong's  "history".]   NO credible author,  in any field of endeavour today,  would ever refer to America as a "Christian" nation.  The "nation"  has no national religion. That's the result of  the First Amendment's prohibition of the national Congress from passing legislation based upon religion.   This is one more example where Armstrong is entirely out of depth as a historian, and worse,  she has not acquainted herself with the most definitive document of the nation,  which is the U.S. Constitution.           How the church members interpreted the American Revolution is of no consequence.  ALL people interpret their experience.  The only matter of consequence is that they  supported the American Revolution and the Constitution.  Armstrong implies a standard  of GOOD & EVIL exists here,  by which religious people ought to be  rejected. It is a  subversion of Constitutional law at best,  and an inversion of genuine morality, at worst and it is  entirely a pedantic exercise. Sometimes,  the tail tries to "Wag the Dog."    The Bill of Rights is only mentioned on p. 85 in the entire book, and from this, readers may fairly deduce that Armstrong is virtually not at all concerned with regligious freedoms in America.  Indeed, the quote from p. 85 suggests that Armstrong is overly pedantic.  This quote justifies an earlier Amazon reviewer's observation that Armstrong's remarks are INTERPRETIVE,  in the manner of Literary Criticism, rather than as a History.      The point of quoting p. 85 however is to demonstrate that Armstrong omits any concern  for crime,  poverty,  disease,  vice,  or even   immorality in some general sense in American life.  These are not Social Ills worthy of concern.  No,  Armstrong is critical of some American citizens, who in their churches,  have the audacity to engage in interpretive views of their own,  and choose to believe that God is interactive in the daily life of America.  Well, how dare those Fundamentalists do such a thing!  By the same standard,  you could persecute a Feng Shui practitioner, for making interpretive judgements about invisible forces inside our homes.      For exercising a Constitutional right,  American citizens,   come under Armstrong's pedantic criticism. She accuses the religious of "...countering the Enlightenment ideology of the Founding Fathers."       The darker implication is made obvious,  when readers realize that Armstrong is not merely opposing Freedom of Religion;  but  going further still,  to threaten Freedom of Thought.    Ah,  the THOUGHT-POLICE arrive,  and Armstrong's  Scientific Rationalism is beginning to look like fascism I fear.         Remember: One lie does not cost you one truth but the truth." ---Christian Freidrich Hebbel             
 It's hard to believe the other reviewers here read the same book that I did! On the VERY FIRST PAGE, Mr. Savage expouses his contention that any time now he be unfaithful to his "partner", the poor unfortunate house husband and Mr. Mom, Terry -- literally, he states "he will have another man's c___k in his mouth". I'm sorry -- in what way does this qualify their relationship as the equivalent of a marriage suitable for the raising of a child? Having read Mr. Savage's column's in the local tabloids and also his book "Slouching Towards Gomorroah", I thought I was pretty hardened to his coarse sexualization of virtually everything, but even I was taken aback by the cruelty of anouncing on the first page of a book about your adopted child that you intend to cheat on your partner -- can you imagine how poor Terry feels about it?  The title is meant to be provocative and offensive to the Moral Majority (which I am decidedly not), but it shows some of the underlying problems here -- Dan and Terry obviously don't "get pregant", that's a biological impossibility. Neither was the birth of their adopted son "planned" . Language is an interesting thing, we can twist it to mean whatever we feel like. Both Dan and Terry are biologically normal, fertile, young men, and either could have easily concieved a biological child with a surrogate or a lesbian partner. They choose instead so-called "Open Adoption", and end up with the child of what they like to call througout the book "a street punk". In fact, the mother of the child is a mentally ill homeless woman, incapable of taking care of herself or even bathing, wearing clean clothes, etc. A lot of flapdoodle in the book is presented as Dan and Terry seem to struggle with the fact that the mom used some alcohol and drugs early in the pregnancy and if this presented a danger of fetal alcohol syndrome -- HELLO! this is the child of a severely mentally ill homeless person! What about hereditary mental illness? Apparently no one knows or cares or even calls this into question. After all, Dan and Terry have achieved the plum prize that every infertile straight couple drool over -- not merely a healthy child, but a BLOND BLUE-EYED BOY. How they gloat over THAT.  Even worse is humorist Savage's inability to talk seriously about the choice to become a parent at all. He insists that he only wants a child to have a "really expensive hobby" and so that he doesn't end up in old age as one of those lonely, ancient gay couples in South Beach surrounded by expensive antiques . (NOTE: if you think that children guarantee you will be treasured and cared for in old age, you have some serious disappointment awaiting you.) In the final analysis, it seems more that Dan Savage particpated in the adoptation because it was partner Terry's heartfelt wish to raise children...and indeed, it appears that Terry is the one staying at home and doing the "hands on" work of parenting.  It is worth knowing that Dan and Terry have relocated to Seattle, from Portland where the adoption was conducted. Could this be because the child's mentally ill, homeless, destitute mother will find it impossible to visit another state 4 times a year (as she is technically entitled)? So much for the lipservice of "open adoption". This is just more self-serving psychobabble and double-speak for "stealing the adoptable children of poor, helpless, homeless women." It doesn't make anything better that the thieves are gay rather than straight.  I went into this book with a generally accepting attitude towards gay adoption, and the feeling that anyone willing to buck a generally unsympathetic system must want very badly to have and raise children, and would therefore make good parents. This book has COMPLETELY changed my mind. I know that there are good, loving gay adoptive parents, but clearly the system is unable to screen out wealthy, manipulative, sleazy individuals like Dan Savage. This is a man who should not be allowed to adopt a pet, let alone a human child. My judgement has nothing to do with his homosexuality, and everything to do with his materialism, selfishness, sleazy morals, inability to comitt to a faithful relationship with a partner, open cruelty, and not least of all, his willingness to exploit both his partner and his adoptive child to make money from a sympathetic gay community 
 I love her as an author and I read all of her books but this book was a disappointment.  I love how it tied into and brings the characters of her other books but it took eveything I had for me to finish reading this book.  She still remains one of my favorite authors and I will look forward to her next book 
 By far the dumbest, most confusing novel I have ever read. We read it in our Contemporary fiction class in College and we are now trying to get them to change the curriculm so we are never forced to read such rubbish again 
 This book may be the most unreadable piece of junk I have ever come across.  This book has very little to say and says it poorly.  The best part of the book is the title.  It is totally downhill from there 
 Go right to the heart of the matter with Graham and Dodd's Security Analysis if you want to know how Buffett started.  Hagstrom's book is a poorly executed fifth grader's book report on the primary investing philosophy of Buffett.  Don't waste your money here.  You'll regret it.  This doesn't even really scratch the surface of relevant information 
 The main disappointment with this movie was the excessive number of shots of the cars zipping through empty roads as compared to the number of points won by mowing down citizens. Actually not that many of the latter - the satire (such as it is) could have been much sharper and more extravagant here. Did the Director feel that stepping up that side of it would be too shocking?   Otherwise the movie has an agreeable facile sense of the period (bad hair styles, would-be funky music, absurd sets, inane plot, cheapo design all round). So worth a watch. But not the witty classic I had expected 
 I expected something completely different when I read this book.  I was expecting that this book would tell about different ways that the future would get energy to the people.  This book is nothing like that the first two thirds of this book is a diatribe on how everybody is using energy the wrong way.  It tells that innovation and micro power is the wave of the future and condemns all government subsidies for energy.  He does not explain why we will be going to micro power but says that's the way it is going to be.    I have to say I started reading this book and put it down for a while for the racist remarks throughout the book.  It is told from an Indian viewpoint where he makes snide remarks about the British saying that the British East Indian Company was the ultimate in evil. He makes condescending remarks about the Americans not being smart enough to have back-up generator in Silicon Valley whereas in Bangalore India they have them.   He is obviously against nuclear power by making outrageous remarks about nuclear wastes not being safe for 100,000 years.  I read nuclear renewal and the waste from the newer breeder reactors is a couple of 100 years and they will reduce that as time goes on.   He is all for the fuel cell and the book is very well written.  He doesn't say how we are going to get the hydrogen that we will need and talks endlessly about the Kyoto Protocol like it was the only peace of legislation that mattered on global warming.  I thought there would be new ideas and processes for the future like biomass or solar chimneys.  There is nothing new or insightful this book seems more like a list of grievances.  
 This review is for the MP3 audio cd.  Unless I received a faulty cd, this audio book was generated by an automated translation program. It's fraud. You don't pay to listen to a computer voice. I can't comment on the book 'Acres of Diamonds', which I was anxious to read/listen to, as this cd was so pathetic. [...]  
 This guide is honestly, pretty useless.  Any Tom, Dick or Harry knows about Wrigleyville, Boystown, and well, the rest of Lakeview.  Anyone can tell you that the heart of Lincoln Park is, well, Lincoln Avenue.  But, why, for the life of me, can't I find much on Bridgeport?  Mayor Daley liked it well enough, but, hey, The NFT guys can't be bothered with the facts.  Where's anything west of Western?  I guess Humboldt Park and Albany Park aren't worth the time.  Which is too bad, because it completely leaves out mention of some of the best bars and music clubs in the city, not to mention, some of the easiest to navigate streets.  If you're a tourist looking for lowest common denominator style travel books, then yes, I guess the NFT is a little better than average.  But when I saw how useless this thing was when a freshly moved in friend bought one, I knew that this is for tourists...and tourists only.  You're better off with the Irreverent Guide.  Heck, they might actually list an address for The Empty Bottle.. 
 I recently became the unfortunate owner of "The League of Gentlemen-The Complete Series".There is not really too much to say about itexcept that it is boring,perverted and disgusting.We forced ourselves to watch about an hours worth of it,but that's all we could stand(believe me,we're no prudes).Anyone want to buy the set 
 I enjoyed The Illuminator, however, like some other reviewers had problems with it. While not a middle ages expert, even my novice eye was attracted to absurd name choices. My MAIN concern is this book parallels Anya Seton's Katherine so much that I TRULY felt uncomfortable. While John of Gaunt and Julian of Norich are real historical figures their "voice" in The Illuminator too closely paralled Seton's. About a fourth of the way through the book, I desperately checked the Acknowlegements section for credit to Seton and Katherine- none was given! It almost seems as if a copy of Katherine was at the elbow of this author. Basically, the illuminator IS Katherine, but told from a different point of view. As one reviewer noted, names seem either ubsurd or "ripped off" i.e Rebekka (Ivanhoe) and Kathryn (Katherine). Perhaps someone should check into this....again, I did enjoy the book, but since I had just read Katherine before The Illuminator I was consistently distracted by the TOO many similarities. 
 This is yet another example of the chicanery and pseudoscientific nonsense that people use to fleece the desperate and ill of their hard earned money. It sickens me that people like this offer false hope in order to turn a buck.  Gee, this hasn't been done by mainstream medicine in over 50 years the author points out.  Go figure, that's because it doesn't work.  Last time I checked, sitting in a tanning booth was more likely to cause cancer than cure it, and in a very pseudoscientific way, that's what the author's telling you to do.  As usual, this "enlightened healer" is only trying to help people by pointing out things that those evil doctors don't want you to know, because by golly, light therapy isn't profitable for them.  So... plunk your money here! because writing this drivel has been VERY profitable for Mr. Douglas.    Also, for the record, you can get anybody to testify that "XYZ worked for me, it cured my herpes!" or whatever  you want them to spout, and you can prove anything with an underpowered "randomized controlled clinical trial".  You run the same trial 20 times with 10 patients, you'll eventually get the results you want to see.  Then you find a "journal" of bogus medicine to publish it, and voila.  You can reference anything.  Unfortunately, most people reading these books have an incomplete (at best) understanding of the science and statistics involved in these "trials" (and to be fair, the drug company trials as well, but that's a rant for another day).  This is commercialism, pure and simple, and if it makes you feel better, then by all means go play with lightbulbs, but if you think it's going to cure you of anything, then you're going to be profoundly disappointed 
 When making this book there was probebly an afford to make something that means something and gives advice to girls (at least that's what I heard Jada tell at Oprah), but it's feels and looks empty. Not only because of the lack of words, there is no story, but 80% of the photographs is allso not really up to standard. I like Jada Pinkett Smith very much, she's a strong women and a great rollmodel, but this books does not do her justice 
 If you wanna learn about ranger history after 1974, there is a lot of basic info in here. If you wanna learn about anything before 1974 - go somewhere else. The history of the ranger up to 1974 is compressed into 100 pages and I found one MAJOR mistake - the author claims that the 2nd ranger bn was not the first unit on top of point du hoc, he claims that the 116th reg of the 29th infantry was there first. He even quotes a section of stephen ambrose's "D-day" to back it up, only he quotes from the chapter about the 5th rangers and the 116th at Omaha. If he made a simple mistake like that one, how do I know that the rest of the book isnt filled them? All in all, I'm glad I got this book as a gift, because it isnt worth the money.... 
 There is nothing frightening about weird noises, angry phone calls and a DJ who won't leave the booth even though he has to take a pee and instead wets himself. As one reviewer wrote, there are a ton of flashbacks although the most important and relevant one is from a few hours before the DJ went on the air. As he gets the weird whispers over the phone, the callers start to ask him about those rather than the topic at hand. This starts to tick off an already arrogant person and he takes it out on the callers and the staff. There is a mixture of the "horror" he committed and the slightly weird things that are happening in the station. Oh yeah, the studio is creepy because of what happened decades before to another DJ.  This was not scary, creepy nor good. It was a waste of my time. Even though there were a couple twists at the end, they didn't work because I didn't CARE. There are a myriad of Asian films that deal with phones out there that are average to really good. Put a phone, a girl with long black hair and a person (almost always a woman)who will die soon if they don't solve something before they die all together and you have a winning formula for an Asian horror flick. This isn't a bad movie, it's worse than that, it's boring. Which is a sin in any movie, much less in a supposed horror flick. Even so-so films in this genre avoid. If you want to watch a mystery, then RENT this. If you are looking to be shocked, scared or frightened stay away. FAR away 
 This is easily one of the worst written, worst researched, and worst argued books I have ever read.  In fact it is so bad it is laughable.  I do not agree with their views but this has nothing to do with this review.  Turn to the epilogue and read this statement: "For example, all prophecy scholars agree that the generation that saw Israel restored to her land in 1948 could well be the "generation [that] will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened" (Matthew 24:32-34, NIV)."  No one, not even LaHaye can actually believe that statement.  You can't get 10 people to agree on what to have for lunch, how in the world will you ever get people to agree on something as controversial as the interpretation of Bible prophecy.  Other things that had me in stitches was when they said that a past scholar believed there would be 50 years between the rapture and the tribulation.  They then go on to state that they are pretty sure he would change his mind if he were alive today.  That may be true but why even bring it up.  If that makes it in your book you surely must not have much to say.  Don't waste your time, money, or effort on this book.  I had never read any Left Behind or other LaHaye prophecy books.  From the outside in it sure seemed like it was a cash cow with little substance.  This absolutely proved to me that my assumption is probably true.  ****A Side Note**** For those commenting on reviews by partial preterists, you really have no idea what you are talking about.  I understand the futurist view.  I was taught it my whole life and in Bible college.  I have read books about it including this piece of drivel.  The least you can do is read something by DeMar or Gentry and learn what you are arguing against instead of making assumptions.  What has been written so far in the reviews really makes you look like you have no idea what you are talking about 
 This movie could have been summed up in 30 minutes. I fell asleep several times trying to get through it, good sleep aid, not such a great film. I had way higher expectations from watching the other AMAZING Miyazaki films. This movie isn't a bad edition to Miyazaki's portfolio, but it's not even close to his best 
 This book tries, but fails. The jokes are dry. Humor is dated. I couldn't finsih it. The story had nothing to pull me in. Get Sophie Kinsella instead, you will be much happier 
 The author attempts to confront her rape, beating, and abuse by men in her life but she avoids her own anger and rage about the male violence perpetrated onto her.  She remains the "good girl" and subsumes  her anger into a semantic term "fierce" compassion.  The title of  the book is rather "nice girl forgives once again".  Except now  she learned from her male roshies that growing up to womanhood means we no  longer need to be silent provided we forgive.  And since we are not  compassionate enough to kill all violent males, we cannot do much more than  laugh at our own anger.  What's so fierce or compassionate about that 
 they showed this book as being the right book, but when i received it, it was a friggen STUDY GUIDE. total baloney 
 Sandra Brown is my favorite suspense/romance writer.  I always look forward to reading her new releases and this book was no exception.  However, I was very disappointed with Ricochet.  Normally, her books have so many twists and turns that you can't figure out "who did it" until the very end, which keeps you up all night wanting to read.  This book was different.  I kept thinking it would get better but it never did.  I highly recommend Chill Factor or White Hot instead of Ricochet 
 +++++  This book (first published in 1934) contains brief writings of physicist Albert Einstein (1879 to 1955), one of the most creative intellects of the twentieth century.  It contains articles (speeches, letters, statements, etc.) from early in his career.    This book gives a personal portrait of the man behind the scientific legend.   The book itself is divided into four parts:   (1) The world as I see it (about 30 articles).  This is my favorite part.  (2) Politics and pacifism (almost 20 articles).  Einstein was a pacifist (one who opposes the use of force under any circumstances).  (3) Germany (3 articles).  Einstein was born in Ulm, Wurttemberg, Germany.  (He later emigrated to the United States in late 1932.)  (4) The Jews (just over 10 articles).  Einstein was Jewish.  Finally, if this book is so good, then why did I give it the rating I did?  Two reasons.  First, there is a much more comprehensive book that also has gathered Einstein's writings.  It is called "Ideas and Opinions" (first published in 1954 and sold by Amazon).  It contains almost all the articles (it excludes seven) contained in "The World as I See It."   As well, it contains selected articles from other publications (most notably the books "Out of my Later Years" and "Mein Weltbild.")  As well, the book "Ideas and Opinions" has a fifth part called `Contributions to Science' (which contains almost 20 articles).  Here, Einstein discusses topics such as relativity, theoretical physics, science, and gravitation.  He even gives tributes to such people as Isaac Newton and Copernicus.  Second, this book's price.  It costs $9.20 and you get 65 articles.  But the hardcopy version of "Ideas and Opinions" costs about $6.00 and you get 120 articles (almost double the amount)!!  (Note that all prices quoted are as of May 2006.)   In conclusion, instead of this book, I recommend the more comprehensive and cheaper book called "Ideas and Opinions."  In my opinion, this recommended book is the definitive collection if Albert Einstein's popular writings!!!  +++++ 
 I can not describe how painful this book was.  The first quarter of the book goes at the pace of a moderately entertaining tale, but then grinds to a halt as soon as Silas is leashed with the orphan girl.  This book stands out in my memory not just for instilling a loathing of the written word that nearly took my away from literature for the rest of my life, but for the great amount of negative space it left in my brain when I try to recall some of the "excitement" of the drudgery of Silas's everyday life.  Truly a GREAT classic to unload on junior high children 
 It's not just that this film is a bloated remake of a quick, clean, near-perfect minimalist thriller. It's not that much of the added material (particularly the internal affairs sub-plot) feels tacked-on and unnecessary. It's not even that Pacino's character is a toned-down shell of the dangerously off-kilter detective of the original, that one of the more complicated characters (Frya Selmer/Tanya Francke) has been reduced down to set dressing, or that the ending ruins the film's moral atmosphere. It's the fact that Nolan, a sublimely talented director, is unable to coax a believable performance from any of his leads. Pacino does the method-acting bit again, taking it over the top in every single scene; Hilary Swank plays a pale imitation of her better roles as the down-to-earth hometown girl; and Robin Williams--well, he's Robin Williams. The kids in this film, Katharine Isabelle and Jonathan Jackson, turn in fine performances that, while hardly career-makers (which they couldn't be, considering how far their roles have been pared down), are a refreshing change of pace from their adult contemporaries' mugging. See the film for their far-too-short performances, but make sure you rent it, and don't pay too much to do so 
 I used a sample and liked the fact that it cleaned my hair the way I want my hair cleaned.  Not washed with useless lather and coated with all kind of smoothening silicon products. People have beconme so used to the mass produced garbage that is sold in gorcery stores, that they do not realize they are paying for detergent. In the long run it is damaging for the hair and after some hours it really does not have that nice clean bounce that hair is supposed to have. Jonathan is not the only good product out there. I have been using Phyto Shampoo from France and Kiehl's, both don't have the silicon smoothers either and yes, the hair does feel like straw right after you wash it. Get a big tooth comb and some guts and go through life with really clean hair!!!! I used my sample and will buy a big bottle of the Shampoo. I have not tried the conditioner, but will try it too. 
 Think twice before purchase: 1. Most of the good tracks are available on the non-copy protected "All-Time Top 100 TV Themes", along with the best themes from other networks. 2. This disc has CDS-100 copy protection, so you probably can't upload to Windows Media and definitely not to iTunes. I could not upload from my internal CD drive, only from an external multi-format CD/DVD burner. It still only uploaded to Windows Media, not iTunes. To get into iTunes, I had to add the WMA files and then convert them to MP3. This probably caused some quality loss as I'm converting one compressed format to another compressed format! A time-consuming and tedious process which could have been avoided altogether if music companies would get over this fixation on "controlling" everything. Hello record execs: If nobody can add your discs to their libraries, guess what happens? They DON'T PLAY YOUR MUSIC!!! You might think you're protecting your valuable investment, but you're shooting yourself in the foot instead. Here's how it goes: 1. Nobody can upload your music. 2. Nobody plays your music. 3. Nobody hears your music. 4. Nobody recommends your music. 5. Nobody buys your music. Remember, this only loaded from a particular kind of drive, so it may or may not work on yours.

 This is a tract, not a thoughtful piece of scholarship. It is in the Latin American school of angry social science, but is little informed by fact.  Much of what it says is correct, but is also well known.  But the analysis is weak, based on incorrect or outdated data, and simply a regurgitation of stereotypes instead of a deductive grounded analysis based upon good ethnographic work.   It is therefore often simply wrong.  But anger sells books.... 
      While this book contained some good information, it was an overall dissappointment.  To start, Sweetman begins by saying that the Crimean War was fought in other places besides the Crimean peninsula; however, not once does he mention any other battle, skirmish, or action between the allies and Russia.        I don't know if is the nature of this series to hit only the highlights of a conflict but, this book did exactly that.  Sweetman wastes 4 pages writing about Captain Nolan but only 3 paragraphs about the historic 'Charge of the Light Brigade' and then he left out how that charge ended.  I assume the British left the field but, that is never made clear by Sweetman.  He also spends 5 pages talking about the women in the war (mostly the lives of 2 army wives).      There were also plenty of pictures in the book.  These were good eye candy but, I would have rather had more text.      The last item I found distainful was the maps of major engagements (at least the ones Sweetman decided to write about).  The maps were placed, on average, 4 pages before the related text rather than in the chapter/section that they related to.  Also, all of the maps were mistitled and misdated.  It took me about 15 minutes of confused page flipping to figure out that the battle depicted in the map did not match up with the text that described the battle.      After reading this book, I would advise anyone looking for an overview of the ENTIRE war to look elseware 
 The Snub-nose Revolver could be classified as a subject in much need of discussion but with limited material available.  This is why I wanted to read this book since the snubby .38 Special or .357 Mag is a very common carry gun by licensed civilians and used as a back up by law enforcement officers.  There have been many instances cited where this type of gun saved someone's life.  There are flashes of brilliance written in this book but mostly the author loses momentum very quickly and you're wanting for more.  Another reviewer stated that this book was a compilation of "gunzine articles" and though I am not sure if it was, the book certainly could flow better.  Some examples of things I liked were the reloading of the revolver.  One pearl was that you should reload opposite the way the cylinder rotates so if you have to slap the cylinder shut and fire in a hurry the bullets that were loaded will be available to be shot.  Also his technique for aiming at just two cylinder holes versus all five or six promotes accurate and less cumbersome reloading.  The author knows the different types of snub nose revolvers and though I would have liked him to be a bit more descriptive, there are certainly examples for you to look at if you are thinking of getting one.    Some things that were big misses:  His chapter on the trigger and use of the front sight was just a tease.  There are many important factors regarding trigger control that are absolutely necessary for the snub nose revolver to shine and it is glossed over at best.  He barely mentions dry firing which is an intricate part of mastering this type of gun if you want to learn how to shoot it well.  The proper grip is very important and this is barely covered.  The small barrel of the snubby means that you need every tool available to shoot it accurately and take advantage of its close quarters capabilities and the author just doesn't take the time to discuss this.  When I tried to learn the revolver I found that I had to hold the gun with no thumb pressure or I would string laterally.  I also needed to shoot it with my strong hand gripping the gun no harder than shaking a man's hand or I would shoot low.  A shooting wheel like the one in the US Army pistol manual would really help you at the range and the snubby needs as perfect control as you can muster to hit your target, especially at distances greater than 5 yards.  You may want to look at www.sportshooter.com in the target section for this wheel.  It is free to download.  The chapter on tactics is just awful.  The author interjects examples, which do not contribute much to the points he is discussing.  It just seems to fill up paper.    The book has helpful sections, don't get me wrong, but it could have been a lot better and though it misses its mark it is nice to see a book about a very useful weapon be promoted.  The one thing I absolutely agree with the author on is that the first rule of any gunfight is to have a gun and the snub nose revolver makes that a lot easier. 
 I read this book a while ago (I was a self employed exec recruiter for fifteen years) and it still stands out as one of the silliest. The amount of information either a Manager or another headhunter will glean from this material is negligible. The pages discussing her "schedule" in which she shows us all how hard she works are so laughably self-important that you should skim them in the bookstore for humor's sake. 
 This was and remains one of the greatest movies made.  Unfortunately, the transfer for this DVD is very disapointing.  Images are blurred and colors are distorted.  I hope a better product becomes available, but in the meanwhile be warned 
 The first two-thirds of this book are worth the considerable effort needed to get through them.  Beer lays out an intriguing model for the organization and control of the firm based on a combination of cybernetics and neurophysiology.  It replays careful consideration for anyone trying to make some sense of the general mess that passes for organization and control at more firms.  There are some significant flaws.  First, the assumption that all divisions or strategic business units are viable systems, in his terminology, does not square with financial theory.  (If they were all truly viable systems and potentially indepedent, then the firm should divest all, because the combination would trade at a discount to the value of the pieces because they cannot be easily valued independently.  Many would make the same argument about GE today.)  Second, the system as described has a strong centralizing tendency, whereas many would think that decisions and responsibility need to be pushed to the edge.  Third, the system as a whole is homeostatic by design, where the greatest failing that most firms have today is the inability to change with changing conditions.  Beer does attempt to deal with these issues (except the first), but I do not find his arguments convincing.  But, generally, he had me until the final third, which deals with a project to use these ideas to create a control and management system for (as he says) the "social economy" of Chile under the Marxist Allende regime.  At this point, a great deal of clarity goes out the window, and is replaced with a combination of Marxist posturing and cybernetic babble.  And, as we all know, one of the many reasons for the collapse of the Allende regime was endemic mismanagement of an economy rapidly appropriated by the state.  (I take issue with the reader who sees "hope for the future" in this colossal fiasco.  It's more like a nightmare.)  I could say a great deal more, but I want to keep this review fairly objective without letting too much of my disgust with an obvious brilliant man supporting a repressive, inept, and antidemocratic regime show through.  My perspective on this is as a business consultant with 25 years of experience in dealing with complex strategy issues, an abiding faith in free markets, and enough background in mathematics to follow the arguments.  If you still believe in Marxism, you may find the final section of interest.  If you have an interest in cybernetics, it's worth a look.  From the practical point of view in the design of control and organizations, however, I couldn't recommend it.  And, because of the final section, I am left with the same queasy feeling that thinking about artists like Furtwangler staying in Nazi Germany engenders 
 This is the worst book I have tried to read in many years.  It's a disorganized mishmash of shaky biblical scholarship, soft core porn, snarky comments on current events, and very little about Arnold Rothstein.  I can cut writers a lot of slack. But Tosches' editors at Harper Collins should be held accountable for this dog's dinner of a boo 
 The whole movie was pretty predictable and cheesy at that.  If you watched any of the TV shows, then you know the pattern and this followed that to a T, no updating of story line, just the actors playing the part 
 And here I thought only Lindzen and Singer could write with such deliberate obfuscation in mind. Hooray for the status quo, let's do nothing until it is too late 
 This book is a real dissapointment.  If you love bland food and only moderately interesting taste this books for you.  I have been cooking for 35 years 
 My dad bought this book to assist his diet concerning his diabetes, but I am disappointed with it, namely because it does not have a SUGAR column on its Fast Food tables of Menus! I understand that carbs add up to becoming sugar and such, but why did they not list Sugar in a book for diabetics!  It puts a best bet check mark by different menu items, but I get the impression that these are merely the lesser evils on the fast food menus. Unfortunately, my dad sees the check marks and insists that these are healthy food items for him, for example, the Wendy's Jr. Frosty!   I think that most people can just go online to their most favorite fast food restaurant web sites and download the nutritional information there, which will include the sugar content! I did that with the Wendy's Jr. Frosty and found out it has 21g of Sugar! If my dad saw that on a Nutritional Label on a grocery store item, he would refuse to buy it! I wish I had been with him when he was shopping and bought this book, because I would have pointed out this major omission of Sugar information that is lacking in this book!  This book may have its uses when used properly, or for folks who don't care about their Sugar intake, but from my experience with my elderly father who desperately needs to eat RIGHT for his diabetes, this book is making it harder for me to get him to do so 
 I only read 20 pages or so.  The language was so terrible, I gave the book away.  Sorry 
 Great texbook.  However, has too many mistakes.  Answers are not reliabl 
 The only satisfaction I have gotten out of this product is this opportunity to vent.  If the price seems too cheap, it is.  Where to begin?  Instructions, pretty bad.  Hardware, missing, inconsistent, inadequate.  Design, deeply flawed.  Mounting, not on my standard mountain bike.  Manufacture, cheap, cheap, cheap.  What result culminated my frustrating evening retrofitting it just to see if it would work?  I'll spare you the suspense, it didn't.  Not a glimmer. 
 Bought this for my 4 mo. old son for Christmas (got it for a great price at Costco).  He played with it a lot - loved it.  His dad & I thought it was a wonderful toy, until it shorted out with no provocation after only about 1.5 months of use.  We've tried to find a replacement, but seems it's not for sale anymore.  We are very disappointed and plan to return for a refund at Costco 
 I have had this printer for almost four years now, and while it has saved my bacon on the road a number of times, it has also really let me down at some crucial moments. First, like a lot of older Canon printers, it is noisy and slow. It takes forever to get started on a page. But also like a lot of canons, when it is working right the output is beautiful. But you cannot count on finding ink cartridges for this printer on the road. It also has a weird and unpleasant ink cartridge system which includes two very different little trays, and three different kinds of tank. But what made me finally leave the thing in a hotel room was its tendency to get halfway through a print job and jam or inexplicably give an error signal. I have spent hours trying to get a clean copy of a single transparency. Very frustrating. 
 After reading the trilogy, I was left wondering what the hell happened? I have just read all 3 of the His Dark Materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker.    Pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories I've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy. There isn't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess. If you look up `anticlimax' in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of this book. From first page to last, time is wasted on boring characters, while all the good ones are either killed off, or just MIA for the entire book. Spoilers ahead.   What about Lyra and her parents? Somehow, she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl? She never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations. And Will just goes back with Mary Malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops. Over a cup of tea, naturally. And that's it for him. In addition to all that, this book doesn't even seem to be connected to the first two. None of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends, Will and Lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . .  all in the last 30 pages. What happened to the story, for cripes sake?!  And what happened to the `temptation'? Was choosing not to stay with Will her way of not succumbing to it? The whole premise is just so lame to start out with. As an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn't endanger the universe, why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give Lyra and Will a chance to know each other. The flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another. Supposedly, they had more than gonads going for them, they survived death together!   Pullman didn't feel like thinking it through, he just wanted a gut wrenching ending. In addition to that, he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the `reality' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning. All of Will and Lyra's efforts are futile, kind of like - guess what? religion for the rest of us morons.   After having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever, ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper. Iorek Byrnison, Lee Scoresby - instead we get page after page about Mary Malone the Disaffected former Nun. Pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in Him or anything for that matter!   This is NOT children's literature, it's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess. It's totally dishonest to sell this as a children's book, or even as a competent work of fiction. All of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one.   We never get closure on Lyra's parents. We never really understand what Dust is and where it comes from. We never see Will reunited with his mother. We get a lame battle where `god' dies and no one even knows why or how. Lyra and Will fall in love, but have to `sacrifice' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever, with only flimsy reasoning behind it. The mulefa and Mary Malone's work together amounts to nothing, everyone just goes home. Presumably, Will goes home, although we never see it. All that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing. The major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about Armageddon? What happened to the Fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea. It all just sort of disovles. Mary forgot to be the Serpent, or else I missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa.  Another reader pointed out: " Phillip Pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series. Instead, the story falls flat under the weight of the author's own agendas and mockeries. What a waste of time. I can't believe this book actually won awards. It stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly."   It would have been better if Lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream. Instead, relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the Kingdom of Heaven in the course of her lifetime. Absurd. This was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life. 
 I read another review that declared Balk as the warrior woman caught between these two "different" serial killers but after watching the movie I was left wondering where that warrior was hiding. Yes, she did a couple of smart things... but nothing she did was really over the top in the sense of fighting for her life. Oh wait... she did pull a knife on a guy, but he wasn't even a killer. Hmmm... This is not all that great of a horror film, my expectations aside. Two killers clashing could have been a pretty interesting variation but in the end it played out more like a Daddy being a role model for a reluctant (and rebelious) son. They each target a broken down tour bus... one offering hapless victims a ride to the trading post and the other "taking care" of the stragglers. Neither was truly convincing as "good" people with a dark twist as they both seemed a little looney... and I would trust neither. The only comic light comes from one of the victims as she calls it to a T (both of the killers... she identifies as such even when her husband strongly disagrees) and then gets the shocking satisfaction of being right... although she was probably not to happy when her hubby was offed.  Balk plays the one that almost got away and when they catch up with her, both are instantly fascinated by her and claim her as their own kill. It ends with a mildly climatic incident in the truck.  And then... there is the ending which is meant to top everything seen before it... and it does that in such a way where you go "No Way" instead of feeling all giddy inside. It isn't a riveting twist... and it is slightly comic considering all the leads had been through... but it left me thinking there was more not put in this supposed horror film. It seemed a little flat 
 I HATE TO DISAGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEW.  I BOUGHT THE CD BECAUSE I PLAN TO SEE THE MOVIE.  I LOVE THE HYMS BUT THE MUSICAL ARRANGEMENTS WERE QUITE DISTRACTING.  FAIREST LORD JESUS, A BEAUTIFUL HYMN, SOUNDS LIKE A DANCE NUMBER.  PERHAPS I AM JUST GETTING OLD.  I DO HOPE EVERYONE SEES THE MOVIE

 Ms. Castillo's novel should have been incredibly interesting to me, since I am a Hispanic Literature buff and have recently become quite interested in Chicano Literature, but I found this novel tedious and poorly constructed.  The idea of reading the novel in different orders has been USED, as is obvious to any who has read Hopscotch (Rayuela) by Julio Cortázar, and it was best left alone for future use.  Castillo's use of the technique doesn't even match up to the level of a "Choose Your Own Adventure", because the three different reading leave you feeling exactly the same way, BORED.  She makes her novel rest completely on the lives of her characters, but then she doesn't really ever develop them enough for you to become interested.  I never felt like I got to know them hardly at all.  I was a bit disappointed, but I suppose this book could have some attaction to Chicana women who can identify a bit more with the characters.  Maybe being a Chicana woman would help a reader to fill in all the blanks and holes that Castillo leaves in her characterizations 
 So far this book is killing me.  Hopefully it will get better.  It can't get much worse.  I am learning a lot of good information.  But it is pulling teeth to get it 
 I would not recommend this DVD for Salsa dance beginners who are used to the classic 123-567 lesson style. This DVD is only good for general Latin dance styles, not Salsa specific 
 The author is obviously as out of her element as Inspector Monk, and clearly has little knowledge of the ships, seafaring, nautical quarantine requirements, etc. of the 1860's.  Her characters are hardly believable:  Sutton, the rat exterminator and Dr. Crow are perhaps the worst examples, but not the only ones.  Would a proper young lady be picked up in a cab without a chaperon to go to a function?  Very disappointing 
 i gave one star beacuse it is not color this very old movies i want some in color about depression i have the prombleof the derpression   of you have any movies about this please let me kno 
 Bennett has little if any understanding of children, myths, fables and fairy tales. In this book he tries to bludgeon children into "being good" (his version of it) by terrorizing them. That's not how stories for children work. Some of the stories here are butchered; others are just plain bad. You'd be a lot better off by going to the original stories, and avoiding this collection, which is only useful for a door-stop. Bennett wisely avoids stories about his substantial failings -- slot machines, gluttony, smoking, booze. Hypocrisy, thy name is Bill Bennett 
 Admittedly, the reason I read The Bourne Identity had everything to do with how much I enjoyed the recent film of the same name.  However, the book bears very little resemblance to the movie.  So little in fact that I wonder if the writers of the movie recognized the same weaknesses in the book as I did: shoddy writing, a confused and over-complicated plot, and a ridiculously juvenile, untenable love story.  I kept expecting the story to pick up and sweep me away as most great novels do, and I tried to gloss over my own revulsion at the soap opera dialog, and blaze undaunted through the remainder of the book...sort of like sitting through a movie you know you don't like much, but sticking around because you've already spent your money to see it.  The premise of the story is also hampered by a sort of cowboys and indians, good versus evil, over-simplified rationale on the part of Ludlum's characters.  Their motives are described plainly enough throughout the book, yet those motives are difficult to understand because they seem so casually overwrought.  Both Bourne and his nemesis, Carlos are laughably thin characterizations.  So much so that I found myself reminded time and time again of The Young and the Restless...especially when the story involved Marie.  Too often, her character came across as wooden and forced.  I don't buy her devotion to Bourne for a minute.  I was actually hoping that she would turn out to be an undercover agent or a psycho or something...anything to make her character more interesting or believable.  I have heard that the second and third books in this series are better, but The Bourne Identity doesn't give me enough reasons to find out for myself.  This is the only instance I've found where the movie is better than the book.  So, rather than waste four or five days slogging away at another Ludlum "best-seller," I'll just stick to the films, thanks 
 I returned the book because after I paid for it, I found something in the information that I hadn't been able to see beforehand in the listing, and it said that the book was paperback.  We did not want paperback, and also had someone contact us who'd had this course before at the school where the class is, and we bought a used hardback Algebra 2 book from them for less than half what we had paid for this one.  The course itself is pretty good 
 In its time, Rand's vision was intoxicating.  We are now living in a reality where big business pretty much influences everything in our lives, and the society that it has produced isn't exactly what Rand envisioned.  The idea of an unrestrained capitalism sounds wonderful as a philosophy.  But in truth, it's just as dangerous as total government control: Exxon Mobil, Walmart, etc. are not businesses, but institutions with power over our every day lives.  I don't think that this is the world that Rand intended, but it's the outcome of her philosophy.  Her efforts, while noble, have proven to be a failure.  
 I saw a documentary on "Hank" Bukowski, and thought I'd give him a day in court. This was the only work of his available at the library, so this is what I sampled. It's crap. A waste of time. Bukowski's reputation certainly can't rest on this alone. Did he pull an esoteric fast-one, and write this just for the initiated? Maybe. The book still sucks 
 This multimedia presentation was nice.  The images where amazing, I would give it a five but, I felt lost.  I didn't know anything about the artist or what neo-symbolist photography was.  I was hoping that there would was background history on the photographer and why he chose to do this. I also wanted maybe a little information of what neo-symbolist photography is.  So if you know who Snterineross is and what neo-symbolist photography is i highly recommend it.  but if you don't, stay away, until you do 
 The author borrows from several world belief systems and tries to pass them off as ancient "toltec" wisdom.  It does contain sprinklings of common sense, but the common sense is offset by impractical application as well as impractical implications.  Furthermore, the author contradicts himself at times.  On the other hand, if you are a fan of Deepak Chopra you will probably like this book as it is in the same vein.  
 This loser tries to hide his racism behind witty anecdotes, but it is so clear that he hates other races, nations and cultures and frankly feels that they get what they deserve. Prof. of History???? What a joke! 
 Firstly, I have been a big fan of the aurora engine for PC based RPG games.  I loved BG 1 and 2 plus the first IWD but the sequal to which I found, to be honest, awful.  I was raised with the 2nd edition rule set and I have never played the 3rd (with the exception of NWN) but the fact that this game is based on the newer set of rules didn't bother me much.  It's a computer game after all, the exact mechanics of the system I dont have to understand.  The thing that did bother me about this game is the fact that it was one big battle after another.  Your commanders send you on endless suicide runs.  It got to the point where I could simply leave my game runing for an hour or two while my chacters could hack and slash their way through the tide of randomly spawned criters.  It got boring really fast.  Not too mention difficult as well.  The really sad part was, when I read the general plot outline, I was enthusiastic.  I have always wanted to see what would happen if the Orc races banned together in an army and attempted to invade.  But, when you and your 5 companions are the only ones on the front lines against an army... this is the point where (in pen and paper RPG's) that I tell the fellow who is hiring me to shove it 
 Cheap mixture of basic body language knowledge and psychology catered to the masses. Very shallow and some of its comments show a unbelievable degree of narrow-mindness (Comments like "if you look like this, you are like that" are all over the book). Very disappointing book, comments like "If someone speaks about sports a lot, he probably likes sports" (page 63) say it all. 
 The material was powerful, Morgan Freeman's delivery was great.  However, the cartoon/old movie clip material was frustratingly off-point and distracting.  What could/should have been an analysis of the political dealings of the right wing of the Republican party and a wake-up call to America, became an erratic difficult-to-follow series of interviews.  I was disappointed 
 Before I started reading "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," the book had a lot going for it: stellar reviews on the cover, an intriguing title and its status as one of five or six books found in the meager philosophy section at Walden Books in Pocatello.  Unfortunately, despite these advantages, the book failed to deliver anything but ambiguity and disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't very good.  I'm not sure whether the book is a memoir, a novel or a philosophical treatise. In "Zen" Robert Pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son, Chris in the 1970s. But the story, I guess, is not really about the bike trip itself but the thoughts the author has about quality and technology.  The only interesting passage of the whole book can be found on page  17:      "The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower."  That passage is good. The rest of the book is depressing and confusing. Throughout the entire motorcycle trip, the author ignores his son and becomes lost in his own head thinking deep thoughts about the definition of "quality."   I'm not sure if this book was intended as a novel, but if it was, it failed to produce character growth. It's standing as a work of philosophy is not much better. The author's ideas could have been explained in a 20 page essay and been much clearer.   Whatever the book was supposed to be, it didn't impressed me.  
 "One who doesn not believe in himself believes in God"  The burden of proof for God's existence falls on those who believe the unsubstantiated claim - this book answers nothing 
 Did not expect much for 10 bucks... but give me a break, 2 weeks and the plastic streched and tore around the handle up on top of the smoker.  I think a heavy duty trash bag is what this product is equivalent to 
 I bought this "portable" DVD player that bills itself as being the perfect solution for watching DVD's "on-the-go."  Unfortunately, as of the time I purchased it, the description fails to note that it must be plugged into a wall outlet or car power source.  Thus, it won't work on a plane, and if you use it in a car, you apparently have to run the cord up front to the power supply.  I think the name and description of this product is misleading.  The documentation states that you can buy a universal battery pack, but that would increase the cost substantially.  To be fair, the return process for the third-party seller is going smoothly, and after a bit of resistance, they have also agreed to reimburse the shipping costs for this item 
 The first third of the book has quite a bit of repetition.  Perhaps this was an attempt at establishing greater breadth but it just comes across as loosely structured prose.  Maybe the editor could have taken a cue from Cantor and deleted the middle third of the text in which the author gives a rather watered down version of the proof for incompleteness - thus  failing to live up to the book's subtitle. The final part deals with some of the personalities around Godel at the institute and - having finished with the more technical material - makes for an easier read 
 I have the 1995 British edition of this book - same cover, same authors, presumably the same text inside, but with the title "Postmodernism for Beginners". I think that title falls foul of the U.K's Trade Description Act, but so, I think, does the present one. I know a little about Postmodernism from a much better short book (Christopher Butler's "Postmodernism: A Very Short Introduction", Oxford 2002), and I found particularly the first half of the Appignanesi book absolutely impenetrable. That first half, unlike Butler's, includes Structuralism in Postmodernism; but on Structuralism you would do much better to read John Sturrock's short "Structuralism" (Paladin), which is much more lucid and accessible, even if it doesn't have pictures in it! The second half of the Appignanesi book does at least have some suggestive ideas about the contemporary world.  
 Yes, I like Oscar Lopez. No I do not like this particular CD of his.  It is way too bland, too much towards the soft-jazz genre instead of nuevo flamenco.  Look at his album Flashback.  There is a reason that NONE of the tracks on this cd appear on that album.  Buy Flashback instead and you'll be very happy with your purchase.  These other reviewers must like bland, middle-of-the-road soft jazz.  There is no kick or passion to this album.  Sometimes it happens when you have to produce just to produce. This isn't from his soul, there is it a decent album for background music 
 Am I doomed to hate electronic music forever? At the present time, I can count on one hand the number of artists within it that I generally enjoy; far too small a number to sustain an interest in the genre. The problem, as I see it, is that, as a sympton of the genre's machine and synthesizer foundation, that most electronic artists are profoundly lazy. They simply let the sample and preset banks do the work for them, resulting in music that is repetitive, dull, and soulless.  Darude's "Before the Storm" is a prime example of exactly what I mean by the above paragraph. Finnish artist Ville Virtanen achieved some degree of fame with the single "Sandstorm" which actually achieved some mainstream radio airplay; you've probably heard it at least once even if you don't listen to (or actively avoid) electronic music. As a piece of music, it's purely disposable; poppy hooks, an anthemic chorus, and a simplistic and repetitive structure. Well, one single isn't enough for a full-length album, so Darude filled up an entire album (yes, a full-length LP) of "remixes" and thinly-veiled knockoffs of his smash hit.  I have scarcely encountered music more bereft of imagination and creativity. EVERY song follows the same formula: a stale, 4/4 beat with some irritating, buzzing synth samples and, if you're lucky, some irritating vocals (most noticeable on track 9 "The Flow"). EVERY song is dripping with cheesy, repetitive pop hooks and banal melodies. Like all bad electronic music, the songs go nowhere and show no progression throughout their length, despite the fact that some run on for seven minutes or more. Darude is even so lazy as to reuse the same synth samples as featured on "Sandstorm", giving the listener the impression that Darude simply cut, pasted, and rearranged "Sandstorm" to fill out a full-length album. "Feel the Beat", for example, could have easily been a simple remix of "Sandstorm".  Furthermore, I take umbrage at people labelling this music as "trance". Perhaps I'm flaunting my ignorance of electronic music here, but isn't trance music supposed to be, I don't know, entrancing? Because there is absolutely nothing "entrancing" about this album. It's shallow, cloying, repetitive, and predictable, riding the success of the overplayed single "Sandstorm". This isn't trance. This is the kind of banal, disposable pap that's done nothing but turn a promising genre into a cesspool of cheese. Look elsewhere 
 Ragnar Benson is at his best when giving practical advise mixed with pragmatic philosophy.  This book unfortunately has little in the way of practical advise or thought provoking ideas.  Much is a rehash of earlier work 
 Loved the idea of being able to clip the iPod mount to the dash vents - unfortunately the execution of this concept was lacking in this product - the clips held to the vents - but they fell off the back of the mount.   We have gone with plan "B" and used the self adhesive mount directly on the dash. Sticks well - but can't see the iPod once it is in the mount. Well - at least we can keep out eyes on the road with one less distraction 
 I received this tea chest as a gift and am just now getting around to trying the teas.  The chest is beatiful and will be great for future use; however, I am thoroughly dissatisfied with the tea.  Although the bags are highly aromatic, the tea is very bland, as if the bags were old. I am sure Bentley teas are usually fresh and tasty, just not the box I received. 
 The story was the most silly and childish book that I ever read from this writer. Most dissapointed for a Danielle Steel novel. I had never had a book from Danielle Steel that I did not love but this one I don't know what else to say, bad, bad, bad 
 I DONT WONT TO DOWNLOAD IT I WONT IT ALL ON DVD THIS IS WASTE MONE 
 Everyone else seems to adore this book so I guess I have lost my sense of humor because I just don't like this particular version-- at least not for the 3 and under set.    My first objection stems from the use of bug spray by the 'old lady' to get rid of the fly.  She is shown sitting on a couch surrounded by cans of depleted insecticide while spraying more in her mouth.  Rather than find this funny, it scared me to think that some child might get a notion to copy this activity.    Then second is my objection to boiling a cat and chasing a dog with the same intent.  Now most children wouldn't do this so that's not a problem but I still don't like the idea of introducing this weird concept to my little boy.  (My son asked me if we needed to keep our cat inside and safe from the neighbors - hmmm.)  The funny part of all of this is that I don't mind when the old lady just pops the animals down her throat.  Go figure.  In any case, Nadine Westcott is a good story teller and her artwork is clever, but I still have to give this book two stars because of the above reservations.

 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 Everything is fine. Go back to sleep. Nothing happened here, move along. The government is honest. The Warren Report was totally comprehensive and answered all the questions. Believe. Obey. Go back to sleep. Everything is fine.  I did actually read this book. I will give one thing to the author, he certainly did a fine job finding many of the conflicts and contradictions in the "offical" story. Too bad he He didn't explain any of them. It is a fine research tool in that way.   Unfortunately for Posner his attempts to "debunk" are wholly inadequate and unconvincing. In fact this book is so filled with nonsense and speculation it does more to BOLSTER the case against the "Oswald did it alone" story. If it is true that this was a case of the "lone nut" why would the explantions have to be so over-reaching and internally inconsistent? If it was a straighforward case, the the evidence should be equally straightforward and not so convoluted.  The authors "explanations" are unsupported by fact and at times you can see Posner reaching to the point of "I don't even need to prove it, it should be obvious"  If this is the best effort to prove the Oswald "lone nut" story I no longer have any doubt about the conspiracy theory. If the lone nut story was true there would be supporting evidence that was consistent with the real facts, all the facts and not just the ones cherry picked by the author.  Nice try Mr. Posner 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 This book did not work for me. I believe that natural chemistry and relating to one another are the hallmarks of a mutual and intimate relationship. In this book, the author, rather than helping readers open themselves up to intimacy and be themselves, presents tricks on how to attract the opposite sex. Personally, I'm not looking to 'trick' anyone into going out with me or fall in love. How I open a car door for a woman or how she should or should not reach over to unlock the door for me as I'm walking around after I've opened the car door for her feels like protocol designed to play 'the game' properly. I don't feel that it's a game. It's about being true to ourselves. It's about relating - being best friends. And we are not peacocks - displaying our feathers at such a time and presenting at a certain time. We are empowered with language. I'm more partial to books that explore the similarities between men and women rather than the differences as Gray does. Authors that I recommend are Charlotte Kasl, John Welwood and John Stoltenberg. Good luck! 
 I thought this was a fun read some years back..well-written..hence my first inclination to give it 2 stars, but taking another look..if a man ever wrote about his "repulsion" over sex with an overweight woman, the way Robin describes sex with Michael, we'd be taking to the streets in protest...there was such an unkindness to it..and this was a woman with a dear, overweight friend...I'm changing my mind..back to one star..too much shallow emphasis on looks, money, etc..it's not a race thing..it makes all women look bad. Well, maybe just these women..I'd like to think some of us are different 
 A tribute is defined as "a gift or other acknowledgement of gratitude, respect, or admiration."  That is what you have here. But, if you want a true picture of that incredible morning, don't waste your time and money, look elsewhere 
 Having lost faith and taken a skeptical approach to religion I was hopeful that this book would lead me into rethink.  No way! Tired and inaccurate, not a waste of time though as I found myself constanly jumping up with "That's not true." "What a jump!" and that's a downright fabrication! 
 This is a case where the book is wonderful and the movie is just pathetic.  I hadn't read the book before seeing the movie.  The film stunk.  A few years later, I read the book and was enchanted.  I did not make the connection that this was the same story until I saw the film again on late night tv.  I was all excited to see one of my favorite books on the screen.  Then, I realized what movie it was.  I tried to sit through it.  I just couldn't.  The monster should have eaten the film 
 Warner Bros is putting out a series of "Signature Collections".  They are nothing of the sort.  They are studio collections. The word signature implies the best of the best. A signature collection of Hitch's work would not include several of these titles. The rarely seen Foreign Correspondent and I Confess. The failed comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith. The experimental Dial M for Murder and The Wrong Man.  The middling Stage Fright. Only Strangers on a Train and North By Northwest are signature Hitchcock.  Where are Psycho,  Vertigo, The Birds, Rear Window, Notorious, Shadow of a Doubt, Rebecca, The 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes and, purhaps even, The Lodger?  A signature collection would include all or most of these titles with North by Northwest and Strangers on a Train.  Of course this would oblidge the different studios to cooperate with each other. God forbid. Warner Bros is developing a reputation for shortchanging and lying to its customers.  You're much better off buying your favorite Hitchcock titles individually new or used 
 I have sent away for a book called "Lord Given Lovers:the Holy Union of David & Jonathan" as I find the subject very interesting in this day of same sex marriages, now that David has been used in this subject as married to Jonathan, in the days when the Scibes who wrote the law against such things, I would like to know why David and Jonathan were not stoned to death according to that same law, and if David did such a thing, I would believe that all the Jews then would have did so to, copying David and Jonathan`s example 
 While this book is a classic in American history it does not compare to modern histories. While Parkman selectively uses his evidence and omits key details the prose is very good. Overall though this book should not be used due to the inaccuracies.  He also omits the contributions of the Indians which was a decisive factor in the war. See either Crucible of War, Empires at war or The Scratch of a Pen.  
 This has to be the most boring book I have ever read. Well, I haven't quite finished it yet as it's taking forever to push my way through it. And I'm sure that more boring books exist, I just haven't read them.    I wanted to learn about KKR and LBOs - particularly as a division of KKR recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer. I was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes. But this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved. There really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information. And a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material. It felt a bit like watching someone else's home video. It probably means a lot to the people involved, especially as they'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants, but it's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness.  I'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway. People don't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years. What are remembered are broad brushstrokes - and this is what the author should have written.  There are occasional moments of entertainment - like Ted Forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds. But most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting.   The fact is: I wanted some of this information in this book. As it provided some of this, albeit with a lot of suffering on my part, I'll give it two stars.  Update: Well I did finish this book eventually. My final opinion is much the same 
 This movie has nothing to do with a house. Its really just a low budget rape porn. I tossed it in the trash about 20 minutes into it. 
 If you seriously know nothing about the opening then this book will probably help you some.  However, if you already have gathered all the basic concepts (which seem to be mentioned in pretty much every chess book ever made) then this book is a waste of money.  Even for the complete beginner, I reccomend the recent books Openings for White/Black Explained by Lev Alburt, Roman D., etc., which can serve as both an introduction and a full course.    I thought this book would give me a repertoir, so I would know some actual openings.  However, the coverage of any one opening is so minimal you definitely dont know enough to actually play it in anysort of competetive way.  To repeat: this book will not teach you to play openings competetively, it is only an introduction.  Seirawan briefly covers classical openings and then covers in slightly more depth his "opening solution" which is the Kings Indian Defense versus d4, the Pirc versus e4, and the Kings Indian Attack as White.  First off, I found I do not enjoy playing any of those openings at all.  What is the advantage of being able to play the same 5+ moves at the start of every game? Then what after that?  Well these openings are not devoid of theory and once you reach the end of the first 5 moves you have just as much work to do as with any other opening;  you have just delayed the inevidable conflict for the center--which means a slower, longer, duller game.  Secondly, if you do like these openings you will still have to buy more books that actually cover them!  I would reccommend, even if you are a beginner, to buy the Openings Explained for White / Black by Lev Alburt, Roman D.  Besides full coverage of the openings in the repertoir book, it also briefly covers some other traditional openings (just like winning chess openings).  If you want an introduction you have one in the first chapter; if you want to really LEARN an opening then you have that too.  Or if you already have an idea what openings your want to play then DEFINITELY don't get this book, instead get some thorough books on that/those openings 
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist [...] fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 I expected a little more from this book than creating a simple java file and compiling it. This book is for someone who is new to IDEs. This is *NOT* for someone trying for a quick reference to migrate from another IDE to Eclipse - which was my purpose 
 At first this case seemed like a good idea, but after the 3rd use, the zipper broke. Since the case does not stay open on its own, there is  tendency to push the case open and force the zipper backward and apart. After fixing it a couple of times, it is now permanently broken. Bad design. Maybe Velcro would have been better 
 This book has a few things that maybe of good use. I must admit that the illustrations provided were wonderful for demonstrating the points that Duquette wanted to make. Also the "primer" on Hebrew was nice. This is a very compact book of simple facts for the basic of basics.  What I did not care for in this book was the basic attitude and approach. Now by that I do not mean the humor, which I rather enjoyed. The attitude that motivates the book has the same wreckless approach as Crowley which should come as no surprise since Duquette is so heavily involved with the OTO. Also, the underpinnings of of Duquette's philosophy are 1) tenuous at best and 2) hinged completely on Crowley. This is all well and good if one believes Crowley is the be all/end all of occultism. Not so good if one, like myself, does not.   The basic line also veers far to close to pantheism. Again, great if you are a pantheist. Not so great if, like myself, you are not. [I am talking about the thought that underlies what is being taught in this book]  The good things about this book is that it is super basic while being short and to the point. What is not so good about it is it hinges far to heavily on Crowley and pantheism.   Over all I would say that if you like Crowley that much better to just read his works. Better, in my humble opinion, to read works by Fortune, Regardie, Kraig or Greer 
 Ansay gives us an anguished portrait of families trapped in a cycle of violence, stifled by religion and small-town culture. Ellen bucks the system by being a working mom, but when her husband loses his job must move in with her in-laws, and is exposed to their vitriol and dark secrets. This book is disturbing on a number of levels, and not for entertainment at all. I found the story extremely realistic but the ending all the more unsatisfying because although Ellen plans to escape, it leaves the guilty unpunished and the scars to her children unhealed. I'd rather have a happy ending,and I finished this book feeling sick. Two stars for gritty realism, but this isn't "light reading" or entertaining at all. Be warne 
 Takes FOREVER to shave - and still doesn't get everything - still have to end up shaving with a razor.  Frustrating - but good concept 
 This supposedly radical tale of adolescence, shallow political conviction, lesbianism and prostitution was a letdown.  Tea's prose reminds me of those girls who will natter incessantly to anyone who will listen about their  self-inflicted degradation with all the gory details but not a point to be  found.  Lacking introspection and only rarely showing flashes of wit, this  one's a simplistic catalog of truly sad events.  It is not helped by its  affected prose style, featuring teen-girly exclamations, run-ons, and  erratic capitalization.  This is beneath Tea, who doesn't seem willing to  write at her obviously high intelligence level.  She does a great  disservice to this material, which could have been incisive literature  rather than the forgettable trash it is 
 I listened to the unabridged version on tape.  I enjoy audio books because I'm able to work at the same time (I paint).  So I get to feed my desire for great fiction, and get my work done at the same time.    Blair Brown did an incredible job as a narrator. She was able to create a unique "voice" for each character in the story,making  it easy for the reader to keep track of all of the characters from the get go.  However, by the time I got to the end of the tape, I was glad that I at least had painted those six hours instead of wasting my time reading this novel!  I was so disappointed at the end, and found myself really irritated by the main character about three quarters of the way into the story. From the beginning of the story, I was irritated by the character's daughters too.  Also, I was irritated that nothing outwardly seemed to change in Rebecca's life.  OK, she had an arc, but it was all in her head. I found it very unfullfilling.  If I hadn't been passively listening to the story, while doing something else, I probably wouldn't have finished the novel 
 This is a fine book if you want to see what someone very smart has to say about Machiavelli's major works.  What I wanted, however, was to understand the context in which Machiavelli wrote, and I would have loved to get some information on how and why his ideas began to have influence beyond Florence.  If you understand references to the founding of Rome, to 15th century Papal politics, and have a good grounding in Livy, this book is for you.  If, like me, what you wanted from a introduction to Machiavelli was to have someone explain Machiavelli's context and allusions, look elsewhere 
 I BELIEVE THE SPELLING OF THIS QUEEN'S NAME IS WRONG - ALL THE DOCUMENTS AND BOOKS I READ REFER TO HER AS    " HATSHEPSUT&quot 
 This must be one of the latest entries in the Dan Brown school of writing. Name an expert, assign an audience, lecture on historical points and expect applause at the end. Well, Kathy Reichs can wait for a long time. There will be no applause for this book. I would like my money back. I'm almost finished and still can't really figure out what the plot actually is. I guess she will just pop the final lecture and the conclusion will name the murderer. What about motive, character development (sex + history), etc... This is my first novel by this author and it will be my last 
 I like the style of shoes but It really troublesome for me. It get dirty so quick and hard to clean it. If I knew about it, I wouldn't buy it. the color of black trim will come out so easyly when it touch with water. After that, it makes the leather dirty and so hard to clean it.  Just dont wear it when it is raining. Any way, I hate to clean it everytime 
 I just cancelled my subscription and recommended that my daughter cancel the one I bought for my 14 year-old grandson.  For some reason Ziff-Davis marketers think that  full page ads selling sex videos are appropiate for PC magazine. (Dec 27, 2005, p 122 if you want to check it out).  Previous issues had partial page ads selling "sex pheremones" which I could almost overlook, but full pages scantily clad lap dancers is over the line.  
 Johnny Depp (Secret Window, Ed Wood) goes up into space with his friend, actor Nick Cassevettes (son of Director John Cassevettes, starred in Face/Off) and both of them come back, in tact although Cassevettes soon after at a party dies and then his wife kills herself. Theron becomes more and more suspicious of her husband as she finds out evidence that Depp might not be her husband, but get this, an alien and that the twins she's carrying in her stomach are aliens as well. Then, she's all alone when her Sister and other's wind up missing. Bland boring thriller offers too many things that really dont add up to anything and the finale is hilariously dumb. Depp tries his best to rise above material that seemed to of been remade from other good movies and Theron cant show her talents as she lets all the stuff crumble on top of her....she's done way better people and so has Depp. Also starring Joe Morton (Speed, Terminator 2), Clea DuVall (Ghosts Of Mars, 13 Conversations About One Thing), Tom Noonan (Armageddon, Knockaround Guys), Donna Murphy and Gary Grubbs (Tv's Angel). A failed thriller 
 Before purchasing this item, please check with your safety services division in your state regarding the use of this product with carseats.  I purchased this item with the hopes of keeping my newborn warm - but after I received it I was told by the Director of Safety Services in our state that these items compromise the integrity of the belts in the carseats.  I also had a very hard time tightening the belts in the carseat because the openings for the belts did not line up well. Instead, I returned it and purchased a Kiddopotamus, which is shearling-lined and zips but fits OVER the carseat.  The Bundle-Me item is perfect for strollers, but NOT for use with a carseat.  While I want to keep my baby warm, I think it is MUCh more important that she be safe and secure in her seat 
 I bought all of the examcracker books- some were good, but this book was obviously hastily prepared- there are numerous typos as well as redundant questions.  The title of the book makes it seem like you're going to get thorough practice in organic chemistry but all of the questions are too short and straightforward to be relevant to the MCAT.  Unfortunately, I don't know of any good book for MCAT organic chemistry- it's certainly not this one, though 
 It didn't match the Acoustic Wave player I bought. There should have been also two outdoor speakers, as a promotion for buying both pieces.  The page, from which I ordered both pieces, was unclear, and I received the CD player with the wrong CD Changer.   I had to return the changer and buy the one that matched the player. (I know I'll be refunded the price of the first changer). But by then, the promotion they were having for the outdoor speakers had finished. I received the real changer a few days later, but lost the speakers. I think Amazon owes me the speakers, which is what the bad page made me miss 
 For whatever reason, the Religious Right dislikes the theory of evolution. It seems that their only goal in life is to "disprove" it (despite the fact that for 150 years they've been woefully unsuccesful). Sadly these people, Mr. Hangeraaff especially, have no knowledge about science or how to approach it. The "research" in this book is written with the conclusion already in mind.  His goal in the "research" is to prove what he WANTS to be true. This is NOT science. Science is supposed to involve drawing logical conclusions based upon evidence. If you already drew your conclusion before you began, as Mr. Hanegraaff clearly has, then why bother researching at all? Well in this case it's to give the illusion of "science", since even the religious right are aware that science is more believable than faith.  This book is a collection of half truths, deliberate lies, misinterpretations, and outdated beliefs and models. This is a prime example of someone with a blatant agenda spewing their own personal beliefs.  Evolution is currently 100% accepted by the respected scientific community, so where's the fire Mr. Hanegraaff?  This is biased nonsense and should be avoided by anyone who cares for true science, or for anyone with the ability to reason.  I'll end where I started: Why is evolution a problem for the Religious Right 
 There isn't a fact or bit of advice in this poorly written book that you can't easily find and read on the Net for free. Written by yet another patient that thinks she can write and has something to say 
 The write-up on this SoftHeat Plus heating pad makes no mention of a "New" feature that automatically shuts the pad off after 1 hour.  I specifically wanted one that did NOT have an auto-shutoff timer.  Damn!  Back it goes.  
 I am doing a self study and do not have any facility to get help of any instructor. I purchased the book after got good reference from some of my friends. The content of the book is pretty good...BUT when it comes to the problems...there are a very very few worked out examples (as usual they are the easiest ones)...Addition to that the publisher decided to earn every bits of pennies. So they created a Student's solution manual. No where in the publisher's site anything mentioned about the manual. But when I purchased , found that the manual has solution for ONLY Odd numbered solution (for them the answers are given in the original book). I was wondering whether they have another solution manual for EVEN numbered problems...!!!  The instructor's manual is out of stock and you cannot download it from the publisher's site (unless you are an Instructor which I am not).  Now I am wondering how I can get help on the even numbered problems....any idea?? 
 Some books, in my opinion, are just plain overrated.  The characters in this novel are dull and uninteresting.  Likewise the tale.  The reader takes nothing from it. Put this in a list with Franzen's The Corrections and Frazier's Cold Mountain of award winning novels that did not deserve the accolades 
 I purchased this book because I am interested in environmental issues and I saw a favorable newspaper review.  I found Ms. Royte's style so rambling, long-winded, and anecdotal that it was difficult to stay focussed for the kernels of real information that occasionally popped up.  And now I feel badly for the energy wasted and trees harvested on account of my purchase. 
 Released in 2000, this album has come in many different options.  The original album, which is this CD, has 11 songs and is 44 minutes long.  Also available is a Lovers Rock CD with some bonus live tracks on the disc.  There is also two disc option, with the original Lovers Rock CD, and a bonus CD of a few live tracks.  Lovers Rock is also included as a bonus CD in the DVD Lovers Live (which comes in a standard DVD case).  The best value is to get the Lovers Rock CD with the bonus Lovers Live DVD in the standard jewel case. Confusing?  THIS CD DOES NOT MAKE THE MOST OF SADE'S VOICE OR SONG WRITING.  This is really a stark, stripped down sound for Sade, especially when you compare it to her early work.    Seven of the tracks are driven by muted electronic rhythms and a muffled background music.  I don't think the sound works well with Sade's vocal style.  She sings flat and without emotion.  All seven of these tracks sound alike and the CD gets boring and monotonous.    The songs that are good are where she drops the electronic rhythms and lets the emotion of her voice come through, or where she livens up and starts to rock.  On The Sweetest Gift and It's Only Love That Gets You Through, Sade sings to almost no accompanyment.  Here she sings in a great jazz/blues style and really lets the emotion of her voice come through.  King of Sorrow and Immigrant are a little more upbeat rockers. (they are not really rockers, but do rock when you compare to the other tracks on the CD). Here she sings with more energy and variation.  So, if she is the King of Sorrow, I think I might consider turning gay 
 Yes it is a quick and easy read, but such a predictible soap opera/Bollywood story with very little development that you can really do without it.  This genre is booming and there are some great books out there, I would advocate trying to find another title to bu 
 I am always looking for easy, but delicious weeknight recipes and picked this up because it was on sale. The running lists of brand names ingredients in the recipes gave me pause, but since the Semi-Homemade series appears to be very successful, I thought I'd give it a try.   This book disappointed on many levels, primarily because the recipes are so unhealthy. I'm not a health nut but any means, but most of these recipes are deep in junk food territory. If I made them every night, I'm quite certain I'd have a family of butterballs in no time flat.  Given the choice of so many other quick and easy cookbooks out there, I can't see why anyone would choose to go down the Semi-Homemeade road. I can easily recommend books like "Half-Scratch Magic", any of Leslie Revsin's "The Simpler, The Better" books or many of Rachael Ray's 30-Minute Meal books, that don't rely so heavily on cans and boxes to produce delicious, healthy dishes with a minimum of fuss. Eating Well's "Healthy in a Hurry" has some very good recipes in it, too.  I finally saw Sandra Lee's show, after buying the book, and could barely watch it. Perhaps I'm being unfair because I only saw one episode, but she seems extremely weird and I found it hard to watch her "cook."   By and large, I found that the recipes in Semi-Homemade Cooking are most similar to those found in some of the more obscure community cookbooks which you can get in bundles on eBay for less than a dollar 
 I made mistake getting such a big & bulky case for small MiniDV Sony camcorder HC26. This case can take any big size old camcorders (like old Sony Hi8), so if you are looking for your new camcorder this definately is a bad choice 
 In "Using Terri", Jon Eisenberg attempts to provide the reader with insight into the legal, ethical, moral, and medical aspects of the tragic death of Terri Schiavo.   He falls far short of the mark on all of them.  In his November 6, 2005 review for the New York Times William Saletan succinctly sums up the book:  ""Using Terri" is just another use of Terri."   Eisenberg begins with the death of his 79 year old aunt Ros trying to draw a parallel between her and Terri.  The situations could not be more different.  No one, not Eisenberg, nor her two brothers had any desire to care for Ros.   Her case is indeed tragic and agonizing.  Had she not been dehydrated to death her fate would most probably have been to remain institutionalized and uncared for until she finally succumbed to a sad end.  A very different fate awaited Terri were she to be delivered into the care of her parents and siblings.  She would have received the best loving care and devotion that her parents could lavish on her; she would have most probably lived a long life, giving love to all those around her and perhaps even being able to receive the love that was lavished upon her.  But Eisenberg and the bioethics community would have us believe that Terri's life was a life "not worthy of life".   They are absolutely certain, beyond all doubt, that a severely brain damaged person is, in fact not a person at all.   He or she is simply a vegetable to be treated as an inanimate object.  Vegetables, like pet rocks, and tomatoes can never receive love.  Vegetables do not have, nor should they have, access to the rights and privileges that "normal" people take for granted.  This certainty permeates Eisenberg's book at every level and every page.  Symptomatic of this certainty is the obscenely arrogant inscription placed by Michael on Terri's tombstone which reads "Born December 3, 1963, departed this earth February 25 1989, at peace March 31, 2005."     What Eisenberg and so many in the bioethics community conveniently forget is that all too often the most horrendous acts of cruelty and evil are committed by those that, like them, are absolutely certain that what they are doing is good and just.  Jacob Bronowski devotes a chapter in his classic work "The Ascent of Man" to the issue of knowledge and uncertainty.   In describing the Nazi horror he stands in swamp outside the crematorium at Auschwitz and declares:   "When people believe that they have absolute knowledge, with no test in reality, this is how they behave. This is what men do when they aspire to the knowledge of gods... We have to cure ourselves of the itch for absolute knowledge and power."       If you feel you must read this book I would at least urge you to exam impartially the other side.  Read Wesley Smith; read David Galenter, read Dr. Daniel Eisenberg; read Jacob Bronowski; read Rita Marker, and yes read father Frank Pavone whom Eisenberg so brutal and unjustly demonizes.   They are my heroes.   And question Eisenberg's statements, his description of the events, his conclusions and especially his demonizing of those who disagree with him.  Sometimes one's motives and philosophies can be revealed in the most trivial passages.  There is one such sentence that especially struck me in "Using Terri"; on p 191 Eisenberg describes the scene at the hospice on the last day of Terri life:  "A woman blew on a shofar - a ritual horn sounded by the ancient Hebrews during battle."   As a Jew and as human being I find such appalling ignorance of my religion deeply insulting.  But in a wider sense perhaps it is symptomatic of Eisenberg's utter contempt for everything that does not fit into a purely secular framework and does not worship at the altar of the false god of autonomy.    
 Although relevant and relatable, "Rock Star Superstar" is a novel with obvious faults. It almost tries to be TOO relatable, with its constant references to recent and 'underground' bands such as Death Cab for Cutie, Queens of the Stone Age, Interpol, and Hot Hot Heat. The repetitive naming of everyday items associated with brand names verges on outlandish product placement, with mentions of Fender Precision basses and iPods. I feel these snippets of "current life" date and I don't see this novel as being very memorable or having any longevity.  Other reviewers have brought up the realness of the writing, and that is only because the style feels like it was written by a fourteen year old who had to do this for an English 9 project. Everything that happened in the book seemed rushed and hardly explained anything, all the characters were stereotyped to the point of unrealistic, and I found that I hardly felt for the protagonist at all.   This novel is worth a solid hour and a half of snickering, but that is all. Terribly written, terrible book.  There are much better books in this genre 
 This is an update of a prior review I wrote of this book, I changed my mind. I hadn't read the entire book but had been impressed with what I had read. The book does cover many aspects of commercial banking including regulations, capital and liquidity management, things of most interst to me as an analyst. However, a significant problem is that many of the examples used appear to be incorrect. For instance, the text often does not match the accompanying exhibits or tables. Perhaps the book was not edited well during an update to a new edition, and either the text or the exhibit/table was updated but not both (ie, in numerous cases they disagree). Whatever the reason, the numerous typographical errors made the book difficult to read, especially in a "self-study" situation. I'm looking elsewhere for a better guide 
 Ugh! The writing in this book was so bad! It was so hokey, like a bad soap opera with a religious bent. The storylines were so transparent, everyone of them ended up exactly where I suspected they were going. I love faith promoting books and writings; I just couldn't get past the corniness and predictability of this book to feel the spirit and message the authors intended

 "It is now widely assumed that religion played a minimal role in forming America's Founding ideals.  America's Founders, it is said, consciously rejected religious principles and borrowed their best ideas about law and politics from the ancient Greeks and Romans in addition to Renaissance and Enlightenment philosophers.  This view is common throughout most history textbooks today.  Although Greek, Roman, Renaissance, and Enlightenment sources were important, their influence has been overemphasized, while the influence of religion has been seriously understated."  This paragraph from the Foreword of Never Before in History sounds like a reasonable thesis and one for which I have great sympathy.  Unfortunately, this book never quite lives up to its thesis due to a combination of poor scholarship and sloppy reasoning.  For example: -John Calvin was never the mayor of Geneva, as the book asserts (p. 46) - he wasn't even a citizen of Geneva until shortly before his death.  -Slavery in the south could not have troubled the northern Puritans, as is asserted on p. 119, as letters are available in which the northern Puritans discussed which races made the best slaves.  -The authors, throughout the first part of the book, champion "consent of the governed" when discussing the colonies' break with England.  But when they reach the writing of the US Constitution, however, they claim that it was a "permanent bond that could only be broken by death."    -In order to prove the Puritan influence on the Founders, the authors try to tie the major characters of the Revolutionary era to the Puritans through various tenuous connections, e.g. Samuel Adams was a Puritan because he went to Harvard, which was founded by Puritans.  This last point is, I think, the most egregious error of this book.  It flattens over a century of colonial history into a one-dimensional picture, so that the authors can equate any one who believes in God in the 18th century with the Puritans of the 17th century.  Surely the Congregationalists, Unitarians, and Deists of the 18th century had little in common with their Puritan forbears of the 16th century.  Attending a college founded by Puritans over 100 years earlier hardly made one a Puritan.  If you are interested in the thesis that this book begins with, a far better source is A Theological Interpretation of American History by C. Gregg Singer.  Like Amos and Gardiner, Singer believes that we can identify Christian influences in the founding of our nation, but we must look beyond the founders to the Puritans.  Writing over 20 years before NBIH, Singer, accurately describes the problems apparent in the later book:  "That the Jeffersonian democracy was founded on Christian principles and simply reflects the social implications of the Gospels is one of the most deadly, and at the same time one of the most persistent errors of contemporary America.  The reference to God in the Declaration of Independence, and the apparent submission to his will, should not blind us to the tragic misuse of biblical ideas to convey Deistic principles for the realization of a society which would be essentially humanistic and anti-supernaturalistic in character." 	"Many sincere evangelicals are unwilling to accept this fact, apparently in the fear that in so doing they are conceding too much ground to those who, in our own day, wish to carry this process of secularization to even further excesses than occurred in the early days of the Republic.  Their motives are most worthy, but the ground they have chosen on which to defend the evangelical cause, and the cause of a truly biblical conception of the American state, is faulty.  They must choose higher ground and that higher ground is the Puritan conception of our destiny, the Puritan Dream for America.  Puritanism did not lack for defenders and while their voices were stilled to a great degree during the excitement and full bloom of the Revolution, they would still be heard, and that Puritan heritage would rise again to give health and vigor to the new nation under the Constitution, for in the Convention of 1787, it would gain a hearing that it had been denied in that earlier assembly.  An evangelical strategy which overlooks the clear testimony of history in regard to the nature and purposes of Jeffersonian democracy in the interests of preserving the essential elements of a Christian patriotism is doing a great disservice both to the Gospel and to the very patriotism it is seeking to preserve."  (pp. 41-42)  Singer explains the difference:   "The Puritans held to a very different conception of liberty from that which is so prevalent in contemporary thought and governmental theory.  For the Puritan, liberty was in no way associated with the doctrine of natural law and natural rights, but found its origin and meaning in that covenant which God had made with his people.  Liberty was not a natural right, but a God-given right and privilege to be zealously guarded from despots, to be sure, but also subject to precise Biblically-defined limits." (p. 17)  "The whole conception of government that would later be proclaimed by John Locke and others, which placed the sovereignty in the hands of the people and which found the origin of government in a human compact was utterly unknown to the Puritans."  (p. 18)  These two very different ideas are simply flattened into one by Amos and Gardiner and labeled "Christian."  Although history does need to be somewhat "simplified" for children, it should certainly not be simplified beyond usefulness.  This is what I think Amos and Gardiner have done, to the detriment of our students.  
 Advertisement for this book is misleading. I thought it was the actual book, however its merely a workbook full of vocabulary. Not helpful at all!!! Save your money, you will still need the real book anyway! 
 Somebody else here described the author, Barrett Tillman, as a "US Navy groupie."  Whoever wrote that hit the nail on the head.  This is a book aimed squarely at a nostalgic, generally politically right-wing Americans who enjoy hearing stories of how brave their boys were, how great their weapons were, how great the odds were, how great their sacrifice was, and how sweet the victory was.  It is a true life adventure sotry for people whose concept of history is closely related to knowing unit histories and aircraft variants.  Scholarly, insightful, and deep, it ain't.  Now, don't get me wrong - the boys were brave (very much so) and the weapons were cool and so on and so forth.  And there is very much a place in the world (I guess) for a book that very conspicuously goes out of its way to name virtually every possible named American sailor and airman, knowing full well that this could lead to a sale by the sailor or airman's family, extended family, and so forth.  Such people deserve this sort of book - they deserve our eternal honor, respect, and thanks.  However, the Marianas Turkey Shoot / Battle of the Phillipine Sea deserves a more adult and balaced treatment.  It also deserves better writing than this 8th grade-level stuff.  The good news is that Barrett Tillman has taken a bunch of good detail and anecdotes, mixed it in with a bunch of bravado and nonsense, and has produced something that future historians can build upon.  The bad news is that those of us expecting a "Shattered Sword" or "Fire in the Sky" caliber analysis will have to wait until somebody picks up the mantle.  Oddities and absurdities:    - The book features a Rush-Limbaughesque intro by Steven Coonts where he rails about NAFTA and wonders who will build America's LSTs when the next World War 2 comes about since our manufacturing jobs have been shipped to China for low low WAL*MART prices.  The introduction is embarassing to read.  - One of the reviews, by Henry Sakaida, lauds the book for it's "balance and fairness."  I wonder if that guy even read the book.   There are maybe a dozen total pages that deal with the Japanese side of things, and they are mostly general background.  Clearly, Tillman has been surpassed elsewhere by writers who actually speak Japanese or could be bothered to collaborate with somebody who does, as his bibliographical sources dealing with the Japanese side of things is shallow and out of date.  As i skipped a few pages here and there I could not swear to this 100%, but I don't think Tillman interviewed a single - NOT ONE - Japanese associated with the battle.  - The book's seethes of jingoism.  Pilots on all sides over-estimated and over-claimed aerial victories ("kills").  When describing American over-claims, Tillman not unreasonably excuses young and excited pilots for their overeagerness.  When descriving Japanese overclaims, however, the prose is full of sarcastic, sneering quotation marks.  The contempt Tillman has for the Japanese (or at least, the contept he portrays in order to play to the sensibilities of a certain demographic of book buyer) is obvious.  - In a giant aerial battle such as the Marianas Turkey Shoot, the very least one expects from a serious history is a comparison of killed claims vs actual losses.  Mind-numbingly, this is basically nowhere to be found in the book.  However, there are literally dozens of paragraphs that go like this:  "Lt Joe B. Smith of Little Rock, AR saw four Zekes and with his wingman, Lt Robert F Jones of Missoula, MT took three scalps in a space of five minutes while the last one scurried away into the cloud cover."  No attempt is made to verify such events, link them to the faceless Japanese pilots, or even, for the most part, provide good technical analysis of the air combat.  That said, here and there Tillman has included interesting anecdotes, stories, and technical details that are a testament to his many years of research and experience.  Unfortunately, a lot of it is also complete BS.  Besides the expected stuff that has filtered through from his interviews of veterans and their occasionally over-vivid memories, there's some technical nonsense that Tillman has simply made up.  For example, in describing dive bombing attacks on aircraft carriers, he suggested that SBD pilots would aim to drop their bombs on the stern (as opposed to the center of the flight deck, the normal preferred aim point) if they happened to see parked and fueled planes there.  This is all well and good in theroy - in practice, this never happened and, for all practical purposes, never could happen.  It's simply an example of Tillman basically making something up that sounds technically plausible but actually simply does not reflect historical, operational reality.  Should you buy this book?  It depends.  When I was 14 I ate these kind of books up (the one that comes to mind is "The Fighting Lady", a book about the USS Yorktown CV10 that I read when I was about 10) because I didn't know any better.  They helped me imagine that I was there and ignited an interest and a passion in the subject.  Then I grew up and my desire for insight and balance grew.  Therefore, I personally found this book quite unsatisfying.  I think in general it's just very, very average 
 Over the years, I owned several Proton radios.  Beautiful design, great sound - WHEN they worked.  Repairs were costly and time-consuming.  Nevertheless, I purchased a Sangean radio from Amazon.  It lasted two months - then, no volume.  I now have three broken Proton/Sangean radios in storage - if only to remind me to never again buy their products 
 This book on the black market makes a case for going back to views popular in the 1960s.  In the 1960s, the black market was populated with cold-war spies and gun running free-booters.  Since then, the popular press has painted the black market as a drug running paradise.  Naylor tries to convince us this image is a lie.  The real black market criminals are capitalist executives in the military-industrial complex.  Defined in this manner, 'Wages of Crime' becomes a traditional left wing vehicle for brow beating those unwilling to genuflect before Marxist-Leninist dogma.   This critique is not limited to attacks on the US political establishment.  At one point Naylor laments that Gorbachev's generation 'forgot its ideological roots'.  On another page, Naylor describes the proletarian interests in South East Asia.  The reader won't find the standard pulp crime stories here, which is a blessing.  Unfortunately, the book relies on rhetorical flourish rather than statistics. Thus, it simply substitutes one stereotype with a second.    The text was pulled from independent articles, so the flow is sometimes uneven.  For example, a chapter seeking to debunk the political might of heroin/cocaine dealers tries to convince the reader that drugs are of marginal economic importance.  He complains that the published estimates of drug dealer wealth are too high by perhaps a factor of 100.  In another chapter, rich drug dealers engage in crimes with military-industrial complex.  
 This is great if you have all the time and money to spend on Hors D'Oeuvres--I would not buy it again, but it was fun to look at 
 In the beginning of this book I found it a bit disturbing; however, I pressed on and I was glad. I soon came to be highly disappointed by this book though because it seemed so cliche` in the fact that almost every drugged out junkie seems to find a god and heal themselves; then discuss it for 15 chapters. Aside from that fact, almost 3/4 of the book was about doing various drugs, I felt it was drug out too long and could have been summed up in fewer chapters. It got to be monotonous and tiresome reading about the authors junkie habits over and over again. Although the book had great potential and could have been one of the greats; I felt it became monotonous 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 I too wasn't very impressed with Jarhead.  I thought half way through that Jarhead seemed more like an insider movie for those who actually experienced the Marines, and perhaps other branches of the military.  For those of us who haven't I just don't think there was enough direction to keep a lot of us interested.  As someone else mentione.  I too thought it was going to be a more modern version of Full Metal Jacket, but afte the first few minutes it was obvious it wasn't.. 
 I repeat, the original had no room for a sequel. What a waste of film and talent. This stuff is worthless. Enough said 
 While there was some useful information,this book appeared to be an effort to prove Ms. Vencent's prejudices, rather than the voyge of discovery that it could have been. The author seemed to be searching for the very worst in men, and of course, she found it.  The fact that she would join a men's bowling league, when she couldn't bowl was simply amazing.  I don't think a man (or most women) would ever consider doing such a thing. In addition to the lack of substance, I feel the book was written in a very unengaging and simplistic style. Overall, it was one of the few books I have bought over the years that I don't believe was worth the money.  If you must buy this book, find a used one, or better yet, get it from the library.  If I ever see another book written by Ms. Vincent, I will pass 
 I work at Monte Sano State Park and when I compared the section about the "Plateau Loop Trail" (also known as the North Plateau Loop and South Plateau Loop) with our trail map (which is not, as is stated in the book, 50 cents, but $2.00 because it is a very detailed and excellent map) I saw numerous mistakes.  Firstly, only a very fast and experienced hiker could do the entire trail in an hour.  I can do the North Plateau Loop in 40 minutes, but that is at a fast pace, and it is only 1.2 miles, whereas the entire loop is about 4.8 miles.  Also, hiking is not free at the park.  There is an admission fee for all hikers, bikers and picnickers.  One of the "ruins" the author describes is the site of a lodge built several years ago, which is used for meetings and events.  Some of the landmarks and cross-trails he describes are not correct, and he doesn't even mention where the North Plateau Loop crosses the road that leads into the park! Someone unfamiliar with that trail would have difficulty picking it up on the other side of the road, as it is not easy to see. He also has the Bog Trail meet up with the South Plateau Loop twice before it meets with the Mountain Mist Trail, where it actually meets it the second time after the intersection of the Mountain Mist Trail.  There are so many mistakes in this one trail description that I wonder how many other trail descriptions are in error.  As far as Monte Sano State Park goes, we have twenty miles of hiking and/or biking trails, and your best bet would be to come to the park and purchase one of our trail maps, and if possible talk to one of the rangers, who are extremely knowledgable about the park trails.  And a $2.00 accurate map is certainly better than an inaccurate $13.00 book 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 I am a huge Tim Powers fan, but this book was extremely disappointing.    1.  There is no sense of place.  Powers usually makes you enjoy his locations and they become part of the story.  Despite knowing the general location, there is not a single thing interesting about the location.  2. Boring characters.  Some of the Mossad agents are mildly interesting, but the protagonist and the villains are cardboard.  I didn't care about them at all.  I didn't even care who ended up victorious.  3. Bad use of magical background.  Time travel, other dimensions, psychics.  Sounds good right?  The Anubis Gates meets Last Call?  Not even close.  Everything is meagerly developed.  Supposedly the bad guys want to become gods, but the whole thing is discussed in one or two paragraphs.  4. Boring plot. There is no excitement, no sense of dread, no sense of wonder at all.  Overall this book was a total dud compared to his other books.  Good writing as usual, but not much else.  Tim, What happened here? 
 This book is terrible.  It is very hard to understand.  Not recommended 
 a tired bit of revisionist propaganda out of post-soviet russia which somehow won an oscar as best foreign film.  its fascinating that something so heavy handed can pretend to be an answer to the vile excesses of the stalin era, but what can one expect?  there is (at least one) great movie to be made about that era; dont look for it here. 
   Tens of thousands of books are published every year: few of them sell more than a couple of thousand copies at best. Sometimes you come across a book from a "name" publisher and wonder why the manuscript wasn't tossed into the wastbasket. This is one of those books.    This book is filled with New Age nostrums. "Let's visit the cosmic sphere tht contains our neighborhood - the center of our visible universe." (By the way, Leo Tolstoi visited this neighborhood in the 19th Century in his "The Kingdom of God is Within You.") More great advice from Primack and Abrams, the husband-wife team that claims great new cosmological insights: "Movement becomes a mere idea. There is no visible way to detect it, only the tricky conciousness of time passing." Here's another gem: "The Cosmic Las Vegas metaphor illustrates trhe random, quantum nature of eternal inflation, but it gives no sense of what the theory of eternal inflation could mean if it is true." Yeah. Sure.    Reciting every mawkish statement in this pretentious tome would take as much space as the book itself. As a final example, how about "We represent  an age on Earth comparable to the age of cosmic inflation at the beginning of the universe: brief, but about to set the pattern for the long-term future. . . . For our entire species, today matters."    This New Age gruel is served up as a plea for scientific thinking. It is anything but. It is a feel-good tract on how special you are, much like the character in the classic Saturday Night Live sketch.    Greater good could have been done by saving the trees sacrificed for the paper the nonsensical nostrums of Priamck and Abrams are printed on.  Jerr 
 I had the same problem as everyone else. It just falls apart every time you touch it. A useless waste of money. My daughter was very dissapointed 
 I have been a fan of Mr. Bachs for over 25 years.  I gave his books as gifts to every one I knew, but this book "Out of My Mind" was such a disappointment.  I finished the book in about an hour and wondered where is the rest of the book?  I immediatly noticed the absence of Leslie and the build up to the new women in his life and put it together that he had found a new muse. It was not the divorce that floored me, but the complete absence of a a story!!!  I thought this was just a primer for the real book, so I went to his web page to get info and found that he was selling photos of a pasture and raggedy scarves that had previously flown on his plane for an exorbitant amount of money.  It was then I relized that Leslie must have gotten a tidy settlement and Mr. Bach was perhaps in great need of funds.  I wish him well and thank him for the memories, but will wait for the reviews for his next book.  The title sayed it all "Out of His Mind" 
 "Big Cotton" and US agricultural subsidies are big news in the world of trade. Yafa teases a promise to enlighten on this situation, but fails to deliver.  Yafa knows there is a big and tangled picture here to illustrate, but is unable to work out the world view and settles instead for a series of scenes in cotton's long history. The start of the industrial revolution in England, the rise of Lowell, MA, the beginning of Levi Straus & Co are written as grand chapters containing some amusing anecdotes, but sitting in isolation.  In the final chapters, pesticides and genetically-modified cotton appear, largely wrapped in a diatribe on the evils of both rather than any real analysis. Yafa has left out how the South changed from a resion of sharecroppers pre-WW II to industrial farming by the mid-50's.  Most disappointing are the final chapters on the current world trade. There is a complex story to be told here of US politics and farming as well as farming in Africa. Yafa misses most of this. The devil is in the details of most of this story. With few if any numbers and no detail of costs or pricing Yafa cannot capture this story. It does not lend itself to a journalistic approach, although Yafa's refernces to stories in the Wall Street Journal suggest that the WSJ writers may have written a better piece on the subject than "Big Cotton".  Meanwhile, Yafa purports to tell a tale worldwide in scope, yet his "Big Cotton" is really a US story. After 300 pages of almost exclusively US tales we are told that China is the biggest current producer. Where did the Chinese industry come from? Or Pakistan's or India's?  If you are looking for the story of cotton, keep looking - this is not the book 
 First off i just want to say that i've read "The Secret of the Old Clock" and it made this game even more boring because i knew the basic outline.  I see in an above review an adult of the age 35 loved it, which i can understand. But I'm 15 and i found this game OVERLY boring. The puzzles were way too easy, and driving around in the horribly done car part of the game made me want to quit playing. It says youll get a pay if you do some chores for people...i didnt get anything. Although I love herinteractive and and i love all the other nancy drew games i would highly reccomend you dont waste $19.00 on it. I would only reccomend getting it if it was in a value pack of Nancy Drew games 
 I have not received this order yet. I am contacting the supplier now 
 I can't give this an objective rating. Despite repeated consultations with my computer manufacturer and the software provider I couldn't get this unit to play through my computer, so couldn't do any recording. I sold it to a friend and it is apparently working with his system. Conclusion: be careful if you buy it, it may or may not be adaptable to your equipment 
 I had completely forgotten about this book until a friend mentioned it the other day in her drunken St. Patties stupor.  This book is a great for read for normal people who want to laugh at really bad ideas to find a husband.  It's good advice if you want to be a trophy wife.  Don't return a guy's call?  Good way to date only losers who have no one else to call.  Wear your hair in a pony tail, learn to play tennis, die your hair black, get a nose job, these are all pieces of advice in this book.  The idea is hide who you really are until you get married and then be yourself.  That marriage will last forever... if forever is two days.  If you want to marry a rich guy who will ignore you and eventually trade you in for a younger version of yourself, read this book.  If you want a good laugh, read this book.  If you want real advice on men, understading them, finding Mr. Right, telling the good ones apart from the jerks, knowing what they're thinking, I recommend GOD IS A WOMAN: DATING DISASTERS.  It's by a guy, what's more he's a comedian, and it's really funny with great and real advice 
 Disappointed with the written content. Too much irrelevant, adolescent street jargon.  Illustrations were poor as were the written descriptions of techniques. Overall a disappointing buy 
 Face it people, this is not T2 or The Godfather Part II, and why is there a sequel to the hitcher anyway? The first "The Hitcher" was a classic movie which was a perfect reimagining of Steven Speilberg's classic DUEL. There was no need for a sequel. The story was told, nothing more to tell. A sequel? Dragonheart fell victim for this. A sequel will just tell the story all over again. Not even C. Thomas Howell could save this movie from being a failure. All in all, not entertaining and unnecessary. Not recomended 
 Just like their previous effort "Nevermind," "In Utero" is more abyssmal simplistic angsty radio-rock for the "misunderstood" teens who think they have the worst lives ever because their parents made them clean their rooms and do their homework against their will.  Kurt Cobain wasn't a genius by any means, his song-writing was terrible along with his "guitar playing."  Back when Kurt was still alive, Nirvana was actually struggling with record sales but after Kurt blew his own head off, that's when record sales skyrocketed and they got the legendary status they don't deserve by any means.  The only talented member of Nirvana was Dave Grohl, and his recent work with Tony Iommi (Black Sabbath) and Killing Joke is way better than Nerdvana.  The death of Chuck Schuldiner (Death) was a real tragedy in the guitar world, not the death of Kurt Cobain.  Chuck was 10000000000000000000x better than Kurt at both playing guitar and writing songs.  Just listen to Death's "The Philosopher" (from "Individual Thought Patterns") and "Crystal Mountain" (from "Symbolic"), and you'll be de-converveted from this joke of a band.  If you're not ready for Death, check out the only worthy grunge band Alice in Chains (particularly "Dirt" and "Jar of Flies"), RIP Layne Staley.  Lastly, Nirvana didn't save rock, it just made it worse.  Thanks to them, we have awful bands like Korn, the Deftones, Cold, Staind, and other nu-metal/a$$rock bands.  
 Finally a book with the courage to stand up and tell people with their heads stuck in the 1950 that theyre abslutely right about everything! Glory to the author who finally proves that women in fact should not be paid equal to men who do the same work, and in truth should not be working at all, because totally a whole bunch of science shows how women with professional ambitions and successes in the private sector are just plain stupid and doting housewives whose lives consist entirely of ovens and vacuums are totally where its at! After all it is a true fact that most women who are in a relationship with a domineering husband with religious convictions and a family who puts pressure on them to behave like their idealized mental image of women and who have learned a long time ago that its just better for them not to resist any longer and to do what theyre told report in surveys run by organizations with a political, to say nothing of sociological axe to grind are PERFECTLY HAPPY with their lives, so that proves everything! And furthermore this book was written by a woman! And even though that means she is violating the basic premise of the book by having professional ambitions of her own as far as being a writer (lets not forget, every day spent writing this book is a day you could've spent cranking out more babies like youre supposed to, woman) its still 100% true! No wait, its 200% true because it contradicts itself! Hooray for the 1950s regressive conservitive oppresively religious and slightly sexist mindset! No, actually I dont know what sarcasm is. Why 
 Just a warning - 8 minutes doesn't count warm up, stretching, or the time it takes you to get up from the floor and situated to the next exercise (something that I find really annoying and ineffecient!).  I have not read Jeorge's book.  I got the routine from an excerpt in O! I don't understand why he doesn't pair exercises that are both on the floor or both standing - it's such a pain getting up and down, up and down.  Plus, I feel like you lose that whole idea of "no rest".  I'm sure I expend more calories to get up an down, but it's all too easy to take a sip of water or just in repositioning yourself.  I have been following WW while I have been doing the 8m workout (more like 10-15 for me), and I have not lost one pound.  I'll keep doing it, because it's probably better than nothing, but I'm not impressed so far (about 3 weeks) 
 This is probably the worst book I have ever read. Granted the topic can be very vague and confusing at time, the author makes little attempt tp explain adequately the concepts.   Would highly recommend NOT getting this book 
 After 3 days of having this controller, it already started to have problems.  The docking station would not pick up charges from the battery anymore making my controller useless.  For the amount of money I spent, I am very disappointed 
 I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.  But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books 
 While he gets high marks for imagination about this planet with a thinking landmass/bioshpere, his storyline and his characters just don't cut it. This is despite the fact that the protagonist later appears in significant roles in Eon and Eternity. His experince here is supposed to affect his outlook in the other two books. Granted I read them in the wrong order as this prequel came much later, but it doesn't work for me on any level 
 I was totally disappointed in the CD.  The music choices from the movie were so good, and was looking forward to listening to them; instead I got all the background music.  I wish I could return it for a credit - I feel totally ripped off.  BEWARE!!! 
 This was the WORST sunshade ever!!!  Don't waste your money.  It is so flimsy that it offers no sun protection at all.  We used it on our double jogger stroller but it just flopped down into the faces of our babies.   I do not recommend this product.  I only gave it a one star because zero star was not an option 
 I liked the singles get up and promise and her dancing was fabulous in it, very much like janet jackson so of course I expected ciara to have gone all out, but I listened to the album and I just couldn't get into it at all.  I love r&b and I love freestyle music, both of which ciara sings but it's so bland and boring I couldn't get into it at all.  I have tons of friends who were gushing about the album, and I even had to hear it over and over again at a hip hop dance class I took so I thought it would grow on me for sure but it just annoyed me and is already forgotten about.  Ciara is a good dancer and has the looks but that's it.  She's all hype and without any substance 
 I have read and loved the books in Mrs. Gunn's "Glenbrooke" series, and I was hoping to find illustrations of the homes and gardens in fictional Glenbrooke, Oregon.  I was seeking the recipes mentioned, but not provided, in the Glenbrooke books.  I thought that the characters would be mentioned, or that their relationships might be elaborated upon...I was sadly disappointed.  This is a lovely gift book, filled with brief, warm reflections on the author's own special moments revolving around the tea ritual.  The illustrations are colorful and peaceful.  The recipes look well-devised and tempting, though, I must admit, I have not tried any.  This is a delightful book for people interested in "taking tea" with the author.  But, I am sad to say, the relationship this book has to the Glenbrooke series is tangential at best 
 This and Mad Jack were stunning dissappointments.  Where are the fiery heroines, the ones with true pluck and spirit?  Why do all of Coulter's females become bedridden at some point?  What happened to the mystery?  There was nothing fresh about this novel.  The relationship is missing the brilliant spark that is so enchanting in many of her previous works--it seems lately Coulter is marrying off her couples earlier and earlier.  This story has been done to death by Coulter.  Try the "Song" series or the early Sherbrooke brides 
 This is a barely passable pulp fiction "mystery" novel from Jonathan Kellerman revolving around a sex murder and some questionable rich kids.   In essence, this book is pretty much completely predictable, and burdened by lengthy explanations that, by the time you get to them, you've either guessed or stopped caring about.  The book starts off with premise - a young woman is brutally murdered and sexually molested, with no apparent leads, a cold case 20 years old - but it quickly degenerates, and the true perpetrators are apparent from early on.    Even as a light holiday, poolside, read - this book is lacking.  There are way too many lucky breaks and coincidences (the main character just happens to be old friends with a key witness' shrink) for this book to even approach plausible.  The characters are one dimensional and boring.  Even Milo, the gay cop, is just... boring.  Cliched.  A shabby excuse for a fleshed out character.    Give this book a pass - seriously.  I'm sure there are much better books to spend your $6 - $8 on. 
 Every year there has to be a game adapted from a classic movie or based on a classic movie (From Russia With Love, which is actually not a bad game.). Recentlty just landing my hands on a copy of this, I simply couldn't resist picking up SCARFACE: THE WORLD IS YOURS. I loved the movie SCAR FACE, and I was gonna love this.  But It turns out I didn't.  The controls are really a joke, instead of your normal FPS/3PS/RPG etcetera, there are really bland controls you can't even tell what to do. The dialouge is corny, and everything else is a joke.  For die-hard fans only, I guess 
 Laptop Mag can be best described negatively: it's not a really serious computer magazine.  It's more or less like Consumer Guide, which is basically paid advertising.  This means you can't really trust the article here because you don't know if they are not written by unbiased writers.  In the end, I feel this is a waste of money.  Besides, you can get all the info for free on the web, from CNET or ZDNET, anyway 
 I have never written a comment about a book, but hopefully other people will at least be warned.  This is the one of the worst books I've ever read.  I have read several Wiley books; most of them are poorly written and lacking substance.  This one is unbelievably bad.   This book deserves a negative five stars.  (Who wrote those other reviews?) If you have never read a book on trading systems, then this book is may tell you something. Otherwise, save your money.  There's nothing here 
 As an avid fan of Hamilton and other great sci-fi writers, I find it difficult to plow my way through Benford's mess. The story idea is good, but Benford's writing is positively awful. At times he can't even seem to make up his mind what tense he's writing in. Initial charater development is next to nonexistent, and following character dialogue is somewhat akin to finding one's way around a corn maze at midnight. He uses what seems to be an alsmost experimental approach to dialogue, and no two are formatted the same. Sentence structure is immature and disjointed. Its either incredibly simple, or so complicated it becomes difficult to follow. Some character situations are wildly implausible even for sci-fi, or underdeveloped to the point that they seem so. I would not recommend this book. I am no writer, but I can recognize great writing and this isn't it 
 out of all the garbage I have heard(Mase's double up and Silk's made men)This is by far the WORST Rap album I have ever heard in my life! They dont even rap on all of the songs and the skits are dumb and not funny.  This is the worst album ever! Ever! Go and buy it, I bet you wont even  trade it in but you will throw it away. This is the Girl 6 of albums,  Hugo(car) of albums. I want you to buy it so you can feel what I feel 
 I love the X-Files, and I wanted to read more of the "backstory" of each episode.    Instead, most of the book is wasted on the synopses for each episode. Usually, 6 pages is wasted on the story summary, and only one page on the backstory.    We don't need 6 pages of story summary for each episode: we can watch that!  Instead, give us more on the background!  
 I was hoping for a good read from this author but I will not be reading this latest from Ms Miller.  I am offended by the storyline.  Molestation of a teenager ?  Disgusting.   No thank you. 
 The battery life does not even come close to the advertised listing. Save your money and wait until Sony does a better job. I am a big fan of all things Sony and this is my first big disappointment. Mar 
 I bought this guitar for my 3 year old daughter who is crazy about the Disney Princess line. All the features worked except for the string feature. At this price I expect it to work properly so I took it back and exchanged it for another one. Again we had the same problems with the new one. I guess I'll take it back and try another brand 
 This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I understand that is fine writing, but the book is tasteless. I find Rodriguez arrogant and lonely. Is he trying to say that the turning point of his life was when the nun's came to his parents home. I hate this book it is one of my worst reads ever 
 The basis of this book is great and the author has a terrific way with words but she loses the reader after about page 55, where she goes off into all sorts of liberal and unproven theories about modern family life.  Her research was limited to one major American company and does not illuminate why there are so many problems in balancing work and family life 
 I can't comment on this one because it was lost on delivery twice along with the other two purchased items. It's a real bizzard 
 Enthousiastic customer reviews made my choice of this book a no-brainer. Working for a major international news agency as a financial correspondent, I looked for some fresh methods, angles and ideas to incorporate in my  interviews and market wrap-ups from the equity and corporate world. But  reading through this (highly-praised) feature-writing guide I was  disappointed to see that the material is very boring, outdated and  repetitive of the examples used. The book may give some guidance for  one-story-a-month, relaxed writers. But it looks out of touch with the  modern world of editors demanding fairly speedy 'spot coverage' of events,  where the newsbreaks and the accompanying stories are written on laptop  computers and sent by e-mail 
 The towel is quite soft, however after using it, your body will be covered with small fibers all over.  - not recommended 
 There is much wisdom to be gained from Aboriginal culture, but the "wisdom" in this book is NOT Aboriginal, but rather made up by the author.  She should have based her book on real Aborigines and shared their true culture, or based it on a totally fictional population.  That way readers would not believe the lies she tells about Australia.  The book does make one think about the many flaws of our western culture which is good, but to do so while corrupting a native culture is simply appalling.  She should not be profiting from this book 
 When I bought this book I thought it was going to give recommendations for a balanced diet that is good for your Ph levels.  What I got was an all-out assault on meat, dairy, and fruit.  Here is a very brief review of this book for anyone who doesn't have the time to fill their head full of garbage.  Your diet should basically be nothing but vegatables, grasses, and a small amount of grains.  If you eat meat, fruit, or dairy your body will become very acidic and little microorganisms will grow in your body and slowly eat you from the inside out.  You shouldn't eat more than 25 grams of protein and you don't need to worry about calcium intake because only meat-eaters need extra calcium.     This diet is only for strict vegetarians and hypochondriacs who are afraid of being eaten alive by invisible fungi if they eat meat, fruit or dairy.  This diet will make you loose weight because you're eating less than 1000 calories a day.  It will make you lose muscle mass from lack of protein and you will get the cool side effect of having green poop from all of the chlorophil.    The purpose of this book is to scare you into buying the author's supplements while taking advatage of the Ph theory and capitalizing on people's fears.  Don't be a sucker and fall for an idiotic diet that is one of the hardest diets to follow, very unbalanced, and could potentially be dangerous to your health 
 Another reviewer said that this was a soft doll with no hard parts.  I ordered it thinking it would be perfect for my niece.  What I got was a hard plastic doll with small pieces labeled "Not for Children Under Three."  Needless to say, I was very disappointed.  This would be great for a 4 or 5 year old, but don't expect a soft, cuddly doll for your little one 
 This book is so generic in its advice that it is all but useless. It tries to be all things to all cameras, and therefore says nothing specific about anything. Add to this the way it tries to tout Kodak film, and you realize Kodak should be paying people to read this book. But they still wouldn't know how to work their cameras 
 I gave myself a headache trying to watch this  d.v.d    It should have been a most enjoyable movie but the quality of the d.v.d was so bad it was unwatchable. (I  must say here that the fault was in the d.v.d not the d.v.d player as I have not had a problem watching d.v.d's before.  or since.    I think something should be done to ensure quality of production when  running off d.v.d's 
 The Petersen book is a cut above from the anti-Mormon fare, not engaging in the more out-dated claims offered against the Book of Mormon, such as the inane "adieu" and "Land of Jerusalem" argument critics offer against Book of Mormon antiquity, notwithstanding such claims being outdated for several decades now. However, it fails to engage with Book of Mormon scholarship that reveals that it could not have been fabricated by anyone from the 19th century.  The question of Book of Mormon material culture arises in the text, but such arguments have, too, been answered and have been outdated for some time. I suggest one to track down "An ancient American setting for the Book of Mormon" by John L Sorenson to see how plausible Book of Mormon material culture (e.g., flora and fauna) is in light of its ancient Mesoamerican setting.  Petersen fails to answer questions that critics have been obfuscating from for some time now. For instance, how did Joseph Smith know so much about Arabia? How did he know of the presence of a continually flowing river south-south-east of Jerusalem in Arabia, when, for decades, critics have derided such (and, in their ignorance, continue to do) as an impossibility 9see 1 Nephi 2:5-8)? How did he know of a burial site, *NHM* in the same direction, corresponding to "Nahom" where Ishamel was buried in 1 Nephi 16:34? Furthermore, on this point, lime altars have been found in this region, attesting to the historicity of the name and burial site pre-dating the Book of Mormon volume, serving as the first archaeological evidences attesting Book of Mormon antiquity. In addition, how could Smith have known of a lush garden spot east of Nahom, and describe all its physical and material cultural characteristics, when, again, critics have derided Bountiful in Arabia as another impossibility?  In terms of Book of Mormon antiquity, I am only scraping the barrell. However, this should be suffice to show that critics have some way to go before they will be taken seriously by knowledgeable Latter-day Saints.  I welcome feedback at Robert.S.Boylan@nuim.i 
 In response to the overwhelming academic reaction to his first essay "The American Civil Religion," Robert Bellah again addresses the creation, development, and subsequent destruction of "the covenant" manifested in the American Civil Religion in his book, The Broken Covenant.  By enumerating and expounding upon the "myths" of the American Civil Religion, Bellah attempts to uncover the American self-understanding that has both created and corrupted the Covenant. The myth of origin reveals the basic self-conceptualization of America: a pristine wilderness, a place of new beginnings for "the chosen" who reform the old covenant.  According to Bellah, from a biblical as well as classical republican perspective, America is a land of living myth with a covenant based on Calvinist teachings of common charity, love, individual dignity, and responsibility through which the internal spiritual covenant meshes with the external political covenant to create public virtue. He believes that the American "covenant" legitimizes and gives purpose to the American identity. He compares his book to the lamentations of a prophet crying out in the wilderness, trying to alert the population to societal corruption and impending doom while maintaining a hope for the future upon repentance. He argues that utilitarianism, capitalism and science, along with the "sins" of slavery and the treatment of the Native Americans, have corrupted and destroyed this covenant, leaving America empty of purpose. In violation of the covenant, capitalistic self-interest motivated American society instead of republican virtue.  His solution espouses the creation of a new covenant that humbly recognizes the past and present flaws of America, renews the traditions of the old covenant and provides moral and spiritual meaning for the technological and scientific dimensions of modern society.   Using mostly primary sources, armed with a sociologist's understanding of American history and fueled by personal experience, Bellah attempts to evaluate the American Civil Religion in the past, present, and future.  Though he realizes the current problem regarding the corrupted ideals of republicanism, equality, spirituality and religion, his ideas for the resurgence of the American Civil Religion are vague and abstract. He proposes a state of constant revolution, a continuous renewal of covenant through religious and spiritual rebirth that will fill the external political covenant of America with meaning.  Along with the restitution of the inward covenant, Robert Bellah kowtows to the popular theories of the early 1970s, such as communitarianism and socialist policies, which have failed thus far in America.   Rather than a transcendent new order, he espouses the call for reform common to the generation disillusioned by the Vietnam War and Watergate scandal; his book appears to be the result of a personal attempt to find meaning in a changing modern society.  
 Gies and Gies provide a superficial treatment of medieval life, with the work lacking scholarship to provide it with any substance.  The only benefit to this book is that it did lead to others trying to provide a true perspective 
 Recently I developed a fascination for Japanese horror movies. Some of the Japanese movies are really frightening to watch, and leave a deep impact on your after watching it. Some of these movies include the Ringu(the Ring) series, Ju-on(made as `the Grudge' in English starring Sarah Michelle Gellar), and also The Eye series. After watching all of the movies mentioned previously, I thought I would give All Night Long (called `Ooru naito rongu' in Japanese) a try. Sadly, I was not pleased with this one.  The first of the trilogy revolves around 3 guys, who by coincidence, witness the murder of a woman by a psychotic man who randomly kills her on the street. Strangely enough, these 3 guys get together and become friends and decide to throw a party in order to forget the incident they were witnessed to. They decide to get dates for the party, but in the end, due to various incidents because of other people, fail in doing so. Due to these incidents, they decide to let their anger off and take revenge on these people.  The second story, called `Atrocity', starts off with a high school boy who is spends his summer vacation by chatting on the computer, and playing with a doll. He is bullied by a gang headed by a homosexual, who develops an interest for the boy. As the boy does not feel the same way about the leader, this leads to some disturbing consequences.   The third movie, named `Final Atrocity', is considerably the most graphic of all three. This time, the story consists of a young boy who works in a sleazy hotel, where customers bring in their partners to have sex with, and leave garbage lying around. The boy apparently likes collecting trash, and starts collecting those of a woman living near the hotel, who he is attracted to. He starts following her around and collecting everything that she throws, to the point where he even starts eating rubbish that she leaves behind.  Katsuya Matsumura, the director behind all three Nihilistic movies, tries to portray the disturbing image of human nature in all three of the movies, and succeeds to some extent. While the first movie was an average (I thought it would be really good considering they made so many sequels to it), the second and, especially the third, focus on too much graphic violence and abuse, which just stalls the storyline of the movie, not even progressing anywhere. The only high point of all these movies is the acting, which is considerably good, since you feel that the characters are at some point really insane. The eerie music also adds well to the background during some scenes. This is why I gave this a 2 star rating. The only reason I saw the whole series was because I was hoping that the next sequel would be better than its predecessor. After watching all the movies, you don't feel scared; instead you are left with a feeling of disgust and revulsion towards them. In the end, you wonder, what the point of the whole story was in the first place.   So, if you want to watch some really good Japanese horror, consider the ones I mentioned in the beginning of the review. However, if you like a lot of gore without any storyline, give `All Night Long' a try 
 I ordered this phone on 3/28/07. It shipped via FEDEX on 3/29/07 to my office with an indicated delivery of 3/2/07. The package sat on the FEDEX truck for three days before they attempted to deliver it at 8pm to an adjacent business and then left it without the package being signed for. This was after I'd already called FEDEX to refuse delivery of the package because it was too late in arriving.  FEDEX's response for it sitting three days on the delivery truck was that the driver was overloaded.  For the $100 difference in price it was less hassle to just go to the local Cingular store. 
 Nice addition to all what is out there but as stated before a lot of mistakes in accuracies. I have other books from Jim but this one was a little bit of a disappointment. 
 As a later GAO investigation revealed, Senator Roth's 1997 hearings on the IRS were a farce.  The witnesses' stories of abuse were exaggerated at best, falsified with the connivance of the Senator and his commitee staff, at worst.  His book, ghost written by a staffer, (I didn't know the Senator was literate!) should be listed here under "fiction."  Its all bull - pandering to marginal and disaffected losers who wear aluminum foil inside their hats.  Thankfully, the good citizens of Delware voted the rascal out in 1999, sending him and his horrible toupee back to the obscurity to which he so deservedly belongs 
 I have progressively become more and more disappointed with Rita Mae Brown's books in the past decade. Her early books were utterly magnificent; now, she rarely if ever deviates from her favorite (and by now, utterly boring) themes -- Southern manners, horse bloodlines, and foxhunting. Blessedly, "Whisker of Evil" was foxhunting-free, but suffered from a heavy-handed overload of the previous two. Rita Mae Brown would be wise to remember that there is a big world outside of her corner of Virginia, and many of us have grace, manners, and respect for others -- and we don't take kindly to being told that only Virginians understand these things. That's just simply not true.  That said, there were some delightful aspects of "Whisker of Evil" -- the mystery itself was great, the animal characters were adorable as ever, and I loved learning more about Harry as a person and what makes her tick. Her quitting the post office was a great (and very unexpected) twist. I liked reading more about her home and her relationships. However, the stultifying minutiae of horse bloodlines was beyond me; was this directed at a heretofore-unknown segment of Rita Mae Brown's fan base? It was so out of context in this book; certain details contributed to the horses' relationships to one another, but she took it way too far and I found myself skipping pages. As well, I almost threw the book across the room when I came across a line that stated in so many words that only Virginians have manners. This is a common theme of Ms. Brown's and it is quite frankly offensive. There is a big, big world outside of Virginia -- Rita Mae Brown should know this, she has lived in it -- but her books and characters have become so parochial, insular and snobbish that it is an insult to those of us who do live elsewhere in that big world. I would have thought these kinds of statements were tongue-in-cheek if it wasn't such a recurring theme in so many of her books over the past decade. Enough already about Southern manners (a biased perception at best), ancestor worship, bloodlines (human and horse), and foxhunting.   Whatever happened to characters like Celeste Chalfonte 
 I agree with Ms Hunters review, for me too many ads not enough depth on our relevant subjects 
 While the author does a decent job summarizing someone else's work, the look and content of this title is a clear attempt to cash in on the popularity of the books and films.  Within its pages, you'll find reproductions of "Teen Beat" style magazine covers featuring the movies' stars, and quickly see that the material covered is far from comprehensive.  A much better choice for a book of this nature is Fionna Boyle's "A Muggle's Guide to the Wizarding World," also available through amazon.com 
 Although Roizen and Oz have a great premise here for loosing weight what they have to present gets lost in the presentation.  The book is full of idiotic quips that are redundant, serve no purpose to the book, are a distraction to the overall message of the book and at times were rather degrading.  While the quips are at first funny, 30 pages into the book it gets to be rather tiredsome.  And the diagrams and cartoons in the book didn't add to it at all.  The diagrams belonged more in an elementary school science book than in a book whose target audience is suppose to be adults.  The cartoons, like the quips, just got tiresome.  I was inspired to go out and buy this book after seeing the YOU ON A DIET show on TV.  I honestly thought the docs had something useful here.  Unfortunately I was only able to make it half way through this book before having my "fill" of it.  As the diet was in the last part of the book I didn't quite make it that far and at this point I just don't have the stomach to open this book again.    As I mentioned before I do believe that Roizen and Oz have a good premise here however I just found this book to be too full of silly foolishness to be taken seriously as a diet book.  I am glad to see that it has worked for others, I just wish these two had presented their material better as I was totally ready to give their ideas a SERIOUS try - unfortunately I just don't think they were serious enough about their ideas for me to try them.  I don't recommend this book to any serious dieter.  If you want serious motivation, a common sense plan and someone who will talk to you like the adult you are then I suggest any of Bob Green's books - a very enjoyable read from which I gained enough motivation to lose 50 pounds!!  Having reached a plateau that I am having a difficult time breaking I thought something new and different might be worth a shot.  You On A Diet was definitely not new or different, it was boring and degrading 
 **** - Four Stars, and not two as shown above.   --Remarks on Colour-- is the last fruit of one of the greatest minds of the XXth century. It is a book that allows a most clear view of how intuitively brilliant Wittgenstein is; but in more than one sense, it is disappointing. Above all because he writes it largely on the shoulders of Goethe's --Farbenlehre-- and Runge's observations, without dedicating a single comment to him who has been increasingly disclosed as his mentor and master of youth: the unsurpassed creature of insight named Schopenhauer.  As a whole, Wittgenstein's book can be considered a bundle of topic additions and observations to the Farbenlehre. As everything he wrote, it is extremely sharp and illuminating, indeed of inestimable value. However, it lacks what Goethe's readers would be expecting to see: a personal position on those which were Goethe's main aims; firstly, the critique of Newton's famous spectrum of colors: two centuries ago, Goethe brilliantly challenged the Newtonian notion, still held in utmost esteem in our days, that white is composed by a melange of seven colors through a prism. Secondly, an appreciation of Goethe's attempt to postulate what he intuited as the original phenomenon, Urphaenomen, without being able to explain why: colors complement each other qualitatively in pairs - the most important examples would be orange and blue; yellow and violet; and, above all else, green and red.  Wittgenstein is also unfair to Goethe: criticizes him for not having presented a finished theory (III, 125) as if he had ambitioned that; whereas Goethe expressly states in his work that what he has to offer is but "Data zu einer Theorie der Farben". In fact, to translate --Farbenlehre-- in any language as "Theory" of Colors would be a similar mistake. The gap between Goethe's objective observations and subjective self-awareness is bridged precisely by Schopenhauer's treatise of 1816, --On Vision and Colors--, an attempt to account for the subjective forms of colours; Wittgenstein does not mention it once.  Maybe one could, very scholarly speaking, call this a case of bad bibliographical review by a genius thinker. For --Remarks on Colour-- does bring the impression that Wittgenstein did not really know Schopenhauer's treatise at all. But this can only bring astonishment to the reader: the same astonishment that arises when one sees how unnoticed the book has slipped through almost 200 years; for example by Rudolf Steiner, the brilliant thinker who prepared and commented the intents of Goethe in the present edition of the Farbenlehre (3 vols. Verlag Freies Geistesleben). In the case of Wittgenstein, this is especially striking when one considers how much he dwelled with the philosopher's works as he prepared his earlier projects, particularly as the Tractatus was written (a good account can be found at Bryan Magee's --Philosophy of Schopenhauer--, 2nd. ed.). Had Wittgenstein read --On Vision and Colors--, things would have been a lot different, and maybe this entire book would have followed a completely alternate path, since it would have to rise up to the task of judging the treatise of 1816. A sad instance of his neglect can be seen when, at page III-26, Wittgenstein makes comments which he does believe are quite decisive and original, and which would be indeed, had Schopenhauer not already explained why. Witty writes: "Blue and yellow, as well as red and green, seem to me to be opposites - but perhaps that is simply because I am used to seeing them at opposite points on the colour circle". It is something to be truly mourned that a man with such a marvelous intuitive grasp of this fact has missed the chance to meditate the theory that seeks to account for his perceptions. Because they bring no novelty to whomever has had the chance to read Schopenhauer's thoughts of why colors are qualitatively complementary.  At the end, the general impression that remains is that, theoretically, Wittgenstein's comments about colors stand one step below Schopenhauer's treatise, corroborating and indeed confirming it; exactly in the same way in which the --Tractatus-- stands one step below the --Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason--, corroborating and confirming it; and, likewise, not mentioning it.  Schopenhauer's treatise has been for many years out of print in English. Shouldering and even surpassing the Farbenlehre, it is perhaps the most important but, at once, the least read human study of the borderline where philosophy and physiology meet. Which is where Wittgenstein also stands with this little red book, so acclaimed by his own fans 
 I hate to say this about an ASC album, but this is simply not worth the money.  There's not much here to like.  'E to W' is decent and the rest is pretty blah.  If you're into ASC by all means give it a try, but you'll probably be disappointed.  And if you're new to them please do not start with this album.  Give Mare Vitalis a try instead 
 No real information. Just a view from 5000 feet 
 Given the pedigree of the author, I was disappointed with this book.  For a more useful alternative for MBA jobs, reading the Vault career guides is recommended by my MBA career center 
 This book provides a broad overview of some of the issues behind the Simplicity movement.  The author, Cecile Andrews set up a number of Simplicity study circles near her home in the Northwest.  This book reveals some of the factors that led her to become interested in Simplicity as well as her ideas of how Simplicity study circles might work.  Much of the beginning of the book provides justification for adopting Simplicity.  Andrews enumerates problems such as hyper-consumption, environmental degradation, and personal isolation.  She also explores possible actions we could take to solve these problems, such as consciously building community with other people and the earth, finding ways to express our spirituality, and restructuring our economic system to make it more environmentally and socially friendly. In the last part of the book, she describes the idea of Simplicity study circles, the benefits that might be gained from participating in one, and how a study circle should operate.  She also provides a 10-week study plan based on the earlier material in the book.  Although I agree with the ideas in this book, I found the book rather disappointing in content.  Much of the discussion is either so personal as to be hard to generalize, or else a superficial summary of other more substantial texts.  For example, Andrews frequently refers to findings of Juliet Schor; readers would have more material for discussion by reading Schor's works directly.  Some of Andrews' suggestions for addressing problems are rather inappropriate.  To draw attention to hyper-consumerism, she suggests surreptitiously clothes-pinning tags with messages like "You don't really need this, do you?" inside articles of clothing in shops.  While I'm all for trying to get people to become more aware of their needless purchases, I don't think messing with the property of individual store owners is an acceptable way to go about the mission.  Her suggestions for reforming our economic system would be great in an ideal state, but until we are run by a benevolent socialist dictator, I don't think they can realistically be put into action.  It would be better to focus our efforts on goals that are conceivably achievable.  Overall, while I found the topic of this book interesting, I think there are numerous other books on the topic of Simplicity that are better implemented, starting with Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin's "Your Money or Your Life".  It's hard to tell from this book if Andrews can take credit for originating Simplicity study groups such as those run by the Northwest Earth Institute.  If so, she certainly deserves credit for her efforts in that area, but I don't think there's enough substantial material in this volume to use as background reading for an effective study group by itself. 
 Trying to make a film concerning Studio 54 for a mainstream audience is a really bad idea. It's just not possible to do it and actually stay truthful to the climate of that era. Gays had a lot more influence on that scene than the film lets on. From what I understand, the original director's cut was gutted by Miramax before the film was released it and it shows. Other than Mike Meyers portrayal of Steve Rubell, there's hardly a gay character in sight. There's some very good actors in the film and their talents are simply wasted. Thank goodness the good music helped me get through this drivel. Anyone with a taste for fine filmmaking need not bother with this cinematic mistake 
 I wasn't really impressed with this book.  Iwas esxpecting more of the things that I can do as a non-professional (I'm a receptionist right now) and someone who has no real selling skills.  All that the author talks about is pretty obvious things that require some serious skills, like start a business that earns an average of $700,000 a year, then sell stocks in that company.  Okay, sounds good, I'll get right on that.  He does mention some good points about saving (what we should be saving according to our income, but the stories about the people in his book (are they even real?) get to sound a little out of my ballpark.  I like the idea of finding something that you're good at and make a lot of money off of it, but is that always possible?  I like painting buckets, but there is only a small market for that (I've even tried to sell online).  I'm skeptical about the stock advice- don't invest passively, he says.  I was told that the best way to invest was to picka or fund that you're confident and let it ride, because "beating the market is nearly impossible, " someone once told me.  So, if I can't invest aggresively, and can't dramatically increase my income (or get rid of all of my expenses), the only thing left for me is real estate.  I think that point was made after the housing boom made the author rich, but the market isn't going anywhere now.    I'm still looking for good advice

 Heinlein is a great author.  When he sits back and tells a story, he's one of the best.  Glory Road and Citizen of the Galaxy are wonderful, and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress should be on the shelf of any science fiction fan.  This, however, is an awful book.  It's not merely one of Heinlein's worst.  It's one of the worst books I've ever had the misfortune to read.  The problem isn't that there's no action, although there isn't.  The problem is that there isn't anything of substance to replace it.  There's lots of sex, but not in enough detail to be titilating.  There isn't a love story either; you can't have romance or sexual tension when your characters will sleep with anyone and everyone for any reason.  The book just rambles aimlessly until it ends.  Maybe Heinlein was trying for an examination of gender roles and sexual identity, but if so he failed miserably.  The characters in this book aren't just from a different culture; they aren't people at all.  They're too flat.  If you want to think about such things, ponder them on your own or read a different book.  I suggest Left Hand Of Darkness by Ursula Le Guin.  I Will Fear No Evil reads like an old man's rambling personal fantasies.  Someone must like it, but I can't recommend it even to the most devoted Heinlein fans.  If you're tempted, do yourself a favor and re-read Stranger In A Strange Land instead 
 The problem with the book is that it's utterly uncritical of the entirety of Stephen King's work - it's simply a basic recounting of the novel's plot, followed up with a few bits of trivia and the author's "What I Liked" section.   The problem is that the author of this book likes everything about Stephen King, even when he's talking about King's weaker material. You could write the words "I love Stephen King and everything he's ever done!" on an index card, then post it next to the Amazon search results for Stephen King and you'd have this book in a nutshell.   Plus, he refers to the Gor novels as "wildly popular". Uh, no.  -Darren MacLenna 
 Maybe for some people, to spend 40 days without sex is not big deal, but in Matt Sullivan's case, it could be a total nightmare. After his girlfriend Nicole leaves him, Matt spends about six months devouring girls, until he starts to hallucinate. Advised by his brother, Matt decides that celibacy is the answer to his problems, and proposes to go through lent without sex. For Matt's friends, this odyssey is as absurd as impossible, and immediately they take advantage of the situation to make bets about how long will last Matt's abstinence. He doesn't have it easy, as many temptations will make him suffer, and even smell the possibility of a new love. 40 days and 40 nights is a movie that tries to get the most comedy possible out of the sexual frustration of his leading character. In a similar way that other grotesque comedies have try to explode in the past years, this film tries to sell us the idea that relationships based only in sex are less satisfactory than those based on love. OH. WHAT A SHOCKING DISCOVERY! 
 sorry to say but this is not a 5 star show as most other people would have you believe. the humour is tired,the writing is weak and the mother is annoying. the saving grace of the show is of course Bea Arthur. when MAUDE is finally on DVD,then you will really see Arthur at her best. again Golden Girls is no classic but is good for a few chuckles 
 I had heard of Edgar Cayce before, mainly because I shelved so many books by or about him in my years as a bookseller. It was only recently, though, as I was browsing through one of the Stranger than... books by the late Frank Edwards that I  came across a brief biography of Edgar Cayce and learned more about his mysterious diagnoses given while unconscious. I remembered that I had this book, one of the Time-Life Collector's Library of the Unknown reprints, on my shelf and so I dug in.   For the most part, the prose was easy to read and written in a straightforward, familiar style, so that I felt like I was seeing the events of Cayce's life as they happened. The book begins like a normal biography, discussing early romances, jobs, family incidents, etc., with very little to indicate how strange Mr. Cayce's life would become. Around 1/3 of the way through the book, we discover, along with young Edgar, that he can memorize written materials just by sleeping on them. He also discovers that he has miraculous powers to diagnose illnesses and prescribe cures for people he has never met, all while unconscious. (In his waking life, Mr. Cayce was very modestly educated, and was as surprised as anyone at the ideas and language that came from his unconscious form.) The way that this section of the book reads, you would imagine that Cayce's cures were always successful and that skeptics were fools.  The book begins to drag after the second half, though, for a variety of reasons. First, Cayce could never actually put his powers to any real end. Every attempt to establish a multidisciplinary hospital to implement and research his unconscious revelations, as was his dream, came to an unsuccessful conclusion. This is fairly anticlimactic and does not make for a very "heroic" story. Second, one of his benefactors, a man quite interested in matters occult, began to ask Cayce more arcane questions, and so the revelations began to drift into, to me, less interesting areas-the typical new age stuff about Atlantis, reincarnation, soul mates, etc. Finally, it became more apparent to me, based on the later, more thoroughly documented cases, that Cayce's "miraculous" cures might not have been as amazing as they seemed in the earlier chapters; the earlier cures seemed more amazing simply because the way in which they were recorded and related was more "oh gosh" and less stringent. (In other words, as he gets older and more jaded, even his cures seem less special and miraculous. Maybe this was the writer's intention.)    The conclusion of the book was, for me, the worst part. It is divided into two appendix-like sections. In the first section, the author tries to systematically describe Cayce's philosophy. Boring. Too much like the Ascended Master stuff that I find hard to swallow. Maybe it is true. Maybe not. Whenever I read this stuff, I just get the feeling that I am listening to some pedantic, New England minister lecturing on matters that were expressed much more interestingly 2,000 years ago by Hindus and Buddhists. The second section in the conclusion recounts six case studies from the Cayce files, and these are interesting only for those who want to see how difficult to understand Cayce's medical diagnoses could be, due to the odd structure of his language and the outdated medical terminology.  It was a quick read, except for those two concluding sections, so if you are at all interested, I highly recommend reading it. As for what it means, though, I really have no clue. And I don't plan on re-reading it to find out, though the pretty Time-Life book will remain on my shelf as decoration.    
 Thanks to the other reviewers who warned of this horrible dvd.  Such a fine movie deserves A+ treatment.  Hopefully the movie will be re-released with widescreen, total digital restoration, and bonus features.  Even though it was made for t.v. it still should be done right 
 The major problem I have with this translation is the awkwardness of its language. There are long, unwieldy sentences with twisted syntax. Sometimes, the translation is obscure. For example: "...and the will of Zeus was accomplished/since that time when first there stood in divison of conflict..." Not every line is as bad as that, however. There are some passages that read fairly smoothly, and the last two lines of the fourth book stand out. The translation as a whole, however, mutilates the English language. There are better options if you would like to read the Iliad 
  The only thing Milton Friedman has going for himself is that he says out loud what other reactionaries will only whisper.   Ayn Rand would have loved Friedman's disdain for the poor--for anyone, in fact, lacking the "initiative" famously shown in a 1963 cartoon in which Barry Goldwater stands in front of a poor person in a Southwest ghetto and says, "Why don't you show some initiative? Why don't you go out and inherit a department store like I did."  If you think the status quo was ordained by God, or that capitalism is the best that humanity can come up with, this book is for you. If not, start reading Trotsky, Lenin, and all the people with vision, compassion, and utter disgust for the sad mess that the fat cats have made of this planet.   
 I love cats, which is why I bought this calendar, but I am going back to the regular Workman Publishing Page-a-Day.  You cannot believe the poor quality of the paper and pictures.  You have to strain your eyes to look at it.  Keep away from this calendar and don't waste your money.  Also, it's not particularly clever 
 This book is very well laid out, and points out both sides of the arguments. Very good for seeing what one side says to one issue, and what the other side says to the same. However, some issues are touchy, inerrancy being one.  Page 146 "the Bible is a  trustworthy communication by Spirit-guided interpreters and is true in all it intends to teach." The Bible was not given to men to teach them science, but the God of Science is the God of the Bible - If the Holy Spirit is the author of the text and He errs in some matter (in this case of science) then God is not God.  B.B. Warfield, whom they quote for the "conservative" position, is right. Go get a copy of Revelation and Inspiration, Oxford Press, 1927. Still the best. I am very concerned with how they also handle the Holy Spirit. While they acknowledge His place in the writing of the Bible, all I seem to read about is what did the author on earth mean? I see precious little to help one understand the place of the Holy Spirit upon the authors, except for a bit here and a dash there. How about what does the Bible say? Could we please get to that? I really do wish more biblical texts were quoted.  I am WELL aware many interpretations exist, but this does not negate the fact that we cannot deny the singular purpose of The Scriptures as the revelation of Jesus Christ. Yet, the reader feels lost on this point, and that could also be due to the fact that this book clearly needs an editor. As a humanities major, I went through line by line, and condensed almost 70-80% of the sentences. No appendx for terms, and a cursory index of subjects - I am disappointed that Nelson would let something like that slide especially when this book is used in higher education. It is a good book. Well researched. Covers both sides of an issue. Points the reader in the right direction. Helpful for the foundations of hermeneutics. Footnotes as far as the eye can see. But better exist. Can be improved - all hope is not lost -but a drawing board will be needed. 
 If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.  This book is worse than bad.  It is an abomination 
 This is one of Kellerman's poorest books.  When you FINALLY get to what is going on, it is ridiculous.  Don't waste your time on this 
 I would have given this book *five* stars, had it not been for the shoddy - literal translation from Italian to English.  Being an Italian speaker, I sometimes had to re-read certain sentences with my "Italian" hat on to discern the meaning.  This would have been an excellent book if the translation had been both literary and cultural but it is neiter.  This, unfortunatly, detracts from the book a great deal as some references are not explained to the english-reading audiance who may not be familiar with Italian history.  Since Italians use a great many words to describe something that would only take a few in English- the literal translation makes them read like run-ons and often leaves the reader lost at the end.  If you are able to overcome all these obstacles, the content of the book is enlightning and educational.  I learned that industrial olive-growing in Greece was implemented when they were under Venitian rule and that the fork, was originally a small spear that eventually became the four-pronged utensil that we now know with the development of newer, longer, slippery pasta shapes 
 Just a note to the reviewer who mentioned Hayek's *Constitution of Liberty*, and the postscript "Why I am not a Conservative."  That reviewer clearly did not read, or did not understand what Hayek was talking about.  Hayek's point was that he was not a conservative in the original sense of the word.  In the US the terms liberal and conservative have lost their original meaning, because in the true sense, both Republicans and Democrats are liberals.  So before you bash the author for her characterization, you should make sure you know what you're talking about 
 I enjoyed everything I've read from Robert Heinlein.  This book had lots of potential and I liked the concept but hated the voice of the story.  It was like he was getting lazy, sounded bombastic and I hated it.  I cherish books but this one went into the nasty garbage can at work, only ever threw away one other book and it was worse but it went in the garbage for the same reason, I read for stories not to hear an author try to show off how famous or witty he can be. 
 This book deals mainly with sex magic and getting in touch with your personal Holy Guardian Angel ('Secret Lover'). I liked how this was related to being the Tiphareth Sephirah and also the reflection of Kether. There is much more to be said in this alone. I did like how this book encourages people to go beyond their fear, especially as relates to sexuality and Tantra. For me this was about all I gained from this book.   The author(s) are both learners of Israel Regardie and Aleister Crowley. After reading Christopher S. Hyatt's `Secrets of Western Tantra' (See my review) and being very disappointed, I did not hope much more from `Sex Magic, Tantra & Tarot'. I did find it a little better and have given it one more star. Both of the books that I have mentioned above have similar information i.e. `lesser banishing rituals' and tarot card descriptions associated with personal meanings. If you are into path working and mixing it up with astrology, numerology, tarot and Cabbala etc you may like this. Personally, a good portion of these books come across as being a little wishy washy, new age self help for my liking. The author being a psychotherapist and counsellor probably has something to do with this. There is however a little more depth, probably due to the influence of Israel Regardie and the many years Hyatt has been involved with the occult.  The author states that Sex Magic and Tantra are "Not the same". "Tantra itself is a vast subject, of which sex-magic practices constitute only a small part...Sex Magic however, (requires) no more than a purposeful intent, skill in the techniques of magic, and a relaxed attitude to any possible experience or effect." The author states that this can be accomplished by a single person and couples of same or different sexes. Note also that orgasm is encouraged with the practices given. In `Secrets of Western Tantra' Appendix, via another writer Phil Hine (see also Hine's book `Permutations'- Sub heading - `Sodomy as spiritual fulfilment' pg 25), Hyatt gives techniques for "Cacodemonic Copulations" i.e. sex with Succubi and Incubi; also Evocations for calling an entity for the purpose of having sex with this demon lover. Hyatt states that there are dangers for those not equipped to handle this and gives techniques for getting out of this once all hell breaks loose. I know that the author would hate what I'm about to say, but let's face it, this is black Tantra. I can see that by performing the rituals one would get more in touch with their spiritual selves, yet I profoundly doubt that performing these exercises would lead one to enlightenment. Do what thou wilt with this my review, but remember Anubis is not deceived and shows now partiality 
 While this is a well researched and thought-provoking piece of literature, I do have some critical comments to make. Firstly, it is apparent that the author's own holocaust experiences (or more specifically, those of his family) have left him with a vested interest in how the material in this book is presented. Secondly, there is a LOT of content to trawl through to get, in my opinion, a few pieces of interesting material. Finally, the underlying theme or accusation that without IBM the holocaust may not have happened, or would not have been so sever, is (again in my opinion) flawed. As the book shows, IBM certainly made it much easier for the Nazis to locate and identify Jews, it would not have been impossible without IBM.  Having said all this - it was an interesting read and although overly wordy is certainly worth reading 
 i would only play on friday this is no good for m 
 I loved Mortal Kombat,and I thought the sequel would carry on the great Kombat legacy.I was heartily dissapointed when I saw annihilation.Brian Johnson was cool as Khan,but some of the special effects were so fake I had to laugh.Robin Shou returns as Liu Kang,the savior of Earth.After killing Shang Tsung,the group heads on home when all of a sudden,the Emperor busts up the party and sends his minions down.There,Khan makes his first appearance,along with his abnormal,yet awesome soldiers.Johnny Cage is killed,and Rayden(now played by James Remar)fights Khan,winning but sacrificing Johnny Cage.Now,Earth has seven days before it's destroyed.What I didn't like about this movie was appearances by people who had died in the first film,like Scorpion and Sub-zero.Who heard of Sub-Zero having a brother.Another thing that got me was how Liu Kang's fighting got worse since the first film.He was losing every battle,except the end,and even then he wasl osing.Do not get this film if you want to avoid dissapointment 
 Did you travel around the world to pay high prices to hang out with a bunch of ill mannered tourists?  If so, the Lonely Planet is for you.  If not, throw the LP in the garbage 
 This is a good book for beginners to get some overall concepts formulated of what things are possible on the  web and some good clues as to how to acheive that end. No real tutorials offered and you should have other texts or the web to glean that info.. 
 I like Mos Def's "Black on Both Sides" and the Black Star album, as well as some of his collabs with The Roots, Common, High & Mighty, ect...but this album is worthless.  It's all pop slow jams that are boring and mundane.  If you liked "UMI SAYS" from B.O.B.S. the most off that album, then this may be for you.  But for Hip Hop fans and Mos' fans this will most likely dissapoint.  The Rap-Rock doesn't fit his style, the love ballads get boring after the first 8 bars and everything else is just boring to me.  As a HIP HOP fan I can't recommend this album, but I do give him credit for having the cahonies to experiment 
 I believe that the author of this book should review it. I did not fine any searching in this book. The native people from the rain forest should be let in peace 
 I was intrigued by this book because it is about an interesting topic, and because it is by a former police officer.  I was very disappointed that I didn't get much out of the book.  Unless you are a hermit and have never encountered human life, you know most of the things discussed in the book.  There are a couple good topics, but overall it was lacking.  As a Criminal Justice major, I found the interrogation tips decent, but felt there was much more to be discussed.  I do not suggest this book unless you live all by yourself in the woods and want to know how human interaction works 
 One would expect the creator of an entire fantasy world to be at least a decent storyteller. Not so.   Greenwood takes the ubiquitous Elminster and finally, or rather mistakenly, gives him a history. The character progresses from shepherd boy to unwitting bandit to mediocre theif to unwilling priest(ess) and then WHAM! He's an unstoppable, earth-rending powerhouse within a few scant pages. Shortly after discovering magic, Elminster not only confronts three beasts that would individually annihilate the typical low level character within seconds, he defeats them nearly simultaneously and single-handedly - and he's not even a mage by that point.  Personally, I prefer characters who EARN their hero status. As they say, work builds CHARACTER. Some of us like to see even the toughest warrior get his ass handed to him once in a while. Not Elminster. He's special, or rather, chosen. Whenever confronted with a truly dire situation, rather than think his way out of it (as you would expect a hyperintelligent soon-to-be archmage to do), he tucks tail and whimpers to his sugar momma goddess to save him. Give me a break.  Perhaps to counterbalance the poor class development, Elminster's actual character has redeeming qualities, right? His intelligence, wit and wierdness must provide for some interesting dialogue, right? Nope. He's a big snooze. At no point was I ever concerned for his well-being. At no point did I ever wonder "How will he react to this situation?" Truly, I didn't care. I'd say he's easily forgettable, except that his presence is thrown in your face throughout the forgotten realms literature.  If you like Elminster, or the IDEA of Elminster, spare yourself from trudging through this book. He's more interesting as a mystery than a misdeveloped, thundering yet somehow lackluster bore.  If you want a prime example of how the Forgetten Realms setting is over-magicked, read this book and its sequel 
 I read this book as a part of a Chicano Literature course during my undergrad studies.  While I found the first 140 or so pages okay, I found the overall story a bit boring (educational, but boring).  Lest you think I am being unfair, let me note that the story did pick up again at the end and I do not recall ever having fallen asleep while reading it. (2 stars so far)  I really liked the use of language in creating the voice of the narrator.  It gave me the feeling that I was sitting with an elder aunt or grandmother who was telling the story to me.  (Make it 3 stars, bordering on 4).  So, why the 1 star?  Mainly because I did not like what I interpreted to be a thinly disguised attack on a straw man version of Catholicism and I can't rate it a zero.  I found many of the incidents in the story and especially the commentary of the narrator to be very critical of Catholicism.  I find it unfortunate that, like most critics of Catholicism, Castillo critizes/attacks a straw man version of Catholicism rather than the real thing.  In an interview the author was asked about fact checking in works of fiction (specifically in her book "Massacre of the Dreamers"), Castillo answered:  "No. There isn't any point in it. It's your opinion. It's your reflection, your reaction, your own opinion. When you write a critical -- and this isn't personal essays, these are critical essays -- then you have to prove ever single thing you say."  Maybe that's why she chose to attack a straw man rather than the real thing 
 After seeing the travesty that was episode one in the theatre I decided to give this one a try, assuming that it couldn't possibly get any worse. Was I right? Oh man, I was worse than right. I was wrong. The weak character development that took place with Anakin Skywalker in no way led me to believe that this person could eventually become Darth Vader. The character Anakin is such an undisciplined whiney little brat that it becomes utterly unbelievable that this kid could become a dreaded supervillian. On top of that, the chemistry between him and Padame was very weak. The supposed romance between them was devastated by mediocre acting and no real interesting dialogue.  So once again the special effects department has broken their backs carrying this movie. Without a strong plotline or interesting characters, this movie becomes not a story, but just an impressive light show. It seems as if George Lucas figured that if the technology that he has now is light years ahead of what he had twenty five years ago, then the audience won't need anything else. The special effects in the three 'prequel' movies was so inconsistent with the older films that they should have been released as a completely different story alltogether.  And finally we get to Yoda. A puppet that can bounce around and defy gravity with a lightsaber, but still needs a cane to walk. In the older films, Empire Strikes Back for example, Yoda was balancing on Luke's feet during his handstand. When Luke lost his balance and fell over, wouldn't Yoda be able to just use the force and gently float to the ground instead of tumbling to the ground out of control with him? Is that because of lack of special effects technology back then, or just Yoda was getting too old to use the force anymore? Just a little food for thought. I'll let you decide.  So once again the only plus in this film is the impressive visual effects. If your expecting more however then George Lucas will once again let you down 
 As Stephen Schwartz has said before, AbuKhalil, a representative of the American academic Left and a Lebanese-born academic who teaches at California State University/Stanislaus, attempts in this small volume to explain to his ideological constituency such matters as the history of Wahhabism, the relationship of the Saudi state to Al-Qaeda, the current crisis of the Saudi kingdom, and the resulting challenges to regional and global peace and order.   This commission could not have been a plum assignment. The oppression, corruption, and extremism of the Saudi monarchy are by now so notorious that to make the case that the United States and neoconservatives are prone to unjust interfering with the Riyadh rulers requires a real talent. It means detailing grotesque inhumanities but blaming them all on the United States and Israel, as well as on colonial rulers past and the fantastical specter of "Orientalism."  AbuKhalil does not disappoint. He derides Western authors (this one included), who have exposed the bloody past of Wahhabi Islam, as "Orientalists" (a flattering description, in my view). He recapitulates the Wahhabi historical time line but adds nothing to what is already known, except for occasional flings into the typical Western academic idiom, aimed at softening or explaining away Wahhabi extremism. Thus, the main Wahhabi-Saudi theologian in the second half of the twentieth century, Ibn Baz, "may not have been as principled in his hostility to Jews and Christians as his earlier edicts may have led us to believe." To identify the anti-Jewish and anti-Christian bigotry of Ibn Baz with a "principled" position might seem sycophantic but it fits the prevailing ethos on American campuses.  The author presents himself as the revealer of authentic Saudi reality, but his portrait of the country differs from that described by the most acute critics of the kingdom only in its ideological vocabulary. After enumerating the usual atrocities and undeniable instabilities, AbuKhalil has no solution to offer aside from condemning, yes, Washington neoconservatives for provoking "fanatical and radical forces" in Iraq, and thereby threatening the Saudi state.  The litany is tediously familiar: America was wrong to enable Saudi tyranny, just as it is wrong to try to end it. The Battle for Saudi Arabia is not of use to those hoping to learn about Saudi Arabia. Its only value is to provide insight into current leftist intellectual gymnastics.  
 Lack of practical info, badly edited, quite a few errors. . . just a big ego trip for the author. Very disappointing 
 We have used White House Nannies and they did a fine job. After reading this book, however, I would be reluctant to use them again. I own a business and would never dream of violating my clients' privacy the way Kline does in this book.  She is quite nasty, and unnecessarily so, as many of the stories speak for themselves. Sure, it's easy to mock power couples, but this is Kline's main source of income -- shouldn't she show a little more class?  Some names are real, others (I think) are not. Given the highly sensitive nature of the book, some clarity on this point would have helped.  For those not bothered by the ethics or the tone, there are some interesting stories and genuine insights into the nanny-parent relationship. Still, I'm rather sorry I contributed to the author's profit for such a mean and self-promoting book 
 The 2.0 GB SanDisk Cruzer Micro flash drive looked like a good deal when I saw it on display at Office Depot.  It was roomy enough for all of my data and configuration files, was rated for USB 2.0, and was reasonably priced.  My first choice would have been an larger version of the 1.0 GB Iomega I use at work, but, alas, such wasn't available.  Unfortunately, I waited too long to put the SanDisk through its paces, or I would have tried to get a refund.  As many others have remarked, it is horribly slow.  While backing up my roughly 10,000 files, I found that it was taking about a second per file -- longer for the big ones.  This translated to around four hours to complete the whole operation.  Bulk deletes take just as long to carry out.  Using my Beyond Compare file synchronization software to *read* the SanDisk and compare its contents to what was on my hard drive went reasonably fast -- until, for no obvious reason, it hung on one particular Word document this evening.  I couldn't even get my Windows XP machine to shut down without yanking the SanDisk from its slot:  the usual "safely remove hardware" operation wouldn't work.  After three attempts to read the same file, and three reboots, I tried to delete it from Windows Explorer -- and this operation hung too.  Finally I was able to do the deletion from the DOS prompt.  Just like 1985!  I then recopied the file, and now Beyond Compare can finish its work without a hitch.  But can I trust the SanDisk to deliver up my precious files when I really need them?  I dunno ....  So, it's back to the drawing board.  Maybe by now Iomega has come out with that 2.0 GB model.  As for the SanDisk, I'm reminded of that painful adage:  you get what you pay for.  Ugh 
 I'm sorry, but I really don't! It's a style called Celtic Drama, which means it's a combination of stories w/o words and traditional Irish Dancing.  I've never been a Michael Flatley person.  Parts of this are traditional Irish dancing, but other's aren't anywhere near it! There are also long songs, sort of like a choir piece. I don't like those at all.  If you want to see traditional Irish dancing, this is not your movie 
 If I hear any more "progressive" references to these contemporary retro bands, I may simply have to pu.....no rather start commenting whenever I waste my money on such recordings as this.  Has anyone looked up "progressive"?  I think not.  Just another banal, stupid, ignorant label.  Kino is a decent group and may have done fairly well in the 70's or 80's. Guess what?  They are an average pop band at best.  Song writing...ok...musicianship...ok.....production...ok......recording(squash,squash,DSP,DSP)....sucking the great green weenie.  On every level lacking imagination, originality, and mind boggling production and adventurousness that marks the thrust of the 70's.  I could go on and on.  I'm starting to irritate myself though.  I'll spare you all.  Clearly the 5 star'ers have not listened to the masters in a while or ever 
 The early entries in the book (first 100 pages) are very interesting tales of unconventional lives revealing the author's confusion with his/her ethnicity.  However, after ten or so entries, the reading becomes old and repitive revealing many Americans need to preach their problems.  Being biracial/multicultural is not a problem but a gift which I can personally attest.  The readings need more creativity in establishing a point that is engaging but captivating.  Its too easy to simply say back when I was 4 I came to the realization that... and over and over again.  With this book all I can say is find the entry which most relates to your personal history because this book proves that the whole is not greater than the sum, of a portion mind you,of its parts 
 I bought a 743 for the wife for Christmas. I had a 6330 that I was very happy with. So a 743 should be better Right? Every time that she went to use it the batteries were dead. We finally figured out that a new set would go dead in two days without ever turning it on! After several e mails they told me to call service. I got someone in India that could not understand me and I had a really hard time figuring out what he was saying. They made it very dificult to get it sent in. I sent it in today, but I do not expect much from the example that their service has done so far. I hope it comes back at least. 
 This is the second book I have decided to review. I have decided to do so inorder that others may avoid my mistake. The book is banal. It goes on and on, creating category after category of needless taxonomies. Nothing even slightly new or interesting. Additionally it suffer the problem of all "internet" books. It was hoplessly outdated by the ime it hit thw shelves. Someone exceptionaly tiresome wrote a phd thesis, invented jargon and then decided to turn it into a book.  
 This Oregon Scientific Pedometer is very inaccurate and a waste of money even at the cheap price.  There is no point to even considering "saving money" when it comes to pedometers if the count is going to be almost arbitrary 
 I'm scared to fly so I took this book on a plane with me when I had to visit my grandparents in Winnipeg. It immediately transported me to the wonderful and magical world of public relations!!! I soon forgot I was on a plane, and suddenly I felt like Colin Farrell's character in Phone Booth--you know where that guy held him hostage on the phone to make him repent for his sleazy ways. I especially like how the guy called Farrell out for claiming to be this big shot PR guy with all these connections, but actually he had no real connections at all. I also visited the wonderful olden days of PR like in the movie Sweet Smell Of Success where Tony Curtis is the PR man. Whenever he walks into a room, people cannot hide their contempt for this scumbag. I like at the end how he ends up getting the stuffing kicked out of him.   I arrived in Winnipeg safely all thanks to Michael Levine and his book about what sleazy liars PR people are 
 in the short story collection night shift, mr.king gave us some of his best short stories and spawned at least 6 movies that i know of(this mess,trucks( twice once by king as "maximam overdrive" and once as a t.v. movie),night surf,the boogyman(not the new one),graveyard shift,the mangler,and maybe more and not one has been done right! this one misses by a mile as it tells of the cult of kids who kill all the adults in a town and serve "he who walks behind the rows"     more like "we steped in something behind the rows" and we steped in this flameing piece of junk!!! skip it!!!!!! 
 Those familiar with the Battle of Midway will find nothing new here.  On the contrary, the book is so full of errors and misconstructions of fact that it only further distorts the reasons behind the tragic slaughter of the U.S. torpedo planes and their aircrews during this famous battle.  Much of the technical information cited in this book is outdated, inaccurate, or incorrectly analyzed, leading to erroneous errors and conclusions throughout the text.  Readers wanting to know the real story to the U.S. torpedo planes would be better off obtaining a reprint of Lord's classic work Incredible Victory, Lundstrom's First Team, or the newly released Shattered Sword by Parshall and Tully 
 They keep saying that the American public is not stupid, yet they seem to be buying these books. And if this spewing of hatred is not godless, I don't know what is. 
   I gave this movie 1 star because it is not a true documentary.  It falls more along the same fodder as "Spinal Tap".  It is missing a counter point from GM.  One could argue that Roger had chances to talk with Moore, but choose not to.  One the other hand, Rogers missing interview is what gave the movie such an emotional hold.  I believe that Moore counted on not being granted air time at GM for the production of this film.  An interview would have killed the tone.   Watch the nightly news NOW.  Last night, March 22nd 2006, GM offered a one time buy out to some of it's employees.  The news reported that GM cannot afford to maintain its relationship with the UAW (Just like what caused the Flint situation in the film).  This same thing happened in the late 1980's and brought forth this extremely biased movie.  This film is entertaining in a strange way, but should not be considered to be the absolute truth.  Watch it with a grain of salt. For what it's worth, Under close examination, Careful consideration and Keen intellect, you will see a undercover message You might need to examine closely the content. Outwardly, things are not what they seem Until you look more closely. Many times the basic concept is Misread in the dialog Once you see this, and Open your mind to it, Rational thought will Emerge 
 The book on Kennedy -- also called "A Matter of Character" -- is a stronger volume.   He finds some of the many flaws in Kennedy and examines them carefully.   Here we have a president who has nothing BUT flaws and Kessler is admiring throughout.    What is he thinking?      I gave it an extra star for its attempt to do the impossible -- that is, to paint an admiring portrait of Little George.   If you've seen the final scene of "Pink Flamingos," you will have no trouble swallowing this.  
 "Othello" is a play that will show you how unredeemable human beings can be.  It'll make you question everyone, along with his or her motives and beliefs.  It also shows you how men lusted after women in the late 16th century, but how women could not lust after men.  The double standard was put to the test, and, as always, women lose this battle.  Women may sell themselves as whores, and are ridiculed for it, but the men who use their services are overlooked.  This is a foul play and I think Shakespeare held women without regard. Othello was a despicable man who had little self-esteem I do not recommend 
 Patrick Dempsey had an usual niche in the 80s teen comedy, as did the characters he played.  He was the lovable loser who just wanted to fit in, somehow ends up getting caught up in some smutty encounter or another on his quest for acceptance, but is well liked and tended to have everything mostly work out for him in the end.  Here was no acception.  He plays the lovable loser once again, this time he was an arrogant, cocky kid who blew his education by doing nothing but partying at college.  Disappointed and angry at his failing grades, his parents decide to stop supporting him and he is forced into the minimum wage workforce at a pizza place.  While Patrick is thoughly miserable working for slave labor, he encounters a beautiful, mysterious stranger who (like the plot to a bad porn movie) makes his job worth while with no strings attached.  While this fleeting encounter might have ended there, the mysterious stranger talked with her women friends about this, and soon Patrick is working as a gigalo under the guise of a pizza delivery guy.  The smutty adventures and hilarity ensue after that.  Long before Desperate Housewives he was their Afternoon Delight.  What was amazing to me in watching this movie is that Patrick didn't have sex with all the women clients he eventually aquires.  He is simply a friend, a companion, someone to talk with.  I guess I just don't understand why some of the women he was servicing didn't try talking with their husbands about what was bothering them rather than letting this situation come to a head.  Of course, as infidelity is an ugly thing no matter how many screwball slapstick antics you apply to it like this movie did, it all comes crashing down on him when his mother rings up for some loving.  That's an urban ledgend if there ever was one.    I gave this only 2 stars because the happily ever after ending was too hoaky for words.  Still, it is a commentary on the world being full of lonely people 
 As an open-minded aid worker, I was interested to read about our faults (and there are many, nobody's perfect). But G.Hancock fails miserably to deliver. I have the same reaction with Michael Moore: I agree with his ideas, want to enajoyhis books, and then am extremley disappointed. A long litany of facts mostly correct, sometimnes distorted to fit the picture, and nothing else. No analysis of reasons why, no consideration of what the other side may have to say, no shades of gray, everything is black. Morevoer there does not seem to be any alternatives. Even conservatives can do better than that.  One example of superficial analysis (page 171): 1- a highway was (poorly) built in Somalia and started failing almost immediately. OK this happens too often 2- Somalia will still be repaying the loan ($100M) after 40 years.  NO: first of all with a soft loan they would pay at most a third of it, second even if the road is failing, the road built may be still worth more than that... And second of all Somalia's debt was cancelled in the meantime...SO they will not pay anything...  I am not saying building a poor highway is OK, I am saying the the author criticizes in a simplistic manner. His ranting is really useless. I guess it is for non-aid workers, who will conclude that aid is to be stopped completely.  WHAT DOES THE AUTHOR PRPOSE TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF AID ? Nothing said about that.  NB. One failing among others: why there is no mention of international journalists (such as the author). They also live (fatly) from poverty... 
 Scots, maybe, but usually just plain Scottish. Scotch is a common name for whisky.  It amazes me how many people here tell me that they are "Scotch-Irish" - to me it makes them sound like an idiot. 
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 I was looking forward to reading this book but it is taking a month to reach me. It was shipped on February 8. It is not March 7 and no book.  I am not a happy camper 
 This novel was a big disappointment to me.  It began with great promise but then fell apart at its midpoint.  I can only conclude that Ms. Aikens was writing under a deadline because the resolution of the various plot lines in the novel's concluding scene is ludicrous and unsatisfactory.  So save your money for another book 
 Buyers beware!  I have never written or posted a consumer rating in my life.  I am so disappointed with Vonage's overall customer service; I feel that I have no choice but to warn others.  Vonage in its own words does not guarantee the quality of its service. Vonage customers will experience: (1) dropped calls, (2) garbled communications, and (3) a non-responsive and dishonest customer service department.  The reason Vonage does not guarantee performance is because it knows that it cannot.  My first mistake was in believing the Vonage help desk, during my initial, "30 Day Money Back Guarantee Period," when they told me my issues were due to line quality and not Vonage.  Since then, I have spent three months with Vonage and my High Speed Internet Service Provider's technicians attempting to make this service work. All speed tests indicate my ISP lines are fine.  I had a High Speed Internet Technician visit my house last week only to tell me everything checks out.  All this said, my Vonage phone has never worked worse.  I made a call today and the recipient could not even discern whom I was.  When I finally threw in the towel and decided that Vonage was not for me, I was hit with a $39.99 service charge upon cancellation plus the cost of the phone, despite a documented lack of performance from day one.    Vonage's performance is substandard by any measure.  Closely look at all other options before bringing Vonage into your life and definitely terminate all agreements within your first 14 days to avoid the inevitable early termination fees.  Make sure you read the below clauses in Vonage's Terms of Service agreement before you agree to anything.  A Vonage Customer Service Manager, Mike, sited these disclaimers when I told him that I was not satisfied with the service: (1)	"No Warranties on Service," section 4, paragraph 4;  (2)	"Return of Device," section 2, paragraph 10; (3)	"Termination Fee," section 3, paragraph 6; and (4)	"Money Back Guarantee; Limitations and Conditions," section 3, paragraph 7.  When I switched to Vonage, I was simply looking for a reliable telephone service and a company that stands behind its product and supports its customers.  Vonage's lack of line reliability and poor customer service has motivated me to document my experience.  I had to call Vonage Customer Service on my old fashion landline because the voice quality on my Vonage phone was so poor that I would not be able to have a conversation.  After waiting for 20 minutes to talk to the Service Manager, Mike, I was told that I was contractually bound because I did not terminate my agreement within the first 30 days.  At this moment I thought of the stereotypical shady used car transaction.  I was lured to buy Vonage because of the promises of great service and all the free bells and whistles that only "internet calling can provide."  Instead I received a lemon, a phone that was unreliable and a company that did not stand behind its product.  While Vonage may get my $39.99 termination fee and the cost of the Vonage phone, I do not feel that I can just lay down about Vonage's failure to perform.  I feel compelled to (1) warn others about Vonage and hopefully save them the aggravation that I have experienced and  (2) Hit Vonage where it hurts, in the economic pocket book.  I am terminating my service as soon as possible.  
 This book is not a biography but rather a littany of volatile slurs.  So much mis-information when in print seems to count for the truth.  This book is the furthest thing from the truth or from Barbra Streisand.  I recommend you buy the double CD The Essential Barbra Streisand instead.  You'll get far more than your money's worth and more hours of enjoyment than the pain it takes to read this book 
 Is basically a brief introduction and outline and then many examples. The examples are all mostly from the 2000 decline in the market. So the book outlines a very specific approach and highlights examples that fit that approach.   Given the cost of the book , I don't mind having it in my library. So far the best book on short selling was written by Justin Mamis . The book by Kathryn Staley is great as well. The focus there is how to look at the balance sheets and corporate shenanigans. Both these books are not light reading though 
 I don't like this stupid book! It only teaches kids that "strangers" are bad people that wanna hurt you for fun, and the only "nice" people are the people you know. A kid in my brother's kindergarten class was too afaid to leave his house because of this book. They should of changed the title to "The Berenstain Bears Learn About Demented Killing Strangers. 
 Good Grief...I know this is supposed to be a classic and all but is this the best the producers could do? Maybe I'm missing the point but I've seen better "C" category movies...what's up with the one robot mass invasion? How did they get here? What shot down the military planes? I could even see the eyes of the person inside the tin foil outfit...the characters seem to stay neatly cleaned and pressed throughout, or maybe that's part of the fun...well ha ha... 
 i watched this directors other movie "dancer in the dark" and while i didn't like it,i felt it was very different from the cookie cutter movies that hollywood turns out,so i gave this movie a chance and 2 1/2 hours later i found myself wondering if the director of this movie is on anti-depression drugs or what? this is the darkest most nightmare induceing film i have ever seen. the story of a young girl who marries and finds love outside her faith,only to have her husband cripled, is just not what i ever want to see again. some may like it,but the directors(in both films i have seen)must be fun to be around,both films are the kind that leave you so in the dumps that you feel(at least i do)unclean for having seen it!i find myself hopeing this man finds himself some help,because he seems to be very down on life and all humans in the world.some may like it as i have said,but i'd watch 24 hours of test patterns before i'll watch this kind of downer movie ever again!!!!!! 
 Anything by historian (and World War II veteran) Howard Zinn would be better than Lynne Cheney's jingoism. Also, for some background info on Lynne Cheney's corporate and ideological agenda, see the book by radio host Laura Flanders, "Bushwomen: Tales of a Cynical Species. 
 I actually began reading this book three seperate times.  I'm not typically the type to not finish what I've started, but the dense prose and pompous voices of the characters were extremely off-putting.  Some reviewers have said that they found the haughty nature of the characters amusing, but frankly it makes the characters unlikable. I'm even more upset by the reviews listed on the back of this book which exclaim it to be a "gripping tale" or an "engulfing detective story".  Totally false on both counts!  While I wouldn't say no to a refund, what I really want back is any brain space any memory of this story might be taking up. 
 My kids started reading the Left Behind Kids books, and because I was concerned about the message and theology of the books, I started reading them also.  Then I decided to check out the "adult" books from the library.   I am a born-again, pentacostal believer in Jesus Christ, and parts of the theology are not what I read in the Bible.  OK.  I can stil enjoy a good book, one with interesting characters, realistic dialogue, and a good plot.  The issue of plot is difficult for the Left Behind books, I admit, because we know who wins if we've read the end of the New Testament.  As to the rest, it fell flat.  Most of the dialogue didn't ring true.  After a few of the books, I was interested in some of the characters, but by the end of the books, there were only a few of the original characters left, and they were some of the least interesting to begin with.  How many times do we have to read through the same sermons from the exact same scriptures in Revelation?  How many times do they have to tell us about the almost affair that someone had back in Book 1?  There is nothing new and interesting in this book. The last book is just boring.    It would have been nice, at the end of the book, to wrap up everything.   Jesus comes back, and everyone should be reunited at the end after the battle is over, right?  Some of the characters that were important early in the books are either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all.  It was an incredible let down.  I felt like I had invested in these books only to see what life would be like for everyone after the battles are over.  Nothing.  We stick with that one main guy, and everyone else is left in the dust.  It should have had a really, really happy ending, but even that was boring.  If I had my time back, I would stick to the kid versions, if only to discuss theological issues with my children.  At least in the kid books, the sermons are shorter.  And I will know not to get my hopes up for happy reunions at the end of the series 
 check out (...)and see for yourself.  great site by the way if you're really interested in getting into real estate and don't buy into all these garbage gurus on tv who want you to spend thousands of dollars to learn unethical and possibly illegal techniques to buy and sell real estate.    in any case, if you need motivation, check out russ' books.  if you want a real how to with the good and the bad check out john's site.  it's a real eye-opener 
 I was familiar with Cassandra Clare during her BNF days in the Harry Potter community. But I never read any of the fanfiction that she was so famed and maligned for -- frankly, the subject matter just didn't interest me. I understand there were leather pants.  But I did get a chance to see the first chapters of this book at the end of last year, and I've since flipped through a copy in the bookstore. And you know, it made me really glad that I didn't waste any time and eyestrain on her fanfic.   The book is a clumsy attempt at being witty and literary, full of the purplest prose and dubious metaphors. The characters are two-dimensional and unoriginal, and the POV is incosistent and jerky, and the plot is derivative and cliched -- recycled from a half-dozen mainstream sci-fi and fantasy TV shows, films, and books, and cobbled together rather shamelessly.  The jokes are flat at best, and the author's grasp of the age group about which (and for whom) she is writing seems tenuous. The main characters are utterly unconvincing as adolescents, and their forced dialogue is predictable at best, painful at worst.  Overall, it's a ridiculous and uncompelling train wreck of a YA fantasy novel. And while I don't recall if leather pants were involved, there were parachute pants.  They were the best part, really 
 If you think criminals should be spared from the consequences of their acts, this book will warm your soul. It's syruppy liberal gibberish.  I agree with the author, judges are martinettes and petty tyrants. But it cuts both ways; in my 1000s of courtroom experiences judges nudge the scales of justice both ways; some give defendants every reasonable and unreasonable break, and some hang everybody. Judges often order that the laws be broken inorder to oblige their whims. Judges are always lawyers who cant hack private practice. No exceptions. And lately, all women and 2nd rate men.   Feige consistently writes well. And the book contains several instances of the "F" word. Unless cursing is necessary for the story, minimize it. I'm not opposed to cursing per se, if it's a salient part for telling the story 
 What age range is the book appropriate for?  Poor Horton -- They beat him.  They maul him.  And try to cage him.  And threaten to boil the dust speck in Beezle-Nut juice just to teach him a lesson.  My poor 5 year old looked at me with sad eyes, and asked, "why?"  Not the best bed-time story 
 I bought this book in preparation for a party.  When the book showed up, I was severly disappointed - it's basically the same recipe over and over again using different tequilas.  The book does briefly talk about a lot of different tequilas and has a few (and I do mean few) recipes for other margaritas (fruit etc).  But instead of buying this book, try [web address] you'll find a much better variety and save yourself the money 
 CoT is a rather disjointed attempt at a historical narrative that I strongly suspect was culled from a dozen or so different journals from settlers. This is not well done history and a rather tiresome read. I found it amazing that there was almost no discussion of the culture or way of life of the aborigines. The discussion of the English settlers seems to focus on sex and punishment. What about the organization of the colony? How did the colonists manage their day-to-day lives to survive those first worst years?  For anyone who has a serious interest in history, CoT misses the mark by a wide margin. Not recommended 
 treat it like a second rate reference manual, not a proper textbook. For some good understanding of electromagnetisim and Maxwell's equations look into the Feynman Lectures on physics, the second volume. 
 This book was published in 1995 (so of course was written in about 1993-94) so its information is very out of date. Since that time technology has introduced the BMD bone density scan, and the pharmaceutical industry has developed and promoted the use of bisphosphonates such as Fosamax and Evista. These two developments alone have rendered this book totally out of date and therefore not useful, in my opinion. Also, the information is not evidence-based, most of his recommendations are based on anecdotal and observed results, rather than on scientific studies. What he has to say is interesting, sometimes even fascinating, but is it accurate? For example, his recommendations on caffeine are based on the result of an "experiment" of giving three cups of coffee to five women. I don't consider that evidence-based medical protocol.  A vastly better source of information is The Myth of Osteoporosis, by Gillian Sanson, published in 2003. Her book is exhaustively researched, she cites medical and research studies involving hundreds and thousands of subjects, she covers the newest technologies and medications. The only thing missing from her book (because it was published a few years ago) is the very latest information about the potential dangers of Fosamax and the class-action lawsuits about the death of bone in the jaw that has caused people to have their jaws removed.  She provides excellent suggestions for improving bone health, including exercise, dietary changes, supplements, and other ways to beat osteoporosis. She doesn't say that osteoporosis is a myth, she just debunks some of the myths surrounding this condition. I highly recommend this book over the Gaby book 
 I got one word: RETARDED. It fits this album and also every one of the reviewers here, that gave this bs more than one star. 
 Not only was this book offensive (see earlier reviews) but it is full of bad advice. For example, it actually tells women to never bring their kids to word! 
 The book had a long review of the historical and artistical developments related to the pinhole camera.  I was hoping that it would have more information on building a camera and solving many of the problems that pinhole photographers struggle with, such as changing the film.  I wanted more ideas or different plans for building your own camera, not just pictures of cameras that others had built.  There is a nice chapter on zone plates 
 Whole Foods recipes are not as healthy as they prescribe, nor that tasty.  We have tried several recipes from this book with hopes that we would find something that would satisfy us.  We never found any 
 I disagree with one of the other reviewers that we didn't want to learn more about Micah. I was really hoping that we would see more of Micah than his werekitty persona and hair.  Alas, this book uses Micah rather than discusses him. I really like most of the Anita Blake books, but this one is tedious; don't buy it; gosh, don't even borrow it from the library. Too much bad semi-porn, too much formula writing as though Ms Hamilton had left her computer on auto and returned a day later to mail off what the computer had prepared.  Let's put it this way. I don't even remember the plot. Hmmm. maybe there wasn't one?  Micah COULD be an exciting character, but the non-dimensional descriptions of his trauma and  problems are not it. Let' hope the next book is back to the fun "trash" we've grown to love. Sorry, Ms Hamilton 
 Tepid entry in the collection. Lorre's Moto a bit of a bore 
 I have long had the desire to read a Grisham book, because I have heard good things.  Well, my chance came and I was sorely disappointed.  The audio cd's were on sale at a truck stop and I decided to get them for The Chamber.  The opening to the book kept me going, but by chapter three, I had already decided this, "If Sam Cayhall lives I'm going to be mad because I get furious about hate crimes, and if he dies, he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the "hero" to the story."  Sadly, I pursued curious about the ending.  I'm very glad I got the cds instead of the book, because it only took six hours to get through it.  Sure wish I had those six hours back and the money invested so I could try a diferent author.  Mayber Grisham's other books are better, but I won't be reading them 
 i wonder how hard it is to write cover letters when you have the exact qualifications the job is looking for?  well, if you want that question answered go pick up a copy of this book.  the best has to be "chloe jones" on pgs 69-71.  she's looking for a job as a grant administrator.  it's amazing!  her past job was exactly that - a grants admin.  imagine how difficult it must have been to write that cover letter and resume!  the book is full of examples like this, where the person has the exact qualifications for the job.  ryan then uses the all powerful "impact technique", to craft a masterful cover letter.  it's a little suspicious when every cover letter begins with "ten of banking experience", "fifteen years of human resources management", "twelve years of marketing skills", etc. there is hardly anything of substance in this book for people wanting to change careers, people with little work experience trying to break into a desired field, or anyone who does not have the exact job history and skill qualifications for the advertised position.  save your money or else you'll spend "two hours of life wasted" 
 This could have been a valuable reference.  The front cover lists 39 names, some well known, others so obscure as to invite interests to learn more.  Try to find these 39 when opening the book.  Only in the Index.  At least two pages, as chapters, should have provided insight into the thoughts of these 39 names who appeared under the caption, "A History of Modern Psychoanalytic Throught."  However, Chapter headings only cover Freud, Sullivan, Klein, Fairbairn/Winnicott, Erikson/Kohut, and Kernberg/Schafer/Loewald/Lacan--and that's it.  Eleven theorists.    Toward the end of the book, the last two chapters appear to be the mission of the book--Controversies.  Two pages are devoted to why the authors think homosexuality is normal.  Uh-huh! They emotionally vent against the psychoanalytic view that includes binding mothers and detached fathers.  They grouse over psychoanalytic notions of homosexuality as a "pathological defensive, phobic retreat from castration fears" and renounce employing a "directive/suggestive" approach to treatment.  The authors cite at least one well-known activist by only calling him a "contemporary author."    While Chapter 8, Controversies in theory notes that "Freud regarded sexual orientation as largely constitutional" (p223), the reader must flip to the "Notes" section (p263) to read, "Freud termed homosexuality a perversion, because he considered only heterosexual genital intercourse to be the 'normal' sexual organization.  In the Freudian lexicon, perversions are pregenital fixations caused either by constitution (an overabundance of one or another component drive) or conflict."    The authors have an agenda to discredit theory and call it "expansion" and "transformation" hoping to convert readers to their own way of thinking.  In perusing earlier reviews of this book, they appear somewhat successful.  You might ask, are the authors simply preaching to the choir, or have these reviewers not thought through the material in order to provide credible opinion?  As far as this book being required reading for a doctoral class in Psychodynamic Theory, as one reviewer states, I would hope that expectations of a critical read would accompany such a requirement.  Some of the reviewers appear to be thirsting for knowledge...any knowledge concerning psychoanalytic theory and will drink from the first cup available, without question.   The book's authors, by using vague phases such as "In many cases" to denote Freudian thought to which they disagree, offer no examples to support their attack and leave the reader guessing.  Basic Books is a reputable publisher.  The reader deserves better.  I bought this book but returned it after a selective skimming through its contents.  Finding that the mission of transformation is a failure, the reader will only note that it accedes to political motivation of coveted views 
 Having become interested in metaphysical advancement, I stumbled across the interesting concept of DNA Activation. Thus I began my search for resources that could help me do this, and my search led me to this book.   I was quite disapointed with this book, for one main reason: it's a selling point for a larger 'kit'. The book describes how to do 1st and 2nd DNA Activation, but in order to do the recommended 3rd and 4th Strand Activation, you have to spend a hundred bucks to get the information. [...]   Place this on top of the many spelling and punctuation errors, and it adds up to a book not really worth the paper it's printed on. I recommend avoiding this book 
 What I really didn't like about this book is the constant rambling after starting the topic sentence in a paragraph.  Which never concluded any information on the topic.  Then instead of going over all the variations of an approach, he makes it quite clear that this should be the method for every bowler.  In my opinion bowling involves individuals, and on mans view will not work for every bowler.  It would be more helpful if he used his insight in bowling on how to work with the different variations that you can see in bowling 
 Although the illustrations are lovely and we both love unicorns, the story was just not good.  It was also too descriptive in places for the age range listed.  The story is about mankind destroying the forests and a lot of dialogue between the unicorn and the little girl.  It was really just plain boring 
 Even at a cheap price, its not worth it, spend a few $$$ more and get a better machin 
 This book is very poorly written. This book doesn't define terms, doesn't bother to explain things, and just goes into incredible detail on things that leave the reader lost. I've heard it said that it's for a graduate audience. That's no excuse. 
 I first read A WALKER IN THE CITY as an adolescent, and the book impressed me, in that mysterious way that things that we know "should" impress us can do.  I re-read WALKER as an adult and, by modern standards, I think that it is overrated.  It is long and rambling and self-indulgent.  By rights, A WALKER IN THE CITY should have resonated for me, since my own father had grown up in Brownsville, exactly the same neighborhood that author Alfred Kazin describes, and at virtually the same time.  Yet I found little about Brownsville in this dreary memoir; it simply explores the rather maudlin sentiments of the young Kazin. Swifty Lazar, the late literary agent who was renowned for representing men of letters, as opposed to being a man of letters himself, had offered a far more compelling description of life in that same Brownsville in his own memoir.  No, WALKER only is about Kazin and his adolescent imagination, his theories about those who lived in places other than Brownsville (to wit, "the city") and about his personal (and intensely idiosynchratic, if not peculiar) yearnings.  There are points in which he uses Yiddish without offering a translation, and even a section in which he lapses into high-school French, again with no translation. His use of language often seems strained and self-conscious, such as using the word "plash" as--I think--a synonym for "splash."  Insofar as much of the book had been printed in contemporary magazines as essays, the format here has cobbled together several essays into a memoir. In consequence, this memoir could have used better editing, since things that are fully explained on their first mention do not need the identical explanations further into the book; such styling would be reasonable in a series of magazine pieces, but not in a volume offered as a cohesive work.  I cannot help wondering whether A WALKER IN THE CITY, first published in 1946, would be as enthusiastically received if it first saw print today. It strikes me as the literary equivalent of the Emperor's new clothes 
 A book with a lot of potential by authors with obvious familiarity with their subject matter that devolves into an unpersuasive hatchet job on the Putin government. The authors are quick to find fault with seemingly all aspects of modern Russia, failing in the meantime to acknowledge and explain the enormity of the challenges facing that nation and giving credit for progress and achieved successes. A truly objective look at both the failures and the successes of Putin and post-Soviet Russia would have been more informative and persuasive. The authors seem to have an agenda, which is not well disguised 
  This book is good on theory, but is weak on application and implementation. The book reads well, but when I try to apply or implement the described utilities the necessary details are not there.  This book may work for a class where the tests are given as paper exams, but is weak if you are going to set up an actual machine.  Wondering about why this book would be this way I looked at the "About the Authors" section and discovered why:   Evi Nemeth is retired and sailing her sailboat.   Garth Snyder is now an MD.   Trent R. Hein is running a company.  I admire their accomplishments and wish them the best of luck. However, they have lost touch with Linux.  Linux is very dynamic and requires constant attention to keep up with.  It appears that they don't have time to stay in touch with Linux.  My guess is that they are cutting and pasting from their old books, and maybe have some cheap college students ghost writing for them.  I recommend reading the Linux books by Negus, Sobell, and Jang. 
 What is Wilbur Smith's obsession with the word "escarpment"?!?!  (I stopped count at 37). That aside, this is a pretty hefty adventure.  It caught my eye in the bookstore- the premise of a grand search for an Egyptian tomb really grabbed my interest.  That being said- the author goes a bit overboard with character/scene details, making for a 650+ page read.  Not that it's a negative comment, just a concern about length- there's no economy of words when it comes to Wilbur Smith's writing style.  He's a good storyteller, but it could be so much better with the proper editor involved (getting bogged down in the details slowed the progression of the story's pacing- something I don't appreciate in an adventure novel).  The excitement within the story is a lost a bit due to his slow-detail-oriented writing style.  Don't misunderstand me, I didn't hate it; if the premise of the story didn't interest me from the start, this is a book I would have otherwise put down after the first 100 pages 
 (First of all, this is coming from a huge [Christian] fan of the HP books.) While some of his points do make since, most are not sufficiently explained, and are therefore unbelieveable.  Killinger makes a lot of glaring mistakes; for example, he doesn't seem to understand the concept of a dementor other than the fact that it can (can being the main word) suck out one's soul.  He also gives quite a few incorrect discriptions of exact events in the books.  (An example:  He said that Hagrid had turned Vernon Dursley to a pig in Sorcerer's Stone, but he actually gave DUDLEY Dursley a pig's TAIL.)  The one crucial point that I think he has actually brought across is the role of good vs. evil in the series. Overall, if you are a person who is looking to see if the series is appropriote for you or your children, buy this book.  Otherwise, if you are a fan looking for a good defence of the books, don't waste your time 
 Well, now this carry case is a goner.  The latch will no longer close and the top rim is hopelessly bent.  It was fun while it lasted 
 What a farce this book is.  Barrett is unqualified to write about altnerative medicine.  He has never practiced medicine, only psychiatry.  The work is poorly researched and seems to only support his personal oppinions.  Many may not know that he is supported by the pharmaceutical industry and therefore lacks the objectivity that an author of this subject needs to have.  The findings Barrett writes in this book are really fictionalized 
 This is a strange book. Even for a tell-all book it comes across as really strange. I'm not altogether proud that I purchased the thing in the first place but I was a bit curious about Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and what sort of person she was (aside from beautiful). To that end, the book doesn't really help to enlighten anything. Even when the author claims to have been head over heels in love with her, she (and him) come across as nutty and with too many issues for anyone to be remotely intrigued. It seems to me that Michael Bergin should have had more help in writing it; if he wanted love and respect to come through he just didn't make his point. His dislike for John Kennedy does shine through though, dislike and jealousy. The latter might be understandable if it weren't for its lack of nuances that a proper person and a book needs to have. Towards the end of the darn thing, I was genuinely disturbed by the suggestions that linger off each page. Could he have saved her life? Did she live out her final years in utter unhappiness and despair? Did he know or even care? Perhaps he meant well but it sure doesn't feel like it! 
 ...hahahahahha, boy what a retarded movie! This is the stupidest thing ever...what's that music? Everytime it go's in-sync with what the actors are doing it's so emberessingly bad I cant believe anyone would take it seriously. See the second one if you must...melinda clarke is hotter than shirlyn finn. : 
 This cd sounds like a bunch of 8-year-olds screaming. I like most of the original songs, but they are sung increadible badly by young kids. Most of these songs are meant to be sung by only one person, but the "Kidz Bop Kids" have about 10 people singing them at once. DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!! I'd give this 0 stars if I could, but there isn't an option for that 
 I love to read.  I will read anything, but the back of a cereal box is more entertaining than this book.  I had to force myself to continue reading.  The dialogue goes on and on until you want to scream "stop!"  and the characters are predictable, right out of central casting.  Not only could I not finish this book, but only one person in my 12 member book club finished it, not because she enjoyed it, but because she is a little OCD and felt compelled.  This is so unworthy of a Pulitzer Prize winner--I felt duped! 
 We played this game at a family get together yesterday. It was much too dry and boring for our family. We are all intelligent people, but found this game laboring along with hard to pronounce words and obscure subjects. I guess if you enjoy slow moving trivia games, this would be for you 
 Unfortunately, this book is only going to help you if you're a fat nagging religious close minded wife who's let herself go.   For the modern woman with common sense (and who doesn't have her man beg her for sex, for instance) this book is completely useless. I can think of a few women who'd benefit from it (church ladies?), but most of the things on this book are common sense to a well educated wordly woman. I also found Shaunti Feldhahn's way of writing very anoying...at the beggining of the book, it feels like she goes on and on about respect forever. I get it, respect the man, there's no need to say it 30 times with different words.  It was definitly a waste of money.   
 When I read this book my expectations were high and remained on that level for the first 20 pages. After that I realized this book is less a realistic description of what life in the plains is like but appears to be the authors personal point of view on religion. She mixes up subjective opinions, religious terms and a pseudo-sophisticated, yet more symbolic language that destroys any kind of pleasure that one might find reading this. The description of harsh climate, life in lonesome, empty spaces is realistic but its nothing innovative that one wouldnt know about without reading this book. I think this opus might be interesting to read for everyone living in rural Dakota but to everyone else it is nothing but a mix of bible quotes, simple facts and personal experience as to be found in every issue of National Geographic (except the religious part...) 
 I received the package and read the instructions.  In retrospect there were hints buried there that indicated this may not go well.  It did not.  My installation stalled out and would not complete rendering the computer useless.  I had to take it to a professional to get it going.  Even so, I have had problems with Internet Explorer stopping suddenly, BSOD's.  This is not a job for the average computer user 
 T. Moffatt Burriss failed in his attempt to give HIS memoir of fighting  with the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment during World War II.  The book  bounces from a historical narrative to a personal memoir, to a collection  of others memories.  All combined, this becomes a disorganized account of  one of the best fighting units of World War II.  Mr. Burriss is undoubtably  a brave man with combat jumps and many front line combat days, but he  should have either written a memoir or a history.  His attempt to do both  failed 
 With all that happens in this book,and much of it is somewhat far-fetched, the only thing that I did not buy were the choices made in the end. They were inconsistent with the character development throughout the book. I felt cheated 
 Less a view from afar or broad exposure of solitude from the human condition, this book more aptly excerpts the author's personal conflicts with human relationships.....a one-on-one wrestling match with the Self with no spectators and no judges. The book is a good read for academic analysis, but not so fun for venturist philosophy 
 This book does not deliver on it's cover title. I bought this text thinking it will help me learn the basic working details of TCP/IP. I was totally dissappionted 
 I enjoyed the parts regarding the S.S. Valiant, but the later part of the book simply didn't work for me. Except for Picard, who we of course know quite well from the series, the other characters were flat and uninteresting. We never find out what is motivating the alien attackers and they are the cardboard cutout enemy-of-the-week, boring. The whole "adversarial" situation with the 1st Officer also just struck me as odd and wrong, and was just not developed correctly or fleshed out beyond being another cardboard enemy for Picard 
 I'll start by saying I know first hand that writing a novel is NOT easy...with that said, I didn't care to much for the author's style with this book...She chose to narrate through the voice of her main character, Ceazia but she often mixed that up by telling what the other characters where thinking and feeling...You can either tell it from one person's perspective or in order to incoporate everyone's thoughts and feelings, tell it from the outside as you the author being the main narrator...That was my biggest pet peeve with this novel...Another one was that certain instances and situations could have and should have been elaborated because after reading them I was like--HUH??? and because I read this one after Married to the Game, it's sequel--I know those situations were not spoke upon ever again.  I think she introduced too many characters and tried to juggle too many story lines...It could have been a better book if she either elaborated or eliminated certain aspects of the story...All in all, I give 2 stars for effort... 
 J.A. Jance's novel, Outlaw Mountain, is one of the worst books i have read in years.  Her characters and their dialogue, both inward and spoken, are completely unbelievable.  The storyline is convoluted and riddled with useless drama which is completely unnecessary for the plot.  The fact that I was able to finish this book was an act of pure discipline.  I am a worse person just for having consumed this book.  I would advise anyone who is considering purchasing or reading this book to save their time and money 
  I think first of all it was whack actors and actresses in this film. I personally think the whole movie was crazy. It did not satisfy me at all. I think it could have been alot of better actors and actresses. Please leave the acting to someone else. 
 I only wish it were possible to give them no stars, or just red x's. These guys never shipped my order, and even sent me an email telling me a different ship date then Amazon. Once that ship date came and went, I just made a claim to get my money back. A total of 2 months for DVD's that were meant for a father's day gift. These guys are clueless. Stay away from them for sure. You're better off going to Target to buy DVD's 
 This "mini-booklet" is basically a reiteration of the stages of grief set within a Judeo-Christian perspective.  One could probably stop by the local funeral parlor and pick up a free pamphlet that would be every bit as edifying.   Good grief, what a disappointment! 
 Tony Brown's book isn't backed up by any facts, just "conspiracies" he's heard. I'm convinced Mr. Brown is a Lyndon Larouche supporter who is a paraniod schizophrenic. Though some parts where interesting to read, which is why I gave it two stars, I found it hard to follow one-accusation to another. I didn't believe anything he wrote. 
 The Bissell 2680B Perfect Sweep Dual Brush Sweeper has a pole attachment that keeps coming apart every time you attempt to sweep. This defect in the design, which uses sections instead of one long pole, makes it impossible to use without aggravation. We have put tape around the pole, but it does not work. Now we are going to try screws to hold it together. I never saw anything like this in my life, and hope I never do again. 
 I am a big Brian Setzer fan going back to the Stray Cats. He quite frankly is one of the few artists out there whose music is just fun, lively, and makes you feel "Hey man, this is music". Setzer is as talented on the guitar as Jerry Lee Lewis is on the piano and in my mind no better compliment can be paid to a musician.   Every new iteration of Brian Setzer has been enjoyable: Stray cats, to the Swing of the Dirty Boogie, to the Rockabilly of the Comeback Special, and the superb tribute to sun records.  But, he missed it on this CD. The song writing is silly and sophmoric. I do not expect to find the meaning of life hidden behind the lyrics found in Setzer's CDs but the majority of songs on this CD have all the same elements. Some songs are riddled with rhymes children in the first grade use, and are repeated endlessly. Such as in the song "Bad Bad Girl in a Bad Bad World".   For example here is a small snippet out of the song mentioned before:   She's a bad bad girl in a bad bad world A bad bad girl in a bad bad world It's not her fault she's a bad bad world It's so sad it's a sad sad world She's a bad bad girl in a bad bad world A bad bad girl in a bad bad world It's not her fault she's a bad bad world She's a bad bad, bad bad, bad bad, bad bad girl  What garbage! By the end of the little chorus you just want to give the CD a toss.  Many of his songs are riddled with the disjointed tempo changes found in punk music. Setzer has been able to do this subtly in the past without calling attention to it, but there are a few songs on here that just sound confused. Definately not a Setzer trait.   There has never been a Setzer song that I absolutely cannot stand, until "Really Rockabilly" and "Bad Bad Girl". The first two bad songs he has done on the same disc. There is not one single song on here that compares favorably with any other of his songs that have come before.   I have to mention that I hold Setzer to a very high standard, which until now he has never fallen short of. This CD is still far better than 95% of the crap that is being released in today's market.  To summarize I would encourage Setzer to get beyond this CD, and return to his thrown a top the music landscape 
 I really really like David Lynch's work. I will always remember how the "Twin Peaks" atmosphere bled into my sense of reality before, during and after airing. I ordered the book for an opportunity to find out how the heck he conjured his exceptionally unique and magical ideas. I learned that he derives them from daily Transendental Meditation. I learned that in his short prologue. The rest of the "book" (one short comment on each page)was a waste of my time.  
 I was looking for good links for online activities, tutorials, and classes but found way too many dead links, pseudo 5 star sites that were sales sites, and too many Bible links. I compared a Google search for the topic headings and did much better than scouring the book for viable links. Don't waste your money or time 
 I think those readers who are interested in erotic stories may find the selections in this audio tape a bit "technical" sounding.  The terminology used fell short of my definition of eroticism.  I would pass on  this selection 
 it requires effort from owners.  Bought this to help control our Sheltie's barking behavior.  When we first tried it, he would stop and look around to see where the sound was coming from.  We noticed that this alone wouldn't stop his bark and required us to work with him by using voice commands like 'No' or 'Quiet'. This  meant alot of time and patience working with him and my kids didn't help very much.  They have a tendency to push the button and not do the commands.  So now the dog thinks that the sound comes from the birds that he likes to bark at...lots of re-training to do here.  Well the dog hasn't stopped barking and obeying yet, but we haven't been as good at working with him either.  My next purchase will probably be a Citronella Collar..I'm opposed to the shock treatment from shock collars as this seems cruel and can teach some dogs to be mean.  Better still maybe a good book on dog training is in order.   My oldest daughter used this when walking the dog around the neighborhood and found that it did stop some of the neighbor's dogs from barking or at least got their attention.  My question now is could this possibly stop or delay a dog attack??...at least long enough to get away or somehow protect yourself.   Not sure I would want to risk trying this though but it might be worth taking on walks..just in case.  
 I bought this mouse while on the road when I forgot my Microsoft wireless mouse. I do not have the original packaging otherwise I would have taken in back. The USB receiver is hard to get out of its cradle in the back, I often have to pry it out with a coin or a credit card. After a week of use the mouse started to wig-out. Erratic movement etc. If the mouse is left unattended for any length of time I cannot seem to wake it up with any of the buttons. The ONLY thing that works is using the wheel to scroll. The really bad part is that it seems to behave this way until I unplug the receiver. I thought this was because I was using a Mac, I experienced the same behavior on my PC as well. I'm going to throw this away since I would not wish it on my enemy 
 I'm not certain why there are so many glowing reviews for this product.  My wife registered for this item because the 4 stage tub looked good in theory.  Unfortunately, because of the collapsible design this "bath" tub does not hold water, it just runs out of the seam where the two sides come together.  There is a foam gasket around the seam that is intended to hold the water in, but it is useless. The sling is useful for bathing an infant, and the removable ring does it's job of keeping an infant upright while learning to sit.  Unfortunately, by the time our infant was ready to sit we had already replaced this piece of junk.  I guess they call it Safety 1st as your kid can't drown in a dry bath tub 
 Had this set of speakers for close to a year now. They really are nothing special for the price. ONE problem is when running them on battery the signal seems to drift (if you lock in a signal at all)! They do come with power cord to plug each speaker into AC. I have outside wiring so this is no trouble. TWO if you walk between the transmitter and the speeakers the music cuts out.If you plan to buy these and run them on battery alone, and mounting them in a high traffic area (I mounted mine high above head level), DON'T PURCHASE THEM 
 I love cozies and am very fond of the Miss Julia series.  I had to lower my rating of this book because there is a 98 page reminiscence in the middle of it that provides nothing new to the loyal reader of this series. That's about 1/3 of the book. Very disappointing. 
 I found this book to be very limited in regard to content.  I was looking for more advanced techniques, or at least a more detailed study of actual methods for accomplishing what the title advertises.   The author could have presented the main points of this book on a few pages and saved us all the time required to read the filler material.  Just about any book you pick up about public speaking or personal communication contains the advice found here.  "Repeat the question - It gives you a few more seconds to think about your answer" is about as advanced as the info in this book gets 
 If you are a fan of Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice, and Mr. Darcy in particular, do not buy Mr. Darcy's Daughters.  I had to force myself to finish the book, even while trying to keep an open mind and not expect it to be of the same caliber of Pride and Prejudice.  The story is weak, the characters forgettable.  If I'd read the reviews here first I wouldn't have bothered with the book.  There were many extraneous characters in the novel, love interests develop late and with little or nothing to support them.  There are more references to sex than I think is in line with a sequel to a Jane Austen novel.  I also found it strange that any children of Mr. Darcy (let alone five of them) would choose to show little regard for how their behavior affected their standing in good London society.  At least Mr. and Mrs. Darcy are out of the country for the duration of the novel and are spared the humiliation of making an appearance in such a second-rate piece of work. 
 There are not a lot of good books on World War One.  This is not one of them.  It is about as informative and interesting as a high school history text 
 I have 50 pages to go and I can't wait to finish this boring waste of time. Very predictable, sappy, sweet and quite meaningless.  I give it a minus 1 
 this is the cut down version of the 3 hour pilot that universel released in theaters after the show went belly up in '78. if you buy the whole series you can skip this pointless rehash that isn't that good or very well thought out 
 After reading this book, it is so obvious that the author/s know nothing about chiropractic. Have they ever even been treated by a chiropractor? It is also not very professional for one doctor to condemn another. I am an orthopaedic surgeon and I refer many of my patients to be treated by a chiroractor before the final choice of surgery. After giving a lecture at a chiropractic college in Japan, I was amazed that the doctors know as much about my job as I do! But how much does the author know about chiropractic?  It is books like this that keeps modern medicine  in the dark ages. Some doctors are even ignorant about the fact that HIV is the cause of AIDS! I have a copy of this book at home which I bought for 5 Dollars in a second hand book shop; if anybody wants a good laugh at a doctors ignorance, you can have mine for a buck 
 Sinead O'Connor is One of the best Stylist Singers over the past 20 years to me.problem with her material is that at times She can be heavy handed with the Material. this Album doesn't move me because She doesn't need to be doing any collaborations. Her Instrument of a voice should easily be able to carry any song.this collection seems tossed together as to feeling like a Cohessive Album on a whole to me.with the right material Sinead could make a Pretty Good to Very good Album with the right musical match up&Hook up.this ain't it 
 I was given a copy of this book when my son, Zachary was born.  As another reviewer mentioned, it was quite scary reading all the things that MIGHT be wrong with him medically, along with the quotes from parents the author included.  I'm sure the quotes were a well-meaning inclusion from the author - but each and every one I would review to be extremely non-descript, even bordering negative.  As a parent of a child with DS - I can tell you first-hand that my experience has been nothing but non-descript...but overwhelmingly positive.  My son, at less than 2 years old, has already brought so much joy into our lives and countless others.  A child with Down Syndrome is a blessing in disguise.  He give to me so much more than I give to him as you wil hear from just about ANY parent with a DS child - but not from the author or the outdated quotes she chooses to include in her book. 
 There are just two rules when you create a thriller with a pretty lead: 1) The lead (the delectable Ashley Judd) had better show some skin. 2) Thou shalt not be boring.  Twisted utterly fails on both counts.  Basically, Judd is Jessica Shepard, a messed up cop who specializes in hunting serial killers.  She's fond of bedding men she meets at late night bars, because she's self-destructive.  Only Jessica looks fabulous all the time, even when she's been on a bender (which is apparently every night).  How she maintains her good looks without stinking up the place is just another part of cinema magic.  Jessica is mentored by John Mills (Samuel L. Jackson).  For a second there I thought Jackson was going to play an understated version of his usual maniacal self.  I was wrong.  Things take a turn for the strange after Jessica discovers that every man she sleeps with is murdered.  And she keeps having these weird blackouts every night.  The victims wash up on the shore the next day with a single cigarette burn on their hand.  Poor Jessica is haunted by her parents' murder/suicide and wonders...since her father went on a mass-murdering spree before he killed himself, could she too have the "serial killer gene"?  Jessica is paired with Mike Delmarco (Andy Garcia), an Italian goomba who is alternately creepy, lecherous, and like everyone else in this ridiculous movie, wants to get into her pants.  Mike follows her around an awful lot...could HE be the killer?  Or maybe it's the ex-boyfriend cop, Jimmy Schmidt (Mark Pellegrino).  Or maybe it's...actually, I figured it out in the first ten minutes.  Being something of a true crime fan, and having read a bit on the subject, this entire premise is absurd. You don't wake up one day and become a serial killer; if anyone actually got a good look at the life of a serial killer, it screams DANGER from day one.  Pretty Jessica has none of those problems in her past, except for a vague "suppressed rage" that manifests itself in kinky sex and kicking people in the face.  Her cherubic face shows no signs of hardship, and neither does the rest of her. Although the script wants us to believe she's a haggard cop, the camera is only too happy to zoom in on her rear end.  Not once, but twice.  And it's not a naked rear end either.  So we have a gorgeous female cop who sleeps around, yet there are very few bedroom scenes.  We have a serial killer plot that is connected by red herrings (Who is that lady across the street?  Why does Jessica fiddle with a cigarette but never light it?).  On one hand, the cops are strictly by the book; they make a big deal out of the fact that Jessica kicks a serial killer in the face.  On the other hand, nobody pulls Jessica off the case when she's a prime suspect, nor watch her home when the serial killer is obviously following her around.   Neither sleazy or highbrow, gritty or moralistic, Twisted is so boring, it gets bored with itself 
 I will not watch the movie "Andersonville" until they make a movie called "Elmira"(the camp in Elmira, N.Y., the worst of the Union prison camps had 35% death rate) 
 This Book was horrible!  I heard really great things about it and so i figured i should read it.  The main character is really boring and shallow and i didn't like her at all.  And for her to allow a boy to just take over her life even though she knows he doesn't love her is simply ridiculous!  I don't know i thought that this book was kind of boring and i just didn't like it that much.   
 I wouldn't recommend this book.  it is hard to follow, it doesn't satisfy the answers to your question and I've already found 2 illnesses that aren't in this book that my kids have recently had 
 I just want to say that I really, really wanted to like this movie...I just couldn't bring myself to.  It came on IFC the other night and since I've been on this Independent Film kick lately, that and it starred Penn, Morton and Thurman, I decided to give it a watch through.  I had heard good things about it, mostly about Morton's performance as well as Penn, so I can honestly say I had high expectations.  Those expectations, sadly, were not met.  First of all I want to say that Penn's performance was so overrated I was left appalled that he was even considered among Spacey, Crowe and Washington that year.  Morton on the other hand did add some weight to the picture and proved that she is a commanding actress even when she says not a single word.  Penn plays fictional jazz guitarist Emmett Ray, a very conceded and irresponcible man who spent his time womanizing and obsessing over better known musician Djamgo Reinhardt.  The film follows this mans life as he takes up with Hattie (Morton) a mute woman who's naïve enough to love this man and then leaves her to marry aspiring news reporter Blanche (Thurman) who is using Emmett for a story.  The much underused Anthony LaPaglia and Brad Garrett make almost too-short cameos as gangsters who get involved with Emmett and Blanche.  All in all this was a very slow moving film that eventually went nowhere.  Woody Allen is known as a classic director, and that maybe the case, but this is nowhere near classic.  It's mockumentary style of directing is annoying since it's not funny nor interesting, and Sean Penn is just plain ridiculous (as is his character) in this over hyped film 
 Will not play once video was downloaded. I get the error message:  "can not play file, please try again later. error# 0x80040273" I made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the UnBox department was already closed, I was told the UnBox Saturday and Sunday 6-5 hours.

I will Update again - Feb. 10,200 
 I canceled my order after 3 shipments of the wrong color. The shipping documents stated red but you consistantly shipped white. It is hard to be happy with a product you never receive 
 This album should not be under the category "angels, beautiful, beauty, blue, celtic" but rather under "Darkness, hell, despair 
 I am about halfway through this book and am about to throw it out. So far, he has gone through a history of the psychology of mothering and fathering and tried to relate personal and client experiences. I didn't want a psychology textbook, I just wanted the author's insite on fatherhood. After reading half the book, the only conclusion he has drawn is that men are more aggressive than women and are different in their parenting styles. I already knew this and didn't need all the psychoanalysis to prove the point.   The organization of the book is awful - it has no chapters. You have no idea what each section is about. It rambles on somewhat aimlessly (at least so far). It is certainly not something you would want as light reading. I would think that only a psychology student or professor would enjoy reading it. I will probably finish the book in the hopes of gaining something that may help me be a better father, but I'm not holding out much hope 
 I cannot for the life of me understand how this thing ever found a publisher.  The prose is flat and insipid; the characters unexciting and drab; the pace leaden.  Reading this is slightly less exciting than watching paint dry.  The author has done some historical research and can't just use it; where he pops in an historical detail he elbows you in the ribs to draw attention to his cleverness.  I had a very hard time dragging myself to the end of this book (first one by Mallon I have read) and would not recommend it 
 This movie was not entertaining at all, bad script, etc 
 I got this at Best Buy 4 months ago, its been serviced twice, has a replacement board and there is a 2 month + wait for 2 more replacement boards (digital and scaler).  The picture is lime green, especially on the left side.  The Tech keeps saying all of them (this model) have a green picture so repairs won't work ... so here I sit waiting for repair #3 - by the way, don't get it at Best Buy or use their warranty - its a big battle getting them to replace it or even fix it. FYI This Model wasn't made by Sharp, it was made by a far inferior manufacturer, and the picture shows it.  Anyway, it would be a great set if it wasn't like looking thru Lime Green Jello.    Perhaps the other Aquos models live up to their rep 
 Great idea but a few more pennies could have been added to construction.  It would be a better idea to put the money toward a changing table ...really 
 I felt that the book was technically well written, but the story, subject, and outcome, were all very melo-dramatic and predicatble.  The love story was unimaginable, the plot "twists" were that of a second rate  novel, and the outcome completely unlikely in real life, even back then.  I  live in the California valley, and I have been through every town that is  tramped through in this book, and only by Mr. London's sheer talent for  writing did I keep enough interest to finish it.  There are better, more  rewarding books in London's canon than this 
 People who enjoy this book seem to characterize it as an original work of sci-fi/fantasy and a thought-provoking exploration of insanity, which interests me very much.  However, I found this book to be neither original nor an adequate account of someone's "descent" into or recovery from madness.  The premise is intriguing enough as the novel begins, gradually revealing the story of an amnesiac/schizophrenic patient being admitted to a psych ward, who turns out to be a professor at Cambridge.  Immediately, the reader is thrown into 50 pages or so of stream of conciousness ramblings that were quite frankly difficult to trudge through.  This put a bad taste in my mouth, possibly tainting the rest of the book for me.  The remainder really wasn't terribly interesting; I found Lessing's writing style to be excruciatingly boring and lacking any sort of insight.  Other reviews of this book tend to fall to the extremes of loving it or hating it; I guess that means I hated it.  So maybe I just didn't "get" it...personally, I don't think there was anything to "get".  
 Goldwater's disastorous 1964 Presidential campaign is the vehicle for telling the book's real story: the rise of the ultra-conservative movement in American politics in the sixties. It is undoubtedly an important story, and one that Perlstein has researched considerably. However, Perlstein's work is undone not by his findings, or his damaging portrayal of the burgeoning right-wing movement -- I concur with him on these points -- but by very lazy presentation. Perlstein has obvioulsy drunk deep at the David Halberstam well. He can rattle off an anecdote, but he is dreadfully prolix. The book is at least two hundred pages too long. No reader opening a book on sixties politics needs an eight-hundred word summary of Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove. Perlstein has also made a mess in organising his material; he leaps back and forth, from person to person, without ever stitching the requisite parts together. One moment Henry Cabot Lodge looks to be the certain favourite for the 1964 Republican nomination, and we are treated to fifteen pages on the organisation of his campaign; later we are told, almost as an aside, that he has withdrawn from the race, and Perlstein never explains why. Sam Tannehaus's 'Whittaker Chambers' is a much more assured analysis of the growth of anti-communist hysteria in the fifties and sixites, and is considerably shorter and better crafted than Perlstein's book. A more thorough editor and an author more intent on telling the story carefully and well would have made 'Before the Storm' a much better book than it is 
 As someone learning to play drums and interested in African rhythms, I must say that this book was quite a let down. It offers very little useful information on drumming itself, and the ideas it does offer (the 12  principles) are expressed in uninteresting ways, lacking in subtlety. If  you're interested in a book that offers insight into the meaning of African  drumming, avoid this book and look to John Chernoff's African Rhythm and  African Sensibility 
 This is the worst book I've ever read on racing tactics. If you're a beginner racer, you can develop an understanding of the entire contents of this book just by doing a few road bike races. While I was reading this book, I was really surprised to read that the author has never experienced a cross wind on his bike while training or racing. Apparently he never raced in northern California.  
 This book is written by an annoying, weak man.  The formal innovations are vaguley interesting, but in any case do not rescue the work from its primary deficit: you must sit there for several hours with the voice of a neurotic chatty little wimp who reminds one of a certain kind of homosexual man streaming through your mind, mostly in the form of digressions and non-sequitors.  This is neither entertaining nor enlightening, and since it's the product of design it is actually a little infuriating.  I too listen with good faith to the academic hierarchy present and past for recommendations, and I had in my version the hitherto utterly reliable Frank Kermode as Introducer; but damn, this book - its characters, its plots, its language, its taxing convolusions - is just annoying.  Its only virtue is that reading it might raise awareness that vaguely condescending moralistic little works like this about unheroic, petty, neurotic, sordid, idle, superficially cosmopolitan people are a mistake to begin with, and - since we all have only 70 or 80 years on earth and aren't all compulsive aesthetes - time would be better spent elsewhere.  There is nothing of the hard Sophoclean light here 
 West is without a doubt a superb writer, however I found The Shoes of The Fisherman to be a great dissapointment.  In spite of the fact that most of the reviews I have read higly praise the book, it never really got to me.  The concept seems quite interesting at first:  an unknown russian, cardinal Kiril Lakota is elected pope.  After being held prisioner for quite a few years, he steps up to lead millions of people around the globe in a new world which he basically has knowledge of only from his years in captivity.  At the same time, Kamanev, the man who had been Lakota's prision guard in Russia, and who tortured him beyond belief, has become the head of the russian government.  The fact that both men now need each other provides for a very interesting plot, which in my opinion is never fully developed.  The main issue I have with the novel is that it is plotless...nothing really happens.  A large portion of the book consists of  a series of endless, and a bit boring, thoughts  from Lakota.  On the other hand, the reader is exposed to the way the catholic church funtions and thinks, which is an interesting way to humanize religion in he eyes of the reader.  There are also a series of sub-plots dealing with what Lakota has to face as a pope, regading human cruelty, poverty, and most of all politics, which could have proven to be enough for a good novel.  Unfortunatelly, the narration goes astray in many parts, which lessens one's interest in the book. Quite frankly, I had to make a great effort to finish the book, hoping that at some time it would pick up, which it never did.  As I mentioned before, West is a very good writer, but this book is in my opinion, highly overrated.  I can honestly say it never got my full atention. 
 WARNING! Do not waste your money or your time.  Sandra Bullock is not in this movie enough to warrent the packaging headling her as the star. [...]  The sound quality is really bad, as well as the lighting and if they used a script that too.  Run from this movie 
 The author spends the entire introduction claiming how Muay Thai is the most effective self defense martial art out there.  But in doing so, he turns a condescending attitude towards every other martial art.  He says that Hollywood makes 120 pound women believe that they can defend themselves with "windmill" punches.  Yet the author, himself, is the one who succumbs to the myths surrounding other martial arts.  So he believes other martial arts like Tae Kwon Do and Karate are useless because all they teach is flashy movie moves.  But this only goes to show that the author has absolutely no idea what the other arts teach authentically.  TKD and Karate do not emphasize 720 degree jump spinning monkey kicks to protect oneself.  In fact, the first thing you learn in a TKD or Karate school is to punch and to defend yourself against a punch.  Just because all these Hollywood and Hong Kong movies utilise flashy moves does not mean that other martial arts teach that this is the way to defend yourself in a real fight.    Kickboxing has its limitations just like any other art.  If you get grabbed and thrown by a judoka, what are you going to do?  Does kickboxing teach you how to fight from the ground?  If you're a Brazilian jiu-jitsu artist and you get into a fight with more than one opponent, what are you going to do?  Slap on a submission hold while a guy comes up from behind you and stabs you?  Instead of proclaiming that he and his style of fighting is the best, the author should really think about what he's saying.  Style bashing (as it is commonly known in the martial arts circles) only shows ignorance.  I haven't seen this author defend himself in a street fight or fight in a no holds barred tournament.  But I have seen Tae Kwon Do and Karate guys defend themselves perfectly in a real life street fight against multiple opponents and in one on one situations.  And there was a K1 (Kickboxing) competition in which Muay Thai fighters fought against Kyokushin Karate opponents.  Guess who won?  That's right, Karate.  And these are gripes I have just about the Introduction!  The rest of the book was pretty useless.  He says that the book is about conditioning and techniques.  The conditioning section only consists of pictures of a guy lifting weights.    ...all I can say is that it was completely useless.  No effort to tell how much weight to use, how many sets, how many reps, and workout schedules?  I know how to lift a dumbbell and do a bench press.  I don't need this guy's book to show me a picture of it.  And the techniques section was very basic.  If you have even seen a kickboxing competition, you will probably learn more from just watching it than from the useless (!@$&) this guy shows.    This book is a definite waste of money written by an egotistical ignoramus who wants to sound like he is the best fighter in the world and knows everything about fighting.  Yet he can't even put together a simple book on anything useful about kickboxing.  Don't buy unless you really want to waste your money.  There are much better books on Muay Thai on Amazon.  Actually, any other book on Mauy Thai on Amazon is better than this one.    I was duped into buying this based on all the other favorable reviews on Amazon.  But now I know that they must have been left by the author or his friends.  Or by people who have never trained seriously in Muay Thai or any other martial art.  A much better book is Complete Kickboxing by Martina Sprague and Keith Linvingston 
 "Leaving Reality Behind.." is a myopic and biased account of a subject that just isn't that interesting.  Unless you were one of the eToys.com employees or one of the 'cutting-edge European artists' of etoy, the 'Toywar' was quite simply a non-event for the rest of the planet.  In essence, the authors (who clearly are sided and likely involved with the etoy camp) are trying to dress up a relatively trivial legal dispute over a domain name that is now about three years old.  Why is this interesting??  Throw another 'yet-another-dotcom-story' on the pile 
 This is a very hard book to get through. Mainly, b/c there is so much name dropping and venting about being a divorceï¿½, "wife of".  It's also hard to read through the constant pity party that she throws for herself every ten pages or so. I frankly, don't want to read about a 40-something yr old who is completely insecure with herself in every aspect of her life. Not to mention it sounds like her young daughter gets the brunt of it.  The rants are too long, there is really no need for this book to be in print. It was a waste of a tree. 
 This is without a doubt the worst piece of social science ever produced. Regardless of where you stand politically, Johnson is guilty of revisionist history to the worst degree. Throughout this work Johnson displays a truly and utterly amazing ignorance of geopolitical realities. 
 Although this catalogue is stunning in its photography, graphics and presentation, I was surprised and dismayed by its content. If the article in Chapter 6 entitled "Stumbles and Pitfalls in the Search of Viking  America" is an example of the level of scholarly rigor, the authors  have stumbled painfully with misrepresentations, unsubstantiated innuendos,  blatant contradictions and a stream of factual errors. The pitfall, it  seems, is an agenda established by the editors to discount the slightest  consideration of evidence of any kind for Norse contact south of the  Canadian boarder, reinforced by gratuitous remarks throughout the catalogue  (we wonder by whom) denigrating pre-contact research. In all, this  publication is an embarrassment to standards of American scholarship and a  perverse use of taxpayers' money. The Smithsonian should be ashamed of  itself!  Suzanne Carlson, Edgecomb, Main 
 As a previous reviewer stated, there are plenty of other good bios of Houdini. This one is full of psychobabble and reads like character assassination. All heroes have feet of clay, but her analysis is repetitive and makes the second half of the book deathly boring 
 What is the fun in reading about 3 very inmature and stereotyped  characters?  The book starts as "Sex and the cityï¿½" at a yacht in the Mediterranean. The difference is that the main characters are male. Quiet entertaining in the first 20 pages. After that you can skip to the last chapters and  these succesful "teenagers" with the bodies and money of adults found the women that will change their lives for ever. Ha! And of all them will find true love at the same time! Ha! Botttom line: bad novel from a very commercial writer  
 It was really short and I was so Excited to get it  from my book order but I was so dissapointed when I read it, it was way to short and still wasn't that good. 
 Uhh....am I missing something here or what?  The person who is the Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce was BORN in 1998!!!  Last time I checked, that is how reincarnation works!  That's what is meant by "will enter in '98".  No other logical reasoning exists.  If this guy is arguing that since he realized who he was in 1998 that that must mean he is the incarnation of Cayce sounds more like him trying to fit a square peg in a round hole and trying to convince the reader he really is the circular peg, just with added corners!!   Gimme a Break!   I'm a major believer in Edgar Cayce and what his readings contained and am very much read on the subject(s) and this book and author are a belittling insult to the metaphysical philosophy found within the readings.  And for the other reviewers who found the structural philosophy of the book interesting there are many more out there that do a much better job introducing you to the edgar cayce story and material than this one.  A few that are off the top of my head includes "Our Origin and Destiny", "There is a River",  "Many Mansions", "The Story of the Soul" and "Edgar Cayce on Reincarnation" just to name a few of many, many good books about All this Without an ego-trip from the author.   You Know, I could claim the same thing and be just as convincing about being Cayce than this guy.  But, Oh wait! I forgot! I'm NOT SEVEN years old now am I?  Unfortunately, we will all have to wait around twenty years or longer for the genuine article to be old enough to have a chance to write the NON-Fiction version of this book idea!  Any first grade teachers out there with a unique child in their class this year?  Makes ya think doesn't it?  There are much better books out there on this subject.  Just type in "Edgar Cayce" in the amazon search bar and find a real book on the subject 
 I never bought GQ back in my 20s because for one thing, I never thought of myself as a clothes-horse.  Also, I actually took the G in GQ to mean that it was actually for Gentlemen, ie, sipping Champagne on a Yacht pass me the the Caviar type Gentlemen.  Well, after now having reached a "certain age" I find myself going back and forth between Esquire and GQ and find that in many cases, neither are exactly right for me.  However, I think I've bought my last episode of GQ.  The 2006 "interview" with Will Ferrel was interesting for the first three paragraphs, and then it became an excercise in self referentialism, disguised as an attempt at wit.   Also, the Politics of the magazine are unabashedly anti-Bush Administration, which would be OK except for the fact that I'm not reading GQ for Political content.  There are plenty of magazines out there make this their specialty, and when I find it in GQ, its just tiresome.  Frequently, swipes at Bush and his policies just come out of nowhere in an article, as if the Editor decided that a jab at Bush and his policies might help the piece, regardless of its content.  Not to mention - does anyone actually wear the clothing they put on display?  $800 tennis shoes?  I fear that I will be an Esquire reader - I can't bear to become a "Men's Best Life" subscriber just yet 
 The book was poor but had a lot of good photo of stevie nicks, I have walked with stevie on her long road of life for meany year now, 20 and counting. If you are looking to find yourself for who you are look to  stevie nicks. PELA STEVIE ALWAYS BE TRUE TO YOURSELF 
 I read them all.  Grishim, Turrow, etc.  Kermit has a good understanding of the legal process, as he should.  There is so much legaleze, the characters go undeveloped.  The plot is thin and never really grabs you. Some of the sub plots are so trivial, they go nowhere.    Kermit, you have the talent.  Now that you have written your book that first year law students could learn from, go write the next one for the rest of us 
 This product looks much better in the picture than in person.  The brush looks very full in the picture but actually very sparce in person.  Bristles already started falling out before I even used it.  It comes unwrapped just thrown in a plastic bag for shipping 
 New York criminalist, Lincoln Rhyme, is in North Carolina to undergo surgery which he hopes will improve his quadriplegia.  A sheriff from the small town of Tanners Corner asks for his help.  A teenaged boy has been murdered and two young women kidnapped by a youth known as Insect Boy.  Rhyme, along with his protagee' and soul mate Amelia Sachs and his aide Thom, agree to help.  This is the first book by Deaver I've read and, while I am hoping it was just a bad choice,  I'm not certain I'll read another.  I really struggled to get through it.  I had no history of the principal characters and none was given.  In fact, all the characters were one dimensional, there were two many of them and stereotypes ran rampant.  I like a good twist or two in a story but this became laughable.  And let's not even talk about the ending!   I did feel Deaver did a very good job conveying the problems and frustrations of a quadriplegic, but that was the only redeeming feature.  As for the plot, the title says it all.  This rated zero on the believability scale.   
 Don't waste your money on this book! It does have a few useful bits of  info but if you think you could build a gun using this book, think again.  The black and white photos were so over exposed that you can't make out any  detail, the drawings were so faint that half of them couldn't be seen and  nearly all of them didn't have any dimensions.I'd suggest Gerard Metrals  book "A Do-it Yourself Submachine Gun" if you have access to  machining equipment.It's packed full of prints.Also try Bill Holmes later  volumes 3, 4, and 5. He did a much better job on those 
 Kellerman's last few books have been forgettable to say the least and I hoped that this would display the quality of his early writing.  While it was not a total waste of time, it came close.  Far too much print was devoted to the half-hearted team meetings of people in mud colored clothing as they outlined ever more convoluted theories as to who had done what to and with whom.  This  is yet another book that lacks credibility or suspense.  
 THIS BOOK WAS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME,IT HAD HARDLY ANY INFO,ALTHOUGH IT DID A GOOD PICTURES THEY WERE IN BLACK AND WHITE,I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE 
 This terrible movie has singing!  Bad singing, and lots of it!  Overacted, trite, and BORING!  All those good reviews, I thought it would be campy and cool, but it's NOT!  
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 (disclaimer: I am NOT big, I am actually quite trim but I'd like to keep it that way and therefore I use home workout tapes in between gym sessions.)  After you get through a solid 12 minutes of spam, clips, and advertising, you are finally presented with a sloppily thrown together, uncoordinated poor excuse for Pilates. Beginners (which I am not) would be lost altogether as the instructor doesn't demonstrate her steps. The mat work is marginally better but not enough for me to ever touch it again. Therefore, this tape and the other ones I also bought from this series in the same purchase, are going in the "Goodwill" bag.   
 My wife and I have now spent a good month "learning" with this book. In fact more than 10 minutes a day,  more like 30 minutes per session. We both speak other languages, so we can compare.  GOOD, nice thematic picture groups,  and you need to learn the words associated with them.  (We did.)  BAD, again, and again Ms. Kershul introduces words,  and grammar which do not fit into the "just mastered"  scheme of things.  IRRITATING to the extreme: Ms. Kershul gives her instructions in a mixture of English  and Italian in one sentence.  (We would have preferred one line of Italian ONLY,  followed by one line --say in italics--  providing the English translation, in many cases preferably, with an explanations "how this compares to what was done yesterday".)  BAD: In attempt to NOT introduce grammar, you are left high  and dry figuring out gender, declinations, and worse conjugations by yourself.  (We have not yet seen satisfactory forms summarizing 'things',  and we are half way through the book).  In anger, we finally went to the local library  and got a 70 years old Italian grammar for High Schools.  That did solve our problem and left us convinced that "new and improved" does not necessarily  provide a better learning experience.  Somewhat IRRITATING:  Ms Kershuls's choice of vocabulary seems to assume that 1. you wish to visit lots of relatives  (not an uncle, niece, grandson, cousin, grandparent, or daughter  is forgotten in the family tree),  2. you wish to order meals and "buy stuff" constantly (we assure you, that is the one thing Italians are very good at, understanding English when you want to  buy things or order a meal)  3. you wish to tell Italians that you are "American"  (as if our accents and clothing are not dead-give-aways)  4. you pray "catholic", "protestant", or "Hebrew".  (the Italians we know couldn't care less -- how about instead "politics", "music", "movies", "soccer"  and the "bella ragazza" over there)  In summary, we are ready now to look for a book which does not claim to be "easy, in 10 minutes a day",  but emphasizes grammar,  groups vocabulary (and discusses alternatives for each new word),   provides clearer indication of emphasis in the pronounciation (example: telEfono, versus incorrect tElefono) Teaches Italian as a language of "constructed" full sentences, rather than "single catch words". ------------------  Our final test,  No, we would not recommend this book to a friend 
    Since I do a lot of driving, I bought this as an audio book to hopefully ease the pain of sitting in traffic. This book is more irritating than traffic jams.          The heroine in the book, if you can call her that, was not at all likable. She was arrogant and in my opinion, her arrogance made her foolish. For example, when a police detective she was working with telephoned her on her cell and asked her where she was she responded with a smart remark rather than tell him where she was. Why? Simply because she did not personally like him.  Moments later she was knocked out and taken captive. Later when she woke up she bemoaned the fact that no one knew where she was. Dumb! And this is only one example of her stupidity. Ironically, earlier in the book she referred to this police detective and his partner as tweedle-dee and tweedle-dum. Later, this same policeman saved her life, but she still was unappreciative and belittled him even when it was pointed out to her that the man saved her life.       The "heroine" also had a Canadian boyfriend who pretended he was a cowboy throughout the entire book. I thought maybe the author had just seen "Pillow Talk" with Rock Hudson pretending to be Rex Stetson while she was writing this book. It was bad.       The "heroine" had been separated from her husband for years but failed to obtain a divorce. She seems to have a hard time taking care of unfinished business and she constantly complains about everything.      The author bores the reader with long, drawn out descriptions to the point the reader or listener is screaming, "Okay, I get it! It's hot outside!" If that weren't bad enough, readers or listeners of this book are subjected to lectures on how we evolved from apes and endangered turtles. If I wanted to read about endangered turtles I would go to the non-fiction section. To add insult to injury, the big mystery in the book, the disappearance of an entire family, turned out to be a complete non-mystery.       I was determined to listen to the whole thing but finally, on the last half of the tape, after enduring another political lecture, I could take it no more. I took the tape out and threw the entire thing in the trash.          I have read thousands of books and I've listened to probably more than 60 audio books.  This was the absolute worse of the lot.  If you want to read or listen to a good forensic mystery, stick with Patricia Cornwell and her Dr. Kay Scarpetta series. Cornwell's books are worth reading!  
 While I loved the first two of Doss' "Shaman" series, this one was a big disappointment. The author seemed more infatuated with his hero, Charlie Moon, whom he presents as a sort of Native American Jimmy Stewart, than interested in constructing an efficient plot. There are an endless number of jokes about "the big Ute's" voracious appetite for fried foods, his impressive masculine physique, and his total bafflement over the behavior of the opposite sex. In fact, Doss' depiction of women was one of the most irritating things about this book: They all (with the exception of Daisy, the shaman) seem to belong more in a comic book than in a novel for grown-ups. Every last one of them has "tiny, delicate hands," "a small foot," "crimson nails," and has no thought in her head other than how to land Charlie Moon (why they would want to is the only mystery in the book). I had been very impressed with Doss' handling of the mystical in his previous novels, but this one is so choked with cliches that I quit two thirds of the way through. And the shaman of the title, a vibrant character, gets little attention in this one. So if you want a well-paced mystery with touches of poetry in the writing and well-developed characters, go to Tony Hillerman 
 the beginning of this book was excellent, but dont be fooled, the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book.  the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers. what's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were.  this was one of the worst books i have ever read, i'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery. dont waste your time reading it 
 So, poor Brooke Shields felt unhappy? So what? Is she unaware of the billions of people on this planet who live desparate lives of real poverty, who watch their children die of preventable diseases or starvation? Is she unaware of all the babies who die from malnutrition and malaria every year? And all she can do is sit in her mansion and feel sorry for herself. Of all the times in one's life, the time you are needed most is when you are a mother who has just had a baby, yet still she couldn't feel her own baby's love for her. How pathetic. I think she'd have soon changed her tune had she been marooned on a desert island after a plane crash, and she realised she could die any moment. People get 'depressed' because they spend too much time thinking, and thinking about THEMSELVES. Don't these pathetic people have anything better to do with their lives? Think of all the suffering she could prevent if she used her fame and money to do so.  She should read "Stop thinking and start living" 
 Love research on folklore. And compilations of myth or legend. But this struck me as the 'ultra-lite' version. This book is not outstanding or special in any way. Suggest readers (whether child or adult) get this from the library before they decide to spend any money for their own copy. Glad I did. There are plenty of other mermaid books that contain stunning art and text.   
 I have read and enjoyed James Patterson in the past, but can honestly say that this will be the last Patterson book I will read.  I was truly disappointed in the lack of storytelling and writing ability.  The book had no depth, and the story suffered for it.  As I read the book I got the impression that Mr. Patterson was simply trying to crank out a book as quickly as possible, and could not be bothered with such things as descriptive detail or creative plotting.  I did not find the characters or their behavior to be believable.  
 The Covert-One series, written by a variety of authors, unfortunately does not live up to Ludlum's standards. Since Paris Option was my first of the series, it was bearable, but all other Covert-Ones are very similar to each other. If you've read any one book from this series, I would suggest you stay away from the rest.  The suspense is decent, but the climax is very predictable and it all works out somehow in the end, without a well-thought out approach to the finale. Covert-Ones start with a variety of events occuring simultaneously, events that in the beginning don't really seem to have a bearing on the other. In the middle of the book somewhere, it all comes together leading to a high-testoterone (but somewhat unbelievable) climax 
 Ok, i was going to go to the Warped tour, but i decided against it.  Warped Tour has become too commercial, jamming together mostly emo and screamo bands for their shows.  Since when are emo bands punk?  It's just loud, whiny pop music to me.  One day, emo will die and maybe the promoters just might book some real good bands for the show.  Until then, this is what we have to put up with.  However, major kudos for Big D and the Kids Table, i love them, they're an amazing ska band, and if you're reading this you should check them out.  There are few good bands on this cd really though 
 cable won't fit  Power supply cable covers other connectors  mouse does not not work  includes flash update cable but web site has no flash images  If you don't plug a keyboard into it sits there and just beeps  What idiot designed this trash.  
 I remember reading "The Chamber" distinctly. Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns. The characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out 
 Yancey's problem is that he follows fads.  It's like in the movie, Good Will Hunting.  Most of the people studying an issue will follow the latest fad.  That's what Yancey does.  The title, "The Bible That Jesus Read", insults Jesus Christ, who is God -- the Second Person in the Holy Trinity.  The Old Testament and the New Testament clearly teach the Holy Trinity.  Gospel of John chpater 1 shows all Three Persons of the Holy Triity operating.  It is because people like Yancey has taken the helm of Christianity -- he is the editor of Christianity Today -- that America's Christianity is in grave trouble.  Ordaining homosexuals?  What do you think about that Yancey?  Is that a part of the "Bible that Jesus Read"?  Ridiculous! 
 I bought this stereo because of its relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had aux inputs for me to hook up my mp3 player to it.    The first unit I received would not turn on at all.  I contacted Philips' tech support, and their solution was for me to send the brand new defective stereo back to them at my expense.  Fortunately, Amazon has a very nice return policy, and I sent it back to them instead.  Amazon was also very nice in sending a replacement right away without waiting until they received the defective unit.  The replacement stereo arrived in short order, and I was immediately disappointed in the sound quality, which didn't seem as good as the 15 year old cassette player boombox that I was replacing.  After listening to the stereo for a few days and comparing it to a Sony CMT-NE3 bookshelf stereo that I own, here are my thoughts.  1. The FM reception is not as good as the CMT-NE3.  Both units have a thin wire type of antenna, and both wires are about the same length.  The Philips stereo, however, would hiss and crackle as I moved around the room - my body interfered with the reception.  This did not happen with the Sony stereo.  2. The sound quality is not as good as the CMT-NE3.  Playing the same song side-by-side on the two stereos, I found that the Philips stereo had a flat, tinny sound when compared to the CMT-NE3.  The Sony system had a much fuller and richer sound quality.  Also, there seemed to be significant distortion in the high-frequencies on the Philips stereo, making "S" sounds sound more like "H" sounds.  I also noticed an occasional crackle of distortion in the overall sound, possibly due to a bad connector on the aux input.  3. The ergonomics of the Philips stereo are not so good.  For one thing, the stereo will easily tip over forwards if accidentally bumped.  If that happens, the CD can get wedged in the CD tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove.  The electronically actuated CD door is much more likely to break than a passive mechanical door like the top-loading CMT-NE3.  The volume goes up to 31 or so, but 5 is about as loud as you would need it for regular listening.  This means that there are only 4 quieter volume levels, which is rather limiting.  Finally, the stereo is a bit bigger than I was expecting (though I could have looked more closely at the specs when buying it).  I am in the process of returning this stereo, and I will try to find a Sony system instead.  Unfortunately, Amazon no longer sells the CMT-NE3, which I bought just about a year ago.  I don't understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churn their product lines so rapidly.  Is there really that much innovation in bookshelf stereos?  The only difference between the Sony I bought last year and one I bought in 1989 is the ability to play MP3 CDs.  
 I bought this dryer to replace my 10 year old conair, when it gets hot it would stop.  Good thing I didn't throw it away. This cordkeeper only worked for about 4 months.  It is also very LOUD! ALmost hurt my ears to use i 
 This was a gift at a party.  The idea was that the entire family could play the home version of this fun television show.  Not!  There were so many rules that it took the fun out of it and was the complete opposite of the simplicity of the tv version.  This is a box that will sit in the closet unused for years until it makes it's way to the trash 
   I really thought this book had promise.  I liked the character of Edward in Hamilton's previous books, but "Obsidian Butterfly" made him look like a wimp! Giving the guy a "family" and a "personal life" after having him spend years as a cold and calculating hitman was so not the right thing to do.  Why didn't Hamilton have Anita fall in love with him, too?  After all, she's got lovers from a variety of different species! I couldn't even finish this book; it was so disappointing.    Another serious problem I have with the Anita Blake series is the lack of vampire hunting, as listed on the front of each novel: An Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter Novel.  It's quite the misnomer these days.  I wish Hamilton had stuck with Jean Claude (my favorite character) and created more scenarios around him and other vampires.  I probably will not by any more of her books unless they feature Jean Claude and/or actual vampire hunting 
 I normally like Shannon Drake.  But....what on earth was she thinking?  If you enjoy to read about rape -- not once, not twice, but, throughout the ENTIRE book.  Then this book is for you.  I found myself skipping pages due to the VERY overbearing historical facts! 
 I gave it one star, because there's only one star on the CD I care to hear, and that's Ms. Jane. Hey Jane baby! Make a CD, I'll buy it! ; 
 The Virgin Suicides starring Kristen Dunst, Josh Hartnett, Kathleen Turner and James Woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline. This film is directed by Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), I really tried to like this movie but I was fooling myself, you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the Coppola legacy but just because your father is Frances Ford Coppola doesn't mean you belong in the same category as best director of all-time. Sometimes magic does not stirke twice. How can all five sisters end up killing themselves, their homelife wasn't that unbearable, a lot of parents are religious, but that doesn't mean you'll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide. Kristen Dunst just gets on my nerves, her acting is the same in every film. Don't believe the hype, The Virgin Suicides is not a groundbreaking, poetic film 
 I just saw the end of JAWS: THE REVENGE again on latenight cable TV--where it belongs--and I'm still stunned by the incredible lameness of every aspect of this movie.  For everyone who quibbles about the unlikelihood of finding a Great White in the warm waters of the Bahamas: this shark also roars.  Like a lion or something.  A roaring shark.  You read that right.  The filmmakers also keep cutting shots from the original JAWS into the climax.  As a reminder that there was actually a good film at one time here?  A distraction from how horrible this one is?  They paid Michael Caine enough to be in this stink bomb--but obviously not enough to wear a wet shirt after climbing out of the ocean.  His expressions often convey that he's there but you're lucky he's at least facing the camera. Was there something better he could have been doing?  Yes.  Picking up his first Oscar for HANNAH AND HER SISTERS.  But he missed the Oscars to be in JAWS: THE REVENGE.  At least he went on national TV to admit that he did this movie because he had a home right there in the Bahamas (he even pointed at the house during the interview).  The demise of the roaring shark is a baffling, badly-edited violation of all of our natural laws and logic.  Shark rises out of the water.  Boat rams shark.  Shark explodes.  Boat explodes.  Everyone survives, even the annoying Jamaican who got chewed up several minutes before.  Roll footage clearly the same of the blown-up shark sinking from the original. Wow.  It's that bad.  The tag line for this movie was "This time it's personal." They were right. That studio's really got it in for us 
 DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION of SETTING SONS!  One star for this CD version.  Five stars for the music.   There is another version of Setting Sons on Amazon for $6 more but you get the bands best single (Strange Town) which was not released on the vinyl LP, PLUS the bands other single only release between All Mod Cons and Setting Sons (When You're Young), PLUS several other B-sides and single only versions of other songs.  If you are trying to aquire all the Jam LPs on CD, you will miss those songs unless you own them on a compilation compact disc.  Don't make the mistake I did.  Good luck and happy listening 
 The only real value in this book is that you can return it and get your money back. There seems to be a pattern here. If Robert Allen is involved in a book or business deal, run the other way. The man just doesn't get that people hate to be scammed. He's a master at making money at the expense of others. If you want to learn how to cheat people, this is a great book. Funny, they mention a higher power. They had better pray for forgiveness 
 I got in on this deal for a great price, but when i put 90 cd's in, I couldn't even come close to closing the case, now I have to transfer them all back to the other case!!! 
 I should have read the other review more closely. This is a good blanket for HOT summer nights! I believe it is too light for cold winter nights. I expected more for over $50. If I didn't return it it would have made a nice decorative throw! The color and texture are nice 
 Bread8, that's one of the stupidest comments I've ever read.  You don't know s*** about metal.  You can't handle the intensity of real metal because you're a fat virgin who'd cry to your mommy if you heard godly metal songs like "Immortal Rites" and "Pleasure to Kill."  Leave the metal to the metalheads you mallcore f@ggot.  Anyway, "Dysfunction is better than Staind's other stuff, but only by a microscopic margin.  Aaron Lewis is a weak, talentless crybaby whose bandmates couldn't make a good song to save their lives.  Every song on here is full of bogus "pain" and "depression" coupled with abyssmal musicianship just like every other nu-metal band.  If you want heavy music that's accessible for the masses, go for Rage Against the Machine (except for "Evil Empire"), Faith No More, Helmet, Living Colour, and Quicksand. 
 The problem I have with everything about the Purpose-Driven Church ("PDC") model is that it is predicated on one fact to justify why it is "better" or "more effective" than any other model--NUMBERS.  Having gone to a PDC, I find it disturbing that everything is reduced down to something is watered-down and stupefied for the masses.  Even things such as accepting Christ into your heart end up being something that you end up checking off on an impersonal card.  Everything has a different term that is watered-down enough to make it palatable to the masses.  The PDC produces a generation of "believers" who don't know what they believe, because their Biblical knowledge is supplanted by other Christian self-help books.  The idea that the Sunday service is the focal point and that having a multimedia spectacle somehow will draw more believers is crazy.  In the end, I think that you could apply everything you read in the PDC here to any part of your life.  It's just purely incidental that they are using Jesus as the subject matter here 
 The Ying Yang Twins are so bad that it is not even funny. Now if they had talent then I could buy this CD, but that is not the case.. 
 I have never returned a book to a bookstore until I purchased this one. I truly hope Lauren is experiencing health and happiness but this was one of the most boring reads upon which I have ever embarked 
 i had to read this for a high school bio paper and i must say this book was extrmely boring. There were a few cook books to chose from and i must say this "looked" intresting. There is no suspence what so ever. If there was no bio weapons in the plot it would be a book about a doctors boring day job who likes a co worker, and gets aroung to playing "B-ball". The only aspect about the book that was the best was the un-predictable ending that i definatly didnt see comming. Other than that do your self a favor and dont read this book, because you will just be waisting your time. 
 I encourage many to stay away from this usb product; like previous reviewers said, just spend the extra money on a better usb dongle. As soon as i got this thing out of its package, i almost snapped the casing off due to its poor construction.   The main problem that i have experienced with this product is that although its range is ok(not the 100 meters that it claims), as soon as i go into a room thats only 10 feet away, has doors or walls in the way, the reception starts to fluctuate in and out every 2 minutes. 
 The author divides the books into sections by elements--good enough for organization of material.  She provides lists of correspondences.  Fine, could be useful.  What it does not do is provide any real information.  We get a lot of watered-down fantasy novel-style "vision quests" or "seekings," encounters the author alleges to have experienced.  These "experiences" form the bulk (and I do mean bulk) of the book.  Apparently, one is supposed to envision one's self in the author's role.  There is no explanation given for the structure of these pathworkings (the kindest thing I can call them), which are interspersed with commentary about the author's "Native American family."  (She claims to have been adopted into a Native American clan.)  She makes many references to possible Native American teachings, but offers no source material, how to seek out further information about topics she urges readers to explore more fully.  The terminology she uses is just authentic-enough to sound legitimate, but so vague they reveal nothing.  (An example:  the examination of a crystal the author has on a staff.  A tribal elder who is apparently one of her teachers examines it and gravely announces it used to be a Grandfather crystal.  So what, exactly, is a Grandfather crystal, and why is it mounted in a Wiccan-style staff?  With runes, no less.)  Even more suspiciously, many of her "Native American teachings" sound like something out of a Hollywood script than anything one might imagine being part of an actual oral tribal tradition, passed down from shaman to student.  Lastly, there are pages and pages of meaningless diagrams and a list of colored "rays" that will bring all kinds of good things into one's life if one meditates on them.  The entire book reads like a Wiccan primer with a glaze of pseudo-Native American spirituality as seen by Caucasians.  I have read other books on shamanism, and many stress their adoptive connections to the parent culture.  (A good experience for them if it actually happened, but one can hardly expect readersto stampede over and demand adoption.)  And yet this information, supposedly kept within these families and tribes for centuries, is now being set out in print for the mass consumption of the reading public.  Well, what was the point of being 'adopted'?  If these 'adoptive families' wanted this information public, wouldn't they have written a book themselves?  Some of the more honest books on shamanism admit they are witholding certain information because some knowledge *should* be kept 'in the family'.  They openly say they are creating something for use by people living in the modern age.  Wolfe has done none of this. Waste of time to read.  Waste of space on my bookshelf.  Waste of trees to print it.  Waste of *plastic* for the bag I carried it home in.  I'd be embarrassed to even turn this thing to a used bookstore for credit. 
 I'm not sure what I expected, but I found this CD to be a huge disappointment.  Sizzla is an acquired taste, and I haven't acquired the taste buds yet.  
 Have you ever desperately wanted a book to end but hated leaving it unfinished?  That's the way Sappho's Leap was for me. I finally finished it over the weekend and am still wishing I hadn't spent good money, even bad money, any money on it.  Admittedly, very little is known about the only ancient Greek female poet besides where she probably lived and a few snippets of her poetry. Her words are searing, lovely and sometimes erotic. But Erica Jong's novel fictionalizing her life was banal and boring and droll. Sappho, as her heroine is not only uninteresting, but has no single aspect of her personality that makes me like her. Sure, she experiences heartache and longing, but Jong simply fails to give me a reason to care.  Jong just tells me, flatly, in first person, how Sappho feels and what she thinks, but doesn't make it real for me. She tries to make Sappho into a female Odysseus and can't figure out if the novel should be a fantasy or a semi-believable historical account. And all that wrapped up with a very disappointing, Hollywood ending, tied it off into an unequivocal piece of garbage.  I can't believe Erica Jong has actually written and published eight novels.  It honestly seems like she wrote Sappho's Leap specifically to sell to high school English departments to teach a bit of Greek history with a feminist slant.  Regardless of whatever pocket genre she was trying to exploit, Sappho's Leap is utter tripe 
 Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..?  And talking about the end...could it be more simple?   Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else 
 No doubt the book boost a lot of pastry making ideas. I bought the book with the impression that there are pictures featured with the recipes, unforuntately NONE shown!!! I would prefer recipes with picture illustrations.  A BIG mistake to buy this book, the cover was nice, other than that, NOTHING. Never will buy a book without pictures in it. Not EVERYONE has a good vision to able to visualize how the end result will look like.  [...]  
 This is an okay read - nothing more, nothing less. The overall plot is very interesting and the story is well told up to a point. The real flaw though is the rushed, and in my opinion, corny, ending to this book. It really was substandard, straight-to-video, B-movie type of stuff (and yes, I am reviewing the book). I won't give too much away, but why at the very end would the chief baddie be the one to carry out 'the deed', and not one of his followers? And why was it the 'good' guy who tracked him down and stopped him carrying out 'the deed' - surely the police / FBI would have got him?   As with John Case's previous book, The Genesis Code, the initial plot will have you hooked, but as the story drags on it does become a little silly and rushed.   
 This is a great idea regarding how to brainwash children and young adults into joining brand name christian cults (read: memetic vampyres), in similar ways to how the Mormons (aka: mindless slave drones) have been doing it for years. So now we will soon have bible-thumpin' viral Baptist zombies, Catholic memebots, and drooling Methodist machines out beating the bushes for more hapless victims to infect into demonic Jesusfreakers. Joy.   Of course the funny part is that all the religions are jumping on the Meme wagon: Scientism, Scientology, Buddhism (has known it for a long time), Hinduism (which just eats christianity and poops out another Hindu avatar of Vishnu or Shiva), and now the christians are catching on. Xians have always been a little slow on most fronts (slow to forgive, slow to tolerate, slow to understand - but very quick to anger, rapid of hypocricy, lightening fast in respect to corruption, and swift indeed to resort to violence!).   Anyway, this is really nothing new. The brain death known as christianity has always been a viral organism - all religions, all ideologies and political movements, and all scientific paradigms are intrinisicly memetic in deep ways.  So, with that in mind I dearly love the idea of Heaven. I completely and vigorously hope that all christians, of all the various varieties of viruses thereof, go to Heaven - and stay there forever and ever. And why do I wish that so vehemently you might ask? Because that way all the christians will be quaranteened, and will then leave the rest of us thankfully alone! Anyway, the christian Heaven is my idea of hellishness personified. If, in some afterlife, anyone ever sees me in Heaven, then they will know beyond a shadow of the teeniest doubt that I am there because to me having to be around Jehova and his demonic son, Jesus the Vampyre, and their cattle-like glassy-eyed worshipers, is to me the worst punishment my rather amplified imagination can come up with.   Give me a trillion Hells, just don't send me to Heaven 
 Received the item with a small dent on top which I thought nothing of, shouldn't affect the performance I thought.  But when I plug everything in, the machine just makes a whirring noise, no water spraying, no movement of the dial.  After 15 optimistic minutes, I gave up.  Returning back for exchange.  Crossing my fingers for the next box 
 Those who describe this story as "cute" and Joon as "quirky" aren't paying attention. For me, this movie was a trip through hell with a final destination of insanity. The writers slickly throw just enough whitewash on top to let most people ignore the darkness. Yes, Depp is great, given what he has to work with, but overall I am very sorry that I was subjected to this horribly stupid, insensitive movie 
 Unlike some reviewers here, I haven't read the other (apparently better) books in this series. The larger premise--a special wing of the FBI staffed by psychics--completely hooked me, but this novel quickly devolved into standard genre schlock with all its weaknesses: "Characters" who interchangeably spout exposition, contrived romance, and so on.  Here's hoping other books in the series are more satisfying. 
 A friend assured me that Pillars of Creation was the only stinker in this series to date. He was wrong. This is - by far - the worst book I've read up to this point.  A trilogy's first book isn't always the best. You lay out the rules, and set up the conflict. That's the way it goes. But the fact of the matter is that setting up the rules - and the conflict - didn't need to stretch on for 600+ paperback pages. Man, what a tedious book this was; if Richard wasn't reiterating his frustration in monologue, he was beating the same old dead horse with various characters.  I have a bachelor's degree in philosophy, and hadn't really taken issue with Mr. Goodkind's thinking until this book. Zedd's ramblings regarding contradiction and faith are ridiculously juvenile, and Goodkind did a startlingly wonderful job of making a wise character turn in to a stupid fool.  Here's to hoping Phantom isn't this burdensome.   
 I received this coffeemaker for Christmas.  After two months of use, it quit working. I contacted Hamilton Beach and they sent me something to clean my coffeemaker.  It still did not work so I contacted Hamilton Beach again.  Now I have to cut off my appliance cord and send it back to them along with $6 to get a new cord.  Since it wasn't my fault, why should it cost me anything to get my coffeemaker restored.  Stay away from Hamilton Beach products 
 A little disappointing after reading Barnyard Dance, but a good rhythm none the less. I don't like the "ew" in reference to broccoli stew. I guess I'm for encouraging kids to eat their vegetables. Also, the small animals tell large animals to go do big guy things because they're too large. I don't like the implication there either (no, I'm not large) 
 This is a major disappointment as most of the beloved Carry On gang are missing. Sid James appears five times, Hattie Jacques only once and Kenneth Williams and Charles Hawtrey not at all. Laughs are scarce and it's easy to see why this series was short lived 
 What the heak is this crap, did Gavin Rossdale need to pay of some debts? How much time did he spend on the artwork cover? (Just paint on some horse?) There is absolutley nothing good about "Distort Yourself" its a total bore, nothing fresh, exciting, sounds like Gavin doing a bad cover of Soundgarden.  Gavin Rossdale and these guys out of Helmet have got nothing to say at all, its a wonder why they even bothered.  Why Gavin Rossdale just does'nt get of his arse and make a decent Bush record is beyond the fans I'm sure 
 The moment I saw the cover of this newly published book, I immediately went to the cash register and bought myself a copy. I mean, even the title sounds cool.."Raised By Wolves". Yet, when I began reading this book, I was wondering where all of this writing was going.   The author, Jerome Charyn, seems to have only a wide knowledge of vocabulary that makes it sound like he knows what he is talking about. And at the same time, I feel as if he writes on purpose only to confuse the reader with all this filmic and post-modernist gibble gabble that really, if you try to think about it, doesn't make too much sense.  I wanted a detailed story about Tarantino's life as a youth, how he became the person he is today. What influences he had, what things he did to mold him into a film director, etc. There were bits and pieces yes, but I feel as if there was too much confusion around his aimless commentary and analysis to make it worthwhile to read 
 This is the worst book in the world. After just finishing Jimmy's last book An Hour Before Daylight i could say that he needs to learn how to write, this book was so un iteresting that i almost burnt it while reading it. I suggest that if you own this book then burn it before finishing this report 
 I would just like to say that I am a proponent of 9-11 truth, and I have read many many books on the subject. I first heard of Icke while watching a episode of decoding the past on the history channel. I went to my library and ordered some of his books. I admit that he is very entertaining and funny. He also uses some good research and facts. The problem is that he is also psychotic, and he includes a lot of his bazaar, yet funny accusations in his work. The fact that he claims the entire British royal family are reptilians reminds me of the scene in "Fear in Loathing in Las Veges" when Thompson was on acid in the hotel lobby. There are many real journalist out there who are not as "out there" as Icke if you know what I am saying. To me this is a horrible place to learn of 9-11, since one might draw the conclusion that all 9-11 research is nuts. If I were you I would check out the books 9-11 Synthetic terror, and The New Pearl Harbor. On the other hand if you have already found the truth on 9-11 this is quite funny and entertaining. Icke always gets me to laugh at him. Some actually say that he is a double agent meant to discredit the truth. I haven't seen evidence of that, but he does distract people from the urgency, and legitimacy of our movement 
 I purchased this item a few weeks ago to mainly kill fly's. It seemed that this wasn't happening as there were fly's still around and no evidence of fly's being killed. At night there would be a lot of flying bugs getting zapped though the noise would make you jump every time. It scared my Labrador Retriever to the extent she would not go outside after dark. The final straw happened when a young squirrel laid dead underneath it with no marks on it at all, I could only figure that it had got zapped. I finally switched it off and hung-up some zip lock bags with water inside, now there are no fly's and no interference with the ecology of our garden 
 Very much a disappointment! Especially for those of you who were deticated fans to the Talking Heads throughout the late 70's and 80's. The first three tracks were okay, I guess or better yey I should say TOLERABLE. Tracks 4 through 10 on the other hand ERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!! Like fingernails on a black board and it's sad because those of you who could dance to classic hits such as "burning down the house" that listened to this album know there's nothing you can dance to, or really even upbeat for that matter. It was an unfortunately exhausted effort by who even by 1988 was a worn out band. Why do you think later by the following year maybe 1990 they broke up 
 I bought this book with big aspirations of another "Joy of Cooking" with a little upscale to it. While I must say the design of the book is fabulous (I am a graphic designer and truly love the cookbook's design), the recipes leave much to pine for. I don't like that most of the ingredients are nothing I normally keep in the house and I am not likely to use often enough to warrant purchasing them. I have yet to actually cook a meal from it for this reason and I have owned the book for over a year. I will stick to "Joy of Cooking" for it is much more of a tool in the kitchen. 
 Aside from the numerous typos - for an overpriced book they should proof read the darn thing - this is just another opinionated book from a guy who tells you what works for him. Which may or may not work for you.   With no Scientific basis, just his opinions through his own trial and error on his body, he has reached the conclusion to eat double the amounts of carbs to protein in what is a very vague and nutritional chapter in which he'll discredit the Glycemic index saying its only of value to Diabetics not bodybuilders. Furthermore he shuns any type of Cardio Work. Then just talks about this and that and doesn't get into any detail or give you a definitive plan neither for the excercises or the nutritional guide.   An extremely frustrating and vague book. You can get the same info from any bodybuilder in any gym probably with a few more contradictions as everyone wants to write their own book and give thier own opinions. No one can agree on anything. And this book is the same. In short Chris Aceto gives you a brief overview which you could find on the net. Not much help. And not much of a guide for anyone wanting to break into the sport just to get fit. And those who are already advanced which is really who this book is for, will already know this info or know what works for them.   There is an emphasis here on being big - so big you can barely wipe your arse without a spotter- and training for competitions. Although this book will never help you accomplish that either, unless you do as he suggests and walk around with a darn scale in your pocket to weigh anything that goes into your stomach first.  Nothing new in this book. Perhaps if it had a detailed guide of excercises, number of sets and reps to perform for each set of each split, then it would be worth something. And if he's going to talk about nutrition, how about giving a list of tasty recipes he uses to reach his protein and carb goals for the 6 meals a day - 7 days a week.   Diagrams have blurred out descriptions. He doesn't give you a routine to follow. Just overviews several excercises for each muscle group; several types of splits people use. But not a detailed list of excersises, sets and reps for each to perform to accomplish your goals.   Finally the last third of the book is PADDED with an unnecessary large amount - As thick as Chris's quads - of blank sheets for you to keep a track of Nutrition and Training routines ( all that was needed was one for you to photocopy) which you'll have to come up with yourself because he doesn't give you much of a plan for either. A rip off of a book in my honest opinion. THE ABS DIET BOOK and its recipe companion was a much better purchase although with a different goal. Losing fat.  Seems with more and more contradictions in this sport, you got to figure everything out for yourself, then when it works write a book like these guys do. This book should be found in the used book store for 99 cents. That's what the information is worth. I rate it 0 and will be selling it back. Has to be something better than this. 
 Looks great but don't get trusted, this is the worst killer shark film ever! The shark looks so fake and during all the movie he only killed like 4 people and that's it. So please don't see this movie I'm warning you
