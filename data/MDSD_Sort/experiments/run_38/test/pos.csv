 This is the 5th book in the Rapp series (I've read them in order), and it is definitely the best so far.  The story is highly entertaining and action packed from the very beginning.  Flynn's previous efforts, while still very good, have all left something to be desired.  Transfer of Power was a little slower moving, Third Option and Separation of Power were too drawn out and should have been written as one novel, and Executive Power just wasn't a terrific story.  Memorial Day does not have any of these flaws.  All the strengths of his previous efforts are present without any of the weaknesses.  If you are an anti-military, excessively PC, or pro-bureaucracy, this sort of book is not for you.  But if you are a fan of 24, like one reviewer mentioned, you will be a big fan of the entire Rapp series.  I give it an easy five stars.  Can't wait to start Consent to Kill and Act of Treason 
 I may be the only reviewer who saw the Church live onstage in their heydey (no pun intended) and this album captures the melodic Church, but Peter Koppes on guitar live is like nothing I've ever seen since.  I met Steven Kilbey too - talked about his Fender guitar, rare combination of inspiring singer and a nice guy.  This album definitely worth a try and you may be absorbed (like me) once it's on.  "Blood Money" was a key song in Miami Vice episode "Heart of Night" about Lt. Castillo's exwife being kidnapped and definitely made that show memorable.    I thought I was listening to the Church when I heard Coldplay's "A Rush of Blood to the Head" album.  Especially "In My Place" and "God Put a Smile upon Your Face" -so another generation has been influenced by the Church.  good 
 This Book made the  hair on the back of my neck standup ...it is Breathtakingly told superb ...like a LE CARRE  Novel ...this Killer stretched the Israeli's to the Brink ...but they got him in the end ...INSHALLAH...by the way he belonged to HAMAS ,thats the Goverment now in Power in Palestine ....OH really!!!!!!.. 
 My daughter never sits still except to watch this video. The characters are spectacular and the songs too. It is perfect for children of any age. This is one I didn't mind watching so much. It teachs every step including wipe, flush, & wash hands. My daughter took her pants off and went to the potty right after watching it. This is truely the best kids video ever. I have the dvd and it has sing-a-longs and other bonus stuff that are great too. I definitely recomend this one all the other videos I tried were a total waste of my time & money. In short you should really get this one 
 Who would ever have thought Senator Thruston Morton could be so interesting? Yet De Antonio got some great material from him. Tonkin Gulf "No"-votes, Senators Ernest Greuning and Wayne Morse, also make wise appearances. Like LBJ, all three Senators left the government after the 1968 elections.  This film is really about film-making, more than it is a History of the Vietnam War. It ends before Tet and the Paris peace talks, more or less around the time of the South Vietnamese national elections of 1967. It has compelling shots of Buddhist immolation, but overall it's addressed to the Hearts and Minds of late 60's Americans.  This is not a history for your kids: too much is missing. That being said, In the Year of the Pig is a fine documentary. Emile de Antonio works forward from his material to present a viewpoint, instead of using cinema to work backwards from some deeply-held prejudice, a la Michael Moore. A good example would be the filmed address by General LeMay: how easy it would be to turn him into General Jack D. Ripper instead of presenting his argument in an almost, I-don't-know, reasonable way.  The Home Vision Entertainment edition comes with a great essay by Douglas Kellner explaining de Antonio's cinemagraphic methods 
 Inspiration abounds in this book~I love how it features the same rooms, accessorized differently for the seasons. That is my favorite way to decorate~ Also, if you love old homes and restoration, this book provides inspiration for that as well. Wonderful! And the chandeliers, oohlala! 
 I listened to it 20 years ago on LP, had to have it on CD. Great tuneage 
 What a great story - I just read the book for a second time (2 years after the first time), and again I was drawn into this delicate web of lies, dark manoeuvres, and high-flying ambitions. A cast of memorable characters, surprising twists and turns, and a good dose of subtle humour make this book an outstanding historical novel. And while enjoying the good read, you pick up some knowledge about the beginning of stock exchanges, about futures and puts and gets and some such. So, definitely a good choice for your next vacation reading!   
 I cannot understand anyone having a problem with this book.  Maybe it is too long for some but that is why it is called literature.  Likewise, if you do not like the slow pace and lack of action, pick up a Grisham novel during your visit to the airport and chuckle along the way.  This is the best southern McCarthy novel by far and equal to Blood Meridian.  Remember, turtles make good soup and do not try and kill your neighbor's pig without first asking 
 Like her memoir, Albright shows herself to be as good of a writer as she is a statesman.  She speaks the truth here about many things regarding world policy and religion as well as the missteps of the current administration.  The frustrating thing about this book is that its really written to the choir. I nodded my head often - and realized that the people who should read this book never will. So read this book then loan it to someone who still doesn't get it 
 Sharon, you did an excellent job with these short stories.  My favorite was "Hunting for Boys."  This book is all about girls and they boys they like.  It's about learning about relationships.  It demonstrates puberty and hormones kicking in.  It reminds me of the saying by Dolly Parton on confusion: "they don't know whether to scratch their watch or wind their behind."  Moms and Dads, please get this book for your daughters.  They will enjoy the stories and may even find themselves in some of them.  Each story has a different premise but they all tie into the same plot--getting with a boy.  It reminds me when I first started liking boys when I was in junior high.  I definitely recommend this book for the average teenager.  Well done, Sharon, and keep 'em coming. 
 A humorous collection from his newspaper column.   Every two or three page rant was good for a laugh, and often more than one - what more can you ask from a humour column?   Barry is a funny guy, who can take something mildly amusing or ironic in the every day and articulate it into something really amusing. On a particularly good day he even goes a bit surreal.   He's consistent (or, at least, selective in this compilation). I'm glad I came across him - I'll be back for more. 
 Filmmaker Robert Greenwald has effectively made mincemeat of his targets in a couple of recent fiery documentaries - Rupert Murdoch and the FOX Network in "Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism", and the Bush administration in "Uncovered: The War on Iraq". His latest is no exception as he lays into Wal-Mart, its CEO Lee Scott and Sam Walton's heirs in this probing 2005 critique of corporate injustice. Instead of providing a single narrative voice, Greenwald structures his film as a series of vignettes focusing on discrete instances of where Wal-Mart has violated fair market practices, passed over women and minorities for leadership positions, restricted movements toward employee unionization, taken advantage of cheap labor in China and India, and disregarded environmental standards.  The grievances seem endless, and the film even discloses the embarrassingly paltry amounts each Walton family member has given to charitable causes (compared to Bill Gates, of course). The most touching episodes focus on victims like Red Esry, who are experiencing the closure of their multi-generational small businesses in small towns where Wal-Mart opens and cannibalizes the competition. Much of the treatment seems ham-fisted, especially in the juxtaposition of Wal-Mart commercials and in-house training videos within the context of those being crushed by the corporation's economic clout. Moreover, the one segment about the rape of an employee in a parking lot, while horrific, seems more generic in nature than Wal-Mart's accountability in the incident. The abundance of conjecture and the lack of attributable facts tend to affect some of the film's credibility.  However, Greenwald makes his points with clarity. Especially effective is the use of archived footage of Scott asserting to a massive audience of his employees that Wal-Mart has done nothing but good for the economy, even though many of them have to go on welfare to get medical care. The film ends with a montage of people who have successfully lobbied against the construction of stores in their towns. At the same time, Greenwald has not made a monomaniacal diatribe, as the takeaway never feels like the destruction of Wal-Mart but more a call for a severe overhaul of their internal practices. The filmmaker has certainly come a long way since his 1980 feature film debut, the ludicrous "Xanadu", and he seems to be continuing his streak of confronting those corrupted by their power.   The DVD has several extras, the best being a twenty-minute making-of featurette and a separate 16-minute short, "The Big Meeting", on how the film came about. Greenwald also provides a commentary track, though much of what he shares can be gleaned from the featurettes. There are a couple of deleted segments that do seem redundant if they were included in the movie (one set in Quebec, the other in England), as well as a brief clip of local religious leaders condemning Wal-Mart's practices. Lastly, there are several fitfully funny Wal-Mart commercial parodies that apparently served as commercials for the documentary. Those looking for a more-in-depth analysis of Wal-Mart's business impact may want to read Charles Fishman's "The Wal-Mart Effect: How the World's Most Powerful Company Really Works - and How It's Transforming the American Economy" 
 This book explains a great deal about medical billing. It is written in an easy-to-read style, and organizes the information in  logical steps 
 I have become generally tired of women's fiction/chicklit and read this on a friend's suggestion. I was floored by it. Its very well written, has a lot of depth and is extremely witty. The emotions of a woman going through divorce are very well written. 
  This California style salmon jerky tastes great, but a little overly dry and hard to chew, in my opinion. Still it is nice to have, and it is very funny to see looks on people faces when you offer them salmon, somewhere on a trip in the middle of nowhere. 
 Dean Koontz is one of the best genre writers working today.  I have read most of his fifty plus novels, and I think PRODIGAL SON ranks as one of his best recent efforts.    PRODIGAL SON is the first in a planned trilogy of books that retells the story of Frankenstein in modern times.  Book Two was released last year and the final volume will be released next summer.  Like most fans, I'm eagerly awaiting that third book, which is over a year late.  The plot of PRODIGAL SON is very enteraining and fast-paced.  It has very short chapters, kind of like a James Patterson novel.   This is a good book for younger readers, since it is written in a very simple, staightforward style.     If you're new to Koontz, this is a very good place to start.  Some of Koontz' books are somehwat overwritten and tedious, but PRODIGAL SON does not fall into that category.  This isn't a great novel, but it's tons of fun.  If you like this book, I recommend reading some of Koontz' earlier work, such as WATCHERS, ODD THOMAS, MIDNIGHT, and DRAGON TEARS 
 I put off reading "Vengeance of Dragons"for about three months, because I had already read "Courage of Falcons" and knew much of what was going to happen. It was one of the least wise reading decisions I've ever made. I love this book. LOVE it. Cover to cover. More than being exciting, it's writing at such a high level that most authors never attain it. "Vengeance of Dragons" is easily my favorite book and the series, and one of my favorite books period. I read very few novels a second time, but I have every intention of visiting this one again, and most likely again after that 
 I don't even like country, but this....ohhhhh yeah 
 My two toddler's love this movie. It was so hard to find and Amazon had it. This is a great kid's movie! It is a must have for all families 
 I found this to be one of the most interesting books I have ever read. For me it's a revolutionary work in the sense that very rarely do books such as this come into my life -- maybe once every five years -- and have the ability to forever change the way I think about the world. And as with all such important books, it is iconoclastic and will not please everyone. Some will no doubt hate it, but most of the objectivist academics have no doubt long since dismissed it as nonsense. Most assuredly it is not without its faults. For example, Lakoff tends to rail a bit  much against what he calls "objectivist" viewpoints (those who espouse some flavor of the correspondence theory of truth), which includes pretty much all of the present day scientific community  as well as the majority of Anglo-American analytic philosophers. In addition, the book is admittedly long-winded and a little repetitious in places. By the time I had gotten to the end of the second case study, I was totally burned out and could not continue any further. But it wasn't disenchantment with the book so much as the desire to just move on to something else. I have yet to read the third case study, but I will eventually. In fact, I know that I will come back to this book many times in the future to refer to the numerous insights which lie scattered everywhere throughout the text.  Contrary to what you may have been told, Lakoff is NOT an egotistical academic. He is quick to give credit and praise to others for many or most of the ideas contained in this work. Nor is he vain and arrogant; on occasion he even makes fun of himself. He does not talk down to the reader, but his expectation is that you are able to follow his argument, which is intelligent-undergraduate level. To be sure, he has not tried to water down the ideas to appeal to a wide audience of couch potatoes.  I especially like the format of this book: the larger type is easy on my older eyes; excellent paper quality, generous margins, little or no typos: All make for a first-rate reading experience, a real treat. The generous margins are useful for jotting down quick notes on the side for future reference, as I did repeatedly thoughout this book.   I will end with one example of the many insights that fill this fascinating book: Viewing truth as a radial concept forms the foundation for a mature relativism "Because, as we have seen, truth cannot be characterized as correspondence to a physical reality, we must recognize truth as a human concept, subject to the laws of human thought... There are central and non-central truths. The central truths are characterized in terms of directly understood concepts, concepts that fit the pre-conceptual structure of experience. Such concepts are (a) basic-level concepts in the physical domain, and (b) general schemas emerging from experience...." The fact that there are central truths and non-central truths means that by realizing that the truths we live by are not central, we can gain an appreciation of and respect for the truths others live by.   In summary, this book held my attention for more than 400 pages, was thought-provoking, challenging, rewarding, and one of the most satisfying intellectual experiences I have encountered to date. I strongly recommend it 
 "Latifah's Back" in this *GREAT* comedy along with Steve Martin. This movie was definitly amazing. If you like to laugh this is a movie for you. It' full of laughter!! 
 This book is very well-written and depicts life out in Iraq so vividly. The author does a good job describing life as a grunt and how significant the grunt's job duties are in the Corps. It really made me appreciate everyone's life story. It has become one of my favorite books. Excellent read! Buy it 
 While the photos in this wonderful book are enough to make your mouth water, reading the fantastic descriptions will force even the most uninventive baker to hop in his/her car down to the nearest gourmet specialty shop and purchase a supply of Valrona's sumptuous dark chocolate, parchment paper and a fun assortment of accoutrements that would please the most well-turned out pastry chef. Those who have never used a pastry bag, need not panic; the results are well-worth the process.  The recipes are fun and fantastic, the tastes, subtle and the step-by-step directions, complete with Pierre's sidebar tips and suggestions, foolproof.  The book is divided into different sections focusing on Cakes, Cookies, Tarts, Custards/Mousses, Truffles/Candies, Ice Cream/Frozen Desserts, Hot and Cold Drinks.  The book is prefaced by a brief essay on what you can expect from the book and finished to perfection with Pierre's base recipes and a dictionary of terms, techniques, equipment and ingredients with a source guide.   I especially enjoyed concocting Pierre's Chocolate Macaroons, the Financiers, and the Moist and Nutty Brownies.  The total chocolate experience of  the Original Hot Chocolate is Proustian, (with or without the madeleine)reminiscient of that served in a Parisian specialty shop in a tiny cup.  The books presentation alone would make a lovely gift even for the coffee-table brand of patisserie chef, but for those who are a little more adventuresome, there is much pleasure to be derived from this little gem 
  This edition of Dreiser's JENNIE GERHARDT attempts to "correct" the text that appeared in 1911 when the book was first published. Back then the editors at Harper's agreed to publish the novel only if they could make substantial changes to the text, softening Dreiser's criticisms of organized religion and the rich, and diluting the "immoral" behavior of the main character. Dreiser reportedly didn't like the changes, fought to get some of them re-instated, but eventually had to yield since no other publisher would touch the book. Using preserved typescripts, this edition is closer to the one Dreiser submitted before cuts were made.  Jennie Gerhardt has an out-of-wedlock child by Senator Brander, which she is able to keep secret from the wealthy socialite Lester Kane, whom she takes up with. He finds out about the child, however, and is unaffected by the news. He continues to live with her in a complicated arrangement, until Jennie finds out that Lester's father will basically disinherit him if he doesn't stop living with her and forces him to leave (echoes of WASHINGTON SQUARE by James and the subsequent movie version THE HEIRESS here). He marries Letty Gerald, a woman from his own social class, but is miserable. When he becomes ill and is alone, he summons Jennie and declares his true love for her.  The novel is an interesting one. Lester is a pessimistic, cynical, atheistic man while Jennie is much simpler and has a mystical belief in the goodness of life. The "battleground" on which these opposing beliefs are fought over is made fascinating by Dreiser. Also Lester's struggle with his own wealthy class system, which he is never comfortable with and rebels against, is handled admirably and honestly by the author (it became a major theme in fiction by WW I). This was Dreiser's second novel after SISTER CARRIE; it's not as good as that first book, but it's a solid work of fiction nonetheless 
 Dear fellow readers: 	The subject of mass and heat transfer is very involved, and it has applications in many industrial processes. This book starts with a very fundamental explanation of heat transfer. The introduction seems to be from a grade ten science class, hence it is easily understood. As the chapters develop, other concepts such as thermodynamics, solids, and fluids come in to discussion. For this reason I recommend that any one who wishes to read this book, have a firm grasp on these subjects. These sections are far and few in between, so a reader can further develop their understanding with out much difficulty. As the title states the book is about both heat and mass transfer. It is interesting to note that, although these subjects are fundamentally different the calculations are very similar thanks to dimensionless numbers. The book does a very good job of explaining and relating these topics to each other. In my personal opinion, if there is one book that should be bought that encompasses these subjects, and can be used as a reference in the future, this book is my preferred choice 
 I found this book extrememly helpful and my partner and I will be using this technique to start our real estate investments 
 Great!!!!  Will definitely consider ordering other items on Amazaon.  Again, many thanks.  Very satisfied with my order 
 This book embodies the best teachings for kids in today's society.  Kids need to feel OK about themselves and have that reinforced constantly so they grow up to be positive contributing members of our society.  My brother and I loved it as kids ourselves.  It's a terrific work and I hope it continues to last for ages to come 
 After seeing "The Right Stuff" I became intrigued with the Mercury Seven astronauts and wanted to read everything I could about them and when I saw John Glenn's autobiography I immediately snatched it up and pored through the pages!  What a great and exciting life John lived!  Poring through the pages I hung on every word and lived his experiences vicariously as he described them...I can only imagine how he felt when he was picked to be one of the 7 Mercury astronauts...He was in a elite group that was beginning to embark on a major adventure into a new frontier...How exciting that must have been!  John's book to me was better than the movie..He talks bout his childhood days and test pilot years and ends with a wonderful passage on flying back into space again at the ripe old age of 77..What an inspiring book!  If you are looking for inspiration..pick this book up and read about ambition and hard work and focus ande see what all these things can do for your life!  John...thanks for being a great role model 
 I had just recently seen a Lange exhibit when I bought this wonderful book.   It starts with an essay on Lange by Robert Coles.   Then it moves into her photographs and her own words.   Her work is beautiful on its own, but to have the photographs and her philosophy side by side is an enriching experience.   The photographs fill the entire book so it's a great read and a nice coffee table book.   The images are primarily from her depression photos, but there are also pictures from around the world, her family and her early portraits.   I also like that they included photographs of her and her oak trees.   Dorothea Lange was a woman with such a unique perspective on life.   I feel that this book does an excellent job of presenting her work 
 Silver, the girlchild of an unwed mother and a seaman grows up on the seacliffs overlooking the fishing town of Salts in a house perched so precariously that all the furniture has to be nailed down and Silver and her mother have to rope themselves together to keep from falling to their deaths. Even their dog evolves deformed legs to navigate the steeply leaning floor! When her mother dies in an accident, Silver is apprenticed to an old lighthousekeeper named Pew, and begins to learn not only the beauty of this simple but important job, but also a little of the history of the family that built it. What follows are interlocking and parallel narratives of Silver's urge to find the meaning of her life and that of Babel Dark, friend of Darwin and Robert Louis Stevenson, who lived a double life while serving as the town's clergyman.   Lighthousekeeping is a nice book that recalls not only classic literature but also allows Winterson to use her penchant for creating half-real neverlands that somehow find solid ground in the real world. Many aspects of this novel are fairytale-like and the interweaving of historical personages and the connection of names to Treasure Island lend it an even more dream-like quality that recalls poetry more than prose. In some of Winterson's other works, her pseudo-gravitas is invested too much in the lyrical nature of her words to the detriment of the storytelling. But Lighthousekeeping is a rousing success. A good book.  
 i hadn't seen this movie in years. still love it 
 This book is an excellent resource for a new parent of a preemie. Its primary focus is on parenting your baby in the NICU, and its filled with advice on how to handle your baby, ways to provide comfort and more protection and assistance in interacting with professionals in the NICU. Overall it is a comforting book which introduces you to the astonishing world of neonatal intensive care.   The title is really a bit of a misnomer, as what the book does best is provide information for the new parent, especially one whose baby is doing relatively well and is not extremely premature. For someone whose situation is more fragile, I would recommend this be supplemented by one of the more extensive books in our recommendations on prematurity.org. However, there is a broad audience for this book, as most preemies will do well in the NICU and after; for those parents this is a gentle and supportive introduction 
 First-Thanks to cartoon expert and great guy Jerry Beck for alerting cartoon fans to this box set on his websites.  Second-If Amazon is combining the FLIGHTS of FANTASY box with the PUPPETOON MOVIE or THE FANTASTIC FILM WORLD OF GEORGE PAL at a sale price,be forwarned:the FLIGHT OF FANTASY box includes both DVDs along with Pal's first feature film,THE GREAT RUPERT.  Others have said nice things here about Pal and the FANTASY FILM WORLD documentary-suffice it to say that without George Pal there would be no STAR WARS,no E.T.,no TOY STORY and a slew of other pop culture icons.  My childhood was filled with the works of George Pal and I didn't even know it. From the Puppetoon "Tubby the Tuba" to the live action 1960 film,many a sit on front of the TV on Saturday morning or the movie theater on a Saturday afternoon was filled with the magic of George Pal.  My list of children entertainment hereoes would include Walt Disney,Jim Henson,Bob Clampett,Tex Avery,Friz Freleng,Chuck Jones and Max Fleischer. But George Pal might take the crown. He influended my love of music with Tubby and laid the seeds for  a positive vision for mankind in his interpretation of H.G. Well's TIME MACHINE. Like the others mentioned above,he never talked down to me as a child and yet his stories resonate with powerful images in my adulthood. I think all of these artists were their own best audience and if they liked what they created,well,the audience came along for the ride.  Of particular interest to cartoon fans is The PUPPETOON MOVIE disc in general and the extras in particular. There are 12-count 'em-12 complete and unedited Puppetoons added to the disc,with their original titles where available. Such a feast for the eyes! Some of these were made as one reel commercials for Philips electronic producats(radios and light bulbs)that were shown in European movie theatres during the 1930s. Pity the feature film that followed one of these "commercials",especially if it was a musical. I suspect even Busby Berkeley dropped a jaw at the images that Pal lovingly filled the screen. Colors,sound,movement-all swirl in your head and await another go round. I promise you will watch thiese short films over and over with amazement. George Pal loved his work and had high hope for mankind-not a bad way to go through life. Important lessons to be learned from a shy little tuba. 
 There are so many great books on business out there and I have found this one called "The Wal-Mart Way" by Don Soderquist to be an invaluable tool when starting my business 
 Dr. Strand provides the reader with priceless information that will empower you to take charge of your health 
 Daniel Hillel's , Out of the Earth: Civilization and the Life of the Soil, stands as a definite "must read" for all of us. Although science-based throughout, this book reads like a mystery novel as Hillel traces man's relationship to the soil over the centuries. Ultimately , he shows us the destruction wrought on civilizations through neglect and ignorance of the soil, proving in the end, as we have somewhat suspected all along, every civilization is built from the soil--more literally than is often recognized.  Hillel's understanding, and empathy, comes through distinctively in this compelling narrative, which he introduces as "not a strictly dispassionate exposition."   Drawing on his background in education, he begins with a clear and concise introduction to soil science. From there, he takes us along on a journey across our planet and through time to look at the soil with a new appreciation.  Hillel is the best kind of writer - seductively informative and a passionate observer. He brings to his pages an affinity for his subject that could make even a debutante  enamored of the very ground upon which we all walk. Hillel details soil management in Israel where he served in different positions with the government.  He is intimately familiar with desert soil management, but he ranges far and wide beyond the deserts - into the rain forest as well as the plains of the American Midwest. His experience and his vision encompass the entire earth, and his examples are born from every continent. His clear and instructive text is easily digested; his examples are well thought and  concise. This book will repay your investment of time and money with a better understanding of the soil you walk daily - that "dirt" you dig out from under your nails after a day in the garden. I appreciate even more the soil which serves as the foundation of my home and upon which the culture and all that we as a society have built - the thin crust that sustains all the inhabitants of Earth; that delicate layer of the Earth in which we grow our plants and bury all our dead. We live and die as beings, societies and civilizations, in conjunction with the care we bestow upon the soil or withhold from it. We may fare no better than our ancestors in our care of the soil, but it will not be from ignorance with books like Hillel's around.  This book sits handily on my bookshelf; I take it down and allow it to open to a page to "spot-peruse." It has become pivotal in my thinking about soil, water and civilization 
 Not a Good Day to Die: The Untold Story of Operation Anaconda is a well researched and written book. It kept me engaged. Highly recommended! 
 I have been running in the top of line New Balance for over ten years and have bought every top brand running shoe to try to compare. Even though they are overpriced - still best shoe on market - especially for those with injury or pronation problems as I have 
 Another enjoyable album from Deep Forest.  Makes a great gift 
 For many years I have relied on War & Change in World Politics as a structural guide to examining international relations.  Gilpin's classic work provides, both clear historical and theoretical support to augument  his argument.  His thoughts reside firmly in the realist tradition, but  adds to the richness of that paradigm through focusing on transition.  Gilpin correctly argued that,"Throughout history a principal objective  of states has been the conquest of territory in order to advance economic,  security, and other interests.  Whether by means of imperialist subjugation  of one people by another or by annexation of contiguous territory, states  in all ages have sought to enlarge their control over territory and, by  implication, their control over the international system.  For this reason,  a theory of international political change must of necessity also be a  theory of imperialism and political integration.(23) The firm goal of  Gilpin is to creat a theory of the transition of power relations. I believe  that he has provided the initial steps through his courageous attempt to  provide framework developing a theory of change.   I first read War &  Change while residing in Western and Central Europe, from 1989 to 1999. I  was at the tearing down of the Berlin Wall, The Gulf War, and witnessed the  collapse of the Soviet Union and the reunification of Germany.  Gilpin's  book provided structure to my studies and my personal search for  understanding of the dynamics of these profound changes in societies. I  evaluated theories of economism, based on American capitalism versus  European and Japanese socialism and the belief in a new tri-polar order and  found them theoretically broken down in War & Change.  Gilpin argued  that,"Although multipolar systems can become tripolar, the more usual  occurrence is for bipolar systems to become tripolar, and as Waltz  correctly observed, tripolar systems tend to be the most unstable os  all....Thus the emergence of a powerful China, Japan, or united Europe  would undoubtedly prove to be a destabilizing factor in contemporary world  politics."(91)  The explosion of the Internet changed for many the  equation of power.  However, the technological catch up tactics of Japan in  the 1980s had many Americans worrying that it's comparative advantage was  being lost.  The Internet will decrease the curve and the trajectory of  technological catchup policies. Take a read of pages 173-178 to fully  appreciate Gilpin's analysis of pre-Internet military and technological  trends. The ideas of democracy as the only legitimste form of government  were dismayed by my real life experiences and I found support and faults in  my analysis of this situation in Gilpin's work. In closing, I believe that  Gilpin needed to concentrate his argument more on a particular structure of  change.  However, because of the wide range of issues that increase the  factors of change and the trajectories of states an explanation of change  that requires this drift was almost a necessity.      For any student of  international relations or history War & Change in World Politics is  rich in references and advice for structuring an analysis.  My belief is  that this is a fundamental book in understanding the changes occurring now  and that will be in the future 
 The Odyssy, is a classic book written by Homer himself that stars the famous Hero Odysseus, his son Telemachus, and the goddess Athena. Homer was a greek poet and aoidos that wrote both The Iliad and The Odyssey. No classic can compare to The Odyssey.  In the story, The gods of Olympus finally decide to guide Odysseus home. He reaches a famous land where the people gladdly take him in. As he is kept there he tells them how he ended up marooned on the island he sailed from. He tells them of his battle with the anciant cyclops Polypheumus, his outsmarting of the charming goddess Circe, and his other famous adventures. After he finishes his story, his hosts take him over seas to his home land where he has revenge on the fowl suiters who took his place on the throne and allowed crime to roam through the streets. But i will not say if he lives or not. That is for you people to find out.    This book is so interesting that i bet all fictional readers would give it a 5 star each, because i certainly do. The big reason I liked the book was because it had a perfect mixture of fantasy, adventure, sorrow, action, and romance. Very good read for those who love this stuff 
 Hegel's Philosophy of History is his easiest book to read.  He angered some people by saying that History is Freedom, and so those countries which did not have Free States (in 1821, the year he wrote his book) were not truly part of History but part of the Pre-historic period.  He begins with a narrative of Africa in 1821 which was steeped in Slavery, both internal and external.  He stated that all nations were once at this level of Pre-history, where no king could last more than a year.  But China was the first nation to make One but only One Person free, namely, the Emperor.   This was the beginning of History.  From this point Hegel traces those nations which increased Freedom slowly - from Egypt to Assyria to Babylon to Persia to Greece to Rome to Spain and then Europe as we know it today.  The Idea of a Free Republic was born in Greece, but was first made material in Rome.  Caesar opposed the Republic because he knew that the fullness of time had not yet come for it; so he opened up barbarian Europe instead.  The Free Republic eventually grew to a point where a great, courageous World Historical Individual, Napoleon Bonaparte, overthrew the Medieval structures and paved the way for the eventual abolition of Slavery.  Hegel was an Abolitionist and lived to see England and Spain renounce Slavery, but died long before Lincoln, so his view of the USA was pretty pessimistic 
 It has a lot of neat recipes in it!  My husband is the "low-carber" in our family, and he has said that some of them need a little more flavor, usually salt.  I've really enjoyed her unique recipes; out-of-the-ordinary seasonings like curry powder, I enjoy that.  And some of them are just so darn easy, I love using it!  Healthy yet convenient are my two favorite characteristics of recipe books.    Thank you Dana 
 Great book many good ideas, out grandchildren have enjoyed the variety of cupcakes and enjoy looking through the book and picking out which ones to make 
 It's been years since I read this one but I remember reading it late at night and being afraid to step out of bed to turn out the light.  Never has a novel made me so afraid of my own shadow.  It was an easy read and maybe a little simplistic but it was still a great horror novel

 I started reading this book and I still cannot place it down - it's brimming with information that I can use to help others and myself change during difficult times or the best times in my organization. As a manager in my organization, I have to stay knowledgeable of all of the best management practices in the industry  - - this is the best book I have found for this purpose. You could pay for $1000 and up attending conferences and $5000 on research reports and never find this kind of management knowledge 
 I liked the book, i thought it was a change from all the usual hating that goes on this country. I don't understand why people think it is the responsibility of one country to make the whole world successful and happy- maybe i am slow, because I really don't see how that can be done. I think this country helps out a lot as far as food and aid in poor countries but I could be mistaken.  This going to sound selfish but why should people in this country worry about how other's perceive them- you can't please everybody. If all the countries in the world were on common ground in every situation- there would still be people who will have negative things to say about the country. I really enjoyed the book but a lot want because it don't have a lot of negative things about America.   
  	Nicholas Sparks has found a way to grasp your heart in this tragic, yet happy love story. If The Notebook was a sad story then this one will leave you crying for hours. With the love between Theresa and Garrett, the ending of the book seems to take a dramatic twist that you would have never seen coming from the first time that Theresa met Garrett. This was a book that I enjoyed to read and found out that once I picked up the book I couldn't put it down. The ending might have been tragic but the overall theme seems to remain clear. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has lost a love before, or even fallen in love. Sparks always finds that way to leaving you weeping at the end. This was once again, another wonderful book by Sparks. 
 I own a few PC books and had always planned on giving it a try but never did. That is until i got this book. The directions are top notch and fun to read. I made my first PC creation and was very pleased. Made me feel like a pro and it was so fun. I will buy all books that this author puts out as I know her directions will be excellent and the subject fun. I highly recommend this book 
 Marvin Gayes' untimely death in 1984 left a big void in music. Marvin Gaye had become one of the most influential singer and songwriters in soul music history. His diligent work had tremendous depth, making profound political statements and social commentary as well as having a poignant and spiritual edge.   Marvin Gayes' recording career spans back to the dawn of the swinging sixties when Motown Records was beginning to make its mark in the world by becoming commonly known as "the sound of young America". The fantastic Stubborn Kind Of Fellow was one of his very best early hits. The formulaic though enduring Motown sound is fully at work on this classic with Gayes' distinctive vocals seamlessly surfboarding along the somwhat complex musical arrangements.   Hitch Hike, Can I Get A Witness? and Too Busy Thinking About My Baby also encapsulates that familiar and distinct Motown sound of its golden era in the 1960's and all three are instantly contagious from the musical arrangements to gayes rocketing vocal performances that was in a class and style of its own.   During Motowns golden era of the 1960's, Gaye worked with many of the labels most talented female singers. His phenomenal duet with the underated Kim Weston on the sparse, It Takes Two, sounds just as fresh and as vibrant as it was back then. But it was the divine Tammi Terrell (who was married to David Ruffin, one-time lead singer of The Temptations) that he found his perfect duet partner.   Gaye and Terrell cut many albums and succesful hit singles together with their diverse blend of harmonies gelling neatly into the sexually sizzling productions. Some of their greatest duets include You're All I Need To Get By, Ain't No Mountain High Enough ( the latter being a total contrast to the more famous version Diana Ross took to the top of the charts in 1970), You Ain't Livin Till Your Lovin' and The Onion Song.   Gayes recording work in the late 60's vastly matured growing much more unique and phenomenal. He really hits his stride on the masterpiece, chart-topping mega-classic, I Hear It Through The Grapevine. The compelling opening interlude leads into a rocking and sparse production with Gayes stirring, soulful delivery complimenting the startling arrangements. Gaye really carries off I Heard It Through The Grapevine with style and finesse and this was but a mere taste of things to come.   Whilst his recording work progressed the sound of his music became more refined and stylized. He delivered what was possibly his greatest ever album in 1971 with What's Going On. That album neraly didn't happen as Motown boss Berry Gordy was unsure as to how his buying public might react to Gayes new, creative force. Well, if anything, this merely fuelled Gayes record sales and critics alike joined in to praise the genius. What's Going On completely shook off his more familiar sound of the 60's, exploring relevant environmental issues that also made some form of political comment as well as profound social commentary.   Gaye is put more in touch with his spiritual side on the timeless and poignant Mercy,Mercy Me which, with its rolling arrangements that has a really sharp, soulful edge, conveys Gayes vocal power which was simply going from strength to strength.   In 1973 he recorded a successful album of duets with the queen of Motown, Diana Ross. The highlight of this project was the breathtaking, You Are Everything. From that magical, exotic opening intro to the fittingly refined vocal delivery of Ross to Gayes more forceful, aggressive delivery, You Are Everything is THE ultimate love duet!   The evocative Lets Get It On taking from the excellent album of the same name, is one of my own personal favourite tracks. Gaye is in full romantic mood here with his exuberant delivery sounding highly sexually charged. This merley coats the smooth arrangements that features glorious saxophone interludes played at various points on the recording.   Gaye moved into funkier terriotry in the late 70's and reached its pinnacle on tracks such as the satrtlinglyeffective Got To Give It Up. With its multi-layered musical arrangements, dubbed crowd noises that sounds as though it was recorded live in a nightclub to Gayes impeccable delivery, it perfectly demenonstrated Gayes wonderful craft of versatlity.   One of Gayes last signature tunes had to be the timeless, sensual and utterly divine Sexual Healing. Gayes raw, earthy delivery rides along the state-of-the-art production and this was featured on his last studio album, Midnight Love which was his first (and last) for CBS Records following his departure from Motown records.   This two Cd collection collects together all of these classics that are all compelling musically and really give you an understanding as to why his work has remained unparralled and such an inspiration to todays new generation of wannabe soul/r&b singers. ESSENTIAL!   Ian Phillips  
 I really like this album; I'm actually listening to it right now.  I think that it is a good album considering that it's No Doubt's first made CD.  I love ALL of the songs on here.  And here's the funny thing:  for 11 years, I always thought that the very first song' name: BND, stood for Band No Doubt.  I was wrong obviously.  It actually stands for the very last song on this CD: Brand New Day.  And, I cannot get over the fact that the first song is only 45 seconds!  It was like a warm-up session for the band! But, nevertheless, I recommend this CD for EVERYONE...I mean, even it's your first time hearing No Doubt.  I mean, come on.  It's their very first CD, and they, to me, did such a wonderful job with it!  All of these songs could be on the charts! I give it 5 stars.  1 
 the movie, the system ,everything is great. it is the next step to quality home theater films, the only thing is you have to get the system of blue ray to see the blue ray movies and there are only a small handful, but on the upside, if you haven't made a big collection here is where you start, because the clarity is amazing.this movie is fantastic and the vision is breathtaking, a must buy 
 I had never read a "Chicken Soup for the Soul" book but I had heard such good things about them that I decided to pick this one up and sure enough it's great!! It really got me in a holiday spirit which I needed and the first story made me want to cry. I can't wait to finish this book and get it out next year. I might even buy a few copies for my friends. I really want to read more of the "Chicken Soup for the Soul" series and I think you should too 
 We bought this card game years ago as a way to interact with our children.  It is a relatively simple game with a few complicated rules that will challenge younger children.  Although the game is competative, everyone scores and even if the game doesn't go quite your way, you get a reward for effort anyway.  With the popularity of NASCAR, this game is sure to be a hit with any auto racing fan.  It is fast paced so, even if you are stopped by one of the many hazards, the play continues with added excitement.  Mille Bornes teaches about how strategies work.  There are many ways to manipulate the play and plan how you, or your team, can finish the race in first place!  There are even ways to play that allow the loser to sometimes gain more points than the actual winner.   See for yourself.  With the special car-shaped tin as a storage container, even when you're not playing the game, you can play with Mille Bornes 
 I was really surprised by this film. Its so good to see this kind of movies with such beautifull stories behind them. 
 Cassandra King can capture a Southern Belle and she does in The Same Sweet Girls story. You almost have to be a Dixie Darling yourself to fully appreciate each of these women, however, and from the reviews not every reader does. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this book almost as much as The Sunday Wife. I like King's style of writing, and I know these people she's talking about even though they drive you crazy at times.     I do wonder, however, how many loyal daughters of the W, the REAL W, Mississippi University for Women in Mississippi, the oldest state supported college for women in the country, will rise up in arms because King has moved their beloved alma mater over into Alabama and even brought along its spiral fire escapes. Poetic license no doubt, but as I read, I put it back where it belonged as there are many such friends there who would fit the cast as well. If you belong to one of these groups, you'll like King's story even better. 
 I bought this as a gift for someone and started looking at a few pages and could not put it down. Definitely worth reading 
 So a self-confessed serial killer who sliced, choked, stabbed, and drowned his way thru Houston, aka Michigan's "Sunday Morning Slasher," promises to kill again if able, yet was due at the age of 52 for mandatory release in May 2006--and this in Texas!  He admits to 13 murders and his own words back up official suspicions of responsibility for about 100!  Yet with all the victims and affected parties the reader is not overwhelmed, as the author employs a masterfully understated style that conveys the events, lives, and outrage with clarity and suspense that doesn't resort to tabloid-style sensationalism.  The man can write!  But for those who read true crime for information, you can pick up some simply prudent tips for protecting self, loved ones, and community--tinted car windows protect against more than the sun; trimmed shrubbery can't hurt, a lot can happen between the car and the front door; and be aware of potentially life-threatening weaknesses in "the system"--mayoral/police politics, good conduct time and mandatory release policies, intercity cooperation problems, the surveillance-v-harrassment issue, pressure to clear cases, etc--this and more is woven into the story.  Oh, and if you think it's a downer to read about human depravity and official callousness or incompetence, no worry, there are inspiring real heroes here too (survivors, citizens, professionals).  Finally, I especially like that the author describes without prescribing:  He mentions childhood ailments, yet doesn't insist medicine has the answer for serial killers; same thing w/noting sexual oddities, family history, spiritual comments, involvement in aggressive sports, and so on--all is recorded, but the reader is left to process the info and determine the causes and solutions of such deviancy.  I for one am sick of the "Have You Seen This Person?" inserts in my mailbox and am thankful for this awareness-raising pageturner that speaks for those who cannot, though their blood cries out 
 I bought this to consolidate to one card reader for my camera's CF cards and Palm Treo's SD cards. The build quality is surprisingly good given that's it's just a card reader - even a rubber bottom so it stays put on your desk. But, it's fast and easy to use as expected. I have not noticed the quirk the other reviewer mentioned. I just plug it in, drag over some files and unplug - no problems - system (XPpro SP2)recognizes the reader quickly. I should mention that I'm also using Sandisk media because that's what I already had - and they've been consistently good for years 
 I received this decanter as a gift last May. Very slick looking and its nicely constructed. It comes in real handy for everyday use. I like it-- made a very practical gift. As a consumer, I always recommend you shop around for the best price 
 Lots of down-to-earth advice on how to handle yourself at social events. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to strengthen their communications skills at parties and have more fun at them in the process 
 This biography has a flow that pulls you in. I was surprised by some of the revelations, such as the complexity of internal politics he had to deal with. It gives an image of an honest, ambitious, great leader. A leader who himself is unsure of many things (such as the civil war). Recommended 
 Although I've long known, generally speaking, what this movie is about, I never saw it when it came out in 1983, because I was too busy "living my life" in the 80's during my preteens. But I just saw it recently, in its entirety, and thought it was pretty decent.  I don't know, maybe it's the current sorry state of affairs of the world today that made me want to watch this film, just so I could revisit the "Happy Days(?)" of the eighties, when, although the world was also in a sorry state of affairs, at least there was an underlying pretense of hope and glory, a pervasive (albeit childlike) adherence to the belief that wishes DO sometimes come true, miracles CAN happen, and for every ugly frog there IS a beautiful princess waiting to kiss him...  Many viewers commented that this film is very dated, but not necessarily bad. It was looked upon as a bit of fluff that was very successful in the box office. So now, it would come across as nostalgic (in the same vein as "Dirty Dancing"). But the thing I do like about it, is just that. Adrian Lyne perfectly captured the time, a post disco era when Break-dancing and Synth Pop were all the rage - Who could forget the FANTASTIC theme song, sung by Irene Cara (Fame) and composed by Synth Pop genius Giorgio Moroder ("I feel love" - Donna Summer among many others).   So what if Jennifer Beals wasn't a great actress? So what if it wasn't her dancing? (Think one of them was a break dancer from "The Rock Steady Crew" - see? All about the era!) she was just a pretty woman who done a harmless bit at the time. If you love movies and music(especially from the 80's), then this is for you. This movie deserves a bit more credit (in my opinion), as it is a movie that can easily be enjoyed. 
 I was drawn to this book because the concept of "creating health" is one I see far too rarely in our society today.  As an executive coach, I have worked with numerous individuals from all walks of life who see their health as only a condition of their well-being rather than as a consequence of their actions.  But this is where Dr. Reed steps out from behind the curtain to reveal the truth that many of us try to hide from ourselves... for better or worse, we create our health.  As she states in The Creation Health Breakthrough, "C is for choice."  We have a choice in the type of health we create for ourselves and if we so choose, we can follow Dr. Reed's simple and inspiring plan to create a healthful and positive future for ourselves.  Unlike the more typical stern reproach you might get from your doctor about your lifestyle choices, Dr. Reed writes with humor and empathy, using stories to definitively make her case while keeping you engaged and inspired to follow the Creation Health plan.  I not only intend to recommend this book to all of those I coach as a guide for finding balance and wellness in life... I intend to include The Creation Health Breakthrough as a central part of my own personal wellness library 
 If you want to own the BEST, buy THIS one!  I have 10" bananas hanging on it now and they curve out so it does not touch any fruit in the bowl. The bowl is 9 1/2" round.  This is an impressive piece 
 I've been a huge fan of Birkenstock since purchasing my first pair of Professional clogs that I used both in the OR and in Labor & Delivery.  Wanting a casual pair to wear on a regular basis, I sought out the Boston for its good looks.  Not only is this clog great looking, it's incredibly comfortable, just like they were made for my feet.  This will not be my only pair, nor will they be my last pair of Bostons.  They coordinate well with jeans and casual pants, and are an all around fun shoe to wear.  NOTHING can beat their comfort! 
 Going from a traditional trainer to performance consultant/trainer. I found the book to be a little overwhelming. I feel the terminology, language used could have been a little more user friendly, especially if  you were just learning what a performance consultant is or does. The  authors did a good job with the performance relationship map to use as an  effective tool and the overall point of the book was well taken.  After I  attended a performance consultant workshop did I really have a better  understanding of the points that the authors were trying to make 
 Magical Lp (or CD now) -- just wonderful --- dont miss this one 
 Another great book with V.I. Warshawski.  Couldn't set it down.  Great plot lines.  Two lines going on at once.  I really enjoyed this latest book by Sara Paretsky 
 As a therapist who works exclusively with eating disorders, I find myself using this workbook again and again with my clients. It is creative, compassionate, honest and thorough. Jam-packed with information and suggestions, clients can work through exercises at their own pace. Thus far each client who has used the workbook has benefited. They often cite the contributions from recovered people as providing them with hope when they are most lacking it. Whether you are working on recovery yourself or a clinician working with people with eating disorders, this book is a "must have." Very well done 
 I wish that I could write this without knowing that this would be the last from the remarkable band Blind Melon. I remember the anticipation for this release my friends and I had, and the tragic loss we all felt when Shannon left us. I bought this in '95, and to this very day still listen with endearing reverence for a band that touches on so many different levels. I don't think there is one filler track on the whole disk. Songs like "Vernie" gushes out like honey, "2x4" like warm gravy, and "Skinned" a musical black comedy. "Car Seat" is a true gem just waiting for you to dig. I really like the changes in "Wilt", the guitar break just melts the chorus. Some of these songs are unbelievably revealing and personal, and like true artist' paint a vivid and sometimes surreal picture. Thorn, and Stevens are one of the best tandem guitar players I've ever heard, and the whole band seems so instinctive with such a lively feel. Some listners might never get it, but I'm glad I do. 
 My wife was a first time user of a serger that I bought her for Christmas (I know - great Christmas gift - but it was what she wanted!) - anyways, she tells me that this book is very helpful for providing a lot of useful hints past the basic instructions you get with a new serger - she would recommend it for anyone who usually needs just a little more hints tht a basic instruction guide provide 
 buy this along with the new drumset. Exactly what the new drummer needs to know about drum sets and to start drumming correctly 
 This story chronicles the lives of three classmates from the U.S. Naval Academy who graduated in 1951. It takes the reader thru their careers and marriages. One character was a marine hero in Korea, went on to join the FBI and the was elected to congress. Another was a skilled pilot who was shot down on a mission in Vietnam and was a prisoner of war. The third, was an engineer and scientist involved in our early missile programs. He then left the military and worked as a civilian. It was painful to be reminded of Hanoi Jane Fonda and her ilk. They worked like a 5th Column for The Enemy. This is a valuable read just to remind us how bad those days really were 
 I can turn my head to the right as we pass a little grey shack on the new blacktop road and see a big green Cadillac sitting in the dirt driveway.  Wonder how those folk can afford that, I might wonder as we whiz by.  Kimberly Holt has the answers in her book "Dancing in Cadillac Light".      The story, read in one sitting, swept me along because I know these people or maybe their "kin".  Growing up in small town Louisiana and living in East Texas, I know first hand that Mrs. Holt has nailed this time and place down perfectly.  That's what I like so much about all her books.  They are about real places, and especially real people 
 I had been looking for a pair of boots for months. When I came across these and was very interested in the way the looked. I was unsure if I wanted buy these after reading the "Elf Shoes" comment. However, I decided to take a chance with them after realizing that finding boots was so difficult in the stores. Needless to say, I am very happy I bought them as they are very cool and comfortable. I have received positive feedback and have NOT been pointed as wearing elf shoes. I would of given them 5 stars but there was a blue marking on one of the boots. Luckily it was on the shoe wear the average onlooker would not see it. But I can 
 Although I can't say this was a totally knockout read, I have to admit I  thoroughly enjoyed traveling the French countryside with Cassie and Rona,  the book's enormously likable female protagonists. Once I adjusted to  Galloway's rather inventive literary style (no punctuation to denote  dialogue, stream of consciousness narrative, loose spacing within sentences  and paragraphs, etc.), I was off and running. Cassie's contrary and cynical  nature is the perfect foil for Rona's perpetual Pollyanna personality, the  clashes well illustrated in short vignettes and terse conversations that  will leave the reader laughing out loud on occasion. Stopping at various  French tourist attractions and sites along the way (many highlighted in  hilarious travel book lingo within the text), the Scottish duo cope with  rude male behavior, snarling dogs, decrepit hotel accomodations and their   own dramatic mood swings. With a long history of taking  "holidays" together, Cassie and Rona explore not just the  unfamiliar terrain of the French countryside, but also the sometimes  startling interior landscape of their own psyches. The resulting literary  journey is well worth the reader's time, so sit back and enjoy the ride!  This book is a wonderful testimony to the power of female friendship 
 Steven Ozment's A Mighty Fortress is the best comprehensive survey of German History I've ever read.  If I were to teach a class on this subject, his would be my textbook.  The extensive "notes" section offers the reader a variety of resources to expand knowledge in particular areas.  Ozment offers a balanced and intelligent perspective on a people who have long been a source of high achievement but also profound disillusionment in the European experience.  Without resorting to ideology or popular cant, he gives us the foundational understanding to find both unifying themes and surprising variations.  He handles this massive and not a little controversial subject so well that I bought several copies as gifts 
  There have been emblematic films that plainly, justifies its success based on serious denounces that attempt against the environment. But few times, we had had the opportunity to watch with such boldness the ferociousness, constancy and dedication like this one.   We should be back to the times if Silkwood or The China syndrome to feel with such powerful intensity the importance about the magnitude of the ethical limits of the industrialization and the preservation of the environmental health; that degenerated in an unpredictable scandal of majuscule proportions    On the other hand of the coin, (and I must confess I have never been a special fan of Mrs. Roberts) she displayed by far,  the best of her repertoire and gave us a very real portrait that deserved her the Academy Award that year.  One more thing: in order to the fairness, I would personally would have stated decreed an equal number of votes with another superb and perhaps never equaled performance: Ellen Burstyn and "Requiem for a dream". And that I keep this statement taking into account that famous double prize between Barbara Streisand and Vanessa Redgrave in 1967, where the difference in what acting concerns was even major.     Excellent edition and magisterial direction of Steven Soderbergh.  
 JACKIE TELLS IT LIKET IT IS .EVEN HIS OWN PEOPLE LOVE HIM .. 
 I read this book since i wanted to understand the business world. This book was very insightful about open book leadership and motivating employees with numbers and equity in the company. I saw some comments from others stating the chaina product price will beat all these principles. I think this guy got partial truth in his statement. A good business will do business using resources from chaina and focus on the advantages they have locally (Marketing and Selling). Principles are principles anywere. Awesome way to start the game. :- 
 This book debunks many assumptions we have about help among poor people.  It presents vividly what happens when there are very few resources and  people must make heartwrenching decisions whether to help their mom with a  small loan of money or their children with school supplies. The poor often  don't have enough resources to help everyone and end up in difficult  situations that sometimes lead to tension. This book is an eye opener!  Anyone working with poor and disadvantaged populations should read it 
 The Lady and the Lion is an excellent book.  There are so many small details that make it just right for any reader older than 7.  You have to be able to read the book, but if you can't, the pictures tell the story.  The Lady and the Lion's pictures tell exacly what is going on.  They also tell the mood of the story.  They are realistic drawings, and you can tell what is happening.  It is a mixture of Beauty and the Beast and Cinderella.  I think the Lady and the Lion should have won the Caldecott Medal.  It is a truly excellent book.  Everyone should be able to have the pleasure to read it 
 Overall, this album has many of the best songs between the two _Use You Illusion_ releases, but it also contains some of the least good songs Guns 'n' Roses ever recorded.  First, for as great as the original version of "Don't Cry" is on the first disc, it was simply to fill space to include an alternate lyrics version on this one.  Plus, "Get In The Ring" was silly when it was new, although it does contain one of the funniest lines ever recorded by an 80's L.A. rock band; the line is directed towards the head (owner? executive editor?) of Spin Magazine, which is really all I can say here.  I can't forget, no matter how much I'd like to, the included version of "Knockin' On Heaven's Door".  After all, it really takes some bit of talent to take a song that was originally less than 3 minutes long and stretch it to 8 minutes long!  And it wasn't a last-minute decision either, as their 1987 MTV concert had them playing this same song four years before they put it on record; actually, it was four years later that the song finally ended and they were able to turn off the tape recorder.    The rest of the album varies from decent to excellent, but hearing how bad the three songs I mentioned above are in comparison to the rest of the CD, it makes it all sounds almost as good as _Appetite For Destruction_...ALMOST...  I among the millions of fans patiently awaiting the next Guns'n'Roses album, _Chinese Democracy_, and no matter how good it is, no matter how many times Axl Rose needs to tweak this or rerecord that, it will NEVER EVER be as good as _Appetite For Destruction_, but I will still buy it the day it's released.  EVER! 
 This is a very good introductory book for stock trading. Its concept of CAN-SLIM system provides an entry point for novice of how to do stock trading. Besides, it also points out many bad habits of major investors which should be avoided. Even for experienced investors, this book is good for review too 
 For those of you who are being selective in which Twilight Zone volumes you're buying; and, you plan on watching this DVD more than once, this is the best.  This volume includes (1) Living Doll (Talking Tina) with Telly Savales, (2) The Fever (a taunting slot machine), (3) The After Hours, with Anne Francis, who is left in a department store after the store closes and all the people have left.  (4) The Dummy (a ventriloquist).  The first 3 are great, the Dummy is OK, but again the first 3 are worth the cost alone.  Also, the fact that you don't have those annoying commercials anymore makes watching Twilight Zone that much better 
 For those listeners who simply can't handle multi-lingual stream of consciousness intrusions into the musical hot licks, this CD should be avoided. For those who don't mind a little Timothy Leary along with the tunes, this will be just fine.  The cover art shows a large group of individuals across several generations, commune style, but basically Group 1850 was a five piece, although I suppose some of those pictured may be significant others doubling as backup singers, accompanists, etc.  The playing is indeed very hot in most places, but it may take some patience to get there since the chants are pretty heavy near the beginning of the work. 
 I found this book to be an excellent guide in developing tools for others to understand IT Project Management.  It is also a great help in teaching others to develop clear, concise requests for proposals seeking contractors  to assist in a project 
 This book is wonderful and contains a vast amount of knowlege. I read and followed the older one written years ago, and it changed my health. Now this one even explains more with greater knowlege in it. I love the new  recipes. I loved both books 
 Fascism is one of the more complex political movements of the past century and one of the more difficult to satisfyingly define.  Philosophers sometimes seek the necessary and sufficient conditions for defining some term or concept.  The problem with fascism is that while there are a number of necessary conditions, they are not in themselves sufficient in designating a movement as fascist.  Fascism is always ultranationalistic, racist, and anti-liberal, but these are features it holds in common with a host of other right wing political movements.  In the end, identifying a movement as fascist is more of an art than a science, akin to the famous definition of obscenity by U. S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart:  "I know it when I see it."  Kevin Passmore's fine book can help one know it when one sees a fascist movement.    It is important to understand this movement for a host of reasons, many of them historical but some of them contemporary.  For instance, calling someone a fascist has become a commonplace of contemporary political vituperation.  In the 2004 election I heard a number of people call Bush a fascist, and while he holds a few positions in common with fascism, they are in the end very few and the differences significant.  Less understandably, I heard more than one right wing commentator call Kerry a fascist, which is beyond comprehension, since he does not espouse a single position that connects with what we understand as fascism.  So we really do need to understand what it means when we properly identify someone as a fascist.  Passmore's approach is primarily to discuss a host of national situations from a historical perspective that were at the time either self-identified as fascist or, in the wake of WW II and the utter discreditation of fascism, that share a significant number of features with pre-WW II fascism.  Obviously this approach means discussing Italian and German fascism, but Passmore also spends a good amount of time on nations that will be unfamiliar to all but serious students of Eastern Europe, such as Romania.  The picture that gradually emerges of fascism is of a movement that is anti-modern, rascist, masculine and anti-feminist, corporatist, rabidly nationalistic, rural rather than urban, largely undemocratic, leans towards a dictatorship, tends to be anti-free market and at the same time anti-trade union, and paramilitary in nature.  What can be bewildering is that not every incarnation of fascism can be characterized by all of these features.  This is less true of pre-WW II fascism than post-war, when movements that are largely fascist have been forced to espouse democratic principles and even claim not to be racist.  In the end, what one gains is not a crystal clear of what is or is not fascism, but a general impression of what might count as a fascist movement.  This is not a well-written book, which is the only complaint I would like to make about it.  The structure is awkward and one chapter does not naturally flow into one another.  There seems to be little rhyme or reason why one bit of the subject is dealt with in one part of the book and not another.  Furthermore, Passmore never really states clearly what he sees as lying at the heart of fascism.  I managed to figure out what he meant by typing out various identifying characteristics as I read through the text, but unless one undertakes some such exercise, one could end the book a bit confused about the whole matter.  Had the book been more clearly structured, it would be a far more valuable introduction to the subject.  In the end, one does get a good sense about fascism, but only if one is willing to work hard towards that end.  The author doesn't help the reader as much as he might have.  Nonetheless, I strongly recommend this book.  Although we are unlikely to see the kind of fascist movements that we saw in the interwar years, it represents tendencies in political thinking that have never really disappeared and persist even today.  We need to be sensitive to these tendencies and prepared to deal with them in the future 
 Lara's life is perfect.  She has everything going for her: she is one of the most popular girls in school, she is beautiful, she has a wonderful boyfriend and her family is great.  Even though she is in high school, her father still calls her his princess and tells her all the time how beautiful she is.  Her mother is thin and beautiful, too, and supports Lara as she enters and wins beauty pageants.  The best night of Lara's life is the night she wins the title of Homecoming Queen as a junior.  She has officially been voted by her peers the most beautiful and the most popular girl in school.  The only thing that makes this night slightly less than perfect is the fact that she tries to help Patty, the fattest girl in school, by offering to exercise with her to help her lose weight.  Patty insults her and rejects her offer.  Lara thinks to herself that Patty, like all fat people, is just too lazy to make any effort to lose the weight.  Soon after homecoming, something awful begins to happen to Lara.  She starts to gain weight.  At first it's just a few pounds she thinks she can diet and exercise off.  But then it's more and more.  The more Lara diets and exercises, the more weight she gains.  Her mother and father don't believe she is trying to lose the weight.  Her father tells her she needs to have more willpower, and he stops calling her princess.  Lara's popularity is disappearing fast, and she can't do anything about it.  How will she adjust to her new life as a fat girl?  I liked the honest treatment of Lara toward the end of the book, when she has gained a bunch of weight.  The author didn't romanticize or try to make it seem like things were still the same for Lara.  Her entire life and all of her happiness was wrapped up in being pretty, so it was reasonable to me that she would struggle a great deal to redefine herself.  Although I didn't like the character of Lara, I thought the way she reacted was the way most teens in her situation would.  Just because she gained weight, it wouldn't necessarily mean she equated herself with others who were overweight.  A prejudice as deep as hers and as accepted in society as hers, would take a great deal of time to dissipate.  It would have seemed unrealistic to me if Lara's perceptions of beauty and worth were radically changed by the end of the book.  
 This was purchased for my granddaughter. I have not seen the DVD, but my daughter tells me that my granddaughter will watch it from start to finish 
 After ploughing thru hundreds, and I mean hundreds of dance CDs, particularly drum n bass ones, I have come to the conclusion that there is no other that comes close to the intensity, energy, ferocity and adrenaline this album pumps. This album is tops! There is no other quite like it....damn 
 If I had to recommend one book that best explains today's current events, I wholeheartedly endorse Dave Hunt's book, "Judgment Day."  I haven't agreed 100 percent with Mr. Hunt over the years and sometimes his writings are tough to understand.    This time I am very impressed.  His writing is clear and concise and he provides irrefutable references for his assertions.  What is especially strong is the array of issues that Hunt weaves into a cohesive theme that proves God is very angry with the world for their mistreatment of the Jews.  Soon He will return not as a suffering savior as He did nearly 2,000 years ago but as a conquering King to rescue the Jews from those who have sought their extermination.   Hunt addresses the rise of Islam and the complete absurdity of the political correctness that proclaims Islam is a religion of peace.  The media and the U.N. refuse to acknowledge that the Palestinian people didn't exist until 50 years ago and that they are pawns to exploit by their fellow Muslims.  The world also forgets history that the Jews were given far more land after World War I than the currently have.  Hunt makes the case that the land is no longer the issue:  If the Jews had one square mile in the Middle East, Islam would want it and see the Jews pushed into the Mediterrean.    Most damning to Islam is that Hunt clearly shows how true Islam is violent and that Muhammad himself spread his religion by the sword.  Hunt demonstrates how poorly Islam treats their women and children.  (Where are the National Organization of Women and Hillary Clinton in ever denouncing Islam for this?)   Two excellent chapters are worth describing.  Chapter 9 describes the parallel between Nazi Germany with Czechsolovakia (1938) and the PLO (today) in painting public opinion and twisting the true story about their land grabbing.  The media conveniently ignores history's lessons about Hitler.  Both Hitler and Arafat were empowered by demons with a lust for killing Jews.   The other notable chapter is Chapter 12 which describes how most of today's churches are very anti-Israel, even if they don't recognize it.  This view called "Replacement Theology" ignores numerous biblical passages that proclaim God is not done with the Jewish people.  Israel has been back in her land since 1948 for a very specific reason:  God's timeline is being set for the return of Jesus Christ to rescue a remnant of the Jews at the Battle of Armageddon.  Too many churches ignore Romans Chapter 11 that the New Testament church is a wild branch grafted into the natural branch (Israel) of the olive tree.  Gentiles are far too arrogant in self-importance and thinking that Israel has been disinherited from God's blessings.  We have forgotten our Jewish roots and God is far from being done with Israel... her very existence as a nation today is the largest sign for this generation to know that Jesus' return is soon to occur.    Lest anyone say that Dave Hunt does not love the Muslim, that is simply not true.  At the end of the book, he clearly and lovingly presents the gospel to the Muslim that the God of the bible is not Allah.  He shows that God's son died to redeem all who claim His shed blood as the payment for our sins.  That is the positive message from Judgment Day.     
 Although not well received by the critics, this sequel to The Last Picture Show is now widely recognised as an excellent film.  Laced with explicit and tacit references to the old days, it rekindles that unique atmosphere so meticulously created by Bogdanovich in the original. There are many contrasts, though. This film is set in summer amid stifling heat while its forerunner was icy cold, with the wild Texas wind howling throughout. The overall feel of the film is similarly hot and potent, a far cry from the desolation of the original.  The characters have moved on too yet many of their traits persist. Duane uncertain, Sonny looking like a lost soul, still seeing his own last picture show in his mind and Jacy elegant yet austere. Lester, still awkward is now a manic banker teetering on the brink of disaster.  Beautifully shot, this really is a commendable effort to continue the story, albeit decades on. The spirits of Benny and Sam the Lion loom large and the transient nature of life is carefully and starkly exposed. 
 An excellent book and a great series quickly sent by seller very happ 
 Great F****** album. I'm tired of people over-reviewing albums that need less talk and more listening. This album is brilliant, both in originality (except for their name) and in musical ability.  Do you try to analyze a cool breeze on a hot day or wish a mountain range could look more majestic? If you do, go ahead and kill yourself because life will continually disappoint you.   This album is great. Enough said 
 I consider myself well read in freethought literature, including all of Paine and much of Ingersoll.  However, Jocoby's breadth knowledge of these and other important freethinkers exceeds mine by leaps and bounds.  Contrary to some of the bad reviews here, I found the prose tightly written and very logical in its presentation.  I hope that all freethinkers read this book.  I can only hope that the general public will read it as well 
 Never have I read a collection of more powerful words between two covers! If you're ready to be changed for the better, if you're ready to stop making excuses and start making your dreams come true then buy this book  and devour every page 
 If you are looking for an exciting 1 hour read this book is surely guaranteed. The simplicity of it is perfect and the story line is pretty good 
    As the previous reviewers have already stated, this story encompasses many plots; all of which are interesting and somehow tie to one another.  Callie Dunbrook, archeologist, out on a dig of a lifetime with a surprise addition to her team - her ex-husband/anthropologist, Jake Graystone.  Not only do Callie and Jake discover each other and the remnants of a lost settlement in the town of Woodsboro, MD, Callie has a bigger surprise in store for her - the discovery of a birth mother, father and brother that could possibly be more fact than fiction.  This story plays many different angles, but Nora ties them all together with some really lovable characters - Doug, Lana, little Ty, Suzanne, Jay, Vivian and Elliott as the parents and siblings as well as the team, and I especially like Digger!  Definitely a Nora book you won't want to miss - Birthright is a great find.     
 Zakk Wylde is one of the few respectable names left in the pure heavy metal scene. This is no nu-metal crap, the album is full of strong riffs and excellent solos. "All for You" kicks the album off, an adreniline-pumping opener with a fret-burning guitar solo near the end; this song is amazing! "Stronger Than Death" is strong too, with backing vocals at the end by baseball player Mike Piazza. The rest of the songs are gauranteed to please Zakk's fans as well, because many have powerful riffs and all of them have at least one guitar solo. I wish Zakk would convince Ozzy to put out material like this. I feel that Zakk's vocals leave much to be desired (they sound like a mix between Phil Anselmo, Layne Staley, and Scott Stapp), I long for Ozzy's glory days of "No More Tears." Zakk should form a full time band dedicated to playing true heavy metal and kicking rap-metal like Limp Bizkit out of the music scene 
 This is a beautiful book about Buddhism, easy to read and understand for everyone 
 As someone can't resist a book, no matter bad, on musicals past, I feel like I've found a new best friend in Ethan Mordden. He knows his subject, thinks for himself and writes extraordinarily well. He's quick to confute the common memory - pointing out the unremembered virtues of Camelot, Funny Girl and even The Unsinkable Molly Brown, yet perceptively skewering Hair, Dear World and Zorba. His identification of trends and repeating patterns is brilliant, and at the same time he gave me several good belly laughs, notably when he referred to Ilya Darling as the culmination of 3000 years of Greek culture. A treasure of a book. I'm ready for the 70s, Mr. Mordden 
 I thought that the secondary plot in this book was a little too much.  It seemed to take up about half of the novel.  A little more time could have been spent on the relationship between Livvy and Ray.  I found Livvy a little to cold towards Ray at times which made me feel as though she didn't deserve him.  Not a nice way to feel while reading a romance 
 If you want to see the evolution of Okinawan Karate from Shuri-te  into Shorin-Ryu, Shoto-Kan , and eventually Korean Tang Soo DO You need to have this book and also Karate Jutsu. Then study Hwang Kees Two texts on Tang Soo Do vol 1 and 2 and you'll see Tang Soo Do is the Korean version of Shoto-Kan (which is nothing to be ashamed of). Even though the Koreans don't like to admit it, there's no question where Tang Soo Do's roots lie and it's not in a 2000 year old Korean art or anything Mstr. Kee learned in China! You will also see the changes that evolved, from the High original stances of Okinawan karate (Karate Jutsu) that Funakoshi was taught by Itosu, to the deeper and longer stances that later developed in shoto-kan, as well as many Shoto-isms particular to both styles such as Pinan 1 and 2 being reversed from Itosu's original order. You'll notice the single index finger knife hand blocks in Seishan Kata (Hangetsu), which modern Shoto-kan no longer uses but Tang Soo Do still does, the commonality of the total kata and the overall simularity which is remarkable especially when Tang Soo Do's leaders and most Koreans refuse to admit it.  
 The item, I know for a fact is a quality one, because a friend of mine has it. Thus, the rating. BUT, I warn you now... I ordered this item October 28th, 2006. It is now January 31 2007- and they have been yet to even SHIP this item out to me! So if you can, try to get this from another seller. I am very unsatisfied with Amazon 
 I bought this book and an audio tape arrived so straight away you have some insight into me. The tape is good quality and a great listen. However if you are looking for the elusive silver bullet prehaps you need to look elsewhere, prehaps into yourself. The foundation of this tape is that success in sales stems from personal integerity projected from you onto the prospect.Prehaps i'm naive but just refering to a customer as a prospect somehow casts a shaddow of doubt on the notion of integerity. All in all if you are interested in a career in sales this is worth the price and if you are already a soul dead professional prehaps you might just glean some iota of truth from the ideal that joe expounds but just dosen't quite get. I gave it four stars because three seemed too low.Certain aspects deserve five star plus Please excuse spellings 
 Some books age like vintage wines, gathering a film of dust thatdisuse protects until that happy "discovery" by an oldfriend.  Rollo May's "The Courage to Create" was written in1975 - in a time when the presence of the atom bomb created an anxietythat prevented people to create for a future that was unsure, at best.Now in 2000, twenty five years of cosmic angst have intensified to afear of the limits of even a glimpse of a future and it is reaffirmingto return to Rollo May to regain the courage to "rage against thedying of the light." In eloquent but inordinately accessiblelanguage May surveys the entire concept of Creativity with terse, wellselected passages from Plato and the ancients to Cezanne to Tillichand Kierkegard and Thomas Wolfe. This is not a "How To" bookor self-help rapid- read to solve superficial problems.  This littlebook, when read slowly and thoughtfully, guides us through conceptsthat allow us to regain a state of positive thinking in a time when itis far more popular to dwell on our day to day foibles and transientmisjudgements.  The discovery of the self is his most importantdriver, yet he doesn't stop there.  Taking that newly discovered selfand building the courage to acknowledge encounters, engagements,epiphanies, and a usable acceptance of limits - this sounds so simplein a review, but when May has your complete attention, more happens tous than just learning about creativity: we learn about reallyliving. .... 
 This is an excellent book.  It gives the Sanskrit for each of the 200 sutras, then the English translation, followed by a comment by Swami Satchidananda.  These comments are essential for helping make some of sutras more understandable.  I would highly recommend this book 
 This book has colorful illustrations and is a lot of fun to read with children. The child I gave it to loved that the pages feature cut outs so you can see what the old lady swallowed. All around, a great book 
 This film is easily in the Top 5 of Fritz Lang's best films, and quite possibly his #1 best sound film as well.  In addition to being Lang's debut sound film, it was also Germany's very first sound film, and really goes to show the benefits of having waited a little while to move away from silents and into sound pictures.  Almost every sound film from the late Twenties and very early Thirties suffers from a static camera and almost nonstop chatter, as though film-making just went backwards in time by about 30 years and reverted back to being filmed stage plays instead of true "motion pictures."  But by 1931, a number of those wrinkles had been ironed out, and what resulted is an absolute masterpiece.  And unlike a number of directors working in those very early years of sound, Lang struck a very good balance between dialogue scenes and scenes of relative silence.  He knew that the actors didn't have to be talking nonstop for it to be a good film worth watching.  Of course, the director is only one part of the film's genius; the actors are brilliant too, in particular Peter Lorre, who truly gave the performance of his career even though it was his first starring role.  The film also really sets the stage for the later film noir genre, what with the terrific shadows, lighting, and suspenseful mood and atmosphere.  The film does start out a little slowly, but before long it gets more and more intense and compelling.  The plot needs time to be established and for the viewer to be fully drawn into it.  Lang did suspense and crime thrillers so well, and this film is no exception.  A child murderer is on the loose, and with no answers in sight, the townspeople become paranoid and bloodthirsty, particularly when it comes to those whom they already know are criminals.  The people in the underworld suffer the most from all of these paranoid accusations, and so resent how their community is suffering that they resolve to not only find the murderer themselves, but to do it all without any help from the police, who in turn have no idea what these criminals are up to.  Even criminals have standards; it's often said that child rapists and murderers are reviled by "ordinary" criminals because that goes far beyond the pale of the things they did.  When the criminals finally track down Hans Beckert, the murderer, at a warehouse, they tie up the night watchmen so they won't alert the police, so insistent are they on capturing him by themselves, even as they race to find him and get everyone back out before the police might get there.  The final section of the film, in the criminals' kangaroo court, is one of the most powerful scenes ever set to film.  One starts out feeling repugnance at this menace, this person who molests and kills children, but by the time the film is up, one can't help but feel sorry for him, or at least see him as a human being.  We never see him hurting children, and don't even see his face right away.  He's not shown as a monster or an evil person; indeed, who would ever suspect that such a baby-faced rotund man would be a child molester or murderer?  The treatment of him is surprisingly progressive for the era.  While what he's done isn't being excused or apologised for, he's ultimately shown to be a victim himself, a very sick man haunted by this monster inside of him, doing these horrible horrible things because of it, only finding peace when he's committing these criminal acts.  Is he any worse than these career criminals who have chosen to live this lifestyle, people who could have become bank tellers, teachers, or doctors, people who had a choice because they didn't have this monster constantly following them?  This must have been a positively revolutionary idea in 1931, when many people blamed people like Beckert instead of considering that there might be medical or scientific reasons for it, when criminals were given no sympathy and viewed as unreformable menaces to society instead of human beings who were made prisoners by something beyond their control.  It's the kind of film that stays with one long after viewing it, and only gets better with multiple viewings.  Extras include audio commentary, an interview with Fritz Lang a year before his death (once again he tells the  tall tale of his meeting with Goebbels and how he left Germany late at night with barely any money, never to return until after WWII, even though his passport and other historical evidence paint a quite different picture!), the mini-documentary 'A Physical History of M,' a gallery of pictures, stills, and drawings, an interview with Harold Nebenzal (son of producer Seymour Nebenzal), a ten-minute version of 'M' made by Claude Chabrol, and excerpts from discussions editor Paul Falkenberg had with students in his film class as they watched the film.  Overall, this is a must-see for anyone interested in film history; one can't claim to be a true student of classic film and never have seen it.  This film also seems to enjoy the distinction of being one of those films that just about everyone agrees is a classic and a terrific film, instead of one of those films that people are divided on about if it's great or if it's just overrated 
 I Find this book of daily reading is a great way to start my day. There is scripture and some uplifting humor in a short form for a busy day 
 What can I say,this album only has 1 weak track and that one is the 1st track,Country Thang,is just not up to John's caliber of songs we are used too. But from 2 to 10 take your pick everyone is awesome. There are 4 songs that should be put out as singles and just stick out a little more than the others. The title track Pictures,is another I Swear,I Wanna Be There,another-Little Girl(penned by the same writer),Believe In Me is just another classic JMM love song and I Got You To Thank For That,is just what we JMM fans have been hopeing for in a radio great sounding upbeat tempo song. Everyone of those songs belong to put out on country radio and those stupid country PD's acrosss the country should give him #1 songs,they are that special. There is quite alot of fun tracks that have people talking,Love and Alcohol and Four Wheel Drive,fun uptempo great songs.But,last but not least the great new song ,Til Nothing Comes Bewtween Us,is just another great love song,JMM seems to have a knack of picking out. Should become another top 10 hit for him,but it probably won't becuase the Country PD"s don't like JMM becuase he doesn't kiss ...  for anything or anyone,which takes him out of big hit category,like country fav's Kenny Chesney and TimMcGraw. I listen to both of their recent entries and believe me,JMM rules and is a million times plus better than those. Buy this one,JMM has done it again!!!A+ material JMM!! Buy IT!! If you don't you will be missing out on the best album to come out of Nashville all year long 
 This book is the most important work on philosophy that I have seen in many years.  Taken together with their much earlier _Metaphors We Live By_ their treatment left very little to be desired.  If you have an interest in psychology of philosophy I would strongly recommend that you take the time to review those works.  The basic model that is presented in these books is further extended into the politcal realm in Lakoff's _Moral Politics, and into the realm of mathematics in Lakoff and Nunez's _Where Mathematics Comes From_.  The incredible consistentency and workability of their arguments across all these subject areas really validates their basic premise and leaves the reader with a greater ability to understand themselves and other people in many different circumstances.  It's true as some other reviewers state that a portion of _Philosophy in the Flesh_ have appeared before their other works, and that some of the principal ideas appear in a  different form from other writers like the existentialist Martin Heidigger but nowhere else have I ever seen such a comprehensive, consistent and realistic view of the underlying conceptual processes that have produced Western Philosophy and how they ultimately resulted in serious errors that have been replicated again and again across the centuries 
 This book is full of insight into human behaviour in general  and  gives a lot of reasons as to why our society is the way that it is. This book takes you back to when it all started! You can't truly understand feminism until you've read it. Shulamith Firestone doesnt just point the finger at society she gives us reasons as to how we got to where we are. 
 The living legend Ric Flair is represented very well here on 3 DVD's that highlight his career from AWA to present. I'm also reading Ric's book and for the price I picked it up used it's a GREAT purchase to go along with this set. I'm enjoying this DVD set and can highly recommend it to his fans.  Below is the reason why I got this DVD, and my brief personal meeting with The Nature Boy. I stand by those words and I'm now one of his biggest fans, as a Wrestler and as a Celebrity. Wooooooooo!!!!  Am I into wrestling?, well no. Have I watched it before?, yes many times, often when getting pretty drunk buzzed and I find it very entertaining at times (when I have not seen it for a while). Did I like Ric Flair when I would watch him, I don't think so, he was the cheater so I always went for the "good" guy like the Hulkster (you had to love his character (Flair's) before the match though, The Nature Boy would crack me up). But let me tell you why I really like Ric Flair now. In the late fall of 2004 Ric Flair came to the Middle East along with some other wrestlers (David Benoit, and some wrestling babes), and did a signing and picture event for the troops at the base I was at. I had JUST got back from Iraq (the base he came to and I was at than was in Qatar, not a shooting zone like Iraq), and fortunately we were allowed 2 beers a day there. Before the signing, Ric really said some stuff that impressed me, calling out the lefties in this country that would sacrifice the efforts being made in the Middle East to gain politically, he called it like it was and is! Well, after the pics (which I've got a great one with Ric),  Ric and David hung out for some beers and amazingly most of the crowed had left and I got to hang out with these guys! They were really down to earth and I really got the sense that they were fully supportive of the troops, not like the crap you hear from these protestors that "support" the troops but hate the mission. Well, that's my real memory of Ric Flair and he's #1 in my book from now on! Just like Ann Margaret is loved by thousands of Vietnam War Vets, Ric Flair I'm sure gained some followers who are Iraqi Freedom Vets like me. Wooooooo 
 "The Body of Jonah Boyd" begins in the late 60s and is narrated by Judith Denham, known as 'Denny' to her friends. Denny is single, and she works as a secretary for Dr. Ernest Wright, a Psychology professor at Wellspring University in California. The fact that Denny is having an affair with Ernest doesn't really interfere with her friendship with Ernest's wife, Nancy. Denny gradually becomes one of the "strays" invited to the Wrights' wonderful home every Thanksgiving. Denny, as a wistful outsider, makes the perfect narrator of the odd events that occur in the house on Thanksgiving on 1969. The Wrights are expecting Nancy's long-term friend, Anne to visit with her new husband, famous novelist Jonah Boyd. Nancy longs to see her old, slightly estranged friend, and see whether or not Anne has changed. Denny wants to meet Anne, as she feels somewhat challenged by Nancy's much older--and supposedly deeper--friendship.  Anne has gone sadly downhill since Nancy last saw her. Glib, slick Jonah Boyd attempts to cover the fact that their marriage is less than perfect, but it's obvious to everyone that Anne is unhappy. She frets and sulks while Jonah entertains Denny and the Wrights by reading from his soon-to-be published novel. The Wright's precocious youngest son, Ben is a would-be-poet, and Jonah adopts a mentoring role while wooing various household members with his largesse. The only person to remain unimpressed is Anne. When Jonah's notebooks containing the only copy of his next novel, go missing, the household slides into an uproar. The mystery of the notebooks fractures many lives for decades to come.  "The Body of Jonah Boyd" is a brilliantly executed novel. Denny is the uninvolved narrator who is privy to the events of the fateful Thanksgiving, and these events have powerful ramifications thirty years later. Author David Leavitt explores such complex issues as the creative process, the writer's sacrifice for art, guilt, the balance of power within a marriage, and family loyalty in just over two hundred pages of this marvelously woven tale. Leavitt's characters leap to life off the page, and the story is both credible and satisfying--displacedhuman 
 I was very disappointed with Gabaldon's previous book, The Fiery Cross, and had a hard time getting through it.  It didn't feel fun, exciting or sexy, as her previous books had.  But I picked up this new book anyway and am VERY glad that I did.  It was a fast read, didn't get bogged down, had enjoyable and interesting characters.  Can't wait to get the next book in the Lord John series.  Highly recommend.  
 Good insight and enjoyable reading. End of chapter summaries saves time on reviewing the useful information. This should be read by anyone taking a business trip to China 
 This is the first book I have read by this author but I have to admit, I want to go back and read his previous three books now.  The story progresses beautifully and in such a way that you really believe the characters.  I got really sucked in to this book and am still thinking about the characters several days later--they really get to you.  Roeder really knows how to create a heart wrenching story line with characters you feel deeply for.  I felt a wide range of strong emotions as the plot unfolded and the characters revealed their inner thoughts and feelings.    Anyone who loves gay fiction will love this book, I promise.  The one critique I can offer now is that I found it extremely annoying that there were so many typos, misuse of words and misspelled words in the book.  It had the effect of pulling me out of the story.  All in all, a great book.  I hope to see these characters in following works by Roeder. 
 A Great look and extra insight into the wonderful characters that Big and Little Edie Beale were.  They are presented in a much less exaggerated way from the original documentary "Grey Gardens".  A very down to earth look into these two very eccentric and remarkable women. You've got to love them. This would be a great addition to your Beale Library 
 Of the numerous works and studies on this CD, "Philomel" stands out the most.  Remember that this was one of the earliest symphonic works involving synthesized sound.  Babbitt labored for years on a rickety punch-card era machine without preset channels or sampled sound, beginning from scratch sometime around 1960.  It took that long to get the sound that he was looking for.   Regarding the other works on this CD: Sadly, even with the playability of Phon. for Soprano & Piano, Post-Partitions, and even Reflections, these are almost never selected for performance. Post-Partitions is attractive for Babbitt's use of "dyads," if we can even apply that term to music.  
 Working in an IT company catering to bankers I bought this book to help understand their lingo. I have to say it hasn't disappointed yet. It is also very up to date the latest IT/banking terms. If you were to read all the definitions in this book you would probably know more than you banker. A great reference. Buy it 
 Making the point that someone quirky can still be an achiever, Norm Ledgin has selected 13 famous figures from the 18th through 20th Centuries who had all the earmarks of Asperger's.  They succeeded nonetheless.  I doubt there's a young person with such a condition out there who will fail to draw comfort and inspiration from this book.  As a teacher, I know how tough it is to inspire, but Asperger's and Self-Esteem does that 
 This album is Egg plus Steve Hillage at 17! Though the band did a lot of bar gigging from 1967 to its demise, this is a legendary psychidelic (sp?) recording. Steve Hillage is what stands out as an inventive musician, hanging right with his time. This is worth owning from a historical perspective. Here the beginnings of the canterbury scene (sort of)! This is better than Egg's first album, but not quite as intense as The Polite Force a year later. The feel of the album is a 1968 acid trip; very intense to a novice ear and probable scary too. They all go under psyeudonyms as the had already sign a contract with  Deram minus Hillage. Again, you won't want to listen to this everyday...but every once in a while. Great spin 
 I'm so happy I took a chance and bought this item, it's exactly what I needed.   I bought the small/medium in black and it has a circumference of 23 3/4 Inches (60cm). The Headband is curved, at the widest point it is 3 inches and narrows to 2 1/4 inches. The width of 3 inches, is sufficient to completely cover my ears. It is only 3% Elastine, so there is a minimal stretch and it doesn't feel tight against my head, nor is it too loose to require constant adjusting. It sits comfortably, the polar fleece is what I would call a micro polar fleece - it has a small short pile and doesn't feel cheap.   I have worn this headband in temperatures as low as 15 Degrees Fahrenheit and it keeps my ears warm. Unlike earmuffs I can wear the headband indoors, it's one less Winter accessory that I have to remove whenever I step inside a building 
 If this is your first Suzanne Brockmann novel, STOP! The "Troubleshooters" series is best read in sequence.  The characters are reappearing and their stories build through out the books.  Understanding the history of the storyline is most significant in "Gone Too Far" which explains the discrepancy in the previous reviews.   I always appreciate the characterization which Ms. Brockmann utilizes in her stories.  She is a superb story teller who teases her readers with bits and pieces of stories about old and new characters.  This makes her series a pleasure to read for those who have traveled with her along her journey... but can be frustrating and confusing to others who come in during the middle of things.   After reading the entire series in a frenzied month or two, I personally hope to read more about Sam and Alyssa in the future.    
 The concept of this book is simple and correct. The negative reviews forget that this is a book about advertising, and not about finding a cure for cancer.   The author lays out various aspects of his main concept (people have to love the brand, as every apple head knows) with great efficiency of words and pictures. This guy is obviously a master of his game 
 Taylor is an important voice in today's philosophical community- one that refuses to give in to the excesses of either postmodern relativism or extreme conservatism.  Instead, with "Sources of the Self", (expanding on "The Ethics of Authenticity"), he's written an important summary of the evolution of moral ideas from the ancient virtue-hierarchies of the Greeks, through the communitarian great chain of medieval philosophy, to the independent "I" of modernity.  In doing so, he explains the strengths of modern ethics:  -the "hypergoods" of liberty, equality, and freedom of expression.  -the "sanctification" of ordinary life (esp. as it stems from the Protestant reformation)  -the pursuit of scientific inquiry and it's benefits to modern life.  He also, however, points out the problems that occur when modernity's "focus" on the self turns into the narcissistic "obsession" with self of the Romantics and postmodernists.  I highly recommend this book to philosophical liberals as one of the best defenses of modern liberalism in print, to scholars of philosophy as an important history of the evolution of the idea of the self, and to fans of the works of Jurgen Habermas and Ken Wilber, both of whom also deal extensively with issues tackled in this book 
 Born To Steal: When the Mafia Hit Wall Street, by Gary Weiss  "During Wall Street's big bull market, there were brokers in $3,000 suits, billion-dollar IPO's and twenty-year-olds making $500,000 a month." - First sentence of the inside flap.   That says it all. As a former Wall Streeter (1990-2001) I can surely attest that there was an abundance of temptation to enter the "dark side" and this book wraps up that temptation in a captivating, tell-it-as-it-is account of the lure to the dark side of the 90's on Wall Street. I know people mentioned in the book and could write volumes about the wildness that went on; from 25 year olds in $150,000 cars dropping 20k on a average night out to brokers going out for a night and ending up in the Bahamas for a week and calling NY for a wire because they spent every dime and don't even have enough to make it back.   You've got to love it when a factual book reads like a work of fiction, which this book does. I am always on the lookout for books that tell such a story that you say to yourself, how the hell did he do that or this is so crazy that I can barely believe it.   Wall Street is a very small Street and word travels fast, and as the 90's wore on they just kept getting wilder and crazier. The book brings you into a time when a runaway market made it easy for scamsters to camouflage their manipulation because large moves in stocks were happening every day.  John Q public was more apt to believe the tales of these boiler room or bucket shop brokers, if you can call them that because half of them weren't even registered or licensed. The sad thing is, in the 90's it was just as easy to build a legit book of business and make huge commissions the honest way. I guess the lure of easy money was just to much for those with weak morals and values and a distorted sense of right and wrong.   It's interesting and entertaining to re-visit the shenanigans of the last decade, but you can't help but feel sorry for Louis Pasciuto as he slips deeper and deeper into the clutches of the dark side.   Mostly I read, and write about business stories. This book was a bit of a break for me but it's about a time, place and people that I remember vividly. When I finished it I read, Mob Over Miami: The Shocking True Story of Chris Paciello-from Staten Island Thug, to South Beach Club King, to Witness Against the Mob and Clubland: The Fabulous Rise and Murderous Fall of Club Culture.

 Buy whatever Ajax primer you want, work with it, get excited about it, but before you use it in a real application, buy and read this book. Never expect to learn about a subject from a patterns book, just expect to leapfrog some painful learning experiences. This book helps you jump from experienced beginner to reasonable competence status without having to build a lot of bad applications first 
 bell hooks contextualizes feminism within the different realms of class and race. a very good, critical and comprehensive look at feminis 
 Five thousand years of human history explained.  Reading the book you are struck by the realization that despite all the changes since the dawn of civilzation we have not changed and all our 'modern" problems are not so modern. The answers are available in ancient texts and explained in modern terms. A must read. 
 I am not a mom so at first I was a little hesitant to buy this book - boy am I glad that I did! I was just looking for an overview on all the steps required in designing a product and getting it into the market place.  Seldom, if ever have I been so satisfied that an author comes through with a book that is clear, concise, informative, thorough, full of information, resources and real life examples.  I thought this book was WONDERFUL 
 Twelve-year-old Veronica "Ronnie" Swan is used to babysitting her younger sisters while her parents are out running errands. Her family lives in a settlement in Utah too small to be called a town, surrounded by members of the Mormon church to which they belong -- their life is a peaceful one, a life of faith, solitude, and simplicity.  But a game of hide-and-seek while she's babysitting her sisters changes Ronnie's life forever.  The novel begins as Ronnie is called out from her hiding place by her sisters' strange silence, only to find Becky and Ruthie lying on the ground beside the picnic table, blood like "great dark pools of paint" gushing from their slashed throats.  Their killer -- later identified as Scott Early -- is sitting beside her sisters, mumbling to himself, still holding the scythe he used to kill them.    Scott Early is diagnosed with schizophrenia and is sentenced to spend three years in a mental hospital, a verdict that Ronnie can't accept.  She is angry, and she can't let go of the guilt she feels for being unable to save her sisters.  Just before Scott Early is released from the mental institution,  Ronnie's parents decide to offer him their forgiveness -- but Ronnie refuses to accompany them.  She can't forget what Scott Early did, and she can't forgive him.    But her life will forever be intertwined with that of her sisters' killer.  Four years later, when she has enough credits to graduate from high school, she is drawn to San Diego, where Scott Early lives with his wife and infant daughter. Ronnie begins taking classes to become an EMT, and she convinces Scott Early's wife to hire her as a nanny for their daughter, Juliet.  Once she has settled herself in the Earlys' life, Ronnie beings to plan her revenge on her sisters' killer -- and you won't believe the results.  Talk about a roller-coaster of emotions:  CAGE OF STARS takes you through them all.  After the earth-shattering opening scene, the reader is left feeling devastated and heartbroken and utterly involved in the Swans' grief.  And Mitchard keeps us there, relentlessly, by giving us a narrator so believable and sympathetic we can't help but be hooked.  Ronnie's voice is pure and childlike; her tone is conversational and forthright; her observations are are both simple and wise beyond her years.  Her innocence will break your heart.  And in addition to giving readers a brilliant heroine, Mitchard also gives us a complicated, sympathetic villain.  She brings us inside Scott Early's life, makes us understand his illness -- and while we don't root for Scott Early, we do pity him, and, unlike Ronnie, we don't begrudge him his happiness or his family.  In CAGE OF STARS, Mitchard has taken us inside the Mormon community, a religion little-explored in contemporary fiction but much persecuted in the mainstream media.  She debunks lots of stereotypes about Mormons here, as well as gives interesting information about their beliefs. A Mormon community (or any religious community, for that matter) is the perfect place to set a story like CAGE OF STARS:  a story with forgiveness and redemption at its heart.  I tore through this book in a day; I just couldn't put it down.  And when I reached the perfectly-nuanced ending, I couldn't help but shed a tear for the characters.  CAGE OF STARS is a powerful, moving book about the nature of forgiveness, and I'd definitely recommend it 
 First, note that this book is NOT written by Kathy Reichs, the original creator of the Temperance Brennan character. (Hopefully, Amazon will fix that error on the page.) This novel is a spin-off from the TV series BONES, and should not be confused with the novels written by Reichs.  Compared with Reichs's books, this falls far short, naturally. It's just a fun read for those of us who are utterly addicted to the TV series and need a fix to hold us over between episodes! Actually, this book doesn't do complete justice to the characters on screen, either, but it ain't bad for capturing the repartee and chemistry between Brennan and Booth.  Like I said, if you're addicted to the show like me, this book comes in handy when you're waiting for season 1 on DVD or stuck in the days that stretch long between Wednesdays (or thru the baseball playoffs!) 
 I can't believe I didn't know anything about this time in US History before.  The Chicago fair as background to a serial killer is facinating.  This book is very well written.  You'd think a book about architecture might be dry, but its really not at all.  Highly recommend this book.  Its a slo a great book for a book club 
 If you're considering selling on Amazon, this book is a fantastic, comprehensive resource. If you already sell on Amazon, you'll find plenty of off-the-beaten-path tips and tricks, as well as a good helping of fundamentals that you may need to be reminded of. Great info on "word of mouth" trends, the marketing power of product reviews (and writing them for others), and much more 
 I have these shoes....also in black, pink, and white. I found them to be really comfortable...I have a narrow foot and they fit me fine.  They tend to be a little stiff when you first get them, but once you break them in you can't live without them.  
 I felt like I was reading the author's diary. She writes so openly and lets us into her world of adoption, motherhood, and farm life. Throughout the book I stopped to read something funny to my husband and he would say, "keep going." He enjoyed this book as much as I did 
 Super extra fine if you want to know a convergence of the Trut 
 If you enjoy the plot twists and legal thrills that Grisham's books generally bring, this short novel might let you down.  There is little adventure and no surprises in Bleachers, a look into a small sleepy Texas town that finds its identity in its football program.  Though not Grishamesque, the book is well written and enjoyable to read.  The small Texas town and the characters that live there are undeniably real and the image Grisham puts into the minds of the readers through is pen is very vivid.  The football fan will enjoy the many pages of play-by-play of a football game communicated through a radio announcer.  Not only a novel about football and small town politics, the author explores other themes such as the power of expectations, death, the importance of discipline in life, and the value of relationships.     
 For someone I'd never heard of before, Hillary Carlip manages to drop an awful lot of big-time, not-so-big-time and used-to-be-big-time names. Which is not a complaint. It's actually one of the things that makes the book so enjoyable. A warning though. It will make you feel like your average, go to school, go to college, get a normal job life was a horrible mistake. But then, you probably already knew that 
 I am 23 and plan to teach at the secondary level, but when we read this book in one of my education classes I knew I had to share it.  I bought it, went to a first grade classroom and they were hooked.  Many wanted to hear it again, others wanted to get a copy for themselves, still others just wanted to look at the magnificent pictures again.  It is a fabulous book and a wonderful story 
 This is a rich anthology with many fine pieces in it. But it does not always contain the best selections , the funniest things of the writer's in question. I suspect part of this is that the writers- anthologizers could not for instance get permission to use a selection from Philip Roth's Portnoy, or Bellow's 'Herzog' or 'Henderson' or 'Seize the Day'. Interestingly they have two selections from Woody Allen but not a single one from Bellow. I also would have liked to have seen a selection from 'The Catcher in the Rye' ( though I understand that Salinger though Halachically Jewish does not self- identify as Jewish). There are so much else that could have been in the anthology including samples of the work  of the long list of great American  Jewish comedians. Nonetheless there are many very enjoyable pieces in this very fine anthology. 
 I bought this and another new cartridge for a long plane trip.  My almost 4 year old played this one over and over and over again.  She LOVES it.  She played it all the way across the country, most of the week while we traveled, and all the way back.  And she's still playing it.  HINT: I only allow the Leapster for travel, never in the house.  It's the one toy that she never tires of after over a year 
 I think this is the best book to conclude this series. READ IT!!!!!!!!!!! 
 This is the tenth novel in the mystery series featuring Marcus Didius Falco, an informer and sleuth in Rome at the time of Vespasian. A series of books that have become hugely popular, so much so that the author is now at the forefront of historical mystery writers. It was probably a stroke of genius on her part to have novels that are extremely well researched and contain all the elements  that would be and should be found in  the Roman world of circa AD70, but to have a lead character who has the vocabulary of a present day New York cop. In this the tenth novel Falco and Helena Justina now have a baby girl (Three Hands in the Fountain)  It is AD73 and the Emperor Vespasian has come up with a good idea for making money. Why not hold a census, after all if the senate know who everyone is and where they live it will be much easier to impose taxes on them. Falco and Partner become Censors. Well someone has to do it. There job is to investigate fraudulent claims, a messy, but lucrative business.   Unfortunately for Falco his `partner' is none other than Anacrites, a no good low life and palace spy. While investigating the people who run the gladiator schools and wild beast shows, Falco is involved in the mysterious death of a lion, an escaped leopard and a dead gladiator. There is much rivalry among the  men who organise the vast games in Rome. It is a cut throat world where life is cheap and killing a man comes as second nature to many of the people involved in Falco's latest case 
 This book neatly breaks down the pros and cons of "home improvement" projects that may or may not increase the value of your home. It's easy and a pleasure to read and crammed with valuable insight (e.g., let's just say that I'll think twice before installing an in-ground pool). I highly recommend it! 
 I love disaster movies, or any disaster movie that involves water - Titanic, Hard Rain, Titanic, Pearl Harbour, Titanic ... Yeah I love Titanic. But I was shocked when watching this film how much Titanic resembles it! There's a lot where you can see where James Cameron might have got some of his ideas from.  I felt very claustrophobic watching this film, not only were we watching it in the darkness, but there were also fireworks going off outside, and the film itself is very claustrophobic. There's no natural light, as the boat is capsized.  I had an awful time recognising actors in this, particularly Gene Hackman. I knew the name, I could NOT pick out which one he was. (Very blonde moment there.) I eventually recognised him, cos he was the main character (big clue there), and he was also using Simon Cowell's fashion sense - high waisted trousers, and polo neck TUCKED IN. I don't know why it took me so long to recognise him, but I managed to recognise Ernest Borgnine, who played Rogo, as being in Little House In The Prairie, in one or two episodes.  The Poseidon Adventure is a really good film, with no need for special effects or CGI, apart from the odd one or two. Nearly all the stunts were performed by the actors themselves, when possible, and they would have ended up with many bumps. What made this film all the more better was the lack of special effects, and it made it all the more real. I was holding my breath during many scenes - which was quite difficult considering I was blocked up with the cold at the time - and because it was so claustrophobic, it made it all the more worse.  The Poseidon Adventure is definitely up there as one of my favourite disaster movies now, and I really look forward to seeing the sequel, and the 'remake'.  And I just discovered by looking at IMDB, that Red Buttons (what a strange name) was also in Little House On The Prairie, in two episodes 
 Beyond being an all-inclusive portrait of Andy, this book breaks down the public, trends and the superficiality of fame and fortune. I loved this book. It was as addictive as the National Inquirer and as informative as the Times 
 I bought these glasses for my husband and we both are very happy with them.  These are a great value and really do enhance your wine experience.  We were so pleased with these that I bought him the white wine set too.  Buy these and enjoy 
 One of the funniest books i have ever read!  when i first started reading Terry Pratchett's Discworld Series i couldn't believe i had gone through my life without knowing his books were out there.  i am an ultimate film fan and i cracked up at all the references.  this was to movie fans what Soul Music was to music lovers.  Discworld is for everyone who loves mystery, adventure, and above all, a good laugh 
 This novel is not just the story of the idealist probation officer Steven Baum versus the sociopath crack addict and drug dealer Darryl King but a story of a city (New York) where the melting pot society is divided by races, greed, social classes, poverty, corruption and absence of moral values.  Most than a "slow motion riot", the author picture a city sat on a time bomb where the criminality, violence and corruption are keep at bay or ignored with some "legal" methods without any intention of erradicate it, where minorities lost hope in the system and are induced to criminal activities and delinquency because of unemployment, low education rates, poverty, low salaries, dependency of social aid and segregation.  A very explicit message for those who still dream with a more equalitarian society and for those who already lost hope in society and are paying the consequences of that cruel reality 
 Fludd was my first Hilary Mantel book, and I'm thrilled there are a half-dozen or so for me to read. I hope they're equally funny and creative. Mantel offers a vivid portrait of the dismal little town of Fetherhoughton, its spiritually troubled residents and the mysterious stranger who shakes things up for everyone. Although the scope of the story is small, I was completely caught up in the world of the atheist Father Angwin, the confused young Sister Philomena and, of course, the enigmatic Fludd. As an added bonus, the book is occasionally laugh-out-loud funny 
 this is extremly good book for anyone who is new to moderately experienced in linux. instead of going through all the howto and man pages this book does the job well. extremely well written for subject like system administration 
 "...Queen Maeve...sent  the hero of legend, the great warrior Cuchulainn to capture the Brown Bull of Cuailnge..." Such a large error for a great book,supposedly greatly researched. Queen Maeve sent Ferdiad (Cuchulllian's best friend) and a army to steal The Brown Bull. Cuchullian slew his best friend  in heroic single combat, protecting the bull 
 This book is revolutionizing the way I garden.  I have learned so much about how to work with the soil and not be concerned about the bugs I see there.  I am composting with knowledge and a purpose instead of composting just because.  Highly recommend this book for beginners or long-term gardeners.  This will challenge the way you have gardened...in a good way 
 This is one of the most beautiful pop-up books I have ever seen.  As an adult without children, I have to say I would not want them handling it, as the work is so intricate and fragile.  I wouldn't give this book to a child under 12 or so.  That said, this book is truly a delight and a wonder and well worth owning.  I don't know how the authors do it but they're amazing!  Don't hesitate to buy it...just keep it away from your two-year-old.  R-r-r-i-i-i-p!! 
 I ordered this book because it looked interesting....well, it is!  It is a wonderful idea book.  It gives minimal instructions for creating garments out of found clothing (sweaters), but it is jam-packed with the neatest ideas and everything is doable with minimum skills.  What is especially nice is that the photographs, writers, models are not from the U.S.  It is always nice to really get a look into the style of people from different countries.  Excellent book and "search" offered by amazon does not highlight the best parts.  Do not go by the minimal pages that are offered as a sneak peek 
 My son likes it so much, I think it is a great stuf 
 Its been 4 years I believe since the last "issue" of ANL and the wait has been difficult. #16 is finally here and overall its worthwhile. The printing, binding, and colors are all top-notch and the full presentation is everything I expect from Ware plus more. One doesn't simply own an edition of ANL, one cherishes the package and makes room for it on the bookshelf. Again, bravo.  Rusty Brown's story is off to a slow start but it features all the Ware trademarks and then some. We see glimpses of what's to come, I think, but for me the "bang" wasn't fully present in the here-and-now. Rusty's father's dilemma unfolded, well, "glacially" as Ware himself puts it on the cover, and almost felt as if we got one word per page to make up a full sentence (I jest but the feeling is there...) Rusty's inner thoughts are much more interesting and his obsession with "Supergirl" is exactly what I expect from Ware: revealing, embarrassing, and oh-so-true, dammit. Our author-artist hits you between the eyes with his childhood foibles and though it often stings quite painfully you cannot look away. The truth is out there.  I appreciated the double storyline effect on the pages and immensely appreciated the overlapping of the storylines from different points of view (always loved that literary tool).  Again, I gave this 4 stars because I felt there could have been more meat here and still have fulfilled Ware's own slow approach to his points. I was done reading and observing much more quickly then I find is normal and comfortable with an ANL pamphlet.  Please, Mr. Ware, give us volume 17 in relatively short order 
 I read it when one of my kids had to read it. A great story and brings up a lot of American history for teaching and learning (about the Gold Rush) 
 Introduction 	How many of you have ever played basketball? Well, Bix Rivers doesn't even know what it is, however he is an athletic kid so Jerome Foxworthy decides to teach Bix how to play basketball. Book Information 	The book I read is The Moves Make the Man, it was written by Bruce Brooks. The genre of this book is sports-fiction.  Main Characters 	The main characters are Bix Rivers and Jerome Foxworthy. Bix's conflict is he hates lying. Jerome's conflict is whether or not he should be a friend with Bix. Bix is a good, athletic kid, who loved baseball, but has many violent mood swings. Bix likes baseball and made the game bounce ball. Jerome is a nice, smart kid who is very good at basketball and hates baseball. Setting, Conflict, Plot, etc. 	The setting of this book is Wilmington and I think in the 1960s or 1970s because the schools had to integrate. This did not help Jerome though because the white school found a way around it and only put one colored in the white school, which was Jerome. Jerome tried out for the basketball team and didn't make it because the coach was racist against blacks. So, instead he practiced on a court he only knew about or, so he thought until one night when Bix. Bix was there, playing bounce ball. That night Jerome decided to teach Bix how to play basketball. Recommendation I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes sports because they would be able to relate to it and therefore enjoy it. Conclusion The book I read is The Moves Make the Man by Bruce Brooks. It takes place in Wilmington in the 1960s or 1970s. The main characters are Jerome and Bix. This is the first book I've read, written by this author and look forward to reading more.     
 Fun to watch, entertaining, interesting and Im glad I have this in my collection 
 This story is about a seventeen year old boy who needs to save his world from an evil dark sorceror.  Tamwyn, the main character, is brave, adventurous, clumsy, and sort of unlucky.  He's brave and adventurous because he protects his friends and does what's right, most of the time, plus he likes to explore his world.  He is very clumsy and is seems to be that every time it talks about him he is tripping over things which puts some humor into the book.  Tamwyn is sort of unlucky, he's like a black cat, everywhere he goes something bad happens either to the people or the town.  This leads him to think that he is the prophesized Dark Child that is supposed to bring the end to Avalon, his world.  I could really connect with the author's characters.  It seemed like I was in the story with them.  I've read T.A. Barron's 'The Lost Year's of Merlin' series and I enjoyed both that series and this book.  I look forward to reading his other books about Avalon.  This book is for grades 6-10.  Its a great action adventure book and I highly recommend it 
 I have watched 8 of the 50 movies.  Start at the beginning.  First off the quality of the picture isn't that bad, it's what you would expect from ventage movies.  You'll see a dust spot here or a scratch there on some of the movies, but its not enough to worry about.  I'm actually pleased of how good the quality is, so far. One complaint is that the characters in the stories just don't mesh, its hard to feel compassion for most characters, I suppose it's because back in that time people were more unsophisticated.  Recently I have viewed...  Carnival of Souls-- Not bad, I found this one to be interresting, the only annoying thing is the background music.  Other then that very dark creepy film that is somehow poetic. It is where a woman is thought to have drownd in a car accident but is discovered to be still alive.  After she recovers she suffers from what would seem to be dementia, but there is a sweet little twist at the end that has probably inspired many other recent films.  Atom Age Vampire-- This one was okay, kinda reminded me of Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde.  It is about a show girl who is in a wreck and pretty much owes her life to the scientist who has helped her in repairing her wounds.  However to keep her perfect, he has to feed her bodyparts, so he transforms himself into a monster to commit the crimes.  Creature from the Haunted Sea--- Not a horror, it sucked greatly.  I've seen better monsters made from modeling clay.  Nightmare Castle--- So far this one is my favorite.  I would buy this collection just for this movie.  It is where a man murders his wife and her lover then remarries to a woman who is mentally unstable.  The new bride is haunted by the tormented spirits of the past so that they can have revenge on their killer.  The idea of the story reminds me of Hellraiser.  Black Dragons--- Sucked not a horror.  More of a sleeper of a drama with no emotion.  Invisible Ghost--Was equally as enjoyable as Nightmare Castle.  A man who supposedly lost his wife thinks he sees her ghost.  This drives him mad so he randomly kills without remembering what has happened.  This one was fun, not creepy, but defently fun.  One Body Too Many-- Not that great, kind of humorous, mostly boaring.  White Zombie--- Another great one.  This film was chilling due to the scenery, which I imagin was a masterpiece for its time.  The plot was interesting, once again not much emotion here but it was fun to watch.  Defently, chilling.

 This is simply the best introduction to the fundamentals of economics ever written. The book is divided into two parts. Part one, which takes all of four pages, is the basic lesson of the title. Part two, the remainder of the book, consists of applications of that lesson to all types of economic issues. It clearly shows the folly of many modern economic policies, including rent controls, minimum wage laws, government subsidies, and protective tariffs.  Hazlitt is a great writer, so much so that he somehow manages to make what is usually a dry, unexciting subject fun to read. (A little-known fact: the philosopher Bertrand Russell liked Hazlitt's style so much that he wanted him to be his biographer - until, that is, Russell decided to write his life story himself.) As a result, Hazlitt really succeeds in driving home his points. Economics has never been so interesting or so easy to understand. 
 Words about nature.  Words that paint pictures in your mind.  While reading, I feel as if I have an "inner eye" that was seeing the scene Whyte is writing about. Reading this book is like walking through a forest or an art gallery filled with paintings of nature.  I can see, feel, smell and sense the scene Whyte's words paint.It's amazing how Whyte can touch your heart with his words

 This book, along with "Emotional Alchemy" by Tara Goldman, has been a life changing experience!  Years of therapy and $$ down the drain never helped me as much as these two books.  By understanding and challenging your schemas, you will free yourself to create the life you want. You will also come to understand your friends and family members and what drives them. As a side benefit, you will be able to let go of anger and experience compassion. While continuing work on my schemas, I feel freer.  I can finally exhale and get off the roller coaster of an unexamined life.  And, over time, I have been able see a more direct relationship between my emotions and the quality of my health.  Thank you so much 
 With the amount of junk that Hollywood feeds us these days, you need a source to help you find the good stuff. This book helps in the search for quality. It simply and briefly lets you know why these films are worth seeing. I have found many films from years past that I would've never seen if I hadn't read about them here first. Just about every great film from the silent era to the present is in here. Hopefully, more people will start paying attention to the good films of the past. Once you start watching these films you'll notice just how bad most of the the current blockbuster studio releases are. If we keep paying to see bad movies, the studios will keep making them 
 My 2 y/o son loves this CD we listen to it every time we are in the car.  The singer has a nice voice, not irritating like other kids music I've heard so I actually don't mind playing it for my son because it doesn't give me a headache!! 
 Whatever opinion scholars have of Bettelheim, this is an extraordinarily eye-opening work for a layman. Just the insights into the magical thinking of children--how fairy tales make sense to them because a parent's abilities to predict behavior, for example, seems magical to them too--is "worth the price of admission" for any parent. 
 This is one of the best explanations of the Christian's responsibility to evangelize I have heard. This book isn't simply about predestination vs. free will, it is a perspective on the whole question of Christian evangelism in light of God's sovereignty. Packer shows that, when properly viewed, the sovereignty of God does not remove our responsibility to evangelize. He writes a very good perspective on the relationship between God's sovereignty and man's responsibility, showing that both the "freewill" position and the "hyper-Calvinist" (i.e. those who say that God's sovereignty precludes our responsibility to evangelize) position are wrong and unBiblical. He also makes some interesting comments on the WAY that we evangelize. For example, he points out that many consider evangelistic sermons to be a "special" type of sermon and evangelistic meetings to be a "special" type of meeting, but ALL of Scripture, both Old and New  Testaments, point to Jesus, so any sermon that properly teaches the Bible is in a sense evangelistic, and every properly run church service should point to Jesus. He points out that this attitude of "special" sermons and "special" meetings is very indicting of the modern church - i.e. that many "sermons" and "church services" are NOT really properly teaching the Bible and are NOT properly pointing to Jesus. This is particularly true of many topical sermons and "Christianity-lite" (I once heard of a Christmas "sermon" on "how to avoid anxiety at Christmastime" - no mention of Jesus' birth, life, teachings, or work for us). This does not mean, of course, that we should not have special meetings or sermons for the sole purpose evangelism, or that we should not make a special effort to evangelize. Packer argues that these should still occur, particularly considering the paganism dominating our culture of late.  Anyone who wants to better understand the Christian's responsibility to evangelize, or the relationship between God's sovereignty and man's evangelism (and who doesn't want to understand these better?), should read this book. It is excellent 
 Unless you have never seen a college basketball game, you probably know quite a bit about coach John Wooden and his success at UCLA.  Several excellent books have attempted to capture the essence of his coaching philosophy.  All of those books made you admire coach Wooden and want to emulate him.  But you ended up feeling like you were dealing with a saint who emerged full formed from a clam shell.  How could a mere mortal follow his foot steps?    Wooden on Leadership takes a revealing look at how that philosophy evolved, the mistakes he made along the way, how he corrected those mistakes and the regrets he has today.  A high point for me came from seeing his notes during the years that the philosophy evolved.    You still feel like you are dealing with a saint, but a saint who (like Paul when he was Saul) started out with some imperfections that you may recognize in yourself.  I came to appreciate several dimensions of the Wooden philosophy that I hadn't understood before.  Here is my new learning:  1.  Focus on helping each player become the best they can be in contributing to the team, and help the players understand how they can and are contributing to the team.    2.  Attract people with good values who are eager to improve in team contributions.  3.  Set a good example.  4.  There are no little things.  Everything is important.  I hope that anyone who ever coaches children's or school sports will read this book and be encouraged to become a better leader.    Even if you coach fencing, you can learn a lot from this book 
 Welcome to the World, Baby Girl is an amazing collection of lives and events that keeps you guessing all the way. It's not a mystery or thriller - this is a novel about one woman and her search for happiness, but Flagg interweaves so many elements that this book is a pleaser at many levels. While I initially coudln't like the heroine, Dena, very much, Flagg fleshes her out by going into her past and surrounding her with truly lovable characters who get you to see the sweet person Dena really is. All of the supporting characters are memorable, including the villains, whose lesser traits are explained through Flaggs' narrative. You don't love them, but you understand why they do what they do. Fannie Flagg is a great observer of human motivation, and has a fabulous sense of humour. Welcome to the World, Baby Girl is a novel you will enjoy and not be able to forget for a long time 
 I've never seen the original movie. I figured it was just another stupid teen slasher movie so I never bothered. I didn't much care for "Halloween" to be honest. I never could figure out what all the fuss was about that one. Anyway, I found John Carpenter's "The Fog" on DVD for five bucks at Target a few weeks back and bought it with the intent to watch it eventually. Meanwhile, I rented this one. Now I'll have to watch the the original soon. I have to say that I rather liked thid one. I thought it was adequately entertaining and nicely atmospheric. Like all movies, it has its flaws, but the effects were excellent and I enjoyed the story. I also liked the main characters (Welling, Grace, and Blair). Sorry, but that's my opinion. I've certainly seen many far worse movies over the past 40 years 
 I thought this was a great book to give as a gift for earliteen/teenage kids to keep them busy & out of trouble.  If you know what I mean.  When I was about that age, I used to keep myself busy with origami during the vacation months.  Therefore, I want to help other youth in my circle of community do the same thing.  This was an excellent book that provided great step-by-step illustration.  Although, it is not a beginner's origami book 
 Wonder Boys (Curtis Hanson, 2000)  I ended up seeing a lot of movies-- a whole lot of movie-- the weekend I saw Wonder Boys, and it was by far the best of them. Rare is the movie, these days, that's laugh-out-loud funny. Rarer still is that movie actually a drama, a sort of absurdist metatragedy about the decline and fall of a University professor who seems bound and determined to destroy his life and his career in the shortest possible time.  Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is that professor, a man who wrote one vastly popular, critically acclaimed book seven years before, and has been unable to finish its follow-up. On the weekend of a big to-do at the school where he teaches, his editor, Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey, Jr.), comes into town to get a look at this legendary manuscript Tripp has spent the last seven years writing. At the same time, James Leer (Spider-Man's Tobey Maguire), a neurotic student, has just finished his own manuscript; his relationship with Sara Gaskell (Frances MacDormand), the University chancellor's wife, is going through a rough patch; and his boarder, Hannah Green (Katie Holmes), has picked the worst of all possible times to turn up the pressure on him to get involved romantically with her. Everything's lined up for either salvation or damnation, or possibly both, and Tripp seems bound and determined to figure out as many ways as possible to stick his fat in the fire while still leaving himself that one last road. As we all know, however, the road to hell is paved with good intentions...  When Curtis Hanson is on his game, he's one of the best in the business, and he's definitely on his game here. It helps that he pulled in a fantastic stable of actors to realize Steven Kloves' fabulous script, from the justly famous Michael Chabon novel of the same name. This is a fun, fun movie that got far too little exposure during its brief theatrical run; rediscover it now. *** 
 A nice breath of fresh air, this book focuses on the individual struggles of four fairly well-off dominican girls caught in between cultures, as their lives carry them from the Dominican Republic, to New York, and back.     Unlike many U.S. latina authors, Alvarez chooses not to focus on tired old cliches of inexorable racism or institutional opression as the only themes capable of producing a novel.   Instead, she exposes the reader to the often complex inner world of  the young female attempting to recalibrate her identity in a new culture during the bumpy transition to adulthood.  Alvarez plays no favorites here: Old World traditions and empty American promises are equally ridiculed, while the evolution of the poetic inner self becomes the novel's focal point.  The personal struggle is given precedence over the group struggle.  The realistic prose, absence of excessive description, and smooth sentence structure make it a fast and enjoyable read. The story, written in "reverse" fashion, begins at it's end, and then works it's way backwards into the past.  Other than being a neat little narrative trick, I doubt whether this adds much to the esthetic value of the novel.    Overall, a nice contribution to the rapidly diversifying US latino literature canon.  
 Ken Tucker's "Kissing Bill O'Reilly, Roasting Miss Piggy" is a collection of short pieces about 100 things the critic either loves or hates about television.  Tucker's long, intricate (but always clear), witty sentences are a joy to read.  He doesn't talk down to you (which is an occupational hazard for many TV critics.) This may be the most entertaining book of TV criticism since Harlan Ellison's legendary "The Glass Teat."  Tucker appreciates great art no matter where he finds it; he says that he needs to acknowledge that he has "been nourished as much by 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' as the novels of Philip Roth."  As far as I am concerned, this statement hits the bull's-eye (and I speak as a big fan of both Roth and Buffy.)  Even more remarkable, Tucker proclaims upfront his status as a "politically progressive member of the east-coast media elite": but he doesn't let his politics get in the way of judging a thing's quality (a true rarity indeed.)  Among the surprising targets on his "hate" list are: Ed Asner's "Lou Grant", "The West Wing", "MASH", "Barney Miller", "The Tonight Show", the Smothers Brothers, Edward R. Murrow, "Saturday Night Live", "Family Guy", "Mystery Science Theater 3000", PBS, and "Little House on the Prairie."  On the "love" list: Jennifer Garner's red wig, David Caruso, MTV's "The Real World", "NewsRadio", "Cops", "Full House", Aaron Spelling, "Homicide: Life on the Street", Bill O'Reilly, David Duchovny, "Roseanne", Homer Simpson's alcoholism, "Pardon the Interruption", "Laverne and Shirley", "Twin Peaks", and "The Waltons."  Nearly every page of this book provides something to delight or infuriate you.  Indifference is definitely not Tucker's problem.  He shows a lot of guts, especially by allowing the hideous, funny Drew Friedman caricature of him to be on the cover 
 Brian Hayes has produced an excellent book which descibes the workings of the industrial infrustructure as we see it on the surface of the industrialised world, in particular the US and Italy.  Hayes clearly explains what we often see as mysterious, arcane and inexplicable structures in the industrial landscape in clear terms, without becoming tediously technical and using difficult technical terminology, regarding those who may not be overly familar with the mechanics and procedures of mining, energy production and other similar industries.  The text is profusely illustrated with clear colour photographs with captions on every page. Very few diagrams are included, unless absolutely necessary. The captions associated with the photographs elucidate the workings of the machinery or structures depicted. Details such as pylon insulators are also explained. Importantly, a sense of scale is always provided by pointing out an object in the picture which is recognisable.  This is an important book, long needed. It is non-judgemental, and written with a playfulness which makes it all the more engaging. The analogies and explanations given are clear, and the language is accessible most readers including young people from the age of ten, without being condescending.  Infrastructure is a well designed book, produced on art paper (glossy and china coated), and is actually quite weighty. The layout is clear and functional, good typography and eminently legible. The design matches its contents 
 If you consider yourself a melodeath metal fan, or if you're a newcomer, it is absolutely mandatory that you're familiar with the following four words: "Slaughter Of The Soul." If there ever was a classic in this genre, this album, the fifth studio release and fourth full length from At The Gates, is it. This record did the same thing for melodeath that "Reign In Blood" did for thrash. It's often thought of as being the epitome of the genre, because of its importance. It almost single handedly created and established the Gothenburg metal sound. It has influenced almost everybody-from In Flames (who are also a highly influential melodeath group), to nine-out-of-ten modern American metalcore bands (Shadows Fall, for example).  "Slaughter" was also probably the heaviest melodic metal album to be released in the 1990's. Every song on here is very scorching and infectious, and loaded with propulsive, attacking the jugular rhythms, fiery, bludgeoning riffs, catchy, ferocious guitar leads, fast, thumping (at times pounding) drum patterns, winding, careening (albeit brief and un-complex) guitar solos, and high-pitched, black metal influenced, almost Death or Kreator-esque vocals from frontman Tomas Lindberg.  The pounding, blistering, lead-off track, "Blinded By Fear", is one of the album's highlights, but every track is essential listening. "Suicide Nation" is a good representation of the disc as a whole, since it's one of many brutal songs on here with a breakneck tempo, blowtorch riffs, blinding guitar leads, and a wild guitar solo to cap it all off. The title cut is fueled by scorching, propulsive guitar shredding; "Cold" boasts a brutal, surging guitar and pounding drum attack, including a brief, skillful drum solo and a melodic guitar break around two minutes in; and "Into The Dead Sky" is a slow, serene instrumental interlude with clean guitar strums and whooshing background noise (bands like Killswitch Engage probably got the idea for an acoustic interlude from this song.) And, lastly, "Unto Others" is a particularly attention-grabbing, memorable, and infectious song, because it includes a somewhat pretty flamenco guitar interlude.  If you buy the reissue (which you definitely should, and probably will because the original version of this C.D. is very hard to find), you'll get six extra songs which make for a great listen and are essential for your collection. These songs are "Legion" (a Slaughterlord cover), "The Dying" (an unreleased track from the "Slaughter Of The Soul" recording sessions), a Slayer cover of "Captor Of Sin", two 1995 demos (one is of "Unto Others" and the other is "Suicide Nation"), and "Bister Verklighet," a song originally done by the band No Security.  If one had to find fault with this album (aside from that the guitar solos are nothing really special), it would be that it sounds a little dated by now.  It has aged very well, but if you're already initiated with melodic death metal, or if you've been listening to metalcore for the past several years, "Slaughter Of The Soul" may have a very small initial "wow factor" on you. But this isn't At The Gates' fault-how were they to know that a countless number of other bands were going to cop their sound? In fact, if you listen closely to a metalcore album, you should be able to hear that some of the riffs on that album have been lifted wholesale from "Slaughter Of The Soul". Thus, this record might take a little while to grow on you, but you still need to own it. If nothing else, at least buy it so you know where melodeath began, and so you can say you have a complete collection. And if you're new to the genre, there's no better place to start than right here 
 A great read!  While its main theme is the 2005 Final Four, Coach Roy Williams and the Tar Heels of North Carolina, it provides a wealth of historical information on how March Madness developed over several decades.  It also provides the reader with an insight into the politics of the NCAA tournament as well as how the TV revenues influence many of the decisions made by the selection committee. 
 This would have been a bit better if Prince didn't add his chimes, etc.  But overall, this is Prince and it is good 
 How do you write a novel about wife-battering without making the batterer a monster? How do you write one while making sure the reader cannot blame the victim for staying? Well, perhaps the first is impossible, but the second surely isn't, and this book is proof.  Doyle takes us inside the head of Paula, who has found out that her deadbeat husband is now dead. There are hints that she might have had to something to do with his demise, but it's not clearly drawn out until we have learned how horrible he has made this woman's life. Why doesn't she leave, some may ask? Well, she's poor, not well-educated, and has grown up in a family and neighborhood where abuse stays behind closed doors. However, her struggles first to survive her husband, and then to survive the memories are moving and poignant.  Doyle also lets us the effects of abuse on the children, who have witnessed it, and how the whole family can act in accordance to keep the unsavory behavior of one of their own a secret. While Paula considers herself weak and just muddling through, the reader will likely come to the opposite conclusion. Rather than go on Oprah and confess her problems, she keeps her struggles to herself (and the reader) and in doing so, comes across as incredibly brave, a heroine in every sense.  
 The author has done a masterful job of building the case for a serious exploration of a bio-based energy economy. The book has a friendly not-too-technical style and it's incredibly well researched, carefully documented and very well organized. As an added bonus, Biodiesel starts off with an insightful forward by celebrated author and environmentalist, Bill McKibben.    After setting the tone for the book by bringing to light the potential crisis of Peak Oil, Pahl begins to delve into part of the solution as he leads the reader on a great story ride through the life (and death!) of Rudolf Diesel, to the early pioneers of biodiesel across the European eco-industrial landscape and back to the present day biodiesel industry currently emerging in the U.S.. The book is full of personal interviews with key players that brings this rapidly evolving world of agriculture, science and alternative energy to life. And Greg Pahl does an excellent job of providing a balanced look at both the possibilities and the social and environmental challenges of drawing increasing amounts of energy from the soil.  I've been pretty involved in sustainable development for years (and biofuels in particular) and I can only say that this latest book by the author is a real gift and a "must read" for anyone interested in or working towards a renewable energy future 
 This is one of the best books I've read to get someone started in the world of relational databases.  As a former software trainer, I've recommeded several database books to students.  But I wish I had known about this one for my beginning students.  Sure, there are the 800 page monsters out there, but if you want information that is straight to the point, well-written and user-friendly, this is the book to use. I'd also like to point out that the one time I had a question, I was able to contact Dr. Whitehorn and within an hour, I received a my answer.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know the basics about relational databases 
 Jack Johnson is the greatest new artist on the market. This cd is awesome. Matt Costa and G.Love sound good with Jack, love the Rainbow song 
 I enjoyed this book but i think "Shes Come Undone" was a much better read, another of Wallys novels.  It could be the characters were male and i related better to the female character in "Shes Come Undone".  Id say it was ok.   
 Eric Palazzo is an instructor in medieval liturgiology who first found his way into liturgy via art history.  He found the then stanard French language text by Cyril Vogel on medieval liturgical books inadequate for teaching his students.  Many others has as well.  Rasmussen translated the book into English and added a great deal of information, although in a disorganized fashion.  So, Palazzo wrote his book.  More concise, more clear and equally as annotated, Palazzo takes students through the bewildering array of medieval liturgical books, explaining their use, the known types, and much more.  This is the definately the first place to turn when doing scholarly work with medieval liturgical texts.  Unfortunately, however, the first chapter on the history of the study of medieval liturgical texts is terribly boring and should not be read unless one is particularly interested in the history of the study 
 It first when I saw the title "Shoplifters vs. Retailers:  The Rights of Both" all I could think of was the only rights shoplifters should have is to be "hooked and booked".  However, after reading the book I would say the book should be required reading for begining Loss Prevention Agents.  I like the Scenario and Analysis set up of the book.  But there are far too many "single item" detentions in the book.  For me to risk my badge, possibly my job, and a lawsuit on a bad detention if I am wrong on a single item, I have to be VERY certain that a shoplift has occurred and that the individual has the merchandise.  Not that I have not been involved in single item detentions, but sometimes it's better to let someone walk with the merchandise; because if the person is a true shoplifter they will be back 
 I have found this dictionary to have the best content of all the small-enough-to-carry-around German dictionaries (this one is a little big to call a pocket dictionary), but potential buyers should be aware that the publication/copyright date for this dictionary is 1993, NOT March 2003 as advertised. Langenscheidt advised me that a new edition is expected in 2008. I would also have preferred a hard-back and sewn edition for a book this size that gets carted all over the place, but I don't know that other pocket dictionaries are any better in this regard 
 David Cronenberg's the brood is a film about the concept of violence within a family and how it later affects the child's life, it also tells us how fustrating it is when separated parents have to fight for the custody of thier own child as Cronenberg himself was going through a divorce. Frank Carveth starts to question the treatment his wife Nola played by Samantha Eggar is receiving at the clinic of Dr. hal Raglan played by Oliver Reed. Horrible things begin to happen as his daughter returns from a visit to her mother only to have some scars and bruises on her back. While Nola is in intensive care and is locked up at the clinic it seems that all her fustrations and rage manifest into these deformed creatures that act as a revenge from Nola towards her own mother and anyone that stands in her way. The film wasn't as gory as Cronenberg's other films but it deffinently had a creepy and unsettling feeling that I had from watching it, it also had an inteligent storyline and it seemed more like a personal horror film then the sort of weird mixture of science fiction and horror that Cronenberg usualy does so I deffinently think that you should check it out as I thought it was great but not one of my favorites, my favorite of his would be Scanners 
 You do not have to be a gardener to really enjoy this book; it's that well written and interesting 
 One has to understand not to take all what is said as the sole truth and then it's working great. There are loads of great examples...though definatly seems like they themselves drive Volvo or Volvo has paid authors to write such good reviews about it. Anyhow...when reading I kept in mind to be subjective and not to take it all as the truth, becasue then you end up jumping in your strategies as soon as you finish another book.  Neverthelsess, great ideas, great samples, a bit too arrogant look that PR is the only way...but I'll take it 
 Surrealist visions, hallucination, urge-vision, lost dimension, memory derangement - everything is part of the movie - it is symbolic - it shows you how association and nature of circumstances and surroundings helps to superimpose one character on another or it is like the human evolution (more about mutation) - this is a story about a tenant (soft spoken immigrant) in a poor paris neighbourhood - he sacrifices his comforts to live in a desent place but his neighbours throw the torch at him - they take him to the edge and he starts living in a world of hallucination - he cross dresses and starts to identify with the previous renter of the same apartment who commited suicide by jumping from the window  This is a very different Polanski - of coarse polansky himself plays in this movie as a mild mannered immigrant in Paris - it shows the xenophobia in Paris for other cultures and loved it - look for the fine expressions and the nature of pain as it happens to human lif 
 If you like the Cars This is the CD for you it has all of their greatest hits on hear from "Tonight She Comes" to "Moving In Stereo". If you like 80's music or if yoou just plain like music you will buy this cd. The remastered sound is done well too. This is 80's rock n roll at its best. So buy it Today

 I teach NEC articles dealing with low-voltage issues and grounding to custom electronics installers.  This is by far the best book I have ever used as a reference and I've seen a lot!   The text is very clear, the illustrations are amazingly good.  I have spoken with Ray Mullin the auther on many occassions and am always impressed with not only his knowledge but on the TLC (tender loving care) he puts into each edition.   You can't go wrong with this reference 
 This is an important film. The writer's original intention was to craft a film loosley around The Sandpebbles and African Queen.  The Special Edition of this film includes writers' observations by Alex Lasker and Patrick Cirillo, and they narrate as the film proceeds. They describe the evolution and changes to the original script, subject to a studio seeking to craft a film which would create profits and be a good vehicle for Bruce Willis. But, the writers wanted to draw attention to the state of Africa, and the recurring problems resulting in horrible human rights violations. They bring awareness to genocide and civil war where the western world does not want to get involved.  Reading reviews, it's amazing what this film has meant to people. Some see it as a great but mindless action film. It's meaningful enough to bring others to tears. I recently read a review proclaiming that liberals and "America hating" leftists would hate the film, and that the film represents the goose-step of conservatives. This is certainly at odds with the writers' intentions. As a socially liberal and left leaning American (but fiscally conservative), this attitude left me puzzled. I've always seen conservative types as huddled around their little pile of stuff acquired through life like golems, and concerned with little else in this world. They just want to protect their little pile. A good American to them has a responsibility to care little for the rest of the world, unless we can plunder someone to fatten the coffers. Neoconservatives feel a requirement to democratize the world, as planned out in the imperialistic Project For A New Century. Conservative administrations believe that war is good for corporations and business, but place no emphasis on human rights. Create a war and watch the stock market go crazy. It doesn't matter that our children will be left to figure out the unfathomable debt. Frankly, I don't get it. "Liberals and leftists" believe in international responsibility, and that's what this film is about.  Bruce Willis plays a good soldier who is siezed by conscience in the film, and finds it necessary break his orders to accomplish the "right thing". I've read reviews condemning this action, stating that orders must never be broken, and that in real life Willis would have been rightfully destined for punishment. The military order transcends moraltiy and ethics. In the real world this fact is probably true, so perhaps the film is a bit of a fantasy.  This movie is important because it draws attention to a state of affairs in Africa from which most Americans have been insulated. Recently, The Sudanese government's systematic murder and starvation of black Sudanese has been in the news, thanks to George Clooney and others. It also draws attention toward America's view of the rest of the world.  I found this movie thought provoking as well as being an exciting adventure story. Hopefully people will see this and ask some important questions. While the great nation of America should not be the world's police force, we should be a rock solid moral example for the rest of the world. Want to talk about power? What better power than that which is born out of respect. Instead we have been on a morally questionable path, conducting an unneccesary war, spending trillions and inflicting pain and suffering. We have lost 2500 soldiers of our own, with thousands wounded and traumatized. And for what? Oil? Other countries natural resources? 9/11 hysteria? A neoconservative agenda?  Oil, natural resources and greed are one of the major contributions to events of genocide around the world. This is a sub-theme of the film, intimating that America would have no intention of involvement for humanitarian issues, but oil is another matter. It's sad but true. We have a choice in who we elect, and where they are destined to lead us. We still have elected officials who regret that the south lost the Civil War, and regret the civil rights advances since then. They would consider anyone a leftist who would champion civil rights and who would sympathize with the genocide themes in the film.  This is what the film meant to me. My "liberals eye view" found it deeply moving and morally uplifting. One more thing ... in Special Features is a feature called "Voices of Africa". Eight African actors in the film recount their personal experiences and horrors in the Sudan, Nigerian, Congo, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Thankfully many of them found refuge, and a chance for a future by escaping to America. These moving interviews alone are reason enough to purchase the Special Edition.  When it's time, vote for an administration who will make this country proud. See this film as a reminder that we are each our brother's keeper 
 I have use this book in my middle school classroom.  The kids enjoy it.  Yes, it is silly but heck so are middle school kids!  Since reading the book and discussing it, the kids have a much better understanding of what pi really is, instead of just saying about 3.14 
 I love John Grisham books, and though I've not read the Rainmaker, I do thoroughly enjoy this movie.  It's a David and Goliath story about an underprivileged family and a greener than grass lawyer taking on the mega-insurance company.  (And believe it or not, I work for an insurance company!)  The storyline is great....Matt Damon and Danny Devito compliment each other well in this film.  The subplot of Rudy's love interest is a bit more than the movie really needs...I'd be interested to see if that portion exists or how it plays out in the book.  Overall though, if you're looking for a nice solid movie, I'd recommend this one 
 In my years of experience teaching Fine Arts to high school students, I know that the majority, if not all, of the music included on this album is commonly used in collge music appreciation courses.  This is an excellent sample of truly all the "greatest hits" of classical music.  My students enjoy listening to the music and have later told me when take their required music apreciation courses in college that they "already know it all" because of this CD! The recordings are clear, the selections are passionate, and the listener will gain a familiarity with all of the most commonly heard classical music used in tv commercials, movies, etc.   I recommend this album, along with the boxed set, "Age of the Classics" for anyone who is interested in becoming familiar with the most famous staples of classical music.

 Another great story from Amy Tan. Sad, haunting, & very hard to read at times. Not a quick read, but well worth the time 
 I cannot put into words the impact this book has had on me. This is my 4th translation of this text and this one is the best. Originally I started reading the Bhagavad Gita as it has a calibration of 910 (David Hawkins, Power vs. Force. It is a cosmic text which reaching out of the book and touches ones soul. This version is a joy to read. It is a dessert fresh from a tree. It is a day not too hot with gentle breezes. God becomes the companion rather than the gloom and doom king/parent/authority. Many of my friends now have this book just from seeing the joyful change in me. 
 This book grew out of a smaller work entitled "I Wonder Why;" it "is not designed to be a comprehensive introduction to Buddhism, but to clarify points, provide Buddhist perspectives on modern issues, and stimulate the curiosity and questioning minds of the readers" (p. 10).  The author makes some profound statements about questions: p. 7: "In the beginning one should remain skeptical and rely on questioning and checking the teachings based on one's understanding" and p. 9: "I believe that spiritual practice is more about holding questions than finding answers.  Seeking one correct answer often comes from a wish to make life-which is basically fluid-into something certain and fixed."  The latter applies directly to Buddhism itself: p. 77-8: "As the Buddha's teachings spread from one country to another, they adapted to the culture and mentality of the people in each place without changing the essential meaning...The external forms and ways of doing things are not the Dharma."  Thus, she differentiates between true practitioners and p. 118: "joss stick Buddhists."  Needless to say, this book is for people truly interested in or at least honestly curious about Buddhism.  The author corrects many incorrect views: p. 42: "There is nothing inherently wrong with the world; the real problem lies in our disturbing attitudes" and p. 63: to set reachable short-term goals as well as long-term resolve when purifying negative traits and actions.  In addition to considerable information on helping the dying, a mantra to say when about to eat meat (p. 109: "Om Ahbirakay tsara hung" said 7 times & pray for animal to have fortunate rebirth), types of Buddhist nuns and robes, and especially children (p. 132: "When children see an adult sitting peacefully, they get the idea that they can as well" and p. 134: "Love is more important to children than material possessions.  Choosing to earn more money at the expense of good family relations may mean later having to spend that extra income on therapy and counseling for both parents and children!").  Her words are worth considerable thought though they are quite basic and virtually nonsectarian.  It's worth your time now since: p. 41: "No one dies thinking, `I should have worked more overtime.' 
 I was mostly interested in the THEORY of limiting flavors to aid in weight loss and management, so when I saw that half the book was devoted to recipes, I was somewhat disappointed.    However, after trying just a few of the main course dishes, THIS IS NOW MY FAVORITE RECIPE BOOK!  Each meal has wonderful flavors and textures, are beautiful and quick to make, and I had most of the ingredients on hand already (that which I did not were easy and inexpensive to obtain).  I haven't been as enchanted with the breakfast and lunch menus, but I feel I've already gotten my money's worth many times over with the dinner meals.  Roasted Currant Chicken and the Mexican Stuffed Peppers were two of our hands-down favorites.  Fits with many diet strategies, too.  Highly recommend, both for the theory AND the recipes 
 great anlbum for awareness of this Day also.. 
 If you're looking for a faithful translation from the full score, this is the one. This score is based on Bernstein latest revision as reflected in the Carreras Te Kanawa recording (1985).   But be warned, this score is only for advanced pianist, classically trained. It;s not a fakebook, it's not a simplified/reduced piano score for casual use 
 I found this annotated text excellent for my understanding of the South and its diaspora. Having read Gramsci's original text in Italian several times, I can vouch that this is an excellent translation and the notes Verdicchio provides contextualise Gramsci's ideas. In addition, the translator provides an excellent introduction relating the concerns expressed by Gramsci just before his arrest to present day concerns with respect to migration and the transposition of North-South and South-North colonial relations to diasporic contexts such as those of North America and possibly Australia and Northern Europe. Relevant political writings by Gramsci are added to the slim volume.  This is one piece by Gramsci that deserves greater recognition in the literature than it has been given thus far 
 I bought this book after hearing an interview with the author on National Public Radio.  She has an antagonistic attitude toward the regime, which, for reasons of its own, tolerates her.  Duong expresses negativity toward Vietnamese communism mainly through her depiction of the narrator's uncle, a petty, dogmatic, narrow-minded cadre who brutalizes the narrator's angelic father.  The preferability of capitalism is epitomized by the narrator's aunt, a wise, conscientious small landholder who overcomes adversity.  The young female narrator would earn the sympathy of anybody under any system that shatters dreams and stifles opportunity.  A good read, but be wary of the author's agenda.   
 There are very few books about the theory of game design.   Most of the books which purport to be about game design theory have titles like _Game Design: Theory and Practice_ [Richard Rouse III: 2001], and focus much more on the latter than the former, usually in the context of commercial computer games.  The exceptions to this rule generally approach the subject of game design theory from a particular perspective, e.g., as a communication method or "future's language." [Duke: 1974]  So when _Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals_ (by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman) was published by MIT Press in 2004, I took immediate interest.  The book largely lived up to expectations.  Weighing in at a hefty 672 pages of relatively small type, this textbook-format tome is, as the title might suggest, heavy on game design theory but light on practice.  This makes it a excellent complement to the established game design literature.  Structurally, the book is fairly straightforward and is divided into four major sections: Core Concepts, Rules, Play, and Culture, each of which is capped by an essay or a game design by an established game designer written especially for this volume.  The first section (together with two brief chapters preceeding it) discusses necessary background ideas, defining important terms and presenting concepts to be built upon later.  Besides preparing the reader for the next  500 pages, it's in this section that the authors accomplish one of their primary goals of the book: creating a game design vocabulary.   Creating such a critical vocabulary, they argue, is an important step towards treating game design as a discipline, because you need such a tool to education game designers, to pass skills and knowledge from one generation of designers to another, to faciliate audience-building by enabling critical discussion of games, and finally as a buffer against criticism, by giving "us" -- a word which takes on new meaning in the last third of the book, when they discuss the various ways players become de facto game designers -- the vocabulary and understanding to defend gaming as an activity from those who would censor it.  These points are borrowed from an essay by Henry Jenkins, a media theorist and game scholar who is also the head of the Comparative Media Studies program at MIT.  (As a quick sidebar, this book may be worth buying for the bibliography alone.)  Of course, vocabulary is only the start of an effort to establish a "critical discourse for game design."  Or, as  Salen and Zimmerman explain, "a critical vocabulary lets us talk to each other."  The last three sections of the book form the beginnings of that critical discourse.  Each of these sections highlights a specific primary schema ("a conceptual lens we can apply to the analysis or creation of a game"), with most of the chapters in these sections focusing on related lower-level schemas.  For example, in the section on the schema "Games as Play," there is a chapter on "Games as Narrative Play," which examines both narrative elements of games and narrative as a result of game play.  These schema-based chapters borrow heavily from a wide variety of disciplines, and it is through these schemas that major insights regarding game design can be found.  (For instance, the chapter on "Games as the Play of Pleasure" has an interesting discussion of the importance of short-term goals, which serve both to help players make plans in a game, and also provide moments of satisfaction when these goals are reached.)  A lot of these insights will not be new to experienced game designers, but what is new is the systematic framework in which the insight is embedded.  Or, more correctly, frameworks.  I would argue that this multiple-perspective approach is the book's primary strength.  Rather than taking a given theoretical construct and forcing all of "games" into it, it starts with a few core concepts and then generates a plethora of interrelated-but-distinct models with which to examine any game.  Any given model may or may not be suited to an individual game -- or, perhaps more accurately, may or may not have the potential to produce new insights -- but as a whole they are a powerful collection of tools.  If you have a hammer, the old saying goes, everything looks like a nail.  In this case, Salen and Zimmerman have handed the reader a fairly complete toolbox.  (Note that I will admit to shoehorning this analogy into place just a little bit.  A hammer is construction tool, not an analysis tool; it's job is on the *practical end*, not the theoretical.  A better analogy would be a toolbox that contains an MRI machine, a spectrograph, an x-ray machine, a CAT scanner, and a simple camera, but I don't know of any old sayings that use those particular tools.)  This comprehensive approach draws on a wide variety of disciplines, from pyschology and literature to software engineering.  Within the field of games it casts an equally wide net, drawing examples from computer games, parlor games, Live Action Roleplaying Games, boardgames, professional sports, schoolyard games, and others.  It's not unusual for one paragraph to discuss a game like Chutes and Ladders, the next to discuss professional basketball, and a third to discuss Quake.  Such a diverse treatment of the subject guarantees that there is always an example available for a type of game the reader is familar with, even if the inevitable result is a little bit of shoehorning of examples.  (I remain unconvinced, for example, that Tic Tac Toe is really a "territorial acquisition" game.)  There are also plenty of new games to learn about  -- for instance, did you know that someone ran a live action PacMan game in New York City? This comprehensiveness extends to the bibliography and footnotes.  Another strength derives directly from one of the goals of the book: the authors are attempting to create a vocabulary.  As a result, they are meticulous about defining terms, especially when they are borrowing concepts from other disciplines.  This can occasionally be a little tiresome, but in the end it's always worth the effort.  The weaknesses of the book are in many ways mirror images of the strengths -- it's occasionally too theoretical, too comprehensive, and too multi-disciplinary.  It tends to wordiness, and occasionally the authors seem to base significant points on what one could argue is a word game, e.g., they draw upon the definition of play as in "loose" ("too much play in the fan belt") when defining the idea of "playing a game" or "game as a form of play."  It's a clever little example of creative pseudo-etymology, but I'm not sure that I buy the construct, even if it does seem to offer insight on occasion.  (Note that I originally wrote "play on words" rather than "word game.")  One glaring void in this comprehensive approach, ironically, is that the book doesn't really focus on games that are played for reasons other than the pleasure of the participants.  Professional military games are mentioned only in passing, large seminar games not at all, and it's probably safe to say that when one thinks of DOD gaming, such concepts as "Games as Cultural Resistance" (chapter 32) are probably not the sort of idea that comes to mind.  Indeed, much of the sections on "Play" and "Culture" might seem to be inapplicable to the type of gaming sponsored by DOD, because they do not address the unique reasons as to why military organizations participate in the creation and playing of games.  I think that conclusion would be a mistake.  The motivation as to why individuals play DOD games is certainly different than the motivation of your average _Vampire: The Masqerade_ player, but the mechanisms by which a player finds the experience meaningful probably isn't.  A bored or alienated player is bored or alienated, regardless of whether he's playing in the latest first-person shooter on his own initiative or Millenium Challenge because he was told to be there. If anything, these issues might be more important in a military games context: Joe Civilian Gamer can simply stop playing DOOM if he gets bored, but gamers that are forced into situations they don't want to be in have a tendency to cease their willing suspension of disbelief ("step outside the magic circle," as Salen and Zimmerman would say) and cause problems for others as well.  So, in short, I think the book is worth the time and the price tag ($50 list), both for game designers in general and professional military game designers in particular 
 I don't give many five star ratings but this one completly deserves it.  This album was my first from the dandies and is still my favorite after buying all of their albums becuase this one was so good.  the album opens very soft with Godless and Muhommad(?).  Both great songs in their own way.  Possibly my favorite track on the album is Solid.  it just gives you this feeling that I know I am sitting down listening to this, but I feel like dancing, and I don't even like dancing.  the most distorition oriented song follows with Horse shaped pills.  During the first few listens I thought this song was out of place because it is different from the whole vibe of the album.   My two least favorite songs on the album are The Gospel and Bohemian Like You.  I pick the gospel because it is long and drawn out almost like leading the fans into the era of Odditorium of the Warlords.  Bohemian Like You is a good song but I get tired of everybody saying that that is their favorite song off of the album.    This album is not one where you pick out a few songs for singles, like Capitol records did, but to listen all at once.  this album changed my life and introduced me into a whole different world of music.  A MUST BUY for any person who loves great Head-bobbin, Foot-tappin, High-Quality, Rock n Roll 
 Subbing at an elementary library earlier this month I came across this marvelous book on the shelving cart. I bet it is not on the shelf very often.  Kids love books about their favorite animals. Books on dog and cat breeds fly off the shelves. Put a puppy on the cover and there is instant interest.  Veterinary medicine is a career that is intriguing to many children. The photography shines in this book and invites the reader into a state of the art emergency care facility. There are photos of surgery that are detailed but not gruesome. The images of animals being cushioned with pillows and blankets are particularly comforting to young pet owners. Kind and caring professionals offer insight into their work at the ER.  The book also deals with the loss of a pet. Lucy is a ball python who escaped from her bag and got behind the dash of her owner's car. Despite the vet's attempts to revive the snake Lucy dies from hypothermia. Her owner describes his feelings of sadness and loss.  There are interesting insets, including abbreviations and terminology the doctors use (example HBC is hit by car) and human foods that are dangerous to animals.  State reading assessments use nonfiction selections to test student reading ability. This would be an excellent choice to model nonfiction reading. Young readers will also pick this one up and pore over every word on their own 
 If you like watching Season 1-2, you will enjoy watching Season 3. It is never a dull moment when Reba and her cast members perform one of their shows 
 This book contains a foreword written by a CLASS ACT, Mike Krzyzewski. Much unlike the classless Gary Williams, who refused to attend my barbeque ----- Perhaps this explains why can't pull recruits from his own backyard? This is described in detail in chapter 5. Mr Vitale is a pleasure to read. He describes his trips to Cameron Indoor and his friendly conversations with Coach K, Mike Dunleavy, and Wayne Gooch 
 My only complaint with this wonderful book is that it doesn't touch on childhood vaccinations. This is an important topic in natural healing and the word vaccination isn't even mentioned in the index. Since this book was written in 1998, perhaps the chickenpox vaccine was still very new and the measles vaccine was very commonly used. I understand that one book can't cover all topics, but this is a big one. I would think parents who are looking for natural alternatives to health and healing would like to at least question their options when considering when and whether to vaccinate their children. There is an entire chapter dedicated to treating chicken pox and herpes, but nothing on measles. Neither vacccination will I give to my 11-month-old son and I am always looking for more information on the topic.   Although the book isn't loaded with complex medical terms, it isn't shy on information. It is written for the layman (with occasional pictures and tips boxes), and provides a well-rounded approach to diagnosing and gently treating COMMON illnesses in children. At the same time, the authors were careful to encourage traditional medical advice when appropriate     
 Good Book for English scientific paper writing. Safe and good web-shop. International dilivery is not as quick as imagined 
 My princess-obsessed daughter listens intently whenever I read this book (which is often).  This story is so important in these days when My Scene Barbie and Bratz dolls show off more skin than clothing fashions!  I recommend it to all my friends with daughters 
 As a mathematician, I have always been drawn to the more formal programming methods of the Object Constraint Language (OCL). With it, you can place precise mathematical descriptions of what must be true before the code executes and what is guaranteed to be true after the code has run. Given the concise nature of mathematical notation, the OCL expressions also can replace many times their text in comments. The combination of Unified Modeling Language (UML) and OCL is a powerful one, allowing you to precisely describe the actions that code is expected to perform. However, the OCL is unlike other formal mathematical languages in that it must change in response to new ways of creating code.  One of the newest ways to design software systems is to use Model Driven Architectures (MDAs). An MDA is a high level framework that describes how models can be translated from language to language. Since the purpose is to allow for the translation to be done by machine, it is necessary for all restrictions to be written in a clear, unambiguous manner. Currently, the MDA process is divided into three steps:  The Platform Independent Model (PIM), which is at the highest level of abstraction and is independent of any specific technology.  The PIM is then translated into one or more Platform Specific Models (PSMs), where platform specific features are incorporated into each PSM.  Each PSM is then converted into code to be run on the specific platform.  When I first encountered the fundamentals of MDAs, my skepticism meter rose to a high level. Even with the precision of UML, creating accurate models is very hard, and creating appropriate code from those models is probably harder. Sure, it is possible to create the constructors, setters and getters and other simple components of a class automatically, but code is so complex that it is difficult to look at a model and know precisely what it is supposed to do.  After reading this book, the level of my skepticism meter has dropped quite a bit. From the presentation, it is easy to see how important OCL is to the accurate rendition of code from models. In fact, it is hard to believe that MDA could possibly succeed without OCL being heavily incorporated into the models.   The opening chapter of the book is a brief explanation of MDAs and how UML and OCL are used in combination to create the models. A solid introduction to the MDA way of doing things, it also describes the foundations, but not the specifics of OCL. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the UML. In chapter two, the OCL is described using an example of a customer loyalty program. This is an excellent example, as it is easy to understand and allows most of the basic expressions of the OCL to be used.   Chapter three is where the specifics of how the OCL is used in models are covered. While the examples are well done, one does not skim this chapter and understand it. The combination of diagrams and constraints must be read with a great deal of care in order to understand them. I was impressed with this approach, as the authors did not sacrifice accuracy of rendition for simplicity of understanding. The coverage of chapter four is in how the OCL is implemented and chapter five describes how the structures of the OCL are used in the creation of MDA models. This is where the UML and OCL metalanguages are merged to describe the functions of software. Once again, be prepared to spend some time in examining the diagrams in great detail. I found myself reading and rereading some of the examples before I achieved an acceptable level of understanding.  The final sections of the book form an OCL reference manual, where many of the expressions of the OCL are demonstrated in the appropriate context. In general, they are demonstrated in circumstances independent of an MDA model, which is an appropriate simplification.  There are reasons to believe that the MDA approach to software is not yet mature enough to be trusted. Nevertheless, the advantages of using it in any way are enormous, and it cannot be used without a way to accurately express the environment in which segments of code are to run. The OCL provides a way to describe the environment and from this book you can learn how the UML and the OCL can be combined to create models with the required degree of precision necessary for the automatic translation of an MDA into code.

 I have made a lot of delicious but simple recipes from this book. It was the first Nigella's I got. But when will the DVDs, available in the UK, become available here? I saw her serie "Forever Summer" on BBC-America a while back and it is absolutely fabulous to watch. She has a way of measuring and using her hands that make actual preparation of a recipe a pleasure rather than the uncreative and impersonal chore of measuring "exact" tsp and 1/4 tspn. Being French I am used to a "pinch" of this, a "small glass" of wine, in other words using your judgement and "make it your own". Nigella makes being in the kitchen fun, but you really only get that by watching her. I don't really love cooking after all these years... but watching her do it her way inspires me. What can I say? 
 I haven't read that many novels.  This is by far the best one I had read and my very frist one from Nora Roberts.  The characters are very exotic and interesting.  The story is exciting, and very romantic.  The author really did a good job in plotting out the special encounters and unusual love journey between Princess Ardianne and Phillip.  I couldn't put the book down.  
 I love love love Bette Midler. This is a great Christmas CD that I will enjoy for years to come. I even bought a copy for a friend! However, I am disgusted with the "Christmas version" of Julie Gold's wonderful song "From A Distance," a big hit for Bette about 15 years ago. First of all, the track shamelessly panders to the vastly Christian audience with lyrics like "From a distance, the world sings 'Silent Night'" -- HUH? You think most of Africa and Asia are singing that song? Hardly. But how typically Christianly provincial to assume everyone in the world sings about Jesus. Give me a break. The track reeks. Otherwise, this album is perfection!! 
 I have practiced deep breathing relaxtion techniques for many years, and thought that I was able to control my heart rate and blood pressure. My last visit to my Dr told me otherwise. Even after deep breathing exercises my diastolic was still a little high. After using WD for a few days I realized that my deep breathing techniques that I had been practicing was all wrong. With Wds help I am able to truly relax to lower my stress and BP.  If you buy this and treat it like you would a regular computer game with the same expectations of achievement in getting to the next level, you will be very disappointed. However, if you use WD as a way to achieve true relaxation quicker than you thought was possible, then you will love it just as I do. By using WD I am able to relax quicker with every use.  I finished the game in two weeks, but still revisit the relaxation exercises almost every night. Just ordered the next installment "Wisdom Quest", and can't wait to learn new techniques.   If you buy the Journey to the Wild Divine, give it an honest trial and I am sure that you will not be disappointed 
 We are fascinated by the possibility that there may be some sort of life elsewhere than on the Earth.  The possibility that there is no life elsewhere is equally interesting, but it doesn't, for instance, make interesting science fiction movies.  Life outside of Earth has most often been imagined on Mars, which for all its differences from our planet is the one that is most similar to our own.  Thus, when on 7 August 1996 researchers announced that they had found evidence that might show fossilized life on Mars, it was not just a scientific announcement, but one which that non-scientist President Clinton had to take part in making.  _The Rock from Mars: A Detective Story on Two Planets_ (Random House) by Kathy Sawyer tells how the announcement came about, the science behind it, and the personalities (and the infighting) that made it happen and have kept research in the arena to the current day at various cutting edges at the limits of our understanding.  Sawyer, a science reporter for the _Washington Post_, has made this story not only interesting but exciting, a refreshing view of how big science is done these days.  The story began sixteen million years ago with an asteroid slamming into Mars.  This sent up debris, and some of the debris became asteroids in their own right, and came down on Earth.  This particular rock came down 13,000 years ago, and remained in the ice of Antarctica until it was discovered in 1984.  The special nature of the rock, wasn't understood until 1993, when geochemists started examining it, and found that it was 4.5 billion years old; it was the oldest known rock from any planet including our own.  More important, they found carbonates and iron crystals that were similar to such chemicals produced by organisms on Earth.  Sawyer carefully explains the process of examining the rock; acid, electron scanning microscopes, ultraviolet lasers and more are brought upon it.  There is lots of evidence that was turned up, and whatever the aftermath of the research, the team of David McKay, a famously careful and conservative researcher, did such a thorough job that the evidence was never in question.  It was the interpretation of the evidence that proved to be troubling.  Many scientists were upset that the researchers were taking undue advantage of a hot story and making it seem that their interpretation was factual rather than tentative.  NASA was criticized from the start for hyping the research and using it for political reasons.  In the ten years since the announcement, the controversy has become less prominent, but among scientists who are looking into the subject, there are still opposing camps on the matter, and vehement disagreements, and hurt feelings.  As Sawyer winds up the story, there is no overall agreement on just what McKay's team turned up.  There have been different ways of looking at the rock since then, none of them making a conclusive case.  This is not a bad thing.  Because of the controversy, new techniques have been brought into play and new discoveries have been made.  For instance, what was learned about possible earthly contamination of the rock will be used when bits of Mars are brought back by robot spacecraft sometime in the future.  Because of the controversy, there has been increased interest and better explanations for the origins of life on Earth in the most unlikely and unwelcoming of environments.  With its depiction of all-too-human scientists attempting objectivity when contemplating the great mystery of life elsewhere, Sawyer's account is an appealing picture of a good example of how science works 
 Henry Willson, the Hollywood agent who nurtured the careers of some incredibly handsome if not fabulously talented men, is the subject of this entertaining biography.  Willson emerges, ultimately, as a sympathetic figure who tread fresh ground for gay men in the "industry," but he was very much a product of his times.  He lived in the age of down-low homosexuality (remember that?), when one did whatever one wanted as long as it was done quietly.  Willson adopted a hyper-conservative, often hypocritical, persona and the book suggests that he may have become an FBI informant, telling tales on his own kind to protect himself. As the agent for Rock Hudson, Tab Hunter, Guy Madison, and so many other handsome men, Willson was the brains behind the beefcake.  He could wheel and deal with the best of them, and he played dirty with the worst of them as well.  Ultimately, his legacy as a "notorious" agent is based more on his having sex with many of his male proteges than any of his business dealings, but he never forced anyone into doing something they chose not to do.    This book is well-written and is an interesting social history of Hollywood life in the last years of the studio system's golden age.  It is worth its price alone for the short chapter on the mounting of the David O. Selznick film "The Song of Bernadette," which is hilarious 
 Just simply wonderful. I have going around for a long time to find this movie especally in a dvd.  I reconmend it to anyone who truely love love stories

 As a "follower of Christ" (Christian) who considers himself an Evangelical Protestant, this little devotional book will hold a special place in my library and my heart.  For all Christian believers, the richness and power of Brother Lawrence's life's witness and words are a fountain of Truth, a treasure that is as elegant (spiritually) as it is simple.  For the non-believers, I am afraid that reading this booklet (a spiritual treasure in disguise) will just confirm St. Paul the Apostles's words that "the message of the cross is ... foolishness to the Gentiles" (1 Corinthians. 1:18, 23 and 2:14).  The only way to do justice to this booklet is to quote from it and let you get a taste of it ...  This is a unique biography because it is not compiled by the Brother Lawrence of the Resurrection (birth name Nicholas Herman but known by his monastic name) but by the ones around his life in 17th century France.  Thus one learns very little about the beginnings of his life but very much about his godly lifestyle in the last 30 years of life of bliss (presence of God in his heart) and suffering (3 physical and debilitating ailments).   We learn about this Spirit-filled vessel in God's vineyard - Brother Lawrence, by reading the Eulogy of the abbot of Lawrence's Christian community, 4 short notes of his conversations with his spiritual father - Abb? de Beaufort, 16 very short letters of spiritual advice and encouragement Brother Lawrence wrote to friends and seekers, a manuscript found at his death called "Spiritual Maxims" and a memoir of a leader in the church in France.  The followings are a selection of the many highlights and underlined phrases and sentences from this book:  "Busy yourself with keeping your mind in the presence of the Lord."  "My most normal habit is to simply keep my attention on God, and to be generally and lovingly aware of Him."  "I occupy myself solely with keeping my attention on God and by being generally and lovingly aware of Him."  "We have an infinitely good God who knows what we need."  "Console yourself with the One who keeps you fastened to the cross."  "We should love our friends, but without prejudicing the love of God which must be first."  "Think often about Him; worship Him without ceasing.  Life and die with Him.  This is the beautiful call in the life of a Christian."  "...we should love one another through our words of counsel and even more through our good examples."  "...our only business in this life is to please God. ... my little progress in the path of perfection."  "I applied myself to practicing the presence of God ... Doing this gave me such a high esteem for God that faith alone was capable of satisfying me."  "A devout woman told me that the spiritual life is a life of grace that begins with service fear, increases through the hope of eternal life, and is consumated by pure love."  MY PRAYER: May we all experience God's love, which truly can consume all other passions, and be filled with His grace which will empower us to truly love our neighbors (Christian and non-Christian) as ourselves.  This is my life goal  
 If, like me, you have been disappointed by the Jessie Stone series, this book will be a pleasant surprise. Up to this point, Jessie has been an underdeveloped character - his books have seem to have been back-burner material and second-rate effort by Parker.  This one is different - and it is not a Spenser clone (like Sunny Randall)! Stone is working on two crimes at the same time and Parker paces them well so that the first crime (a rape at a local high school) comes to a resolution just as the second crime (a set of serial murders) finally starts to get interesting. No giant car chases or dramatic speeches as this book winds down, but it is satisfying nonetheless.  The only complaint I have is Parker's insistence on having dysfunctional romantic relationships dominate Stone's personal life (we love each other but we just can't marry each other because that would stifle us, but we are faithful to one another just like we were married, blah, blah, blah...). This is just like he has done with Spenser, Sunny Randall and Phillip Marlowe. Geez, give it a rest 
 John Warner's Fondling Your Muse is an uncommonly funny and clever book. Written by the editor of McSweeney's Internet Tendency, this book is not a straight-ahead 12-step program on how to become a writer. If you couldn't tell that from the tone of the title, you probably aren't going to enjoy the book. That said, if you did "get" it, this book will hit the funny bone often and directly, leaving your elbow feeling numb and tingly (in a good way).  The book often made me laugh out loud. Its tone, to over-generalize, is basically an ironic smarty-pants meets silly grade schooler (which, as can be expected, quite similar to that of McSweeney's Internet Tendency). What I liked best about the book is that, while taking numerous jabs at anyone from Oprah, to Stephen King, to John Updike, to Gee Dubya, to Hillary Clinton, Warner never seems snarky or mean. The tone remains playful as Warner's tongue is held firmly in cheek, and the result in a book that is pretty much delightful in its entirety. As one who Warner would deem "writerly aspirant", I found the book to be dead-on when it comes to characterizing the various writer stereotypes, conversations, and mindsets. This is the perfect gift for your friend who dreams of writing, yet is able to take her/himself not-so seriously. Even those who aren't planning on writing the Great American Novel or publishing volumes of their nature poetry can, I think, appreciate this book 
 This is ideal for a student, but more so for someone bogged down in the minutiae of Pauline studies looking to regain perspective.  Gorman doesn't let you miss issues surrounding what we don't know with certainty -- text or authorship, whether a phrase is Paul's or an appropriated hymn, if he was married or haunted my some psychological demons -- but his emphasis is on reaching a more historically informed and theologically sophisticated understanding what we need to know better: Paul's proclamation of Christ crucified and raised.  This is a book that every serious student of the Bible should have 
            What does biology, physics, the Bible, and Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven" have in common? They are part of Clifford A. Pickover's subject material used to explore the paradoxes of God and the science of omniscience. Pickover, a professional puzzler and inventor, will bend your mind like a wet noodle, so please bring an open mind and more importantly, plenty of aspirin when reading "The Paradox of God and The Science of Omniscience."              Pickover will convince you without a doubt about point A, but then be equally convincing with a contradicting point B. The book is bursting at the seam with paradoxes concerning God's nature. An interesting notion is that omniscience has its disadvantages. One example the author cogently dissects is a game of chicken with an omniscient being. If you enjoy ruminating on such notions, then this book will quickly enthrall and delight with the numerous permutations the author diverges on to grasp a fuller understanding of God. However, if the aforementioned leaves you in the doldrums, harking back to a time when you were forced to sit through the requisite Philosophy 101 college class, then this treatise will have you running for the hills.              The point of the author's writings is to challenge the definitions of God and the universe. The effect may be shattering as one's paradigm slowly shifts. Pickover seems to enjoy being the provocateur; his tone is gleeful at times. Pickover states, "The mere asking of these questions stretches our minds." He leads discussions via the Socratic method, but definitive answers are lacking as questions quickly multiply. However, one absolute is this: a gem of a read for anyone vaguely interested in God.

 I have many of these environmental cds, but it seems that this is one of the few that I reach for most often.  It has a little bit of everything, and not just one main theme repeated throughout the cd.  There are tracks of song birds, rainshowers, frogs, woods and more.  A great night's rest is guaranteed for me when I put this one in 
 This book has a wealth of information and beautiful photographs for inspiration 
 My sister gave me this cookbook for my birthday a few years ago.  When I found out there was a Volume 2, I rushed right out and bought that one, also.  You can tell by looking at both books that they are the ones I reach  for most often, because both of them are battered beyond belief 
 I've read most of the reviews here.  I've found this book troubling in many ways, and months after I read it, I just had to comment for others.  The amazing insight I got from Ishiguro's book was that these clones are much like all of us--always ready to move on, even when we know that what we're moving toward is awful.    Several people have commented that they wanted Kathy to escape her fate, and were profoundly disturbed that this never occurred to her as she  meekly marched toward her destiny.  I think this is a realistic observation of the human condition, and after reading the book, I began finding myself noticing that all people seem to move through all the rites of passage in their lives with eagerness, just as Kathy and her peers did.  In fact, Kathy, like all of us, is always impatient to get to the next milestone, even as this movement brings her inexorably toward pain and death.  Why would we be surprised by this intensely human reaction?    The story didn't feel like science fiction, nor like a reprise of other clone books written in the past several decades.  It felt like a very normal coming-of-age story about humans who just happened to be clones, callously created to rescue others.  So, I was never shocked, nor did I want them to escape.  It was only upon finishing the book that I was bowled over by the matter-of-fact approach, and that is why it continues to move me months later 
 I enjoy reading mysteries and have read quite a few in my time, but I've never before come across anything like "The Woman in White." I'm always a little skeptical when I hear a book being described as a page turner but that description fits this novel to a tee. I found it very hard to find a stopping place each evening and lost more than a few hours of sleep, but it was definitely worth every minute!   I don't want to give away too much of the plot but here is a very brief overview. Walter Hartright is a drawing instructor who has been engaged by Mr. Frederick Fairlie of Limmeridge Estate to tutor his niece, Laura, and her half-sister Marian Halcombe. On his way to take up this appointment Walter encounters a woman along the road, a mysterious woman dressed completely in white. He offers his assistance to the woman and soon after they part he discovers that she is an escapee from a mental asylum and is being sought by the local authorities. Walter travels on to Limmeridge but his experience with this mysterious woman is far from over. Upon his arrival he is surprised to discover that Miss Laura Fairlie bears an uncanny resemblance to the woman in white. This amazing story of deception and mistaken identities takes off from there and the suspense doesn't let up until the final pages!   One of the things that is so gripping about this novel is the way it is written, in the form of a narrative told in turn by each of the major characters. It is almost as if they are giving their testimony about the incidents to a jury in a courtroom. One character narrates the story to a certain point and then the next person takes up the story from there and so on and on. It's just such a good book and so hard to put down. Mr. Collins was a genius in the way in which he brought everything together. The ending is terrific! This is definitely one of the best mysteries I've ever read. Don't miss it 
 Shania's  future husband produced this album. Since he was a rock 'n roll producer mainly this angered the country establishment some but it was a good move on Shania's part. Her popularity in country music largely stems from this CD. Fans, like myself, who loved this CD went back and bought the first CD. Ultimately, the fans loved this CD and Shania and didn't care what the country music bigwigs in Nashville, thought of Shania 
 I have been subscribing to this mag for a couple years, and think it's one of the best gaming mags available.  I have several different consoles, and appreciate that they review games for all platforms.  I like the rating system (1-10) instead of the too-hard-to-pin-down 1-5, and find the reviews well written and objective.  While I have been gaming for years, I am not necessarily versed in computer lingo, but I never feel like an idiot after reading this mag; the writing is erudite but very easy to understand.  I read several different gaming magazines each month, and feel this magazine strikes exactly the right balance between the more serious and more frivolous gaming magazines in the industry.  One suggestion: if you have a GameStop or affiliated store in your neighborhood, get your subscription through them.  For about $15 you receive a 12-year subscription, and a card that gives you 10% off used games at these stores, as well as an extra 10% trade-in value on your used games (sometimes there will be a coupon in that month's mag to upgrade to 20% for both!).  
 I am a college student at a school that doesn't offer Arabic as a language, and I wanted to learn it on my own without taking away too much time from my other studies (including another language- Russian).  As someone who doesn't have an incredible amount of time to devote to the subject, and as someone with absolutely no knowledge of arabic whatsoever coming into it, this book is an EXCELLENT introduction to reading and writing the language.  The book is broken down very simply, devoting time to each letter and the different ways they are written.  The alphabet is known as a very difficult one for Westerners to master, especially when teaching oneself, but this book made the process very easy for me without taking much time.  I highly recommend it  to anyone who is learning this language for the first time, as the alphabet itself is the base off of which to learn everything else about the language.  Fantastic 
 While this is not the best of JAK's Harmony books -- the flower-named novels in the beginning were more intriguing, with their psi energy battles -- it is nevertheless a worthy addition to her earlier work.  I find Harmony to be an absolutely fascinating place (and I particularly liked Rose, the guard dust bunny) and only wish that JAK would produce books in this series more frequently.  As usual, the characters and plotting are excellent, and I hope JAK returns to Harmony very soon. 
 I first read this book 2 years ago after having listened to my family laugh about the characters for years.  I have read and reread this series of books several times.  They are hilarious. In this book, we meet Stephanie.  She has been laid off and bribes her wierd cousin into hiring her as a bounty hunter. She has absoloutely no skills and her first job is a cop accused of murder, Joe Morelli. Turns out they have quite the history.  And I don't want to spoil any of the laughs by telling you about their history, you have to read it to beleive it.  This is a great book and you'll have to read the others, too.  They are too funny!  Great characters 
 What follows are a few excerpts from my review of Solomon's book in the respected philosophical journal Mind (forthcoming):  "Robert Solomon's Living with Nietzsche is a superb book on Nietzsche's ethics.  Several reasons support this assessment:  First, Solomon brings to center stage Nietzsche's many constructive contributions to ethical theory and practice.  Beyond his famous genealogical critique of morality, Nietzsche's primary ethical goal is to transform readers, inspiring them to improve themselves, and Solomon shows how Nietzsche accomplishes this.  Second, he evaluates many of Nietzsche's major claims.  Too often Nietzsche scholars neglect this task, and they can learn from Solomon's example.  Third, although Nietzsche's ethics differs from Kantian and consequentialist moralities, Solomon argues that it contributes to the recently revived Aristotelian tradition of virtue ethics.  This comparison illuminates both Nietzsche and virtue ethics.  Fourth, he provides a balanced and nuanced account of Nietzsche's views that incorporates texts written in all of Nietzsche's periods and styles.  Solomon succeeds in finding the right tone to explicate Nietzsche.    The book possesses additional strengths as well.  For example, Solomon correctly understands that the key to Nietzsche's preferred virtues is overflowing energy, enthusiasm, and inspiration.  Also, Solomon's expertise in the theory of emotions helps him clarify Nietzsche's complex views on this topic.  ...  Overall, Solomon's book impressively synthesizes a lifetime of writing on Nietzsche's ethics.   Here are a few examples of Solomon's important critical questions.  (1) Nietzsche asserts that the fundamental constituent of the psyche is drives, and Solomon argues that this explains both too much and too little.  Distinguishing drives from goals can be difficult, and Nietzsche never seriously clarifies how various drives are related to one another or even what the basic ones are.  Is the will to power a single drive or a principle by which different drives are related?  Nietzsche depicts drives as conflicting, but says little about how such conflicts are resolved.  (2) Nietzsche sought to overcome Schopenhauer's metaphysics of the will, but then seems to reintroduce something similar when he postulates the will to power.  Even if Nietzsche were to claim that it is an empirical hypothesis rather than a metaphysical postulate, Solomon still has questions:  Is it a motive or a goal?  Is it the feeling of power or reality of power that is sought? Is its primary referent power over oneself, or is power over others also essential?  This vagueness makes Nietzsche's theory difficult to evaluate empirically.  (3) Solomon questions whether all aspects of morality derive from resentment and even challenges Nietzsche's claim that resentment is always a corrupt motive.  He thinks it can be and has been creative in overcoming oppression."  I am currently writing a book on Nietzsche's ethics myself, and I learned a lot from Solomon's book.  I think it is accessible to the general reader and also makes a genuine contribution to Nietzsche scholarship.  The writing is lively; the issues are important; and the discussion is valuable.

 It is true that Kenneth Branagh's movie version of Much Ado is over the top, but if there is anything more endearing, rousing, and gallant than the first 10 minutes of this film, I haven't seen it--it's a throwback in its way to the old Warner Brothers swashbucklers.  We know we have entered another, and more romantic world.    Michael Keaton, as Dogberry, and his fellows are far too broad, but Shakespeare survives them quite well.  Denzel Washington is an island of calm graciousness as Dom Pedro, and Keanu Reeves a bitter malevolence as his bastard brother John. In fact, a marvelously talented cast, all in all, and a genuinely entertaining film.  (This might not be there worst way for a student to encounter a Shakespeare play for the first time.) 
 I love the vivid pictures in this book! It's short on text but you could easily spend many happy hours poring over Alexandria's grand ports, hotels and public squares. 
 The Town That Forgot How to Breathe by Kenneth J. Harvey Published by St. Martin's Press Release: October 18, 2005 ISBN: 0-312-34222-5 Price: $24.95 Reviewed by: Jennifer LB Leese, www.geocities.com/ladyjiraff  Joseph Blackwood and his daughter, Robin, are off for vacation--away from the city. Recently separated from his wife Kim, Joseph longs to continue his close relationship with Robin.  As a native of a small outport community called Bareneed, Joseph soon finds he and his daughter caught up in the strange happenings of this quiet fishing village in Newfoundland.  Mermaids, undiscovered sea life, and perfectly preserved corpses from centuries ago, begin to surface from the sea. But mythical creatures aren't the only things bursting to get out; secrets of family lineage and an old spiritual woman with a story to tell keep the residents living on the borderline of sanity and lunacy.  Harvey captures the fear that envelops this small seaside town when residents begin to suffer from a mysterious illness that is making them forget how to breathe. Usually when jumping from one POV to the next, readers tend to get lost, but with Harvey's book, you actually look forward learning about and from each individual character. The tension of not knowing is massive.  Harvey's book, "The Town That Forgot How to Breathe" has been compared to having Stephen King's commercial power and Annie Proulx's literary warmth. With a creative plot and haunting tale, it is a real page-turner. Wanting to know why keeps you coming back for more.  With "The Town That Forgot How to Breathe" Kenneth J. Harvey makes his American debut--"a breakout book". The author carefully pieces together colorful characters and an eerie plot to evoking terror and suspense in the reader.  "The Town That Forgot How to Breathe" is an exceptional novel. Breathtaking! 
 First, let me admit that I have read only portions of Schaff's work, so the 4 stars are just a guess and s/b ignored. While I hesitate to write a review of anything I've not read, once again I'll make an exception.  The reason is that I have read the first  four volumes of Warren Carroll's "History of  Christendom" and especially recommend volume 4, "The Cleaving of Christendom" for balance.  If one sticks to non-Catholic authors, one  is in danger of reading only half of history.  Also good for balance is Thomas Woods' "How the Catholic Church BUILT Western Civilization" (emphasis in original). Woods' book is  delightful because it is mere history and  makes no theological statements. However much is does not threaten anyone's theology, it  is quite upsetting to most people's view of the historical role of Catholics 
 Comic-book-style four-panel color drawings by Pascal Lemaitre provide an inviting format in Toni and Slade Morrison's "Who Got Game?" series. Their retelling of the classic Aesop fable about the lion and the mouse extrapolates quite a bit on the original, adding a zany and fun side to the tale and truly wonderful illustrations. 
 Like a cheery cup of cocoa, this little book will warm you during the holidays.  A Paris hobo, Armand, is content in his life alone, and refuses any sort of commitment, never letting anything affect his freedom or his heart.  This all changes when he finds his favorite winter shelter is occupied by a homeless family of three children.  Cold, tired and hungry, he sets out to cheer them up by taking them to see Santa Claus, getting them fed along the way by taking up change for their singing.  When the mother finds out, she is furious, and refuses all charity.  Armand packs his meager belongings and walks away, only too happy to leave the little "starlings" on their own, lest he loose his heart and experience any more ingratitude.  As he says, "The street has a way of taking your pride."    The next day, however, he finds a pair of do-gooding women on their way to the authorities.  Armand knows their do-gooding will surely result in breaking up the family while the unsuspecting mother is at work.  What to do?  And what to do about the children's insistence that Santa is going to bring them a house for Christmas?  How can he keep them together, without their loosing faith in Santa and all of the good things of this world?  This is a cheery, well-written story that will take you no time to read--it's not much bigger than a short story.  However, the author throws in some clever twists that lead you to a different ending than you would normally expect.  Uplifting and simple, it's the kind of book to get your children at Christmas to make them aware of not only other people's needs, but other people's kindness.  
 if you like books about the old way of living,you will love this book.  it brings back memories of my childhood.. 
 This Movie is Hilarious and in my opinion Leslies funniest movie EVER! It's a must see for the endless laughs.. 
 Those who have followed Janet through the course of her career will appreciate this album as one of her best efforts. I put it in the same class as Rhythm Nation, Control, and The Velvet Rope. One of the remarkable things about this album is the combined stellar production efforts of Jermaine Dupree and Jam & Lewis - the result of which has produced one of the best R&B albums of the year. JD shows us a different side of Janet and it looks good (btw, great photography of her in the booklet); and Jam & Lewis remind folks that they are still very much an important part of the game. I can't get their "Take Care" out of my head -Jam's keyboard work on this track is awe-inspiring; and if you don't want to dance to "Get It Out Me", get your pulse checked.  "Show Me", "Do It 2 Me", "Love 2 Love" (more Jam keyboard brilliance), "Enjoy", and particularly "With U" are all exemplary efforts. Indeed 20 Y.O. is one of those rare albums with no apparent weak tracks. Well done Janet, JD and Jam & Lewis - again, one of her best efforts and a legitimate contender for my favorite album of the year 
 Great reference to those just learning EP or who are new to the field.  We used it for training of nursing staff in EP and for general cardiology fellows.  The book is easy to read and has done an excellent job of making  some of the more difficult concepts understandable 
 this cd is worth the price of gold ,if it would be just for one extremely rare hit ,that is ,"little ole man" (uptight everything's alright)by:the one n' only mr. bill cosby my brother dani diehl turned me onto it years ago n' ever since i've loved it forever , it seems !!i mean , who could resist this fantastic beat creating that dynomite rhythm !!whew !!! 
 This was the first Hemingway book I have read and I was surprised. I always imagined his books were boring and completely symbolibic to the point that you don't understand it. However I enjoyed this book and all the  short stories involved in this. All the stories were interesting and  connected the theme that the "winner takes nothing" in different  situations. I enjoyed the fact that since he probably wrote this in Europe,  Hemingway weaved French and sometimes German into the dialogue. Also in one  story Fitzgerald is mentioned as a wild child. "Winner take  nothing" is an easy book to understand and follow, and the stories are  original 
 Although I am mostly a C/C++ programmer, I still found this book to be an interesting read. If you, like me, have an interest in programming language design and implementation I highly recommend it. As other reviewers have noted, however, the book has little material for Lisp programmers who just want to use the MOP without looking under the hood. I don't consider this a shortcoming - understanding the design and implementation of your language and tools helps in using them effectively 
 Invaluable to seasoned blues hounds and newcomers alike, this package offers excellent lead examples from pickers like Robben Ford and Keith Wyatt - Not to mention a few other incredibally talented instructors at GIT. As if this were not enough, there is also ample rhythm time on each cd track to allow the aspiring blues man more than his/her fair share of gut-wrenching benchmark whiskey blues time 
 I love it when people thoroughly research a subject and then present it in a clear and concise manner.  I've read many books on leadership and success and this was one of my favorites.  It actually affected my outlook on life.  The author approaches the subject with almost childlike fascination and curiousity and uncovers the truth about why some are successful and some are not, as well as what makes a great leader and what does not.  It's almost unintentionally motivational.  The stories are fascinating, the presentation is clear and above all, it's objecive and factual, never preachy or presumptuous.  I highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in growing a successful business, or excelling in their chosen career.     The "one thing you need to know":  Leadership: People are motivated by their leaders when the leader can provide a clear vision of the future.  It gives them focus and direction.  Managing: People perform best when they work in areas that suit their strengths.  A good manager recognizes talents and where they would be best utilized in the company.  Individual Success: Once again, focussing on personal strengths and avoiding areas of weakness.  Find a job that you enjoy, that best suits your strengths, and work on improving those strengths. It'll energize you. Trying to improve in the areas that you don't care about will only hold you back 
 I read this book with a group of 6th graders, and both they and I loved it. It tells real, funny, heartfelt tales about growing up that both adults and kids can relate to. It was so nice to find a book that won such a positive reaction from my students 
 i will die if i don't write a review for this thin, slender, sleeve of heaven here on earth of horrors.  well the first album was unspeakably IT and this is the Dolls all matured, hot and bothered...oh it is beautiful and sad and wonderful and so mature and wise and experienced like a true veteran soldier of the vietnam war.  so different from the first album but i feel like i have witnessed an entire career in only two albums...well three if you also count the also must have "Hard day's night"  Gain possession of these three cd's and you will die of happiness and fright 
 In Forever Odd, one of Dean Koontz's most endearing characters returns to face new perils, following the trail of a kidnapped friend and dicing with death in a derelict gambling resort. Odd Thomas is his gentle, quirky self once more, communing with the ghost of Elvis and finding himself terrorised by scary cat Terrible Chester. I found this latest outing good but not quite as gripping or significant as the first novel, with a villainess who is more frivolous than menacing. Hopefully, the bad guys will be back on form in Brother Odd, the next book in this intriguing series 
 Nice and solid, great wooden spoon with added benefit of straight edge for scraping. Combine with dish towels for a nice hostess gift 
 I bought this season coupple of days ago, and WOW, is all I haver to say. It seems like the shows are longer, better acting (well some scence), and I like the scenes where they had edited them in the tv broadcast.   If you are a Knight Rider fan like mylself, then this should be in your collection!! 
 What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said? It's violent? Yes. Is there a whole lot of cussing? Oh yeah. But is the violence and language really that gratuitous? Well the language is pretty much how people talk, like when the characters are just talking a f-word might slip occasionally but isn't that how normal conversations are? The language gets pretty rough but think of what the characters are going through. I'd be cussing just as much if someone just kidnapped me or just shot a roomful of people. And about the violence being gratuitous? Hell do you know what it looks like when someones head is blown off? Well let me tell you it's much worse in real life than in the book. So yeah it's a violent book but that justs shows how sick some of the characters are. The main characters resort to violence but never cold blooded murder. But beyond the gore and language there lies one of my favorite stories ever. The first story in this book about Jesse's family is my favorite story in the whole series. But the series as a whole is the reason I read graphic novels again. Best book ever, go pick it up 
 I want to drown myself in a vat of beeswax every time I leaf through these gorgeous paintings.  Solid information about the varieties of wax and mediums and practical suggestions for studio setup and which equipment to use eliminate the esoteric intimidation factor and make encaustic painting accessible to all levels of artist 
 This book is an essential piece of work for the player who wants to know the newer cards.  The cards which are coming nowdays are very complex and it is important that you have a reference so that you can get an idea of what you might be facing and to use this information to get ideas on how to stop or counter it 
 Its a great scale that measures accurately and very quick, it's pretty cheap and weighs up to 11 pounds. It also has the tare button to zero it out which is one of the most useful things ever. My only complain (other than that it uses a 9-volt battery) is that it really isn't very washable and you can't remove the top to wash it off from stuff that may get on it. Nonetheless it is an excellent product 
 This was the Second best book I have read dealing with Trading.  The First was  "The Disciplined Trader" by Mark Douglas. 
 Try this before spending money on surgery...her transformation was amazing.  We could visually see the difference in her appearence.  Well worth it 
 Some people just don't get it.  Do you expect this flick to be some kind of masterpiece?!  I believe one of the reviewers called this movie "pathetic."  I guess that's what you get in a critically democratic forum like Amazon (throws up hands).  This is an enjoyable Monster Movie, professionally made, that takes itself seriously (a good thing for a movie-a bad thing for a movie-goer). It ain't Orson Welles.  Oh, and it isn't pornographically violent like the horror/thriller flicks currently filling movie theaters with vomit and teenagers.  If you "take your horror seriously," you shouldn't bother with this one (oh, and you should get out more).  Otherwise, enjoy some mindless schlock

 David Crosby offered the author $100 if during her research she came across anyone who disliked Cass.Needless to say,she did not collect any reward.  Her reward is knowing she has done a worthy job in presenting the essence of Cass Elliot for readers touched by the singer's amazing talent and personality.  A must-read for anyone remotely interested in Cass,The Mamas and Papas and the West Coast music scene of the mid to late 60' 
 In March of 1975, New Orleans favorites The Meters were asked to play a party hosted by Paul and Linda McCartney.  The results are energetic and funk-eh!  What makes this album so great is hearing Ziagaboo Modeliste nailing down his syncopated rhythms, and George Porter & Leo Nocentelli doubling up their bass and guitar lines creating snaky hooks and driving funk.  Art Neville, the self-proclaimed "grandfather of the group", leads the group through classics such as Hey Pocky-a-Way, Africa, and a 10 minute long Ain't No Use.  A special treat is the Cissy Strut > Cardova > It's Your Thing > Love the One Your With segue.  The only misteps are that the lead vocal mic on Love the One Your With is too low, so you can only really hear Art singing back-up.  I'm also not crazy about the Bread tune "Make it With You" but the enormous strength of this disc far outweighs one so-so tune, and a turned down mic.  The disc is espeically appealing because they broke up and this may be the only commercially available live effort by the original line-up, and only Art Neville and George Porter currently tour with the Funky Meters (the recent reunion show not withstanding) 
 In the late 1980s and early 1990's, it looked as though Seagal would join the ranks of Hollywood's top action stars. You would hear his name in the same sentence with Arnie and Stallone, no small feat indeed. And to a large degree, Seagal's films deserved the comparison. "Under Siege" was a winner, as were "Hard to Kill" and "Above the Law." The actor's greatest appeal isn't hard to fathom; Seagal embraced a brutal form of martial arts that, at least onscreen, allowed him to slap down thugs, break bones, and wreak massive havoc without batting an eye. Literally, Seagal would stand in place and put down one goon after the other with an ease that looked not only natural but also realistic. I still enjoy watching that pool room scene where Seagal's character used pool cues, billiard balls, and whatever else he could lay his hands on to put out the trash. Alas, how the mighty have fallen. The early 1990s may as well be ancient history as far as Steven Seagal is concerned. Although he's still capable of making a few entertaining films, like his comeback picture "Exit Wounds," far too often we're seeing movies like "The Foreigner" and "Ticker."   Amazingly, Seagal doesn't play an intelligence operative or freelance secret agent in "Exit Wounds." Nope, he's nothing more than a hotshot Detroit cop named Orin Boyd in this movie. Of course, Seagal's character angers the top brass when he carelessly intervenes to save the vice president from a group of militia nuts bent on assassination. Why the police and secret service agents would express anger at a man who single handedly saved the second highest government official from certain doom is beyond me, but it does present the viewer with the first of many implausible events that pop up from time to time in this picture. To punish the errant officer, officials send Boyd to the worst precinct in town, the lowly Fifteenth. Once there Orin Boyd runs afoul of the gorgeous Commander Mulcahy (Jill Hennessy), gets sent to an anger management class where he meets the loudmouthed Henry Wayne (Tom Arnold at his most grating), and botches a drug sting set up by the suspicious Montini (David Vadim). Despite the fact that Montini nearly took Boyd's head off with a power tool, Mulcahy punishes Boyd assigning him to traffic detail. No matter what he does, Seagal's character can't catch a break. Even his new fellow officers seem to despise him, with the exception of his new partner George Clark (Isaiah Washington) and the beefy Sergeant Strutt (Michael Jai White).   Still, Orin Boyd is a cop's cop, and he quickly proves his mettle by latching on to the case of suspected drug dealer Latrell Walker (DMX), the very same case Montini was working on. When someone robs police headquarters of a boatload of heavy narcotics, Boyd knows something big is about to go down. The answers seem to lie around Walker and his boisterous companion T.K. (Anthony Anderson). Well, looks often deceive, and nothing is more deceptive than Latrell Walker. In a series of plot twists, Boyd discovers a big secret about this supposed inner city dope peddler, a secret that will eventually lead to the discovery of a lot of dirty laundry at the very precinct house where Boyd now works. "Exit Wounds" treats us to one slam-bang action scene after another as Seagal works hard to bring the bad guys to justice. We see car chases, massive shootouts, exploding helicopters, expensive cars, surprisingly gory scenes of carnage, fistfights, swordfights, martial arts action, car jumping, and just about anything else that has ever appeared in an action film. It's as though the filmmakers couldn't decide what they wanted to do so they just threw everything, including the kitchen sink, into the mix.  I have to say I liked "Exit Wounds." Seagal shed many of those embarrassing pounds to play a rather active Orin Boyd. Some of the martial arts scenes where he puts his man down for good look just like the good old days. Even more surprisingly, his character plays for laughs. Witness the desk-crushing scene at the anger management class and his experience as a traffic cop for proof of this assertion. Although self-parody is usually the last refuge of an ailing action star, Seagal pulls it off well. It doesn't hurt to have the frenetic Anthony Anderson hamming it up all over the place either. Too, I was impressed with some of the faces I saw in the movie. Aside from the previously mentioned Jill Hennessy, Tom Arnold, and Isaiah Washington, we also see Bill Duke, Eva Mendes, and Bruce McGill having fun in minor parts. Even DMX does a good job, and I despise rappers. But, and this is a big but, there are many illogical scenes that had me shouting out loud in disbelief. To cite but one example, I couldn't help but groan in amazement at the scene where Mulcahy's vehicle soars off the second, or possible third, story of a parking garage only to roar off down the street seemingly untouched. Oh brother!  For this type of film, the extras are amazingly abundant. You get a trailer, a DMX music video, a lengthy making of feature, a special "Day in the life of Anthony Anderson" featurette, and extensive cast and crew filmographies. Even Seagal the Great sits down to discuss his role in the picture. The behind the scenes stuff tells us that Joel Silver produced the movie, explains how the stunt scenes used wires to suspend and move around the characters, and breaks down most of the action sequences. I heartily recommend "Exit Wounds" to action fans. Sure, it's a later stage Seagal picture, but it's also a very good Seagal picture.           
 An enduring tale for those in the mood for Christmas, or not; it will take you there. The golden tones of Patrick Stewart resound throughout the heartfelt reading. Lets you become a child again 
 I just randomly stumbled on Motion City, don't even remember how and I absolutely love them...I am the Movie is also a very good CD but Commit this to Memory doesn't have a single bad song on it... Top Songs: - Everything is Alright - When You're Around - Make Out Kids  Also check out the song 'MONSTERS INVISIBLE' I randomly downloaded it and it is a really wicked track...not sure where it's from.. 
 This first book of Jane Austen's doesn't have the same subtlety as her later works, but it is light-hearted and good writing.  It's amazing how skillful she was at writing dialogue, even at a younger age.  I mention her youth because it pervades Northanger Abbey; the character are youthful in spirit, and I think that of all her novels, this one might be the most accessible to the modern day younger reader.  It was certainly one of my favorites as a teenager (though the pleasure of rereading it hasn't diminished as I've aged).  The simple and natural emotions of the main character, Catherine Morland, would seem more real to many of today's teenagers than the repressed spirits seen in so many novels of this period.  Catherine is perhaps the least 'civilised' of Austen's leads, in that she does little to conform her behavior to the decorous standard of the day, but she has an exuberance and sweetness that breathe life into every scene, and I think this carries the book.  Northanger Abbey is a delightful read for all ages and Austen fans, even the most serious

 The Quiet Game's main character is Penn Cage who appears again in Turning Angel. I took pains to read The Quiet Game first, having missed it when it was first published. I was glad I did. Iles has fashioned another intriguing novel set in the Deep South. He takes his daughter home for a little peace and quiet but this novel is anything but. Fast-paced, great plot, well-developed characters, it has everything you need for an enjoyable read. Iles continues to build on his solid foundation of intriguing novels 
 This is a good film about the Flying Tigers stationed in China. With John Wayne at the helm of the volunteers they dogfight their way to victory one plane at a time against the Japanese aggressors in W.W.II. before America entered the war. The film plays like a soap opera at times but good flying sequences and a script that explores the camaraderie of these men make the film very entertaining and rewarding 
 recommended buy. Through The Test of Time as her song goes people will realize she will rank as one of the greatest musical talents America ever produced. darius deguzman , santa rosa, c 
 The Way West is the "epic saga" of a wagon train heading west to Oregon and although The Way West was a bit hard to get into, it was a real page-turner. At the beginning of the novel, the characters all blend together and it was hard to differentiate between them all. However, after the wagon train `hits the trail', A.B. Guthrie does a fantastic job at portraying the individuality of all of the pioneers through tone and imagery. The McBees, the 1800s equivalent to `trailer-trash', are represented as such when Guthrie makes Hank McBee out to be an arrogant, hot-headed, ignoramus. Likewise, I almost cried when the Fairman's sick boy Tod gets bitten by a rattlesnake and dies. Guthrie does a brilliant job at characterization throughout the entire novel. 	In fact, it is Guthrie's characterization that portrays the prominent (in my opinion) theme of the novel, that morality is subjective and cannot be used to effectively judge character.  	When I first picked up this book, I expected it to be a stereotypical western, complete with hostile Native Americans and disease-ridden pioneers. However, I found that Guthrie was very realistic about his wagon train and stayed away from typical motifs often found in westerns. Although I would probably not read it again, The Way West was an enjoyable novel and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a quick read.

 This book is essentially a follow-up to the author's previous work Consciousness Explained. Dennett revises and builds upon the ideas he put forward in that book, and addresses some of the criticism that has been leveled against his theory of consciousness in the intervening years. He also reviews some of the development (or lack thereof!) in the study of and debate over the question of consciousness over the past few years.  As always, Daniel Dennett presents his ideas with great precision and eloquence. No other writer I have read does a better job of shedding light on the question of consciousness. As the author repeatedly cautions, much work remains to be done before we have a full understanding of how human consciousness works. But Dennett rejects the "Mysterian" view that consciousness is something special which by its very nature we can never obtain an understanding of using the scientific method. He puts forward a methodology for the systematic study of consciousness, and shows persuasively that it is a phenomenon just as open to scientific inquiry as any other biological function. One of the major themes in both Consciousness Explained and in this postscript to it is idea of "zombies", the subject of an old philosophical thought-experiment. The zombie is a creature indistinguishable from normal people but which has no internal mental life, no consciousness. As Dennett says he addresses the question of zombies reluctantly since it has been the source of so much confusion. He shows very clearly how the concept has little use in clarifying the question of consciousness. He also addresses the inevitable question of artificial intelligence and whether it is possible for "mere machines" to be consciousness. The answer turns out to be yes, since those conscious machines are us!  It would be best to read the author's previous book Consciousness Explained before reading this one 
 It was nice to re-learn the old adage to "not judge a book by its cover". I had been reluctant to read the book by the title alone and what a missed pleasure and educational experience that would have been. As some other reviewers have noted, the title is not entirely indicative of the topics explored. The wealth of knowledge of the new discoveries of human nature, good government, and historical shifts due to the 'changes in the means of production' (i.e. capitalism) abound from Lord Kames to Adam Smith during the Scottish Enlightenment. Also, if one is interested in the genesis of North America and other Democracies, one should not bypass this book.   The book is divided in two parts, of the "Ephinany" (I call it Human Nature discovery) and the "Diaspora". This 1st part and I believe the heart of the book primarily explores the Scottish Enlightenment of the Protestant ethos from Francis Hutcheson, Lord Kames to Adam Smith and David Hume of 'man as a product of history and that we are ultimately creatures of our environment' and 'the way people earn a living shapes the character of their laws, their government, and their culture'. The 2nd part is the Diaspora of the Scots due to the 'clearances' or 'famines' and other reasons and their migrational impact and contributions to other societies.   As for many reviewer's concern about the footnotes or lack there of, such items like the origins of 'blackmail' or 'redneck' are easily found or verified by completing a search with multiple sources identified within a few seconds. However, I do see their point with respect to the many quotes within the book, but don't believe this takes away from the theme of topics the author explores and appear to not have been challenged since publication.  All in, a worthwhile read and high marks if nothing else than for just the 1st part of the book with the exploration of themes on policies for good government and the 'changes in the means of production' and its impact on history 
 Here, in a copious nutshell, is a reference work of awesome value. Not just an analysis of what your malady consists of, but detailed info on what you can do about it (including get thee to thy sawbones when called for). Not just lists of vitamins and herbs, but how much and how often. This is worth many times its reasonable cost. 
 Ron and Robert Galloway splendid documentary points out how this non-altruistic behemoth has provided low cost goods for its customers.  They are able to purchase television sets, clothing, and even groceries.  Some of even become happy employees with bright futures.  It borders on intellectual dishonesty not to declare Wal-Mart to be something of a secular savior to our planet's poor.  Pity those who do not have one of its stores in their area, or at least manufacture products for the company.  Socialists may make false promises---but Wal-Mart delivers.  Government is quite often part of the problem, and not part of the solution.  The free market knows how to get the job done.     The Galloway brothers ask questions of a number of scholars who closely study Wal-Mart.  The consensus viewpoint of even moderate liberal academics is that this company does far more good than harm.  Only hard left-wing ideologues persist in describing Wal-Mart as evil.  The added bonus is the interviews with a number of Wal-Mart workers.  They may even bring a tear to your eye.  I strongly recommend this dvd.  
 This is a re-issue of an older book (early 1970's), this book is still relavant because much of its contents are not recognized by many people.  It tells the story of the dissent that brewed among the GI's in 'Nam.  By no means universal, the dissent actually crippled America's ability to fight the war.  Neo-cons admit the truth of this book's comments every time they extol the greatness of an all-volunteer army as opposed to one formed by draftees.  The truth of this book is exhibited by the armed forces' refusal to start a draft even as recruiting goals fail today.  But the history books still do not speak of the widerspread GI revolt in Vietnam 
 I am probably a bit unusual for a Kate Bush fan in that I like her earlier work better than her later work.  And of Lionheart and Never For Ever and The Kick Inside (which are all creme de la creme Kate), this is my favorite album.  I was introduced to Kate by my mother while I was still fairly young and have been an admirer of/listener to her music since.    I find Kate's early work more theatrical, more strong, more driving, more *vital* than her later work - although I think almost all of it is wonderful.    One can't go wrong trying Kate for a listen.  If you've never tried, listen to samples from this album, from The Dreaming, and then from Aerial and see which you like best.  I think they represent the different spectrums of Kate as she matures and lives and learns and grows as a musician and singer and artist.  Enjoy 
 [A review of the 3RD EDITION 2004].  The promise of this book over its earlier editions is the inclusion of the new threading classes under Java 1.5, which is now renamed J2SE 5.0. Personally I think the new acronym is forbidding to newcomers. Just like the HP snake workstations which it called [eg] HP9000/720.  If you are migrating to 1.5, then it is at least worth your time to see the new threading and what you can do with it. Like the thread pooling and task scheduling. The intent is to free you from having to hand craft what Sun regards as often needed threading utility functions. And so each developer does not need to waste her time independently recoding. Sun has performed a little refactoring, at the language level.  But if you are happy sitting on 1.4, and already have the 2nd edition of this book, then I can't say you really need this edition. Unless you want to see possible advantages in threading if you move.  By the way, the book may say threading in Java is easier than in other languages. But that does not mean that threading is easy. The book can give you some appreciation of the nuances involved. In many ways, the issues in the book are far harder than [say] some book on building a UI with Java 
 This is a long biography of Capote that covers the writer from birth to death, and appears comprehensive. Mostly it is an easy read about a fascinating character as well as a great author. I can't give it five stars however, since I feel it has problems in several areas. First, the author spends too much time on Capote's childhood. Alright already, he had a weird childhood. So do most people these days! It dragged on for far too long at the expense of more interesting periods where five years could fly by in one (short) chapter. Second, there should have been an introductory chapter on NY high society before the author disclussed Capote's voyage through it. Sort of what Painter did on French high society before describing how Proust entered it. This would have been useful because no one remembers who these people were anymore (and I was an adult at the time in NY) or worse, only remembers them because they were friends or foes, or both, of Capote. So the book is dated in that respect; reading it in 2006 it seems like Capote was conferring social distinction rather that trying to acquire it. Finally the paperback cover was absolutely weird. I know it was a tie in to the movie, but instead of a picture of Capote it was a picture of Seymour Hoffman playing Capote. Bizzare. It would be like having a biography of Lincoln with a picture of Raymond Massey on the cover. Considering Hoffman didn't even mention Capote at the Academy Awards, it was truely strange 
   This book, I highly recommend to everyone, even my baba [Father]  Not only is it a tattling read for people of all races but its beyond inspirational.  Marta's life has been a fantasizing path full of spiritual growth, understanding, travel and knowledge, a very charmed life. In this book she not only stresses the impotents of traditional rituals, she also explains why it is important for Rites, knowledge, ancestor worship among many others with out being stuck up.  This book will fill you in to things you may not have known, and forces you to see small and large aspects of the religion in a whole new light. When this book first arrived I was not thinking I would get hooked as fast as it did, but once I started reading, the content grabbed a hold of me and I was unable to put the book down, I read form beginning to end none stop and I know you will do the same.  The books message is also very important to woman and the roles woman carry within Santeria. Be strong; be loving but most of all love you're self and what you do. The book talks about just how important woman are, unlike some books that more or less praise men all around.  Wonderfully well written and styled - The detail is strong but not over powering where the writing becomes dull. The details are just right, and the wonderful thing is: You can feel her though her words. She writes from the depth of her soul and enlightened mind, and it comes through the pages as bright as the sun.  You will be left with a cool claim mind, and a bigger and brighter out look on all things.  I highly recommend this book for everyone includeding those who don't know what Santeria is, like your friends and family- this book will help them understand so much. This book is not just for people who are new to Santeria, but for everyone, young and old.  Ashe.  Happy reading. 
 These songs bring back so many memories from my childhood. I remember dancing in the kitchen with my dad while this tape played. Now I'm 17 and we still have the tape. so when I found the cd on here I had to buy it. My favorites are: "can't get used to losing you", "Moon River", "Born Free", "Danny Boy", "Impossible dream", and my all time favorite..."Emily." It was always a special song since my name is Emily. I know that this was more sharing my feelings than reveiwing the cd, but thats ok. I highly recommend this album. Andy Williams is one of the best. 
 Boorstin outlines the fundamentals and development of American consumerism and capitalism of the 19th Century. A great read for understanding why America was the great attraction of emigration. A good emphasis is put  forth on how much American ingenuity happened by accident.  This book is  excellent for describing who we are, how we dressed, how we ate, and how we  profited from it.  Like the rest of Boorstin's works, this is a must for  any student of history 
 I guess I've seen this at least five times over the years, but it is always enjoyable. Hoffman is fascinating to watch as he switches from failed male actor to successful female TV star. An excellent supporting cast helps as well, and in fact, all the elements came together for the production team on this project. If you missed it, make a point of remedying that gap in your knowledge of successful movies. 
 This CD is pretty good for your money's worth.  It has that 'feel good nostalgia' sound, if you grew up in this era.  The music is definately worth a listen to again, after all these years.  This CD is a trip down memory lane and very refreshing.  I enjoy replaying several tracks on it 
 I decided to read all of the books from this author after browsing her last book (Drinking from the Rain, I believe) and getting absolutely hooked on it. Her writing really appeals to me.  It is not easy for me to understand Sasha, the main character in this book, probably because of the generation gap, but also because I couldn't accept her to be so strong and so weak at the same time. The ending is also very confusing, I didn't expect marriage and maternity to have such a strong effect on her (negative, from my view). I will be checking out here at amazon to see if other people can help me to make sense of the book ending. I intend to read other books from Ms. Alix K. Shulman pretty soon 
 Enjoyed listening to the book.  It was in good condition. Took longer to get here hand expected 
 Thanks for your help! The purchase went very smooth.  I'll be back in the fall for the next addition 
 What a delight! This book has a charming style of writing, easy to follow exercises and you feel like you sat and chatted with Pete Sanders about his ideas. I have really enjoyed the book and have read it and reread it several times. I even picked up the entire Free Soul Correspondence Course and will be starting that after my house guests leave...  If you are a basic person, one that has not experienced NDEs, was not born knowing or seeing visions from birth (those are the lucky ones) YOU will benefit from this book. It tells you how to work hard, practice and tune into your intuitive abilities.  YES! Buy it, enjoy it and go forth and be psychic 
 I read this book for a report, and I found it very factual and helpful. I don't think it would be the kind of book someone would just pick up and read. I would only read it if I wanted to research or find information on Drunk Driving 
 I believe that this book is essential for amateur and professional photographers who are visiting the Grand Canyon for the first time. This book includes all of the details that you need to guide you through a positive experience, shooting all parts of the canyon. I just returned from there and I sure am glad that I read the book first and also took it along on the trip for reference. Well worth the money 
 Plot:  I had never read an 'Alex Delaware' book before, and am always a bit leary picking up a book in a series of books because I may not understand the workings of the character built up before the novel I happen to read.  However, this book was well written and so detailed I didn't feel like I had ever missed a thing.  Written from the point of view of Alex, as well as his best friend, Milo, you really get a sense of the character's motives and flaws.  Another thing I enjoyed about this story is that it is not a predictable ending, and it didn't feel forced.  I hate when a book feels like it just hurried up and tied all the loose ends so it can wrap up.  I never got that feeling from this book, which was a joy.   From the Audio standpoint:  I have never heard an audio book where the reader did such a superb job.  I truly felt that I was listening to a variety of characters, each had their own pitch, inflection and you could hear the emotions in the voice.  I could put in a tape at random and tell you what character was speaking, even though there were well over 10 characters in this storyline.  Very well represented! 
 A wonderfully organized collection of great recipes. The instructions are clear and effective to achieve the perfect dessert 
 this is a book that I recieved as a junior in High  School. I am currently  a senior and I still enjoy looking into this book for mathematical insight  and history 
 I really enjoyed this one. Dr. Alex Delaware - child psychologist/police consultant - is in real peril and it's possible even his pal Detective Milo Sturgis can't help him this time.  It starts with a package in the mail - a very disturbing cassette tape that sets Alex on edge. But then, it becomes apparent that he's being stalked and with therapists dropping like flies, Alex is afraid he may be next on the list! It's a real twisty-turny plot that kept me reading, but there are so many names, I couldn't keep everyone straight. Alex and his girlfriend Robin are really put through the ringer by this stalker as the little harassing escapades get more and more intense - more and more violent - more and more deadly.  There's a new addition to the cast - an adorable little stray dog named Rover/Spike/Barry ... Love that dog! Hope he stays around. And it's interesting to see just how well connected Milo is - he has friends everywhere 
 This girl has the talent, the look's and the momentom to go a long in this business.  What a great true bluegrass album.  I just love her and her music!!! Tom Alma 
 Bridget Jones, modern day woman, brillant and doesn't know it, prone to accidents and mess ups but manages to come out of them.    This is the book that started it all with the chick lit fever.  Bridget Jones is my hero!  
 It's very hard to grasp the importance that John Fahey's music had in the development of the solo acoustic performance genre. Before Fahey the guitar (in "popular" music) was only there to support the voice. Fahey made the guitar the star. He did this not through sheer virtuosity, although certain elements of his technique were unmatched, but by being INTERESTING! His music was hard to pigeonhole, was it bluegrass,blues,new-age,folk?...all of these and none of these, it WAS thought provoking and hypnotic. Now that he's gone artists are coming out of the woodwork (at least three tribute albums already). He could have used their support during his very tough life, but Fahey was not an easy person to love. He was iconoclastic and highly critical(even of himself). His excellent literary efforts show him to be a very complex and troubled individual. This compilation of recordings is a good representation of his ever evolving musical style (he called it "American Primitive Guitar"). If you love music and don't know John Fahey, prepare to be profoundly changed.  
 After going through so many visibly successful "slimming phases," Winfrey has arguably shed more pounds in the aggregate than the ill-fated Donner Party, and her directives should not be taken lightly. I myself followed this wonderful book's program for several weeks before my second wedding, and was able to wow my betrothed with a slender new physique in time for our romantic yet financially disastrous trip to Petit St. Vicent. Sadly just like its esteemed author, I fell into a subsequent bout of severe gluttony that rapidly erased my hard-won gains. However I took heart in Ms. Winfrey's own phoenix-like dieting program, convinced that one day success would again be mine. I found the quiet example of Winfrey's co-author, a Mr. Bob Greene, to be no less inspiring. Greene is an object lesson in tenacity and dedication as he daily addresses the Sisyphean task of being Ms. Winfrey's personal trainer 
 Tony Hillerman once again created a fresh and involving entry in his long-running series about the Navajo Tribal Police. Leaphorn has retired in this one, at loose ends after the death of his beloved wife Emma. Chee is the acting Lieutinent but may not want it to become permanent. There is a little less of the Navajo mysticism in this one but the vast territory covered by the Navajo Tribal Police is given its due as always.  Hillerman dedicated this book to the six officers who had given their lives in defense of their people from the time he wrote his first book until this one. It is only fitting that while keeping true to the Navajo atmosphere always present in this series, good police work, and the very real dangers involved for the Tribal Police are brought to the forefront.  Leaphorn is asked to look for the missing Catherine Pollard, and his unofficial case will intersect with Chee's investigation into an officer's death, that while seemingly all wrapped up, may indeed be more complex that it first appears. Chee is chagrined to discover he is still a little intimidated by Leaphorn, but as the two cases cross paths they will once again peel back a little more of the veneer and come closer to understanding each other.  This one has everything from the poaching of eagles to a very real possibility of the bubonic plague being spread all across the Navajo landscape. Why a pack of praire dogs are unaffected by the virus is only one of the clues to solving the mystery. An old Navajo woman who claims to have seen a skinwalker will also figure greatly into an exciting ending.  The conclusion to this one is heartfelt for Chee, as his relationship with the pretty lawyer Janet begins to flame out. Janet, it seems, returning to New Mexico after her time in Washington, may  be Navajo in name only.   This is one of the best in the series as Hillerman once again paints the Navajo and the territory they inhabit with the colorful hues of the southwest, and explores the many mystical aspects of the American Indian 
 This is the book I check first when I have a question about an English Rose. The organization is great, the photography is beautiful, and the plants are described by someone who has grown them in the US. This book is therefore best for those growers who live in Southern California, but still, it's better than if it was written by an English grower. This book also describes the negative aspects of varieties, which is one of the most helpful things. One thing that would improve this book is a photo or description of the plant habit so to provide information on where to plant in the garden. E.g. is Abraham Darby staunchly upright, graceful, floppy? This book isn't all-inclusive, and of course there are new roses being released every year, but if you've got to have the latest, does it matter? Check out also 100 Old Roses for the American Garden, by the same author. Also a great book 
 This workout certainly works.  It definitely has done everything that it's promised it would.  I've only been following the program for about three weeks, and I've noticed a drastic difference.  I'm 19 years old, and even though I am in no way overweight, doing this program regularly has helped me lose over five pounds in the three-week span I've been doing it... and I haven't even been following the diet.    I do warn people not to expect your first time to fly by in the 20 minutes it says.  As a matter-of-fact, until you learn each exercise and the order that they are given, it will probably take at least an extra 10 minutes.  The upper body workout is much faster than the lower body, with which I have a lot more trouble, and even now it takes atleast 30 minutes.    Overall, this book is fantastic for weight training.  I just think people need to know that the workouts may take a little longer than expected.  Also, I wish the book would have put more emphasis on the need for some sort of cardio workout along with the weight training.  
 Based on the input of the recipient, it was read in one sitting and laughter ensued.  It looked like fun to me as I glanced through it...a fun gift -- just the title alone for the wine Aficionado...  
 Very good book. Covers a lot of ground and happens to address well my skill level (advanced). After reading it I can't wait to get on the slopes to try the recommended drills and described techniques 
    Word of Mouth, Jaco Pastorius' second solo release from 1981, at the time was a eclectic collection of work that met with mixed reviews.     Since his untimely death, where the listeners at large have delved into his recorded past, live and in studio, to satisfy the obvious void of not having him here today, this collection of work has grown into its own and what was once eclectic or odd to one's ears is now commonplace and dare say, has become my genrrations jazz "standard".    Pastorius' background and influcences validate and solidfy this work. Jaco's big band original/arrangments such as Three Views of a Secret and Liberty City are direct products of his discovery and love for this style of music as a young boy listening to either tv show soundtracks and music as well as his Father's love for Sinatra's music growing up, to name a few. Combine that with his time periods Beatles, James Brown etc etc and one can understand "where he was coming from".    The jewel here is "Three Views of a Secret" , hands down the most beloved Pastorius original by his collegues, friends, family and fans, whether they are casual, one time or fulltime fans.    If there is once song to define where his career matured to or was heading, "Three Views" is it.    If you enjoy this tune then check out the 2 CD set called "Twins-The Jaco Pastorius Big Band Live in Japan", this is the completed unedited versions of the Big Band live. I highly recommend avoided the badly edited versions better known as the US release "Invitation".     "Twins" is worth its higher price tag and the search to find it. Jack Frisc 
 I was first acquainted with this work in college and have loved it ever since.  The articles are thorough, but best of all, readable.  I often pick up a volume looking up a specific word, then end up reading three or four articles because they are so interesting 
 THIS BOOK WAS PUT TOGETHER WELL A LOT OF RESEARCH WENT INTO IT  IT'S SO SAD TO THINK THAT THIS GOES ON THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY  AND NO ONE CAN SEEM TO FIND A BETTER WAY TO HELP VICTIMS OF   DOMESTIC AND A BETTER WAY TO PUNISH THE PEOPLE THAT DO I 
 Easy to read. Inspires you to ask God to allow you to witness to someone "today" 
 In this "sequel," Kimmel continues sharing her story of growing up in small town America.  "She Got Up Off The Couch" picks up where "A Girl Named Zippy" left off.  Not surprisingly, Zippy is growing up: she's no longer smart but niave -- she's smart and realizing that the world is not just full of fun and magic, and things are not just peachy within her family. Her mom, virtually frozen on the couch for the entire period covered in Zippy, decides to go to college. Dad is not supportive. The family seems to be disintegrating.  Although darker than the first installment, "She Got Up Off The Couch" is written with the same wry humor and charm.  We can only hope that Kimmel will, again, bow to her readership's requests and write "Chapter 3. 
 I read Skellig a little while back and even today I couldnt stop thinking about how well thought out a book it was. It is an easy to read book that you'll likely finish in a day. David Almond did a fantastic job at bringing the story of Michael, Mina, and of course Skellig to life on the pages. Excellent book for kids as well, 5 stars 
 This may be the least diverse album that BNL has released to date, but that probably is not a bad quality to have considering how broad a stroke they can sometimes paint. This album is chock full of hits and features many great tunes. I especially like Too Little Too Late, Never Do Anything, Pinch Me, Go Home, Falling for the First Time, Sell, Sell, Sell, Humor of the Situation, Off the Hook and Helicopters. Those are all first rate, 5-star songs in my opinion, and for those scoring at home, that also includes the first 5 songs on the album in succession. The rest of the album is just dandy as well, the only remaining song I have rated below a 4 is Baby Seat, which I have at a 3. Sell, Sell, Sell and Helicopters seem infinitely more relevant today than when this CD was released, which is quite sad. I'm pleased to report that the Ladies haven't backed away from its subtle mocking of the despicable Bush regime in later albums; if anything, it's increased, and possibly become even more subtle (see: Shopping on Everything to Everyone).  The only complaint I have about the album is that it does seem highly produced, and the sound doesn't seem as crisp as some of their other work. The quality of music itself doesn't really suffer from it, but it just seems muddy at times. There is a lot going on a lot of times in a lot of times, and songs like Pinch Me are a nice change of pace. The rhythms in a lot of songs remain pretty straightforward, but the melodies and harmonies get intricate at times, which may add to the muddiness I described.   In closing, this is a great CD, and a great addition to anyone's collection, and for new fans to the band, this is definitely one of the first albums i'd recommend picking up. Longtime fans certainly won't be disappointed, though this is possibly one of the most "pop"ish albums the band has. The writing, as always with BNL is terrific, and the vocals are top notch.   Overall: Strong 5 (93% - 4.67 / 5)  "A world that loves its irony must hate the protest singer 
 I bought this book because the movie "Wedding Date" was a great "girly" Movie!  And I love them!!!  The book started a bit slow...maybe, I had to adjust to the British culture...but then I was soooo into it!  At various points I was laughing very loudly!! A great fun book!  I loved the banter and "Play" between Sophy and Josh.  Can't wait to read another book by Elizabeth Young!!!  And I'm passing the book along to my younger sister!  She'll love it as much as I did 
 I recently `discovered' the original Carter Family recordings.  On this CD, it is rather poignant to hear Maybelle without Sara and AP; as if one speaker channel were missing, but don't despair.  The good news is that you get to hear Maybelle!  Compared to the old 78's, Maybelle's extraordinary guitar picking comes thru even more brilliantly.  She is also equally awesome on the autoharp.  Tracks 8 - 12 leave me speechless.  Five Stars 
 This survey of the Catholic women's ordination debate provides the first  sustained reflection on the differences which would happen were women at  the altar. Analysis includes consideration of the implications for the  Catholic church, relationships between female and male priests, and  underlying politics. A thought-provoking consideration for any Catholic  studies program 
 I have read many of this author's books, and while the others are quite good in their own sense, I found myself unable to put this down, good from the minute I started reading it.  It starts by explaining some of the emotional and historical background of the main character, a woman who finds herself unable to fill the void of not been involved with someone and at the same moment is closed minded regarding prospects and hope in general.  The book thens start to get very interesting as the character meets a charming man, who is opposite to her in a lot of regards. With metaphors and thoughts surrounding the story as it is told. This book is marvelous in the way it is able to connect on many levels on the different themes and events that unfold in the relationship. It seems to be able to tell in words and coherent though, the problems presented in relationships based on the struggle for love. I fully enjoyed many of his others books, and this one was the first "love" book that I read of his, being that he has primarily three books dealing solely with relationships.  I recommend this book to anyone who ever loved or doubted love, but wants to read about it in a interesting and challenging context, instead of the usual "they do this" and "they do that," material that is often the writing style of this subject matter. Great book overall and recommended to any and every intelligent person that has been in love or seeks an interesting outlook on how love relates to many of our challenges and hopes as human beings. 
 I have no prior knowledge on preventive manintenance. This book is very helpfull it covers the basics in a practical point of vue with a lot of helpfull tips. It even provide standard form to get started and to get a better picture 
 Although Reich is a borderline socialist, and his ideas are nothing but liberal babble, it's a well-written and entertaining book to read 
 This is the first book in a new series by Barbara Burnett Smith.  This is the first book I have read by her.  Kitzi Camden is terrific.  She and her best friend Beth Fairfield are off to Camp Green Clover for the Craft Retreat.  They went to this camp together when they were children.  Now their friend owns it and runs the Craft Retreats twice yearly.  Both Kitzi and Beth are into beads.  This year they are bringing Shannon, Beth's daughter, along.  The first night of camp Shannon insists to Kitzi that she just saw he father car at the camp.  She wants to follow him.  Kitzi will not let her take her car, so she drives Shannon.  They end up at a hardware store where Shannon says she recently saw her father.  After searching the store and parking lot, they decide to head back to camp.  But, Shannon sees another parking lot in back.  When they investigate they find his car and him in it making out with camp crafter May Feather.  Agreeing to not say anything to Beth, they return to camp.  The next day the find out that May was murdered.  Shannon and Kitzi lie to the police about their whereabouts the night before.  One officer doesn't believe them.  Kitzi begins to look into things on her own.  She is determined to find out who the real murderer is and gets into many sticky situations along the way.    I can't wait for another Kitzi Camden book.  This was terrific.  I loved the all characters and the setting - the camp is located in Texas.  Ms. Smith has a real winner.  Kitzi is so likeable and funny.    There are plenty of suspects for Kitzi to investigate that you will have trouble figuring it out before she does.  I highly recommend this book! 
 Just like "Time and Again" is a classic for anyone living in Manhattan, "Rabble in Arms" is a necessary novel to read for anyone who wants to understand the poignant history of the Hudson River Valley, Lake Champlain and New England. This novel wonderfully describes how Benedict Arnold saved the United States three months after it was born, by heading off a British invasion (out of Canada) in a naval battle off Valcour Island in Lake Champlain. The novel also describes the Battle of Saratoga which took place one year after the above naval battle. Amid the great fictional character development, one sees in vivid detail just how important a man Benedict Arnold was in the founding of our nation...and just how heartbreaking his later betrayal had to have been to everyone involved. One clearly sees that Benedict Arnold could not later reverse the fortunes of the new nation he had so bravely fought for in the beginning 
 Jackie, Ari & Jack provides a new theory of the Kennedy assassination plot, providing a thought-provoking view which rests on a tragic love triangle and its aftermath. A different take on the issue, Jackie, Ari & Jack provides refreshing new perspective. Excellent narration and production values 
 Matthew Maly has written a remarkable book that is indispensable for the understanding of Russia.  I am an American living in Ukraine, a country with a culture very similar to that of Russia, and so this book was especially relevant for me.  Maly has the advantage of having one foot on each side of what is a vast cultural and psychological divide, as he was born and raised in Russia, and educated after emigrating to America.  This makes him uniquely qualified to explain this part of the world in a language that the West can understand.  I would recommend this book not only to someone with an interest in Russia, but also to anyone who would like to understand that, elsewhere in the world, people don't just behave differently - they think differently - often in fundamental ways.  Maly explains these basic differences and the reasons behind them.  While Maly's thinking is well-disciplined, his writing style is friendly, fluid, and direct.  His candor jumps off the page at you.  It is not, thankfully, another history book; there are plenty of those, if you want them, but they won't explain Russia as it is - or the Russians as they are.  For me, this was not a "must read" book - it was a "must read twice" book 
 Great product---what else can I say? While I lived in the caribbean, I ordered food since it was too expensive to buy good quality food there 
 I THOUGHT THE BOOK COVERED A GOOD AMOUNT OF GROUND. ALTHOUGH SOME WAS A LITTLE DEEP FOR ME IN THE CONTENT. BUT OVERALL I ENJOYED IT AND WILL BE READING SOME PARTS OVER AT TIMES. 
 I love the group and the disk but I collect and when I pay for new products I don't like to get cracked cases. I just did not want to deal with it thats why I went with a 4. the music is great best J.A. CD i know of. 
 Very, VERY good. The IPSec chapter alone is worth the book, and the AAA chapters are _great_. Saadat has been able to explain in a great technical level and very clearly subjects which you're going to find in your day to day work - if working with Cisco and security. But not only that: chapters about IPSec, RADIUS, TACACS, are of value even if you do not use Cisco gear.  Missing from the book: a better chapter on NAT, PPTP. Saadat should write the 2nd edition adding those two topics, updating the IDS section, IPSec (including NAT-T), maybe add a little something about SSL VPNs, PIX 7.0 ? The section on ISP security could also benefit from a refresher (CoPP, uRPF?)  4.5 starts because it shows it age - otherwise, 5 stars for sure. 
 I bought the book nine years ago, and it still is after reading several other books, Elder is my personal number one as this is the only book who dives into the personal mind. Dr. Alexander Elder, has a psychiatric background what makes him extremely powerful in explaining what is actually happening with the mind and with the masses who are trading. It gave me as a novice a deep and thorough understanding of what makes the market move. He also gave me as a starting trader excellent idea's and rules on money management which is absolutely crucial. I personally have this book on my number 1 for people who want to learn trading and get a deeper understanding of their own behavior and possible dangers. Beside that lots of practical tips and strategies are given. The book is an excellent book for the beginner and the advanced trader who needs to review his own behavior 
 Another winner!  Vicki I. puts a hilarious spin on life as a wife, mother and career woman.  I own the entire series and besides being funny and delightful, these books truly do contain alot of useful information 
 Mr. Stevens writes with refreshing honesty. He claims his book is not about heroics but the bravery and courage of his own and the other men in the 8th Air Force touch the reader in a way books written to impress or excite cannot. He shows us real ordinary young men at war in a way only those who have been there could know. A must read for students of history and WWII 
 A brilliantly written account into the Heart of Paradise that gives the reader a you are there feeling! 
 Great Book - We read it for our book club and everyone loved it!! Good girl book 
 "10" begins with a surprise party for its guest of honor, George Webber, an award-winning songwriter celebrating his forty-second birthday...   The party is organized by Samantha Taylor (Julie Andrews), a thirty-eight-year-o1d feminist singer who has established a poignant, firm relationship with George... Although he's considered the most successful Hollywood songwriter around, his collaborator Hugh (Robert Webber), a homosexual, disrupts Dudley's good mood by remarking that he's noticed some peculiar changes in George's behavior...   Apparently, George has become obsessed with old age, going through what Hugh calls "male menopause" or mid-life crisis... Needless to say, George becomes somewhat morose... Webber would like to halt the progression of his age, and wants instead to return to his youthful days of seducing young women and never having to worry about his future... George decides that he must find some answers, and possibly a few adventures, to cure himself of this dilemma...  During an afternoon drive, he stops alongside a limousine carrying a gorgeous woman, gowned and heading towards her wedding... George becomes instantly entranced, feeling that he's discovered the antidote to what ails him; the perfect woman of the world, an 11 on a scale of 10. (She's so good, he feels, that she rates higher than the scale will permit.) His heart quivering, George sets off in hot, hilarious pursuit of the beautiful bride, Jenny (Bo Derek).  Dudley Moore enjoyed the extent of his talent in a role that seemed so suited to him... He displayed a human, sophisticated side that had been missing in previous films... George Webber had turned out to be a character almost identical to his own, appearing exquisitely suave, humble, mischievous, and often childlike... And Dudley's musical prowess was again realized during the segments in which he played his beloved piano...   Julie Andrews broke out her goody image to give a strong performance as Samantha...   Bo Derek looked very sweet, charming, and uncomplicated... Bo became a worldwide sensation and one of the hottest female properties to come out of Hollywood in a long time...   Director Blake Edwards carefully supervised a tender subject matter in a way that did more to entertain than offend... His statement that beauty is more than skin deep was heard loud and clear.. 
 Few singers in the last thirty-plus years have ever shown as much raw talent as Maria McKee.  Fewer still have ever been so underrated by music buyers and grossly underappreciated by radio programmers as her either.  Because her music tends to cover many different spectrums, from orchestral pop-rock to alternative to country, Maria, like Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris before her, just can't be pigeonholed by strict radio formats or playlists, and that's why it is so often best to find her music, whether it's her solo albums or the ones she made while the lead singer of Lone Justice, in the record stores rather than on the radio.  And that trend continues with her new album PEDDLIN' DREAMS.  In contrast to the orchestral pop-rock of her 2003 album HIGH DIVE, PEDDLIN' DREAMS has a more organic sound to it, harking back to the acoustic country/folk/rock style that Maria seems to be most at ease with.  She and her husband and producer Jim Akin use plenty of acoustic guitars for the album's sound base, particularly on "Season Of The Fair" and "My One True Love"; and the use of steel guitar is a bit more extensive than you'll find on most Nashville-produced albums these days.  Maria, who is 40 years old now but still looks far younger than that, is in fine voice on all the tracks.  Her cover of Neil Young's "Barstool Blues" is a minor gem too, as is the old-school "You Don't Know How Glad I Am", which, like her 1993 album track "Only Once", is redolent of Patsy Cline and late 60s/early 70s-era Linda Ronstadt in its country-pop styling.  Twenty years after she first burst upon the scene with Lone Justice, Maria is still underappreciated by the general public.  Whether PEDDLIN' DREAMS changes that now is uncertain. But discriminating music fans would do well to get this recording just for the sheer pleasure of listening to one of the finest female singers to have come down the pike since Linda and Emmylou.  Simply put, Maria is an artist always well worth supporting 
 Dumped is a great book to read if you have just been dumped or if you are still hurting from a dump in the past....The stories are really sad but they are enjoyable to read....it is nice to read that these characters are going through the same emotions that i am going through right now.... one of my favorite stories in the book is "lamb for a slaughter" (or something like that)....you will be surprised with the wife's reaction when her husband tells her that he is leaving her. 
 I ordered this book to get me started in teaching my 10 year old trail horse the basics in dressage. I could not put it down!! I am still finding myself going back and reviewing the different methods of the basics for not only training my horse, but to better myself as a rider. This book is excellent for anyone wanting to teach their horse the basics in riding any type of discipline. Don't let the word dressage fool you. You need to teach your horse the basics of dressage to get off to the right start in any type of riding that you do. I highly reccommend this book 
 Still the standard reference work for grading firearms and determining values. Great price online through Amazon 
 This book really makes you think. It is so great.  I can see the story from both sides of the spectrum.  Although I truly believe that no one no matter what ever deserves to be killed, but in that same respect no one no matter what deserves to be treated the way Bobby Kent treated those people.  I do believe that they should have went to the police, especially the girls who he raped.  I do feel bad for these kids almost, they had no parental supervision, no goals, no ambition they were basically floating around with no where to really go. You can see in the end of the book how the parents blame everyone but there kids for what happened, maybe because they relized that if they really sat and looked at the situation, they themselves were also to blame for the death of Bobby Kent 
 If you ever wanted to read the Bible and truly understand the text behind the text, then this is the book you want to read.  Malina does a wonderful job of giving us insight in to the world that is 1st Century Judea.  He brings out the cultural scene of the times to aid us in the understanding of what it was like to be someone in this time period.  Malina breaks down the culture based on the 4 levels of understand.  They include kinship, power, religion and economics.  He discusses the impact that kinship and power had on this era and how these two items were most prevalent in terms of how people viewed each other.  Kinship is broken down into blood lines, where you were born, gender issues and so forth in a way that amazes a reader when it comes to truly seeing the time.  Power discusses the fine art of challenge and repose and how challenge was used to try to break down status of an individual (why do you think the Pharisees asked Jesus so many questions????  To lower his power.  Funny how Jesus always wins.).  Malina discusses the impact of shame and honor and how that plays a role in the family and community.  For anyone who really wants to understand the message behind the text of the Bible this is a must have volume for your library. 
 Anna has an assortment patterns for knitting, crochet, cross-stitch, embroidery, and other crafts, mostly needlework, every month, and the design quality is generally higher than that in American magazines, which currently place a ridiculous emphasis on "Easy," at the expense of design.  There are usually some seasonal crafty-crafts included, using paper, paint, etc., for decorating and some purposes which are mysterious to this American reader.  (Just what is a "school cone," anyway?) Overall, a very worthwhile magazine, with a lot of truly beautiful patterns.  I knitted one tablecloth pattern for my daughter's wedding veil, and it got raves.  Well worth the price 
 The new 1998 edition of Fletcher and Rossing is an excellent book for  anyone working in musical acoustics or building instruments. Covers a wide  range of instruments and gives extensive references to primary literature  and ... it's good reading too 
 This is a must see movie for lovers of British comedy. This movie had me in stitches. In short, the plot of the movie is about a widow trying to raise money to pay off the debt her husband left her. How does she go about the task? By growing pot. Lots of laughs to be had. 
 This book provides a good variety of examples and solutions.  It also gives the workshop beginner some ideas about which tools will be most vital to their work, depending on their particular interests.  I think the best  feature of this book is that it demonstrates good workshop design with real  examples.  I haven't read some of the other workshop books, so I can't make  a comparision, but I feel the book will help guide me through the entire  process of setting up my own workshop.  Thanks 
 This is by far the best of Maguire's books.  The dry delivery, I thought, was a positive not a negative, and allowed you to see characters in a simpler way.  It turned Cindrella literally upside down, and I was so thrilled by the happy(ish) ending(such a novelty in GM's books!). I found myself literally sympathizing with all of the characters, including Margarethe, whom was somewhat shady.  Even as a child I found the Cinderella story to be a bit cut-and-dry and one deminsional, and the characters unrealistic(I was a bright child).  I adored the perspective, and I hope he writes the rest of his books in this manner.  As a history major, I was also tickled by the reference to Catherine de Medicini 
 While Paris in not my alltime favorite city, I do have to admit it's special.  This book, written by a German historian and journalist, traces the development of Paris in the 18th and 19th centuries and its  transformation into the intellectual and artistic capital of Europe.   Meticulously researched, Paris, the Capital of Europe, covers the years  from 1789 to the First World War.  The author presents the city to us in  detail:  the street life and repression, social customs, architecture, the  growth of trade and commerce, health and hygiene, class problems, morality  and art and entertainment.  Willms then weaves all these threads together  to show the reader why and how Paris became the capital of Europe.  Anyone  who loves Paris, European history or both should love, Paris the Capital of  Europe.  Paris!  There really is no place like it 
 This is the first cd I ever owned, bought for me as a Christmas present back in 1993 when I was 13, and I still listen to it on a regular basis.  When I was younger I mostly just liked the music because I liked the movie, but as I've grown older, I've gotten to appreciate the melodies and the emotions that I feel when I listen to it.  The soundtrack was composed by two different composers, Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman.  Edelman stepped in to finish the soundtrack after Jones was unable to complete his work due to a commitment with another film, but the songs mesh together so well, you can hardly tell the difference between the work of the two.  My two favorite songs on the album are "The Kiss" and "I Will Find You".  If you ever loved instrumental music, pick this album up.  You won't be sorry 
 Quick - name a food from Maine.   You didn't say lobster did you?   Well, there are other foods from Maine you know. But lobster certainly ranks as up there in popularity, and there are fourteen entries under lobster in the index of this book. Now all of them aren't recipies you understand. Some of the engries are on things like buying and cooking lobster, and how to eat it.   Other than that, this is still a pretty neat cookbook. Not only does it have all the lobster stuff, but a collection of recipies from other traditional Maine foods.  All in all, 165 recipies, a higher percentage of which are of course seafood. The featured foods are different enough that I find this a good book to look through when I'm looking for something different to fix.   Recipies are good, but she also includes a list of twenty five or so Featured Restaurants. After all, sometimes you want to let someone else do the cooking 
 This is my favorite album of 2006. I like it Better than this year's Agalloch, Isis, Tool, Katatonia, Summoning, Green Carnation, etc. But even while it beats out all those, I still don't think it surpasses my longtime favorite from Novembre themselves, "Novembrine Waltz."  But enough playing favorites, time to explain the music. There was no doubt in my mind that Novembre would create another stunning masterpiece, adding to the previous three, even while being fairly different from their previous releases.  The most distinct change is perhaps there are very little growling vocals here. I have always liked Carmello Orlando's growling vocals, but Novembre has always seemed like a band that would eventually stray away from that. Maybe they will return a little more with the next album, I don't know. But I do know that even though the growling vocals were good, I can always go listen to the old albums. His clean vocals are so good that they really need to be used more, and they can be very diverse in themselves. There are many self-harmonizations with overdub, and everything from soft, heartfelt lulling, like in the middle portion of "Memoria Stoica" and in "Geppetto," to incredibly powerful, emotional singing, such as the chorus in "Comedia," the beginning of "Aquamarine," and in "The Promise." Also, there are many more lyrics in Italian than ever before. I really love when the lyrics are in Italian, bands should sing in their native tongue more often, it seems more authentic.  Not only have growling vocals somewhat vanished, but the album as a whole isn't quite as heavy as previous releases. There are many acoustic-driven parts, especially many intros to songs such as "Reason,"  "Jules," "Geppetto," and many melodies reminiscent of vast Italian countrysides.  The amazing melodies of the band still live on, of course, like the mini-solo in "Aquamarine," the sudden, intimidating riff in "Geppetto," the melodic, unforgettable solo in "Comedia" and also the heart-pounding intro to it, the acoustic-atop-electric Melodies in "Reason," among countless others.  The album's cover song is "The Promise," originally by Duran Duran. Unfortunately I have never heard the original. All I know is, unlike Novembrine Waltz's cover song "Cloudbusting," which many people couldn't stand, this song fits perfectly with the flow of the rest of the album, despite having an electronic-like melody hidden in the background. Most likely, if you didn't know the original song like me, you would have never guessed it's a cover song. This may even be my favorite song on the album, of course, I say that about almost every song here when it's playing.  The songwriting might not be quite as "Progressive" as say Novembrine Waltz, the songs don't quite explore a thousand different ideas. I'm not quite sure if that's why I still like NW better. Maybe they've improved their songwriting so it's not so all-over-the-place, but, I never really thought NW was like that. The songs still go from heavy to soft parts sometimes very suddenly, but they seem to flow much better and keep the same overall theme more often.  Again, Novembre has impressed me more than I would have ever thought, and this album has spawned several more countless classics for the band. They're making quite a name for themselves as some of today's finest musicians 
 At the pinnacle of his powers, Tarakovsky made this remarkable auto-biographical work, pushing cinema's powers to replicate dreams in a way that renders Surrealist 'dream' paintings redundant. Bergman, Resnais, and Bunuel had tackled the dreamworld too. But here, the commitment is ravishing. The best way to imbibe its spell is to surrender any urgency to make narrative sense, and allow the images to wash over you. This is true of all Tarakovsky, but moreso here. His familiar images, of rain, sodden earth, wood-floored interiors, sussurating meadows and leaves, red-haired women, and kids with lip herpes, are all  displayed. His aural net is on a par with the visuals; the barking dogs, Bach chorales, the squark of a beheaded chicken, sumptuous and thrilling. The prologue has a stuttering boy cured by a hypnotist and announcing (in lieu of Tarakovsky) that he will now speak clear and strong. The Kafkaesque corridors of the printworks, the family home all paint the new language that the director felt film, alone, could offer. As a vehicle for memory, dream, perception and the blurred edges they inhabit, this confessional film is close to describing how consciousness flickers in and out of control and focus. Key images, even those supplied by old newsreels, establish chronolgical footholds. Note the slightly askew sound and image tracking used sparingly, the minutely slowed down feeling of some passages. Tarakovsky's father occasionally reads his poetry over the film, adding tonal tension. In fact he is more present through voiceover than his embodied character in the film. His mother is present, at times tantalizingly so. Yet she remains withdrawn from the son, which may account for the love Tarakovsky subsequently projected with such intense palpability on the textures of the world. Watch this over and again. These textures and vivid images do not dilute 
 Stevens' Collected Prose and Poetry is essential for anyone interested in wonderful art and thought. It includes the entirety of his 1955 Collected Poems, all of his lovely essay volume The Necessary Angel, all of Opus Posthumous, early versions of Owl's Clover and The Comedian as the Letter C, many poems of his youth, diary entries, aphorisms...in short, all the Stevens you'll ever need.  And you do need Stevens. Yes, he's 'hard', but the hardness is not opaque, a la Gertrude Stein. You may not always understand him but he always means SOMETHING, and something crucially correct, the key to which is probably found by rereading the work in question, or reading around in his other poems and prose--hence the special need for a volume like this one. His is a fairly coherent and remarkably advanced vision of life, of a complexity and relevance surpassed by those of very few artists and philosophers ever. Basically, if you possess life, and wish to inhabit that life as fully as possible, sounding its deepest depth and furthest limits, Stevens is one of the resources you'll need. There may be poets more masterful with language--though Stevens is staggering with language--but which has ever grasped better what resources the meeting of words and world can open up for us? Find Stevens, absorb Stevens, you'll find yourself somewhere I can hardly imagine. Best use of forty bucks I can think of 
 This is a great movie which is very rarely shown on tv. It is a wonderful reminder of Christmases past, as well as how Hollywood was so good at tapping into it - lots of snow and cozy fires going all the time. Good movie to watch anytime!  
 When "Assault Attack" came out, I remember thinking, "Graham Bonnet? Hmmmm. We'll have to listen closely." The quality of Bonnet's voice is distinctive. Not a great singer but a ballsy vocalist. I'll take 'distinct' over 'technically proficient' any day. Having said all that, it is the _instrumental_ on this album that will tear your head off; "Ulcer." The lead break is one of the fastest, cleanest, most liquid runs off a fretboard this side of Allan Holdsworth with more menace and Teutonic swagger. Back in the day, I was trying to play the solo over and over on the LP, swinging back the tone arm to catch the solo's beginning. Amazing to this day. The other song, noted more for its rhythm guitar work is "Broken Promises." Great syncopation, nice fat, warm rhythm sound, and Graham Bonnet singing his guts out, which is what the tune called for. There is _no_ filler on this album. The rhythm section was killer and Michael's touch and tone was gorgeous. I'm warning you though: that solo in "Ulcer" man! WHEW! 
 This book was so well written, so full of suspense, and so interesting. I loved it!! It wasn't a book that was all about the murders and finding the killers, it was about these characters that were just so real, it put you right there. I would recommend this book to anyone. Fantastic 
 I first saw Cinema Paradiso in 1990 in Hong Kong.  It's a movie that nicely knitted the nostalgia of childhood, adolescence, puppy love, and, of course, the good-old-days in cinemas (not multiplex).  Each time a cinema, or even small multiplex, was closed or demolished in Hong Kong, people would refer to this movie for their "collective memory" and the heyday of Hong Kong cinema.  This movie transcends national boundaries 
 The book itself was nothing more than a summery of the episodes of her show "$40 dollars a day".  Though, it does represent Rachael's quirky personality and live life the way it was meant to be attitude.  It has some nice quality pictures, and interesting recipes, though few, of the plate she partciularly enjoyed on the trips.  I am a huge fan of Rachael Ray's, and I think everyone would benefit from living life with enthusiasm like she does; and since I'm a "foodie" without being arrogant, I love to eat as much to find about the cultures as for the taste of the foods. Watching her shows gives people a chance to do just that, learn and have fun eating at the same time, without busting your wallet!  I was surprised to see that Rachael did not include Saint Louis on her trips. and very disappointed in her New York City ones.  I mean, it's so easy to save money in the City (I being a life-long New Yorker, can attest to it); without dining like a King. All you have to do is go to the multi-cultural sections of the City....and can still find very filling and cheap meals to boot.  Okay now onto Rachael herself: what caught my attention with her in the first place is her humble mien; her good-natured attitude and wide smile.  She defies the air of arrogance and "celebrity" personas stamped on the Foodnetwork.  She brings in a homey and friendly personality to an otherwise stale and coporate network.  For all those who dislike Rachael, "professional" chefs and us normal people alike, why do you do so?  There's nothing NOT to like about her, sure, she's isn't a "real" 'chef' like Bobby Flay (rolls eyes and can't stop laughing), she never claims to be.  Her 30-minute meals and other shows are designed for people in a hurry, and if "professional" chefs are watching her show--my question is, what the heck are you watching for in the first place? If you dislike it so much, stop watching. Meh, I guess people have to complain about something....   sorry for the rant, but the book isn't really worth buying if you wish to get a real cookbook; for it really isn't a "cook book".  But, if you're a fan of Rachael's, then it's a keeper 
 We're not sure where "Trevor (Florida USA)" is coming up with this statement about it being a mono signal. Our tech guys tested the integrity of the RCA Jack and Stereo Jack they are both giving a left and right signal.  I even tested it myself by hooking up the RCA Jack and Stereo jack into my DVD player's audio out and then connecting the transmitter and broadcasting it to my stereo system.  I then used a THX sound system testing sequence on a DVD and when it was playing on the left you only hear it on the left speaker and vice versa for the right speaker.  We offered to replace the RCA Jack but he didn't follow up with us 
 This is a good DVD for the price. One problem though is in the 3 G3 Jam songs - Rockin' In the Free World, Little Wing, and Voodoo Child  there is something wrong with the audio for Malmsteens guitar, you can barely hear it. You can here his guitar fine on his solo set 
 I stumbled over this book purely by accident.  I had no idea that Summers is still in print.  It is like finding a long-lost childhood friend!    Back in the 1950s I used to hang with ceremonial sorcerers and the occasional black magician in my old home town of San Francisco.  I was an avid collector of old coinage, you see, and my main source for Indian head pennies and Liberty dimes was a strange little shop in the Mission District run by an old geezer who was also a taxidermist.  He claimed to be over 200 years old, his life preserved and extended by ingesting certain Lovecraftian "essences" from his stock in trade.  Frankly, I didn't believe him; I'm sure he wasn't a day over 150.    Anyway, the shop was the local gathering place for the questing brotherhood.  After all, if you lived in San Francisco and your grimoire called for, say, a tablespoon of bat's blood, where on earth were you going to get it but from your friendly and slightly weird local taxidermist?  Let me make it clear that I never met a sorcerer who was anything but respectable.  The black magicians in particular were the most law-abiding of people.  One would-be necromancer spent his days visiting and cheering up elderly residents in hospitals.  The story that he was sizing up future clients was a vile canard.  These were not the social misfits who took up Satanism as peddled by Anton LaVey and all his charlatan successors; they came much later.  Really, the only questionable thing about the sorcerers I knew was a deplorable tendency of some to walk about the streets in cloaks.  From time to time, one sorcerer or another would take the plunge and attempt to conjure up a demon.  (The more namby-pamby among them would say "daimon," but it was a distinction without a difference.)  Real ceremonial magic is not for the unindustrious or slothful.  There are robes to be embroidered, wands to be cut, blades to be forged, sigils to be drawn, flames to be lit, smokes to be inhaled and, believe it or not, prayers to be uttered.  It is a long, intense, fatiguing process and, what the heck, it sometimes worked.  It worked, that is, to the extent that an exhausted and half wigged-out sorcerer would convince himself that he had indeed called up a spirit from the vasty deep.  And it would scare him silly.  (In one of his books, Aleister Crowley gives a lengthy description of his shot at demon-raising and the absolutely predictable result.)  After a bout of demonism, sorcerers would check in for short stays at convenient psychiatric facilities or, perhaps more likely, go on long benders.  Then it was back to the taxidermy shop for sorcerous bull sessions about the esoteric literature then in print.  (Grimoires, of course, were only valid in manuscript form and copies were held secret and unique to each individual sorcerer.)  Eliphas Levi, the consensus held, was instructive but unsound in detail.  Aleister Crowley was suggestive but ultimately incomprehensible--a delusion and a snare.  Montague Summers was regarded as sound as to historical facts and crazy as a bedbug with regard to conclusions.  The sorcerers of San Francisco, by and large, subscribed to the often quoted opinion that Summers' learning was as vast as his stupidity.  
 This is one of the best drug guides I have found. It contains everything you need and then some. It also has a handy cd-rom with tons of information on it. 
 Carter's book is not dated for me, but timeless. He has a droll and elliptical way of deflating the fatuous inclinations of book dealers.  Yes, there is no index, and it is tough to find exact terminology sometimes.  But this book is not a mere reference book, it is meant to be read and enjoyed and instruct you in the "what", but also the "why" and "how".  Carter, in his manner and wit, shows a *way* of approaching rare books which I think is very healthy.  His skewering of the term "mint condition" and his hilarious description of "issue mongers" have me revisiting this book for momentary pleasure again and again.  I started in used books in a store about 8 years ago and when I was hired, my boss put this book in my hands.  I have always appreciated that gesture.  Any collector should find both pleasure and knowledge in this tome 
 A friend of Professor Wolterstorff once said that he had bought a copy of this book for every member of his family to read.  Prof. Wolterstorff, finding that odd since the book is a meditation on the death of his son, asked why.  His friend said he did so because the book was a love song.    And indeed it is.  It is a love song to Prof. Woltestorff's son, Eric, who died at the early age of 25 in a mountain climbing accident, but it is also a love song to Jesus Christ and to the people he has made and placed in our lives.  I can honestly say that no book I have ever read has helped me understand life and death so well.  I think I understand much better now just how evil and satanic death truly is.  While some say death is natural, and even elevate it to a special place in their spirituality, Prof. Wolterstorff, in recounting his grief and love for his son, reminds us that death was never meant to be.  That even God himself, in all the mystery that this entails, hates death with a deadly passion and sits in anguish with us when those we love are taken from us.    I strongly recommend you read this book, regardless of whether you are suffering through such tragedy yourself.  It is a love song that like all great love songs reorients the mind and the heart to that which is true and good.  
 Another warm, witty, and eminently readable account of a veterinarian's memories of his feline patients, ALL MY PATIENTS ARE UNDER THE BED brings to mind the work of beloved veterinarian James Herriot (ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL) and will not disappoint fans of that pioneering animal doctor.  Cat lovers will find themselves wishing Camuti and his ilk were far more numerous; in today's world of fifteen-minute appointments and sky-high vet bills, Camuti's individual care, house calls, and irascible love for his patients will call to mind a simpler, more sincere and compassionate time 
 Merike Kaeo's Designing Network Security, second edition, by Cisco Press is an easy to read volume with generous emphasis on the roles of planning and careful design in corporate information security strategy. The book draws its examples from Cisco Security platform appliances and software.    Organized into three parts (ignoring the appendix) of four chapters each, the book progresses from description of various security concepts and technologies to security policy and planning, culminating in basic implementation scenarios.   Of important consideration are the many case studies and configuration examples spruced throughout the volume.   Part I starts with the first chapter on Cryptography, which concentrates on several contemporary cryptographic schemes. This is a good introduction to the topic for newbies and non-cryptographers. It provides clear context for many of the cryptographic schemes in us in many Cisco appliances and used in other parts of the book. Access Control, Public Key and Identity Management where all given diligent attention and their applicability in real networks explored at the end of part I.    Part II develops the concepts and issues in corporate information security management from Enterprise Security Threat profiles in chapter 5, through considerations for site security, policy development and implementation and incidence management in chapter 8.   I find this section as perhaps the most useful given the dilemma many organizations face today in developing comprehensive and holistic response to the ever growing threats to information and consequently much of their business infrastructure. This Section should also provide succor to security professionals grappling with the idea of developing a security policy and incident response procedure for their organizations.   The case study on an educational institution is quit simplistic but in all provides some context for the complex task of policy development. This section like the other two is also well commented with advice and useful example scenarios.    The implementation Chapter is a bonus for Information Security Professionals working in predominantly Cisco environment. The section includes many easily adaptable real life configuration examples for many of the current Cisco appliances using IOS version 12.2 and later. Included are example configuration for routers, firewall, access control servers and Cisco IDS modules. Of course, most, if not all Cisco press text have their share of configuration examples using Cisco technologies, but the organization of this material brings much of the critical solutions into clear perspective.    I got the book a few weeks after getting my CISSP certification and will recommend it as a good read for CISSP candidates even though it is a vendor specific volume, much of the discussion and theoretical underpinning of the text are relevant for a multi-vendor, homogenous security environment that the CISSP addresses. I have read several CCIE-Security specific texts and reviewed the requirements for the Exam. This volume is a sure buy for CCIE-Security candidates.    This is a technical book for intermediate to expert level security and networking professionals, but more importantly it is an excellent desk reference for any information security consultant. 
 I love this record mostly for one reason. Sons of 1984 was rercorded at a free concert in Central Park, in the middle of one sunny afternoon. It was so great, very casual. I remember just walking in and settling into seats in the front row. Todd was very friendly, everyone got a photocopy of the words to Sons of 1984, Todd practiced it with us till we all knew it and there it is.  That's not all we did at the show of course It was all diehard Todd fans, he played a great show and learning the song and recording it was the most fun of all. I still have the photocopy of the lyrics and I remember waiting and wating and waiting for the record's release. Also for those who don't know this the original LP A Wizard A True Star came with an insert that looked like a band-aid with a poem by Patti Smith. And that's one of the shortcomings of digital downloads. About the only one. Also, I am not old, I was just very very young in 1973 
 There is so much to see and discover in this game. It took me over 70 hours just to complete the walkthrough and I am still working on capturing all the monsters for the Monster Arena. Someone who wanted to complete all side quests, find all special items, etc. could easily spend more than 100 hours on this game and never get bored -just incredibly deep gameplay. The graphics are also outstanding, among the best I have seen in a video game. It took me awhile to get used to the Sphere Grid used to increase your characters' stats. At first I didn't find it as satisfying as the typical method of "leveling up". But eventually I began to enjoy it and it's now one of my favorite aspects of the game. The only thing I found tiresome was how long the cutscenes were. The storyline itself was quite good. But I wish it was told with shorter cutscenes or at least gave players the option to skip through the cutscenes. Still this is a minor complaint to an otherwise excellent game. Definitely worth buying! 
 Yes, its no longer 2003, and the Era in which this book eludes to- is coming to a close, but it renders itself (ironically, if I do say so myself) a classic!  Its wittingly insightful without being pretentious. Its clever and funny without trying too hard. It makes fun of its own pretentiousness and the own preface of the book itself, making it exceptionally deck! Most importantly, it really tells you the stuff ! The nitty gritty.  It has scope. The Hipster Handbook is a great read from finish to end. Almost as good as the Bible.  I love it! 
 This book is the story of Dr. Nielsen's time working at the south pole.  It is full of  anecdotes of everyday events that gave me a feeling for what life must be like in such a remote place.  It reminded me a lot of science fiction and especially Kim Stanley Robinson's Red Mars.  Robinson has another book on Antarctica that is said to be very similar to Red Mars.  It's uncanny how similar Dr. Nielsen's account is to science fiction stories about space colonization.  Maybe the idea of life on the frontier brings out these themes.  The difficulty of life makes people work together and abandon some of the petty problems from home.  That gives people a new perspective on the culture of their home.    This story also made me consider how psychologically hard cancer must be.  Dr. Nielsen says being in Antarctica in some ways made it easier because she didn't have to deal with daily ups and downs as the results of many tests came back.  They only had the most basic diagnostic equipment in Antarctica.    Nielsen is honest about her fear of her illness and the pain of being alienated from her kids.  Although it's unlikely because of her history of cancer, I hope the powers that be approve her for more work in remote locations.  
 Stumbled to this product by mistake. Sounds like a 60s Gangster/comedy film soundtrack.  coo 
 "Truly Our Sister," by Dr. Elizabeth Johnson received the Jerome Award form the Catholic Library association, the John Courtney Murray Award from the Catholic Theological Association, and the 2004 Book Award from the College Theology Society in 2004. Dr. Johnson was the first woman to receive tenure form Catholic University of America, and is currently Distinguished Professor of theology at Fordham University, and a sister of Saint Joseph. With such commendations, it appears that the consensus is the book is theologically sound, though it may challenge some preconceived notions.   Dr. Johnson's book in no way denigrates the character of Mary the mother of Jesus, but instead seeks to articulate all of the virtues of Mary that we (and women in particular) can find in Mary as a role model. The "Our Sister" in the title is not intended as some claim to deny the fact that Mary was the mother of God and a role model for maternity, but refers to the fact that as Mary is also God's daughter, and through that aspect she is also our sister through religion. The title's use originates from quote by Pope Paul VI, and as such should not be considered "unorthodox."   The book analyses the virtues that Mary demonstrated in her life, which offer hope and reassurance to particularly women (thought they should not be precluded from men) during daily struggles. Dr. Johnson pays special attention to the plight of oppressed women. In scripture, when the angel appeared to Mary, and asked her to do God's will, Mary said yes.  When doing so, she did so without hesitation, and did not first seek the opinion of her male guardian, who during the time period would have had the ultimate legal custody of Mary's future, nor did she consult a rabbi. The implications of accepting God's will were that she may possible be bearing a child out of wedlock, which would have socially stigmatize her, and made her an outcast of society, but she had faith that God would provide. Mary's obedience to the will of God as a priority over concerns about the law of men was courageous and loyal. Her trust in God to protect her during her potential time of difficulty demonstrated exemplary faith, trust, and hope. This is the image of Mary that provides the most help and reassurance to the women interviewed by Dr. Johnson, during their times of ordeal, and hope during times that no physical assistance seems in sight for them.  However, the image of Mary presented by Christianity focused on her obedience, meekness, and virginity. It did not stress that Mary's obedience was to God rather than to patriarchal institutions, and that her humility to God's will. Although it was a miracle for a virgin to give birth and that aspect of the story helps to demonstrate that Jesus was the Christ promised, virginity was not an uncommon characteristic of a young unmarried woman in Jesus' society.   The image that a church dominated by men constructed of Mary as a role model, extols values that make it easy to subjugate women and render their voices invisible.  It is an image, ironically, that received no input from women, but to which all women were commanded to use as a role model; basically saying theses are the virtues that you should find inspirational. It is also an incomplete image and does not convey the fullness of virtues demonstrated by Mary, which can help women today: Mary's courage to say yes to God's will, and to follow Jesus to the foot of the cross; Mary's priority of obedience to what is truly good as opposed to what society tells her is the norm; her humility towards God, but her leadership in the realm of men that was demonstrated by her catapulting Jesus' public ministry by asking him to change the water into wine at the marriage of Cana; and an acknowledgement that Mary did suffer when God's will was being fulfilled through the crucifixion.   An image of Mary that neglects these components of her life is not only terrible because it is incomplete and does injustice to the role that Mary played in religious history, but it dangerous to women. Dr. Johnson notes a study by psychologists among women of Hispanic culture, in which women who remain in abusive situations do so because they believe it is their role in life to suffer with humility any injustice that life gives them, as if it is God's will, similar to the interpretation that Mary was always obedient and meek and inactive, as mariansmo, a set of behavioral patterns that women tend to display when living in cultures dominated machismo. People need to be reminded that Mary is not a women who accpeted suffering for the sole sake of suffeirng as a virtue, nor did she accept suffering so that the false laws of men that perputuate injustice would be promoted in society. Mary accepted suffering when it was necessary to do so in order to fulfill God's plan and to contribute to creating his kingdom on earth.  Dr. Johnson's book explores all of Mary's virtues. The end result is an image that pays full honor to the entire scope of Mary's life, rather than propagating an incomplete image of Mary resulting from piecing together only certain aspects of Mary's virtues, which cause predominantly women to recourse to a model that tells them to always suffer injustice quietly as a virtue - the consequence of Christianity's portrayal of Mary for the majority of its existence. Dr. Johnson's image of Mary honors her in all her glory, rather than only highlighting the aspects which can be used against women by cultural and religious institutions. The end result is a role model in which all people (not only women) can find inspiration and better guidance for discerning God's plan for their lives, and a deeper respect for the role that Mary played in her time, which increases the reasons and motivation to honor her.     
 Hill Harper has done a remarkable job in communicating poignant ideas to young African American men. His advice is helpful and non judgmental.    Reginald V. Johnson, Author, "How To Be Happy, Successful And Rich 
 before all the slow songs larry graham gave up the funk big time.it's alright is so funky and the jam still bangs after all these years.if you buy anything by this great musician this is the one to have.it grooves for  days.he still can thump a bass like nobodys business 
 Using stories told by her Grandfather, Aimee Liu provides an insiders tale to a time of turmoil in China.  The story starts in San Francisco at the time of the big quake.  It is a love story of an American girl and a very educated Chinese boy at a time when women hardly spoke to a Chinese person, much less married one.  Her husband is a part of Sun Yet-sen's battle to topple the Manchu Dynasty.  Within the novel is the history of China from the Opium War in 1840 to the Communist's  War of Liberation in 1949.  Good insight into the people of China and their relationship with the Western Powers 
 I'm a BFA student at Virginia Tech heading to grad school and this is an excellent book to teach from, have as a reference, or just thumb through for fun.  Simple and succinct while still thorough.  It's really an invaluable thing to have for ready info at your fingertips.  This book has been part of the curriculum here for Performance Art, Found Object Sculpture, and Installation classes, and everyone in the class universally approves and finds it helpful 
 My partner & read this book to our two children nightly for months at their request. We all enjoyed it. Great job 
 Great book, very helpful.  John Gray has a great style.  I have read several of his books and would recommend them all.  
 This book suggests a system of organizational analysis that is as chilling as it is insightful.  Seidenberg is a bit fatalistic at times, but if you see the world as spiralling into an abyss of dehumanization it's hard not to be!  NOTE: This book is rightly included on many best books of the 20th century lists but is largely ignored 
 In this movie we get to see more of Marks great driving skills!!!! *check out some of the special features...theres an interview where he talks about his driving....Mark fans....its worth every penny!!!!* I can't wait for the next movie....its coming!!!! 
 Excellent book for beginner photographers or even for persons who would just like to take better family or vacation pictures 
 Kakar takes the reader deep into sexual ideas and lore, in the classical Indian way, that will certainly enlighten and even titillate some readers.  His imaginative depiction of who the author of the Kama Sutra might have been is also worth the price of admission. His prose - this is his first novel, I think - often falls short of page-turning, but I happily stayed with it to the end nevertheless, and so will you if you're interested in a lively and stimulating depiction of the geography of desire 
 I must admit this is the first anger management book I have ever read. I read it due to the great reviews it was given. I WAS NOT disappointed!! This book is WONDERFUL!! It is written in plain, straight forward English. There are no big psychological words that you can't understand. If you want to read a book that actually TELLS you something about WHY you get angry and how to CONTROL it, then this book is FOR YOU! While I was reading, I felt as if the author had actually come to my house and observed me for a few weeks and then written this book about me! Another great thing about this book is that is not long to read and it gets to the point. I could not put it down! If you're really tired of being "angry all the time", please read this book....you WON'T be disappointed!! 
 I am not a writer, nor a critic.  I am a mere reader who appreciates good works.  This is one of my staple books, which I often reread and recommend to people who I feel might have the mind to appreciate genius.  This is the best translation I know of and as a necessary feature of translated poetry, it includes the original French text, as well.  Baudelaire reveals the beauty within darkness and exposes the darkness within light.  Brilliance has always been rare, but I would say now it is more rare than ever within the literary field.  This may very well be due to books like this going unread by the majority of the population.  This is a wonderful book to enhance a person's writing depth, and their understanding of the world.  Other great author's and books are: Illuminations by Arthur Rimbaud, Mallarme, Antonin Artaud's Anthology and The Death of Satan, Lautremont and Maldoror by Issidore Ducasse, All of the Marquis de Sade's works, Remembrance of Things Past by Marcel Proust, Finnegan's Wake by James Joyce, Anne Sexton's Complete Works, La Batarde by Violette Leduc, the diaries of Anais Nin, and Sylvia Plath's poetry 
 Great work by Mr Shipler.I couldnt put this book down once i started. I read this book as a follow up to Barbara Ehrenreich's Nicel and Dimed, and for me, these two books are a great one-two punch that makes you think.Mr Shipler's book is a must for people who think that their lifes are miserable but have all the commodities in their house and workplace.I love the way he tells the stories behind the people who struggle against all kinds of odds to make a living.I especially enjoyed the chapter that talks about the inmigrants in North Carolina since in my church we deal with a lot of them and Mr Shipler was right on the money in all his observations and stories.I also enjoyed the chapter that deals with the schools and how teachers are trying their best to teach and relate to their students while a lot of  them have a lot of problems at home that would not allowed them to concentrate in schools.Altough i am not a political person a lot of Mr Shiplers conclusions as to what the goverment has to do to help seem reasonable to me and all of us have to do our work and our part to erradicate poverty.Magnificent work! 
 this book is very good for teaching the actor to use their voice, and make it stronger. i recommend it to everyone who wants to make their voices stronger and more powerfull 
 I seriously love this bowl and spoon.  The bowl fits nicely in your hand so it's easy to feed a squirming baby.  The spoon has a very soft tip so you don't have to worry about hurting their gums. My daughter is a year old and mostly feeds herself, but we are still using the bowl for snacks or I'll put yogurt in one side and fruit in the other.  The lid always stays on and the bowl still looks new even though we've used them a lot.  I would highly recommend this product 
 In this book Alvin Goldman develops a highly significant thesis - an account of how we understand other minds. This thesis is significant not just because it addresses classical philosophical problems, but also because it has serious implications for scientific research. Alvin Goldman is a highly accomplished philosopher. In this book he ventures into new waters - surveying research in psychology and neuroscience. He grasps the empirical literature and weighs the evidence with a competence that matches that of a highly accomplished scientist. In doing so he puts most other 'interdisciplinary' philosophers to shame. This is an exemplary work of both philosophy and theoretical psychology. This work sets an example that can and should serve as a model for modern, interdisciplinary, philosophy of mind. 
 For someone just starting out in the painting feild, acrylic or otherwise, this book is gold. It has all the basic information one needs to create an image. If you want to paint, but don't know where to start, this will definately be the book for you 
 anyway, yeah, this movie is very well made for the time period(early 80's). it's a literist's and horror aficionados mixed bag of goodies with gore galore and symbolism aplenty! The usual female coming of age story of first experiences with womanhood and the opposite sex and how to tame them and man's eternal struggle with the voracious beast within that wants to "eat" blossoming females.  i could go on, but i think you get the point.  the screenplay was actually written by famed author angela carter who deals with such subjects as children's fairy tales and adult "fairy tales" of sexual politics.  in the end, what difference does it make?  either you become a wolf yourself or become the prey. either way you're dammmmmmnnnnneeddd.... 
 I have been reading the writings of Norman Podhoretz for about twenty years and find him consistently rewarding.  This book, which seems meant for the general reading public, is no different.  Though I do not have the technical expertise to evaluate his elucidation of the prophets, this book provided a perspective that was very helpful to me.  It will give my reading of the books of the Old Testament a remewed focus of interest.  His concluding chapter is particularly well written, well reasoned and enlightening, even prophetic.  He might have spoken louder 
 I enjoyed this latest project from EB.  It reminds us of how good he was Before the Halle dilemna.  It shows us that smoothness and mellowness that caused Halle to be attracted to him in the first place.  He's back to charming us with his melodies and sultriness. A very nice comeback. 
 I was exposed to Herbert Groenemeyer on a recent trip to Europe and I was absolutely amazed at the audience reaction, the emotion he put into his music and I immediately loved it. I could not find this cd in the cities I visited but did receive it once I got home. So far I have only had a chance to listen to the second half of it and I love it! The language barrier does not in the least hinder the performance. I highly recommend this album you will not be disappointed. My next trip to Europe I hope it will include Germany so I could see this artist live 
 I bought this book for my mother's birthday.   She has baked six of the recipes already.  I went home for the weekend and tried the Smore Brownies she made, they were unbelievable.  My mom said the recipes are easy to bake and they taste delicious. She is very happy with her birthday present.   
  Finally, a pop-punk band that released an entire disc worth of great material aside from one or two singles and three or four other solid tracks.  The Audition have put together what I would call a masterpiece of pop-punk if I were prone to using that word to describe pop-punk albums.  This disc is so hook filled and sing-along friendly that it's hard to not move your body and bop your head while the songs play.    While not sounding exactly like Fall Out Boy, the resemblance is obvious.  You will probably like this band if you like Fall Out Boy but I wont guarantee that you will like Fall Out Boy if you like The Audition.  The Audition isn't quite as aggressive and fall more in the rock genre then the punk genre of their pop-punk mentality, but there's not a damn thing wrong with that!    Highlights:   "Approach the Bench" "The Ultimate Cover Up" 
 I bought two of these trucks for my twin boys when they were 16 months old.  They loved it so much and the bubbles come out the front for added fun. The music and lots of buttons to push, a storage under the seat and a fire helmet makes this a fabulous toy. My boys are now 27 months and have not stopped playing with this truck!!  Its great, buy it, buy it! 
 After listening to Ms Brizendine on a TV interview, I felt the need to purchase her book.  It was one of the most interesting and informative books that I've read in many years.  Ms Brizendine has helped me understand how the female nervous system and all that follows works.  I'll probably read it again sometime soon 
 My 18 month old daughter loves this book and I enjoy reading it to her.  We don't have the full sized version of this book so I can't speak for how they condensed it, but I do know my daughter and I both enjoy this version quite a bit 
 Mysticism: The Nature and Development of Spiritual Consciousness by Evelyn Underhill, is a must read for any serious student of Christian mysticism.  This is also a wonderful work for understanding the spiritual experiences  of the great mystic saints.  This classic text explores the common features  that tie together the religious lives of St. Teresa of Avila, St. John of  the Cross, St. Catherine of Siena, St. Catherine of Genoa, St. Francis of  Sales, St. Francis of Assisi, St. Ignatius of Loyola, St. John of  Ruysbroeck, and others.  She explores the core nature of the mystical  experience both theologically and psychologically.  Underhill is brilliant  in her discourse on the mystic way.  Her theology is impeccable.  I highly  recommend this book 
 This is indeed an interesting tale. Although it is a tad slow in the second half, I stuck with it to see what (if anything) happened in the end.  It is not the story that makes this book, it is the writing and the fact you become emotionally involved with the protagonist 
 I've read nearly every book on Nirvana out there, but it was sooooo cool to see it broken down day by day like this! Even the discography was in chronological order, which is something none of the other books did! Lots of great, and new info too! Thanks 
 Elizabeth Watkins' On The Pill: A Social History Of Oral Contraceptives, 1950-1970 is an informative social history of oral contraceptives covers the period from 1950-70, when the pill was at its strongest development and played a major role in changing women's lives. Chapters survey the contraceptive revolution and common misconceptions surrounding it in a set of coverages on both medical and social realities 
 I keep telling you I own it and I loved it but you keep asking my opinion. What's up 
 Flaherty's brilliant, stark camera exposes civilization encroaching on nature, and the result is visual poetry. A rich meditation on how these opposing forces must interact, it makes the viewer think again about the long-term price to be paid. Ironically, Standard Oil sponsored the film 
 Excellent, real romance!!! Filled with the magic and mistakes of falling in and out of love in Americ 
 Robert Remini is a scholar who really knows how to tell a story.  And Jackson is a fascinating subject.  Remini never gets bogged down in military or political minutia.  He keeps the focus on Jackson, what Jackson wanted, what challenges he faced.  He notes what was different then, but does not harp on it.  The chapters are short, and each is a gem.  (Having already written the long version, it might have been easier to be disciplined and concise in the abridgement.)  I'm happy I read it. I learned a lot and spent several evenings enjoying this book.  (I was going to give it 4 stars, because I don't think I will read it again.  But if I do, it will be the long version, so I guess Rimini deserves a "high 5." 
 A friend of mine had this book and loved it.  She showed it to me and I loved it as well and had to buy it!  In college every little bit of help is great.  This is an easy to follow helpful book.  To any psychology student  out there get this book 
 Raymond Chandler wrote his letters, for the most part, late at night after a day of drinking. The letters provide an insight into the man who created the quintessential fictional PI, Philip Marlowe, and elevated what he called formula writing into a class of literature recognized by his contemporaries as art. The letters range from his laugh-out-loud take on science fiction--"Did you ever read what they call science fiction? It's a scream. It's written like this: I checked out K19 on Adabaran III, and stepped out through the crummaliote hatch..." to the sadness he experienced when his wife of more than thirty years passed away. I enthusiastically recommend this book. Even people who hadn't had the good fortune to read his classic mystery novels will be highly entertained.   
 My tastes run widly through most genres of music though they merge quite handily in one album - Fluid Rustle.  This album is a tasty stew of jazz, classical, a little fusion, some new age, some upbeat, and some experimental.  If you have been disappointed with new age (too boring), found Kronos Quartet a bit too edgy, like your music to give you new ideas, and want a multi-purpose album for personal listening in all sorts of situations (driving, hiking, chilling), this is it.  Don't plan on putting it on as background music during a gathering because it will become the topic of conversation 
 Sloan Wilson, to begin with, is a great writer. He is able to capture a mood, a tention and an empathy for his main character, Mr. Rath, that many authors simply can't.  I found myself able to identify with this man (who is my age, 33, though male) so closely it was creepy. He is like me in his tendency to worry so much about the "what if's" in life, that sometimes he doesn't take the risks that maybe he should. Or, if he does take the risks, he is so nervous that everything will fall apart, he can't truly enjoy it. I found myself rooting for him, and feeling his anxiety at every work conference or family incident. I was glad when the story ended, and that it ended as it did, because I don't know if I could have taken any more stress. This book DID stress me out because it is so true, then as well as now. Definitely worth reading 
 The secondary source material found in the appendices, the fantastic footnotes, the capacioius introductions, the big clear typeface, the textual editing decisions, all make the Ardens the best single-volume Shakespeares by a long shot.  The rest pale by comparison.  The only drawback, god forgive this y-chromosomed curmudgeon, that I can see in this particular Arden is that the editor, Katherine Duncan-Jones, often tends to lean a bit too far to the left, indulging into too much gender politic-ing.     Duncan-Jones also spends a quite a bit of time arguing in a rather extended manner for composition dates that are self-consciously 'provocative' and seem to be much too speculative for an introduction.  One could match this with Booth's version, which by comparison seems perhaps a touch more shallow and hidebound-- but more solid, and get a nice complimentary set of typefaces and editorial views that would balance out nicely, I would suspect 
 Lehninger is one name that most undergraduates who take biochemistry courses know too well. This simplified, well-structured version remains an asset to a great number of students. But, no matter from which source you are ordering it, be sure to specify the actual edition you want as precise as possible. There are several variants of this book in the market (including Amazon.com...)! Do not forget to enter the complete details (including the ISBN number) of this textbook while placing an order for it; or else, you may end-up with the kind of "Lehninger" you didn't ask for 
 This was great suspenseful novel.  Romania's troubles were so clear and the character developement was outstanding, the way Flora begins the bookas a child and ends the book as an adult 
 ELO are one of the greatest bands of all time. Period.   Now that we've got that out of the way, TIME is a concept album about time (duh) and a (not-so-distant anymore) sci-fi future, and I'd argue that's what both carries this album and brings it down. It carries it in the album's unique sound, which almost totally dispenses with ELO's trademark strings in favour of lots, and lots - and lots - of synthesizers. ELO always had prominent keyboards, but Richard Tandy really earns his wages on this one. It's a different sound, to be sure, but I for one like it, because it doesn't sound like just so much more synth-pop. It's still ELO, it's still got the catchy melodies and dense harmonies and brilliant pop hooks, just updated for the 2090s! The concept brings it down, however, in the lyrics.  The silliest numbers work well in the sci-fi context - "Yours Truly 2095"? - but it seems as if some of the best songs here were kind of shoehorned into the concept. "Ticket to the Moon" is absolutely breathtaking on a musical level, but the camp of its storyline holds it back from perfection. The same goes for T"he Way Life's Meant to Be" and "Rain Is Falling", all three some of the best songs on the album that could've been even better with some minor changes to the words. Just a couple lines here and there and they'd be able to remain true to the concept without sacrificing their (considerable) worth as standalone tracks. So the most all-around satisfying cuts end up being the ones that do so themselves - "Twilight", "Hold on Tight", and despite its title "21st Century Man". (Which are great, incidentally. I also find it interesting that "From the End of the World", which meshes perfectly with the musical concept, is perfectly standalone.)  So I was a little disappointed in that. However, those disappointing numbers are still pretty great, and TIME is pure ELO even without the strings, so there's plenty to enjoy in spite of its flaws. Oh yeah, and I'm not exactly sure why Jeff Lynne opted to leave out "The Bouncer", "When Time Stood Still", and "Julie Don't Live Here", all of which would've fallen in TIME without skipping a beat 
 Detailed treatment of Semiconductor Physics.  A classic book in this field and a excellent source of reference for any Electrical Engineer 
  Brando stand for best,and this one was not an exeption 
 Much of what the other reviewers have said is correct about this book. It is not a complete biography of Curtiss, it does spend a LOT of time be-littling the post-1903 Wrights, and I'm not sure he knows his technical airplane stuff 100%. However, this book is highly enjoyable and very easy to read. You'll be hooked and read it through in one or two sittings. The more you read about those early years of aviation, the more you learn. I've read a ton of books on the Wright Bros. early years, but their attempts to scuttle Curtiss in their later years were new to me. They hated Curtiss PERSONALLY! By contrast, the story of Curtiss's adventures at the dawn of aviation are great fun to read and you'll find yourself daydreaming about hanging around his shop to chat with him... not something I've ever wanted to do with Wilbur and Orville 
 This was the first book that I had read by Stuart Woods.  I picked it up on a lark, and started to read and didn't quit until I turned the last page.  There was glamour and power mixed in with money laundering, bookies, and kidnapping.  It was interesting until the end, and even put closure on all the issues that had been brought up during the story.  I am looking for the next Stuart Woods book I can find to read 
 I had read this book in High school: the only thing I remembered is that the women squatted in the fields to have their babies and then back to work.  I re-read it while traveling through China several years ago and WOW!  This is a fascinating story of a farmer and his family in China in the early 1900's. I have recently re-read it for my Book Club and I enjoyed it even more.  The complexities of this family, relationships and moving up in society with Greed as the root of all evil.  I can't wait for our group to meet to talk about this one!    
 Following WADE's advice from his new MUST website, I bought calls on HPQ prior to expected news that Wade had predicted and came true and doubled my money in 1 day! Thanks WADE 
 "Searching for Bobby Fischer" is another fine example of the work of James Horner, combining the diverse elements of a child's innocence with the ancient mysteries of the game of chess and the frenetic energy of competitive action.  Horner's score is very reminiscent of his work on "Field of Dreams," especially the low chord on the piano when Kevin eyes the right piece on the board similar to those when Ray first sees Shoeless Joe on his baseball field.  This soundtrack underscores what the strength of James Horner's work in films, which is that his music perfectly matches the scene.  You listen to these tracks, such as "Final Tournament," and you cannot help but visual the scene in the film.  In this regard Horner hits the mark much more often than John Williams, who tends to have memorable songs that somewhat overwhelm the action 
 I think this is a very good book; it's well-written, accurate (for 1995, when it was completed), and it even has a certain "literary" quality. I read the whole 200 pp. in a couple of days without "slobering" (I think this is supposed to mean slobbering, see review below) one bit. 
 Lillian Ross made her name with this New Yorker series about a half century ago. It was startling in its cynical and very humerous view of the self important and self delusional power players at MGM. With all that we have learned about this industry during the intervening 50 years the story has lost much of its potency, but is still a classic of the genre.    I read it in its original form all those years ago. It was a wonderful and hilarious read. But the protagonists, of course, were extremely upset and hated it. Happily,Lillian has survived; still writing for New Yorker 
 ... and counting.  It is a great book: offensive, sweet, harsh, sad, shocking and entertaining--all in one!  Must read it, but don't forget A Cider House Rules, too 
 There is a saying that blood is thicker that water...But I tell you,this saying is wrong.At least this book shows how "blood" can be thinner that water!...Nigel.  This book is a work of classic fantasy, with a clearly established battle between good and evil and magic playing a lead role. It tells the story of a noble prince who is framed for the murder of his father by his tragically inept younger brother and the evil sorcerer "Flagg" (the villain Randall Flagg from several of King's other works), who manipulates the weaker younger brother to displace the rightful heir to the throne.  Here are some of the characters you would meet:King Roland- The King of Delain. He is a rather plain, overweight man who is unsure around women but is fairly popular within the Kingdom, as his subjects see him as a man of the people. He enjoys beer and, though he wishes it wasn't so, favors his older son, Peter, over his younger son, Thomas.  Flagg- The Advisor to the King. Flagg is a powerful magician and has been around for centuries, perhaps even for a millennium. He thrives on chaos and destruction, and his ultimate goal is to cause Delain to overthrow the monarchy and be plunged into "a thousand years of bloody anarchy".  Peter- Roland's older son and the heir to the throne. Peter is a tall, lithe, handsome young man who inherited his mother's good looks and his father's love of the common man. He is the clear favorite among the people to be the next King, and they eagerly anticipate the day he'll step up to the throne.  Thomas- Roland's younger son. Thomas takes after Roland in that he's on the slower side and is a heavy boy even in youth. He (rightfully) feels overshadowed by Peter and resents his brother in the knowledge that Roland clearly loves Peter more. He feels Flagg is his only friend and sole source of comfort.  Queen Sasha- Roland's wife and the mother of Peter and Thomas. Sasha was chosen for Roland because she was an innocent girl from a lesser noble family and seemed to be the shyest of the lot that Flagg had selected for Roland. However, she revealed herself to be a strong, independent woman, and was truly loved by both Roland and the kingdom. She was murdered under Flagg's orders while giving birth to Thomas.  Ben Staad- Peter's best friend. The Staad family is described as the most unlucky family within Delain, but Ben and Peter strike up a close friendship. Ben is strong, handsome and might be the only hope to turn the Staad's luck around.  Dennis - Thomas' butler. Dennis's family has been butlers to the royals of Delain for centuries, and Dennis takes great pride in his work.  Naomi- A peasant girl who is with the exiles, her favorite dog is Frisk... ................enjoy...Nigel. 
 Joni Mitchell had been labeled a "jazzer" after using session players Wayne Shorter and Jaco Pastorious, jazz musicians in their own right. However, jazz inflections were all to be heard on previous Mitchell releases, and then all the ones going forward. Only " Mingus" stands as a true jazz album. Mitchell was well suited to the genre.   Charles Mingus sent for Joni Mitchell; she didn't ask to be a part of his final recording. However, it's incredible for us that she agreed. It may take a bit of a stretch for fans of early work to reach the point of appreciation, but it's worth the effort. Much great jazz requires a little work on the part of the listener, but it's certainly rewarding.   " The Dry Cleaner from Des Moines" pops! Joni scats here, drawing the color out of a bleak life. " God Must Be a Boogie Man" may need a little background knowledge of Charles Mingus, but once that is obtained, what a tribute! Personally, I like to think that God Himself is a boogie Man. The rythem of life suggests this is true.   The " raps" interspersed through the album are a bit distracting, but an understandable addition given the album's concept. Joni never did pure jazz before or since, but broaden your horizons and embrace the brief departure! 
 This is one of my son's favorite toys.  He has no idea who Elmo is but he still loves it.  He started playing with it before he could walk...he loved to crawl over to it and stand up and dance as he pushed the buttons.  Now he is two and the batteries have been dead for months--but he still likes it.  He uses the pretend phone and hides things in the little cookie spot.  This toy has been on its head more than once and I was pleasantly surprised that Elmo's head didn't break 
 Right - I've bought this album and am very pleased, because most of theses tunes are originals. Previous reviewers were right, however, to mention Star Trek & Bonanza as not being originals. In the album booklet there are five tunes asterixed as not being originals.  They are Dragnet, Bonanza, Star Trek, S.W.A.T. and Happy Days.  So they own up to this fact - so fair enough. Star Trek - I can't tell the difference between this and the TV show. The other four, it says, were all released as singles, I presume, in these versions.  Thus giving them a certain amount of validity. It also goes on to say that some of the tunes are re-recordings by the original artists made for commercial release and are hence not the tunes used for the actual TV soundtrack.  It doesn't say how many and I wouldn't like to guess.  But one such track is definitely Dynasty.  It's all synthy, where on the show it was more orchestral.  But it is done by the original artist and released as a single so - OK. Darren 
 The breakdown to Batdance, all I have to say is:  FUNKY AS HELL AND A MASTERPIECE!!! 
 One of Motown's most underappreciated acts, Junior Walker & the All-Stars were consistent hitmakers for the label in the 60's and early 70's. They scored no less than 18 Top 20 R&b singles including 13 Top Tens. Not limited to just the R&B charts they also charted 13 songs on the Pop Top 40. They were already seasoned musicians by the time they arrived at Motown in 1964 and the first album JW & the All-Stars put out was "Shotgun" in July of 65. It contained 5 Top Ten R&B singles including the title track which topped the R&b chart and climbed to #4 on the pop side. Unlike most Motown acts JW & the All-Stars weren't put into the H-D-H or Smokey Robinson assembly hit line. Instead they continued recording gut bucket rhythm and blues.  And the hits rolled in including the rollicking "Pucker Up Buttercup" [#11 R&B, #31 Pop] and "Hip City" [#7 R&B, #31 Pop], covers of Marvin's "How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)" [#3 R&B, #18 Pop] and the Supremes's "Come See About Me" [#8 R&B, #24 Pop], the blues instrumental "Cleo's Mood" [#14 R&B, #50 Pop] and follow up "Cleo's Back" [#7 R&B, #42 Pop] and the free wheelin' "(I'm A) Road Runner" [#4 R&B, #20 Pop].  Junior's trademark wailing sax, driving beat and high flyin' organ were becoming a bit stale by 1968, at least to the pop audience, and the All-Stars went back to the drawing board and returned with their biggest hit "What Does It Take (To Win Your Love)" which topped the R&b chart, reached #4 on the pop chart and sold over a million copies. It marked the first time female background vocalists were used on JW & the All-Stars records. The hits rolled in once again, "These Eyes" in Oct. '69 [#3 R&B, #16 Pop], "Gotta Hold On To This Feeling" in Jan. '70 [#2 R&B, #21 Pop], " Do You See My Love (For You Growing)" in June '70 [#3 R&B, #32 Pop] and their final hit, 1972's heavenly "Walk In The Night" [#10 R&B, #46 Pop].  It's a shame that Junior Walker & the All-Stars aren't in the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame. They are one of the most influential artists to emerge from Motown. They put grit into everyone of their recordings even their later "softer" stuff and Junior should be credited for being the first of the modern era's popular sax men (Grover, Gerlad Albright, etc). So if you're into blues, soul or just like good saxophone playing pick this one up 
 I was so delighted to find this wonderful enviromental fairy tale with beautiful illustrations of brown people.  It is such a relief and joy to encounter an author and illustrator whom recognizes that there are other marvelous colours that can be used when filling in the hues of the characters.  The beautiful Arianna lead our family on a mystical journey through a medievel forest in danger, and we learned that the darkness of the forest was full of peace, silence and beauty.  Thank you Lynne for letting young readers know that what is dark and brown and black is also beautiful 
 Goodness! Reading this book, I can't help but wonder how we've gotten along without it for so long, or for as long as hysteria as a working clinical-theoretical construct has been banished from our vernacular.  Bollas depicts with great creativity and clarity just what hysteria is, and gives us a working sense of how to differentiate it from other psychic structures, especially the borderline, with which it has most commonly been misunderstood.  True to classical and object relations thinking, the author also extends our understanding of this most complex patient.  His differential descriptions of various structures is done through not only what the patient struggles with, but also how both the transference and the countertransference vary.  A must-read! for any psychotherapist serious about working the depths of our patients 
 Two of our family's favorite characters of all time are Frog and Toad. Author Arnold Lobel certainly captures the foibles, eccentricities and idiosyncrasies of human character in his portrayal these two lovable amphibians. This book has four stories. One is entitled "Spring" in which Frog uses his wits to convince Toad it's time to wake up. The second is "The Story" in which Frog ends up telling Toad a story after Toad undoes himself trying to think of a story to tell his ailing friend. The third story is "The Lost Button" in which Toad, Frog, and friends search for Toad's lost button. The fourth story is" The Letter" in which Toad is bemoaning the fact that he never gets any mail.  This book and its companion books about Frog and Toad are on their third generation in our family. The accompanying audio tapes for these books with Arnold Lobel as the storyteller are priceless. Lobel's dry, monotonic delivery is exactly what is needed to depict the characters, the scene and the humor in these totally delightful tales.   Carolyn Rowe Hill 
 It's arrogant. It doesn't know whether it's a popular economics book or a price theory textbook. None of that matters. It's so clever, so funny and so well-written that it's a must-read for anyone vaguely interested in economics. Friedman's analysis of trade alone is worth the price of the book 
 A stand alone game, this setting (medieval) offers limitless possibilities of role playing vampires in a setting uniquely suited to the genre of horror and the supernatural.  Of all the White Wolf historical settings this is the most researched, the most playable and the best in terms of mood and themes.  Imagine playing an immortal vampire who begins his existance into the world of the damned in the age lit by fire to progress to the modern nights of neon and electricity 
 The Velvet Underground is, for me, rock's - or specifically indie/alternative rock's - all time greatest band because it is its most influential. The list of bands and musicians influenced and inspired by the VU is enormous and includes U2, the Cure, the Strokes, REM, Luna, the Jesus and Mary Chain, and Patti Smith, to name just a few. I am the proud owner of their boxed set, Peel Slowly and See which is one of the few boxed sets I own. I also own some solo records by various Velvets, including Lou Reed, Nico, and John Cale. I brought my friends to see the film "I Shot Andy Warhol," which reconstructed the era of Warhol's Factory, when the Velvets (well played in the film by Yo La Tengo) were the house band. I now own a copy of that fine film, as well.  Even though I was born in 1961, and was thus a bit too young to have known about and understood the Warhol Factory era, I do remember the tail end of the 60s. And I remember Greenwich Village and lower Manhattan from back then. I had an aunt who loved the City and who used to take me over there, from our NJ home, on a regular basis and I have specific memories of witnessing 60s freaks in Washington Square Park. I must have been about six years old at the time. As I got older, I came to a realization of the significance of the 60s, of Warhol, of Greenwich Village, and of the seminal band connected to all three: Lou Reed, John Cale, Mo Tucker, Sterling Morrison - the Velvet Underground.  I bought a rather old, scratchy copy of this record, which I found in a used record bin, while in high school in the mid/late 1970s, which is also the period of time when I, influenced by 70s rock mags like Creem and Circus, began to discover the music of Lou Reed (e.g., Coney Island Baby, Transformer, Street Hassle, etc). However, I didn't truly get deeply into Lou and the Velvets until a bit later, when I bought a Velvet compilation, and began listening to them, as well as the various Velvets solo stuff more frequently and carefully. Nevertheless, having first listened to this record and its classic proto noise/no wave track Sister Ray, when I did, planted a seed. I recall liking a few of the songs here - the title track, Sister Ray, and Here She Comes Now, and not quite knowing what to make of the rest, particularly John Cale's nihilistic little story song the Gift or Lou's freakout guitar solo on I Heard Her Call My Name. I was also less than impressed with the cruddy production values of the recording, made worse by my scratchy used copy.  Listening now, and thinking about it further, I now realize what a gem even a scratchy used copy of this is. This, indeed, is a GREAT album, truly a classic. This is mainly Lou's album, and in it, you can hear him asserting himself as the band's leader. And you can also hear the band pushing him back. And listening to the whole band thrash away on Sister Ray - with its deviantly awkward, erotically charged lyrics -one hears what a rock drone is meant to be. In short, the lo-fi production and the inherent tensions within the band made for a proto-punk, proto-indie rock classic recording, one which truly captures the anomic and polarized mood of the late 60s, a time of drugs, violence, political confrontation, of social and artistic change. The whole world was being turned upside down, and the Velvet Underground managed to capture a small piece of the tenor of the times.   This recording belongs in the music collection of everyone interested in the history of rock, punk, indie rock or Warholiana.   
 Great set of earrings at a very nice price.  Thanks 
 If you are a fan of Bel Ami or just great photography, you should buy this book. The photos are great without looking staged. The quality of the book itself is also outstanding. I highly recommend it 
 The show is better than just a weed show, but because it is a fine weed show, I'm gonna spark another Owl and watch it again 
 I currently don't own this CD but I intend to remedy that real soon. However I feel qualified to rate it because I have been a James fan since 1989 when I first heard "Ya Ho" and was intrigued by the bands mix of folk and pop rock. This is far too simple of a description for this wonderful band, as over the years they have done many different styles while still remaining James. For examples of their diverse songs you should hear tracks from "Strip-Mining" "Laid" "Wah Wah" and "Whiplash", as each album has very different songs for James while still maintaing some tracks that sound like JAMES.  While I don't yet own this album I also feel qualified to rate it because I have done something several people here are lamenting about. I have seen them LIVE. It was Halloween night '92 and I lived in Boston. I went with a bunch of friends to a club on the channel side area, where ships come into the harbour. The club was called "The Channel", naturally! I believe the club is long gone by now. It was a tiny club with a low ceiling. The night's show was a triple bill show with James, The Soupdragons and Tom Tom Club (ex-Talking Head members band) headlining. James was the opening act and made the best of it. When they hit the stage I was standing about 10-15ft from the stage and very BAKED. James Gott the lead guitarist came out with a mask on and seeing as how I was virtually tripping on the chronic, I just stood there fixated for several minutes as the greens,blues and reds of the stage lights danced across the band. And I thought "what is wrong with the guitarist face??" Then it occurred to me that it was a mask and I remebered it was halloween. DOH!!    Anyhow James' set was amazing and the crowd loved them. In fact while Tom Tom and SD were fine, I think the crowd would have been happier if James had played all night. I know I would have been, without a doubt. So here it is fourteen years later and I am writing about James in concert. They are incredible and I have no doubt this is a GREAT album of them live. I will always have that great night in my memory banks and of course my James t-shirt from the concert. It is bright red with JA on the front, M on the sleeve and ES on the back. Many people just stare at it and then may ask "Who's JA"  With regards to those who query why James was never a huge mega successful group I have an answer for you. THEY WERE!!  In America we measure success by whether you made it here in the states. Well by that measurement James wasn't very successful, but in Europe and especially England,their home, they were HUGE. In their heyday of the 90's James could and did headline music festivals that drew tens of thousands to open fields to enjoy James. So America missed out. This problem of good bands never making it big in America is the product of a record industry that patronizes you the listener. They spoon feed you via radio,Mtv....etc what they think you should like and once they get you to buy something, they find 100 other groups that sound the same and pound you with a overload of the same. And on the rare occasion that they do stumble onto a talented musician the constant bombardement of their STAR, because "it's selling" will drive you to hate a good thing. Well that's enough ranting I suspect that if you are reading this you are tring to decide if you should buy this album, as you are all ready a James fan. Well go ahead buy it, because if you can't see them live (which you can't anymore) hearing them is the next best thing. 
 You know what really makes this album awesome? Well the fact that it's awesome. But aside from that, the fingers scratching across the strings on every chord change. Oh my god I luv that. 
 After reading this great book, I wanted to leave my political affiliation and deny ever being a member of that branch.  Every American who wants to know the truth about our government needs to read all of Arianna Huffington's books. 
 This book is one of Agatha Christie's greatest thrillers of all.  I couldn't stop reading it. Once i thought i knew what would happen something what i totally didn't expect happened. This book shows the eccentric character of Christie's creative and skeemy, Hercule Poirot and how he intelligently and cunningly comes up with a solution to this case that had baffled all others.  Agatha Christie's talent and ability as a wonderful writer shines in this book with unexpected twists and turns of plot 
 Many formulas with Excel disk to calculate.  Very impressive and saves hours and hours of headaches and math 
 I have a townhouse and very little room to garden, but I've long desired to plan a garden that would blend in with the woods that back up to our house.  This book has given me my inspiration and has cemented my decision to plan a garden that will be both natural, peaceful and beautiful.  It may take a while, but I'll do it thanks to this book.  Have no garden space at all?  They even cover that in the "Natural Gardening without a Garden" 
 Those business leaders who think they can't learn from Jack Welch, either don't know this man or don't know what they are missing.  For those who can't get a table with Jack - read the book 
 After being very disapointed in "True Believer" I felt this novel was much more realistic and connected better to the characters. He has redeemed himself in my opinion with this novel. A good easy read, very enjoyable. 
 The first day of class my professor felt free to note that the text for her class was boring, in the opinion of some of her students.  After reading it myself, I had to disagree.  The text is one of the better ones I've read.  I took AP Psych in high school and the text used there was boring.  This textbook, however, presents Psychology in an interesting light.  The first chapter, on the founders of Psychology is written so that you can actually make sense of it.  Most cases studies of the guys like Freud, Wundt and the like proved to be boring for me, but not in this text.  The authors also go out of thier way to make sure that you understand what you are reading through the questions that appear in the margins of the text. The book also features comics and interesting pictures relating to the subject matter.  This book is not your typical "college text."  I also recommend the study guide.  It has self tests that you can use to study for the final 
 Vegan? Me? No way!! I could NEVER give up my cheese, yogurt, or a nice juicy medium-rare steak au poivre! TRUST me, after reading this book, this is over with. Another thing you gonna be done with is migraines, weird rashes, acne, strange discharge, fatigue, and medical bills. Well, I considered myself pretty healthy to begin with - turns out, I have been going half speed. All of the above, and more - GONE! Not only do I feel better, I have so much more energy, I don't need "the necessary eight hours" of sleep any more!! 5-6 will do it for me, and nope, I am not burning out! I get so much more done because my day is longer. My body doesn't need all this sleep that it used to require when I was eating all this crap we are all used to eating! Just like Matthew says, "You don't have to believe me, just try it out." You will feel the results in DAYS. I am so grateful, I can't express it. In fact, I now feel obligated to recommend this book to everybody I know and don't know, and I don't care if people think I am weird - if it changes the life of one out of ten of them, it has paid off. Why do you think you are reading all these headlines, "the healthcare costs have soared over the past decade, bla bla bla". This is not just because the population is getting older - it is also because it is getting sicker, and at a younger age. Genetically modified produce, sugar and sugar substitute overload, more soda varieties every day, the entire coffee culture, babies on formula - does it ring a bell??? PEOPLE, THIS BOOK IS A MUST in our society! If something brought you as far as reading this - you NEED it! p.s. Best part: I will be working on a translation of this book, because my parents need to read it - 1) I want them around for a loooong time, and, call it selfish, keeping their healthcare expenses to a minimum ;) 2) Folks in Germany need it, too 
 If you want to learn how to play the piano, you must use Alfred's Adult Piano Course. I have been playing the piano for about 5 years and have used both this course and the Bastien series to teach myself how to play. I can honestly say that I can play, talk, and theorize about music as well as anyone...All because of these books and this course. A friend of mine attended the NY School Of Music and plays the trumpet professionally. I think I know just as much as he does.      If you are serious about learning the piano and about music reading and theory, and are motivated enough to put a little extra effort......BUY THIS COURSE. It's approach is geared towards the adult learner, covers every aspect of music and thoery (that is every key, their minors, chords, chord building, etc.). With each step you learn new songs that increase in intensity and difficulty as you progress. However, the difficulty between stages is seldom felt by the student. When you reach level 3 - you play classics by the best. Bach, Pachelbel, Beethoven, etc. You will be amazed at how easy it is to learn...........and bear in mind, I am just an owner of a steel fabrication plant with no prior music knowledge or experience or training. Good luck to anyone who purchases this course. It is the very best. Thanks 
 They say you either love or hate this rather bizarre offering from 1983, but I found myself somewhat indifferent as Videodrome approached its conclusion.  To my mind, the final third of the story is ultimately too haphazard, esoteric, and too consciously horror-driven to clearly express the themes worked into the heart of the film.  It's easy to read a lot into this film, but that's as much of a credit to the viewer as it is to the filmmakers.    Still, Videodrome is certainly a fascinating, unique film that compels the viewer to contrast the interplay between video and real life in our increasingly technological age.  By 1983, most people were already seeing life through a television screen - TV defined the news, fashion, the latest fads, etc.  In the movie, TV plays as integral a part as food and comfort in the rehabilitation of the homeless taken in at the Cathode Ray Mission run by Dr. O'Blivion (Jack Creley).  Rather than paint the television as a soul-draining maker of brain-dead zombies, Videodrome forges its way down an even more frightening path, where television is used as a potential weapon on the masses.    James Woods plays Max Renn, a rather sleazy cable operator who depends on shocking television shows to keep his little station up and running.  He discovers many of his shows through satellite piracy, and that is just how Videodrome first comes to his attention.  He is fascinated with the show, which features nothing but torture and abuse of individuals, especially women, with no sign of a plot anywhere behind it.  It's just the kind of shocking new thing he's after, and so he begins searching for its source.  His prurient interest in such violent material is enhanced by his current girlfriend, Nicki Brand (Deborah Harry), who is so into S&M that she vows to audition for Videodrome herself.  Before long, Max begins hallucinating, and his efforts to discover the source of Videodrome become, at the same time, a desperate attempt to maintain his sanity if not physical life.  The show isn't rotting his brain, but it is physically changing it, and therein lies the unheralded danger of this example of reality TV taken to the extreme.  All of this works beautifully for the first hour, but I just feel the psychology of the story is ultimately sacrificed in the name of horror, as the special effects force something of a disconnect between the viewer and the film.  At least in my case, this robbed this otherwise perversely fascinating film of much of its power 
 Richard Smoley and Jay Kinney, both editors for Gnosis magazine, have done an astounding job with collecting the majority of lesser known western faiths, and placing them in a easily readable format. Exploring everything from Gnostic Christianity to the Santeria religions of the Caribbean, Kinney and Smoley use floral language and informative resources to present a non-biased and idealogical explanation for the main tenets and history of several lesser known paths.   For the most part, their theology is credible, and their history is concise. The book also provides the reader with extensive suggested further reading lists at the end of each section. If religion and studies of the divine is your forte, Hidden Wisdom is a must-read, and must-read now. As a practicing Pagan, this book was immensely interesting, and I couldn't put it down 
 This movie was a fairly realistic representation of life aboard a British Navy ship in the Pacific Ocean west of South America. You could almost smell the stench of the crew, and their food looked less than appetizing. The cinematography, editing, costumes, story, acting were all top-rate. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. There is little if any offensive language or sex. There are realistic battle scenes with appropriate violence which may not be suitable for children. The humanistic side of the movie was wonderful, for example the captain and doctor playing their music. Russell Crowe was a brilliant captain who has to make tough decisions 
 I first read Six of One about 25 years ago and still read it almost once a year. While I have enjoyed many other books of Rita Mae Brown, this is her hands-down, standout best. Her characterizations are superb, the sibling rivalries of Juts and Weezie still make me laugh out loud (just thinking about the tugboat-float episode cracks me up), and the heroic actions of the characters can't help but bring a tear to the eye. This is a hilarious, triumphant celebration of the human spirit. 
 As a major horror fan, I can tell you that I've read a lot of essays and books on the genre.  While there are many books that deal with specifics in horror films, vampires, serial killers, etc, "DARK PARADES" is the the first to discuss a unifying theory of all horror films:  The Spectacle of Isolation.  The book begins by drawing parallels between Avant-Garde Cinema and Horror movies, both on the opposite ends of commercial cinema.  Avant-Garde representing "HIGH" culture while Horror represents "Low" culture.  Later chapters in the book deal with specific directors oevres, specifically, the works of HITCHCOCK, RAIMI and CRONENBERG.  Highly recommended if you're a screenwriter, director, actor or whether you just love to watch Horror films 
 I was pleased to find Safari, because it is discontinued in lots of stores. It is at an exceptional price as well. We are pleased with the fast service 
   There is a scene near the end of The Hot Kid where Jack (a criminal wannabe who longs to be American's most wanted) is planning to shoot one of his partners (he ends up killing most of his friends at some point in the novel).  The two men are sitting around a campfire roasting a chicken while Jack considers the best possible angle to shoot the other man, not wanting the chicken to fall into the fire.    There is an absurdity to scenes like this that capture the essence of Elmore Leonard.   Needless to say, I'm a big fan and The Hot Kid is among Leonard's best.    The novel is set during prohibition; when gangsters and law men were celebrities.  The novel follows the rise of the new hot kid with the Marshal's service (Carl) and a spoiled rich kid (Jack) who wants to be a famous bank robber.  Jack's ill-conceived schemes provide much of the humour in the novel.   Leonard's characteristic lean prose and sharp dialogue are back in full form (although, because the novel is set in the 1930's there is considerably less swearing than one might normally expect from Leonard).  This is a great read.  Gun molls, bank robbers, and a healthy dose of bravado...   ...need I say more?   
 Stanley Elkin had a wonderful gift for colorful language and a breezy  style, coupled with a narrative gift that brought the reader inside the  heads of his characters. "The Bailbondsman," "The Making of  Ashenden," and "The Condominium" are good examples of these  gifts. The range of incident, humor, violence and dramatic confrontation  shown in these novellas were marks of Elkin's style. I especially recommend  "The Bailbondsman," for in addition its odd twists the story has  depth and suspense and surprise. The narrator notices everything, even  "the roller coaster" of a man's fly when he sits. You have to be  ready to be shocked, but you will also find a whimsical streak in the  writing that delights. Elkin's final novel, "Mrs. Ted Bliss,"  might have been a continuation of "The Condominium." Highly  recommended for all who appreciate fine writing or who are trying to write  on their own 
 The large cast and the large list of suspects in this book make it quite different than most of Agatha Christie's works.  It also has a very convoluted plot that is difficult to follow.  In spite of that, I still give it four stars because it is written by Agatha Christie in her usual creative style.  The book will certainly keep the readers guessing as they set out with Poirot to get to the bottom of an old murder case that has already been tried by the courts.  A man has been convicted of killing Mrs. McGinty, but Poirot and Inspector Spence don't think he did it.  When Poirot starts digging he finds ties to other much older murder cases, and it's a case of identifying people, some thirty years later.  Another thing that Ms. Christie does so well is characterization, and this book is certainly no exception.  I absolutely loved the muddle-headed Mrs. Summerhayes 
 This is the best book I have read during the first 34 years of my life. Tom, the symbolic messiah, manifests hope, love, patience and perseverance. He shares his soul unselfishly with all who will receive. He is quite possibly the strongest person of character I have encountered. In regards to the books commentary on slavery: it was a strong abolitionist paper in the 1850s, but now it is considered racist by some. However, I believer the characterization of African Americans was much kinder in this book than by the media and society as a whole now 
 I read the book a few months ago and I summarize that it is really good but the book drags on a bit and has a few "too graphic and disgusting" for my taste scenes. I liked the two adaptations (especially the Stanley Kubrick adaptation) better than I liked the book. If you are really in to Stephen King stories then this is for you 
 Soundgarden is definitely one of the most influential and amazing metal/grunge bands to ever roam the Earth. This CD gives you all of the greatest hits of this tour de force. Going in chronological order starting off with the groundbreaking "Nothing To Say," from 1987, you know that this is gonna be good. Things only get better from there with "Flower" from Ultramega OK and then three songs from Louder Than Love. "Jesus Christ Pose" is pretty cool pointing how rockers look down on everyone like they are Jesus. The rest of the songs are from Badmotorfinger, Superunknown, and Down on the Upside, which I didn't like as much but are still awesome. This also includes "Bleed Together" for the completest, which sucks because it is the only new song on here... Standouts include "Nothing To Say," "Hands All Over," and "Jesus Christ Pose." 
 I have to say I'm very pleased with the product. I have two units connected on 2 different circuits and the performance is great- 50-60Mbps. My building does have new electric wiring so perhaps it helps too.   The heat issue doesn't exist- the units feel barely lukewarm to the touch. And the 4-port switch is sweet- no extra power supplies, no wires. Great design indeed !  My only complain is that software is a bit flaky, seems to freeze and I couldn't change the password to anything but default. But the software is really not necessary anyway- it is a hardware solution. I plugged the units in and they worked ! 
 Selections from this album are always popping up in my iPod's list of favorite songs. Some days, when I need some energy, I'm playing their pub music. Other days, when I'm crashing on a deadline (or working on my Irish - WHAT a hard language! - learning songs really helps drum the crazy consonant changes into the brain), it's Maighr?ad all the way! Her voice is so beautiful (although it's higher than I usually prefer) and her delivery is so precise that I often listen to her pieces over and over again.   Great music! 
 Songs like Mon Dieu, Milord and Non ,Je Ne Regrette Rien, Hymne A L'Amour  will make you fall in love with her. I heard her songs for the  first time when I was eleven, and I'm still "in love". If you won't buy this  CD, don't buy any chanson at all.  Madame Piaf has the most powerfull and  beatifull voice I have ever heard,you don't have to speak french to  understand her songs, just listen to her sing... I'm giving her 100 stars  not five 
 I couldnt have been more blind to the world around me, or more ready for my eyes to be cleared. I didnt know exactly what I wanted out of religion, but when I finally got through my trials of the Chakra course, and got to the rituals in the back, I realized that there was an outlet for the way I felt I should Worship. But even without the rituals in the back, it would have taken me WAAAYYY longer to find a way to manifest my reality. Ive quit my crappy job and am now happily employed by myself, making enough money to live at a lake 
 It's a kind of tedious read, but the central idea (at least what I came away as the central idea) is great:  masculinity, and athletics aren't two bad notions in and of themselves.  But when you put the two together, and  not properly supervised, you can come up with some horrible stuff.  He goes  about proving this by interviewing some ex-jocks and comes up with some  great material.  It's basically a sociological sutdy, but works out nicely 
 The book was easy to understand, it can save a lot of money to those who invest in options.  It's not an academic piece of work describing too many strategies without rating them, but it is a very practical guide describing just 4  strategies, proven by the author to work very well.  One of the strategies seems to be unknown and not used by many traders. Interesting book 
 Very quick turn-around.  Order placed, order filled within two days.  Amazing.  Excellent recording, excellent quality.  Seller is very dependable 
 I've done my web research and it pointed me to buy the Canon DC40 among other dvd-camcorders in market.  It was such an amazing experience using it to capture moments during my nephew's birthday party.  The still shots were absolutely fantastic!  The video was like no other...it was very clear and sharp.  You may want to tweak the settings to get that film look versus the homevideo look on your video shots. Also, tweak the stills settings as well to get that SLR-like shots.  I love this product and I highly recommend this to all of you who are planning on purchasing a dvd-camcorder.  Cheers!   -- Joel Pelay 
 This soundtrack to the acclaimed television mini-series is heartbreakingly beautiful in its selection of music to represent the Irish diaspora. Surprising are the renditions of traditional songs by artists as diverse as Vince Gill, Sinead O'Connor and Van Morrison, and the orchestral pieces bring tears to my eyes, they are so beautiful. As the descendent of several waves of Irish migration in the past two centuries, it makes me wonder what prompted some of my own Irish ancestors to leave their homeland and come here. This music will break your heart, make you tap your toes joyfully and will make you both smile and cry, true Irish stuff if ever I heard it. I feel both intense sadness and pride at my Irish roots when listening to these songs and instrumental pieces, and if you have even a drop of Irish blood in you, or just wish you were Irish, I urge you to listen to this album. The music will haunt you long after you finish listening, and this is one album you will want to play again and again. A great companion album is the soundtrack to the television mini-series "Out of Ireland", another documentary about the Irish diaspora in the United States. You will find some of the same acclaimed Irish and Irish-American artists on that album as you will this album, such as Mick Moloney and Eileen Ivers. Paddy Moloney and the Chieftains obviously put a lot of love into this album and it shows in the choices of pieces they selected to represent the Irish struggle both in Ireland and in the US. A brilliant compilation of artists and music, and highly recommended, even if you aren't Irish, but just wish you were. If you are Irish, keep that box of Kleenex handy - you're going to need it 
 I am a big fan of Jonathan Kellerman and have always enjoyed his books. This book started out great and moved well.  It had everything to make it another page turner.  But it seemed like the author got tired of writing and just ended the book, taking the shortest route to conclusion and not really, clearly resolving some of the plot issues 
 I wasn't sure about Darren McGavin reading these books.  I thought he was too different from who I thought Travis McGee was.  Jimmy Buffett maybe, but Darren McGavin?  I was pleasantly surprised.  I enjoyed Mr. McGavin's  interpretation of my favorite beach bum sailor.   And any book by John D.  is miles above the rest, so I had to give it FIVE stars, even if it isn't  my favorite MrGee novel 
 I LOVE THIS ALBUM IT HAS GREAT SONGS ON IT I CAN'T STOP SINGING TO ALL THE SONGS ON THERE!  I GAVE IT 5 STARS BECAUSE I LOVE IT!  FROM A BIG BEE GEES FAN FOR 15 YEARS NOW KIRSTE 
 This book will take you on a journey and as you go deeper into the jungle you fall deeper into the dept of mans corruptibility.  This book is brutal and honest.  Marlow is the type of good man that does nothing and his goal is the type of man that has fallen from everything.  Marlow ends up seeing the very essence of the darkness of men.  You realize that he too could be corrupted just as easily by this evil that has stolen his targets soul. I too felt that I could be corrupted by the same evil if I was in their place.  That is the scariest thing of all.   I felt disgustingly empowered by this book and by the end I had chills down my spine at the absurdity of that perceived power and the great cost it took on all the innocents around it.  
 James Morrow is one of those authors that comes along only a couple of times in a lifetime who can leave you staring at the wall, lost in thought, but grinning because you can imagine the twinkle in his eyes as he turns each phrase.  From the first of his works I read, "Towing Jehovah," to this last piece, I've been fascinated, captivated, and entertained.  Here is your chance to learn great life secrets from a turtle, disocver that the most generic essence of man might be a giant egret - and learn that, evolution or not, it is indeed turtles ... all the way down. 
 This is the best parenting book that I have read.  It is easy to put it into practice and the results are fast 
 Not every recipe in this book was great, as is true with just about any cookbook.  I have tried some recipes that I was not impressed with, but I also came upon many recipes I liked quite a bit, such as her recipes for chickpea burgers and enchiladas.  What I really enjoyed was learning how to make baked goods that are pretty healthy and pretty tasty!  She has recipes for pancakes, muffins, cookies, etc. that are made with ingredients like whole wheat pastry flour, applesauce, yogurt, and flaxseed.  Like the ingredients in her other recipes, these can all be found in most grocery stores.  So many recipes in other vegetarian cookbooks are complicated and contain ingredients only found in health food stores.  The recipes in this cookbook are for the most party pretty simple.  This cookbook is particularly good for vegetarians with kids.  The book contains many kid-friendly recipes (pizza, macaroni and cheese, chili mac, spaghetti, etc.) but also has general ideas on things you can give kids for breakfast or pack in their lunch.  The biggest downside to this cookbook is that, if you're not into tofu and seitan, you'll have to skip over quite a few recipes.  
 I have to admit I have yet to read the book the movie was based on, so my review is based purely on entertainment value.  This movie has actually been a favorite of my family's for years and I only recently got a copy for myself.  The acting is wonderful, it's nice to hear REAL British accents, and the punchlines are carried out to perfection.  I tend to think this is a movie that all kinds of movie buffs can enjoy; the setting is the English countryside in the 20's (appealing to history lovers), the costumes are divine, the characters eccentric, and the humor appeals to all kinds of comedy-lovers.  It is an interesting look at human nature at it's best and worst 
 My 5 yr. old son just LOVES this!  He loves playing LEGO Star Wars on the Gamecube and loves to pretend with these.  We are always rescuing the princess and fighting Darth Vader.  We even consult Yoda for instructions.  These have a button you slide so you can wave the base and the "light" saber flies out...lots of fun!  Then it retracts with a little pushing/tapping and snaps into the base so you can wear it around using the clip (slides into a pocket or over the waistband of pants).  The handles look really cool, too.  This is a great deal at $5.29 and free shipping since the little figures are $6 for a 2-pk. at Target 
 I didn't read it cover to cover, but opened it at the points where I was at that part of the process. Good for reading that way. Get up to speed on, for example, copyright, move on in your business, revisit the book later when you're doing, for example, patents 
 I think many people were surprised to learn that Hayworth, one of the screen's most beautiful pin-up girls, began as a dancer herself (and under a Latin name, yet). They were probably further surprised to learn that after Astaire and Rogers' stellar partnership, he would be able to find further success following the whirlwind RKO cycle. This movie, a Columbia baby rather than an RKO, comes awfully close to the same light and airy style of the earlier series- right down to the silky b/w photography. And the mistaken identity plot (SPOILER?!) does have an original flavor regarding the gimmick behind nightclub owner Adolphe Menjou: Hayworth plays his gorgeous daughter- the second oldest of four but the only one unattached, and the father's rule is that the girls marry in order of age. The oldest has just married, and Rita is next to be, but by refusing to fall in love under duress, she upsets the matrimonial apple cart. (The whole notion of her being 'frigid' or 'cold' is utter nonsense, but that was the Hollywood stereotype of an alluring and independent woman back then.) Enter Astaire, and some beautiful dance duets- including the tap-happy "Shorty George" and the stunning ballroom turn "I'm Old Fashioned (radiantly staged in a moonlit garden and showing Hayworth off in a fluid black evening gown.)" Hayworth certainly echoes the title of the film, and she and Astaire made for beautiful music in this second of their two films together 
 This collective biography of abolitionists Frederick Douglass, James McCune Smith, Gerrit Smith, and John Brown presents an elegant portrait of the varieties of antislavery sentiment in the United States prior to the Civil War. The four men, two black and two white, formed a de facto alliance--although they would not have recognized it as such--to end slavery and were willing to use violence to do so. In a scintillating narrative that provides both enjoyable reading and penetrating analysis, John Stauffer links the four together as opponents of slavery seeking to overcome the "black hearts of men" but also partaking of the "black hearts of murder."  Organized into topics, rather than chronologically, Stauffer pursues the "literary turn" to analyze the four abolitionists, their writings, and their changes over time. His chapters relate to how these individuals perceived images of race, religion, economics, politics, identity, and women. At some level the most interesting figure presented in this book, perhaps because I knew the least about him, was Gerrit Smith. Although virtually every history of abolitionism mentions him, Stauffer goes deeper to explain Smith's patrician background, his adoption of antislavery, and his vigorous campaign to end it that sometimes resulted in violence. He notes how Smith attempted to found a multiracial community in New York state, an endeavor clearly tied to the utopian experiments of the era. He participated in an 1851 effort to rescue slaves and supported John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry. Shocked by the outcome of that raid, however, Smith then adopted white supremacism.   One of the central tenets of this book, and it is boldly stated, is that radical abolititionism led to the transformation of race as a concept in American history. This is an intriguing idea, but Stauffer does not pursue it with the diligence that might have been expected from an idea raised in the book's subtitle. What he does, again, is use Gerrit Smith's career as the bellwether for transformation. This includes a fascinating analysis of Smith's 1851 short story, "The Ruinous Visit to Monkeyville," in which Stauffer finds that Smith was somewhat ambivalent about the status of African Americans. This perspective fits well with another conception--this one of considerable durability--that such abolititionists as William Lloyd Garrison were not committed to equal rights for freed slaves. The abolitionists' racial paternalism was palpable, according to Stauffer. Some historians have sought to overturn this conception as not representative of the abolitionist cause, but clearly Stauffer still accepts the older idea.   Most interesting--and certainly worth serious but skeptical consideration--is Stauffer's assertion that the failure of abolitionists "to emphasize with blacks after Harper's Ferry foreshadowed the North's abandonment of freedman and women after Reconstruction" (p. 281). He bases this conclusion on his reading of Gerrit Smith, but there is a tenuous relationship at best and the author fails to make a convincing argument for this position. I find it a captivating idea, for it would explain much about the retreat from Reconstruction; I only wish the evidence supporting it were more thoroughly presented.   "The Black Hearts of Men" is a compelling book, elegantly written and boldly argued. It is appropriate to question some of the author's conceptions, but it is a very worthwhile book that requires serious consideration 
 On the basis of an Amazon recommendation, I picked up the second in the Far Wychwood mysteries. By the second chapter, I realized this was a jewel of writing, put it down, and bought Arson and Old Lace--first things first. As to why I like the series:   First, the author does not waste words. Verbosity is a pet peeve of mine.   Second, the dialogue is witty and believable. The main character has been dumped by her husband of many years and decides to move to England, near her daughter. She gifts her friends with her possessions, keeping only "a modicum of clothing, and the books, CDs, and the photo albums"--my kind of person. In short, she is a charming eccentric.   Third, with titles like Arson and Old Lace and Slaying Is Such Sweet Sorrow, the books deserve to be read 
  I'm amazed at how diverse a writer Michael Crichton is. I really liked the concept of this book.   Man builds a spaceship in the future, to leap across space and gather data. It returns back to earth in the past due to an error.    The spaceship not only creates a paradox, it also brings something back from its distant journey. Great story. 
 If you think of this as an ASTAIRE_ROGERS movie, then you will have some trouble. However, If you think of this as a movie WITH Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, then you will enjoy it. I thought it was very nice, especially when they did the "they can't take that away from me" and dance to it. Ginger doesn't look a day older than 30. (she's 38, and still adorable)We also have to remember, that this was after the depression, after the war, and ten years of different audiences since thier last picture. not to mentio MGM instead of RKO, so of course it will be different. The magic is still there, but in a different way. Don't look for it, but accept it as it is, and you'll find that Asaire-Rogers chemisrty never left 
 As a young boy I read this book and it made an enormous impression on me. Since then I have shared it with friends and family all over the world. It's a wonderful novel style history of diaspora and human endurance. It takes you across many ages in a entertaining way even though the subject is heart-wrenching at times. After Schwarz-Bart wrote the book, he never suceeded in topping it. Then again, if someone can tell a story like this the way he did, you don't have to write anything ever again 
 This is a deliciously gossipy book about a small town which just happens to be one of the world's treasures.  For whatever reason, people *talk to this author and provide insights into the heart of a city that few tourists ever really see for what it is.  I read this book just after spending two weeks in Venice and found that it corroborated in great detail so many of my own impressions.  Venetians talk about it, sometimes with mixed feelings, but they do talk about it.  
 Wonderful story telling and I highly recomend it for all dog lovers. The next to last chapter doesn't seem to fit the rest of the book.  The encounter with young girls detracts from the story line in my opinion 
 Once again, another great 80's classic, that can't seem to find it's way to DVD. Harmless pranks, good clean fun, and a bit of nudity, along with stars Phoebe Cates and Betsy Russell, make this one of the memorable films of it's kind. I guess we'll have to cross our fingers, and hope they will soon release the unrated director's cut on Blue-Ray 
 Palumbo is a writer turned psychotherapist. He saw all his own problems writing, and understood others also had them, and found his new voaction counceling other authors at various stages in their careers. As such the book differs from most other writer's guide books. He focuses on the internal processes of writing: self-doubt, negative judgement, hopelessness, loneliness, lack of ideas, etc. And he does give very valuable advice. Basically, he tells us to turn our weaknesses into strenghts. We can use anything in our writing, even our procrastination and depression. An idea that actullay goes back all the way to Nietzsche. Thios book will not write anything for you, but it will help give new clarity to your thoughts about writing, and in that way help you with your writing 
 Transgressions  provides  readers with the opportunity to sample ten different offerings from ten different authors.  There is a gritty 87th Precinct novella from Ed Mcbain and a lyrical offering on a child abduction from Joyce Carol Oates.  Steven King is well represented with a short but strangely moving tale of a 911 survivor haunted by his souveniers from his unlucky co-workers.    I enjoyed Transgressions for both its quality and variety. While no story in particular was a stand out, each provided a sample of the particular author's style.  Like a buffet, a taste is really all you need to determine where (and whether) you will return for second and third helpings 
 This collar works out great. It performs just as the Amazon description shows. It is unintrusive and snaps off when certain force is exerted. It's fun, too, because of the colors, and affordable 
 As always, Criterion gives the works a splendid treatment, beautiful transfer.  Supplemental materials are excellent, seperate short documentaries on the three films, done by top film scholars (like David Bordwell of the University of Wisconsin).  One thing it lacks is an accompanying commentary track for the films themselves, done by those same scholars.  That I would have liked, as they serve as a film school lecture on the work, and am always a little disappointed whenever Criterion leaves them out 
 Kay Hooper writes a series featuring different operatives in Noah Bishop's Special Crimes Unit. What sets this unit apart from others is that the operatives all have some form of paranormal powers including Bishop and his wife (who were featured earlier in the series). This story features former army officer, Riley Crane who is blessed with spidy powers. Unfortunately, she wakes up in bed, covered in blood with most of her short-term memory missing along with her paranormal powers. She had been helping on an occult case on tiny Opal Island. The case takes a nasty turn with what seems like an occult related death. Riley warily navigates the waters with a spotty memory and evil stalking her.   I'm not really a believer in the paranormal, but I always enjoy Kay Hooper's books. I think it is partly because the characters are always so likable. Sometimes, the paranormal is used as a device to tidy up details that cannot realistically happen, but since so much of these stories are unbelievable anyhow, it really doesn't detract. SLEEPING WITH FEAR was an engaging light read perfect for a lazy afternoon 
 WIRED spoke about a "great read" and Lev Manovich decribed Grau's book as a "must-read for anyone interested in new media, art history, and any field using virtual images." - Grau lives up to expectations !  He analyzes what is new in media art by balancing recent works and historic media development, and so retells art history as media history.  An interdisciplinary study in art history, media history, and new media art, the cross fertilization enriches his analysis and helps clarify the essence of immersion and Virtual Reality.  Beyond Grau's analysis, I was thankful to see so many artists involved - many hot names.  This book will be valuable for both practitioners and theoreticians. Hopefully there will be a paperback soon for students 
 I bought this book because I love Ronald Reagan and wanted to know more about these great speeches. This book provides all of the insights, including both of his D-Day speeches in the appendix section.  It's interesting to hear how Peggy Noonan put the Pointe du Hoc speech together and the back and forth editing that goes on with presidential speeches.  I was most impressed by how the story of Peter Zannata got into the speech.  I always wondered how this happened and this book provides the information.  It's not a history book about D-Day but focuses on how Ronald Reagan helped to create new interest in today's younger generation in the greatest generation--our WWII heroes.  It's very easy to read, too.  A very good book 
 Other than having to re-set a bit more than I would expect I think this PDA is great.  I would definitely recommend it! 
 This is the first time I bought an album from CeCe Winans and I was amazed how every song on here spectacular.  I listen to this cd everyday in my car and it makes my ride to my destination enjoyable!!!!  This album should be #1  Yonnie C 
 In the movie Ronin, the song that is playing when Katarina Witt is shot is "Time To Say Goodbye" and it is not on the Ronin soundtrack.  It  is on Sarah Brightman's album entitled coincidently "Time To Say  Goodbye".  In the other reviews, it may have be confusing that Andrea  Bocelli is also in that song but Ms. Witt's character is shot while skating  before Andrea sings his part in this beautiful duet.  I fully agree with  another reviewer that perhaps the best piece of music in this terific film  is not included in the soundtrack 
 Though the overextended wait for Fiona's third release might have left you to expect a disappointment, this is anything but.  Fiona's work as a individual - both in and outside of music - continues in full force with "Extraordinary Machine."  While I personally enjoy the title track by far, you cannot deny the compelling sounds of "O'Sailor" and "Get him Back."  I had the fortune of seeing her perform selections from this new album live, and she was fabulous.  Though Fiona can be labeled, at times, melodramatic and slightly over zealous, I have to say, it's refreshing to find that someone who has fallen in and out of the Hollywood hype can still channel that energy into something excitingly creative.  If you strive to find others like her that still manage to write compelling songs with lyrics to match, check out Gretchen Lieberum  - you can totally sink into her album like you can fiona's, and she just came out with "Siren Songs".  And if you don't have any of Fiona's earlier works - for shame!  No, seriously, go buy them 
 If you are into this region of the world and its music, world music, ethnomusicology, or music education in general, this series is a wonderful introduction to musical cultures.  My professor at college is using this for a Global Music Education class/multiculturalism in music.  Great model for educators 
 Like many of the comments before mine, this book is not for everyone. The narrative structure is a slight bit challenging and all of the answers are not straight forwards. But this book is not more difficult than anything that could be considered postmodern American fiction. It's an engaging story that is conducive for reading for extended periods of time.   I'm not sure that I would read anything else from Canetti because I found his grammar irritating to a degree. If you can let the phrasing pass by you, the book is an amazing story with a sinister hook. I think that if you like the absurdity of either Pynchon or Gass, you'll enjoy this book a lot 
 This is such a great book.  It shows little kids that no matter what there is always good in people.  Even if they don't show it right away 
   I bought this c.d. because like a poser I liked the songs on mtv. However when I stuck it in my car's c.d. player I was blown away after each track. There are some songs in life that have a good beat and there are others that carry a good little story to them, these songs carry both, great words great beats on every track. After listing to this c.d. twice you listen to the words so intently that you can sing along with the windows open, and just feel great. Must own c.d. for anyone. Great from beginning to end, a rarity 
 Intrinsic Motivation is one of the better books on leadership and management that I have read recently.  Thomas targets both managers and employees, arguing that salaries and other extrinsic rewards are neither the sole nor the primary source of motivation in modern organizations.  In fact, monetary compensation is only a factor when making major life decisions (e.g., whether and when to change jobs) and when there is a question of fairness.  The best a manager can hope for, says Thomas, is perceived equity - that those doing the most and the best work are the best compensated.  Absent major life decisions and inequities, it is intrinsic rewards that will motivate employees.  Intrinsic motivation, according to Thomas, means giving employees an understanding of the purpose of the tasks they do and giving them whole tasks whenever possible.  Today's workforce is more highly educated than its forerunners.  Competition and the need for quick decision-making have reduced the reliance on middle managers and bureaucratic rulebooks.  In this environment, employees must be self-managing and they must have a sense of meaningfulness, choice, competence, and progress in the work that they do.  If they feel that they have all four of these factors, employees will feel a great sense of job satisfaction, be highly motivated, and perform well.  Thomas offers managers and employees suggestions on how to improve in each area if it seems that that factor is lacking.  In fact, if an employee is feeling unmotivated, Thomas suggests the employee consider which of the four "vital signs" is weak and address it accordingly.  It is important, for example, for employees at all levels to have a personal vision to boost their sense of meaningfulness.  Feeling that you have no choice in how you do your work?  Negotiate with your boss for more authority or, if all else fails, consider moving to another job that provides more choice.  A sense of competence comes from training and learning, but it also comes from patting oneself on the back for a job well done.  Progress can be measured in a number of ways, but one of the best is through contact with customers.  Thomas's book is only an overview into each of these areas.  He intends Intrinsic Motivation to be an all-encompassing model of employee motivation, and he generally succeeds.  Those seeking more details would need to use Thomas's notes to find articles and books on individual subjects discussed within the book.  And it is a shame that while Thomas characterizes outdated management styles as "paternalistic" he uses analogies of parents and children when describing intrinsic motivation.  Overall, however, Intrinsic Motivation is a healthy reminder to both managers and workers that there are many steps we can take to improve employee morale and productivity.  More money is better than less, Thomas agrees, but a true sense of purpose and worth can be priceless 
 When I was eight years old, this version of Alice in Wonderland was aired on T.V.  I thought I had watched the best movie ever at that time, and still, to this day, I have more fond memories of watching that movie than any other time in my life!  The songs were beautiful!  I can still sing the song Alice sang to the deer - "Why do people act as if they're crazy?  Why to they behave the way they do? I have to say, this is one my favorite songs of all time! If you get a chance to purchase and watch this movie, you will witness the beautiful music 
 This is the best course textbook I have had so far over about ten industrial engineering courses (and I have had some very good textbooks and courses).  The book basically describes how to analyze and improve manufacturing operations through examining key areas that include: variability and its sources, push and pull systems, and supply chain management.   The authors approach is to present ideas in a very clear and relevant way.  What I particularly like is that they do a great job putting things into perspective in a style that is highly readable.  While there is some math involved if one wants to delve into the details that are in side notes, a basic understanding of calculus is more than sufficient.  The authors are clearly very bright and, more importantly, are able to communicate very effectively and with a sense of humor.    This book can definitely be read on a stand-alone basis outside of a school environment.  Many of the central ideas are very valuable 
 This book, Journey to the River Sea was a very good read. I liked this book especially because I have never been to the Amazon and I thought this was a very descriptive book on the subject. I have read many of Eva Ibbotson's works and this book is one of her greatest. But I do not recommended her latest books because they have started to suck. My favorite part of this book was when Clovis wants to keep living in west wood because he doesn't want to kill Sir Aubrey and also to save Finns life. I think if you are about 2-102 you should read this. I give this book about 4 stars out of 5 So all in all I thought Journey to the river sea was totally awesome! So you better read it.... OR ELSE!!!  
 There are many books on watercolor techniques so why should you buy this one? You should buy this book because it an excellent reference book to help you learn the "nuts & bolts" of painting watercolors.As an example I refer to pages 44&45, "The Gradated Wash".Here artist Joe Garcia gives you a clear definition of the technique followed by very direct instructions and clear photos on how to proceed.He then gives you a tip at the end to get the best results.While this book seems at first glance to be more of an introduction to basic techniques more advanced artists will find this book to be very useful as a reference resource.The book like all North Light books is well designed with many photos and illustrations.When I first saw this book I figured do I really need this one? The answer is yes for the reasons I have mentioned.The author also explains his preference for materials and using watercolor boards which he makes himself. Now that it is available in a paperback edition there is no reason not to consider buying it 
 I bought this book after hearing several homeschoolers tell me how it drastically changed their teaching for the better.   The focus is academic standards should not be separated from spiritual standards! It explains how we need to teach the whole child according to the child's individual God-given gifts. True wisdom progresses beyond intellectual pursuit; it is practical.  The goals outlined in this book will help you prepare, teach, and evaluate your children from a Biblical world view. It will also advise you in helping them become self-motivated, lifelong learners.  This book has four intriguing sections:   The first section explains how we have been conditioned to believe the state is competent to access our children's intelligence! You'll learn how different a Christian world view is and how to RENEW your mind to get rid of this "public education mentality." It includes a look at the Greek history of state education compared to history of Biblical education. The Hebrews focused on the home. Worship, family and academics were taught in the home, not separated subjects in individual locations. The home was more important then the synagogue. The center of all life-- religious, education, and training--was the home.   The second section explains what achievement tests are, test terms, test scores, testing limitations, avoiding testing anxiety, possible benefits from testing, states that require testing, alternative methods of evaluation, and much more.  Section III explains a new teaching approach (based on a combination of several effective approaches including Charlotte Mason, chronological history, Ruth Beechick, etc.) called The Heart of Wisdom.   The Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach is centered around reading the Bible through in one year and the creation of a Bible portfolio. The Bible is the main focus and the core of the curriculum, with the secondary focus dedicated developing writing skills using the "writing to learn" method. The H.O.W. approach leads progressively to a renewed mind and to a self-chosen commitment to a life of intellectual and moral integrity. You can use this approach as explained, or adapt it to the methods and curriculum you are using. (Explained in detail on the Heart of Wisdom web site).  Section IV includes check lists are divided according to grade level K-8: Math, Science, Language Arts, and Social Science. Studies show "Evaluation Check Lists" are far superior to Achievement Tests. You can evaluate and make notes for up to five children with these lists.   Bible Reading checklist and a Character Traits list are also included as well as extensive glossaries and reproducible forms.   I agree with those that recommended this book- it has changed my view of education drastically! 
 This book begins with a brief account of the authors own experiences with many stressful situations and how she overcame them; which gave rise to the book. You may be thinking I am already under stress,why would I want to hear about anyone elses?  I think this is an important part of understanding why her techniques are so believable and useful however. Reading the book is the first step, the next is actually putting the techniques into practice by incorporating them into your life. Luckily they are simple, even though they are powerfully effective. Although this book is several years old now, I would definately say that the wisdom contained within is still very timely and appropriate.  
 Books has great tips and using it along with a more "traditional" guide is a great combination !   Particulary good on the restaurant tips.  A litle "too" focused on americans visiting Italy but ok 
 Very enjoyable CD.  Simple and straight forward, a solo piano and selections from a long list of remarkable composers, followed up with the Peanuts tune Linus and Lucy with a jazz trio(piano, bass and drums) If this dosen't motivate a piano player nothing will.  5 stars 
 This is a great combination of trusty standards and unique variations. I will be handing this book out enmass this holiday season 
 Not only is Herman extremely knowledgeable about his topic, he is also an engaging writer.  Probably one of the better written histories that I've read 
 Okay, so everyone is writing how-to books. Why? They sell. Why? Because we know we could be better than we are and most of us want that to happen. Boothman's book is a plus in any library. He tells what to do and what not to do when meeting friend or foe. With the usual hello or go to hell out of the way, he makes good suggestions about how to build natural rapport. My favorite part of the book is how to get along with a bully. The bottom line is that with just a little practice you can have complete strangers saying, "There's something about this person I really like." Success! Since I'm considered one of America's most controversial authors, that's a very difficult thing for me to accomplish even on my good days. So if this book helped me make a few friends, just think what it can do for you 
 This was a good read because the plot didn't go in the direction I thought it would and had an unusual ending 
 X were an amazing, amazing band and this DVD really drives this point home.  The live club performances show their incredible musicianship--DJ Bonebrake and Billy Zoom are PHENOMENAL!  The studio performances show what incredible songwriters and artists John and Exene were.  The video montages throughout put it all into context, and made me feel really nostaglic, there's nothing quite like superimposing a cruise missile over Ronnie Reagan's face to bring a tear to your eye.  There's also this groovy, artsy video of Exene to White Girl that really sticks with you.  No band in the last 20 years comes close to X--X were the real thing, and luckily there's The Unheard Music to remember them by.  Buy it, watch it, and lend it to your paperboy, and afterwards the two of you can burn all his Emo CDs and start a band together 
 The Soundtrack, "Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events", was everything I expected! The CD is nice and long, and includes the fabulous track: "Loverly Spring", or, the 'littlest elf' song,  which is not included entirely in the movie. Thomas Newman's rhythms and the interesting instruments he uses, combine to create a fabulous listening experience. 
 I got this album before I got any of the other Aesop Rock cds.  The only hip hop I really listened to was Atmosphere and I wanted to get into it.  I bought this cd because it was the only Aesop Rock cd at the store and I was like awesome.  I must admit the first listen I was like ehh I'm not too sure I will like this cd.  Didn't listen to it much after that, gave Labor Days a chance, loved it, went back to this, loved it.  I think it threw me off at first, Labor Days gave me a transition into it.  I would say if you haven't heard Aesop Rock before, you might want to go to Labor Days first, but now I consider this just as good as Labor Days if not better.  I love the way Aesop Rock works with the words, his delivery is also very unique and just works very well.  Labor Days got me to appreciate his style and then I really grew to love Bazooka Tooth.  I like how he produced mostly all of the cd himself, even if some of the songs are a little lacking in the production, but just listen to The Greatest Pac-Man Victory In History and Mars Attacks, awesome beats.  Aesop Rock is a very unique rapper and I love his style, it gives you a very nice break from all those cd's you've been listening to over and over again.  Overall Bazooka Tooth has a few weak spots, but the rest is strong.  If you dig Aesop, get this, if you don't know anything about Aesop but want to get into his music, get Labor Days.  LSD LSD LSD 
 I am just finishing reading this book for the third time. This time I took the time to study each chapter thoroughly and to complete each one of the exercises. I have to admit that this is rigorous study of the book, and it's been life transforming. I've studied the book with a partner. We talk each week by telephone to share what we see about how the information in the chapter and the exercises apply to our lives. There is something so powerful about telling the truth about what we see and how it's affecting us, our energy relating to money, and our lives. One action I've taken as a result of this study is to clean my garage (with the support of my husband). For the first time in several years I can park my car in the garage - and there's breathing room from having many fewer belongings which, for the most part, I wasn't using anyway. I'm also accomplishing my goal of writing a book I'd wanted to write for about six years - with clarity and ease! How good is that 
 The book is wonderful.  It has a nice variety of bags to make, with easy directions.  The pictures are great and there is a nice explanation of skills in the front of the book.  This book is a good way to start making felted purses 
 Randy made excellent comments.  I'd also like to add, in response to the question we hams all receive, as to "why radio, when the Internet, cell phones, and other forms of communication exist?" is that in disaster areas - even small disasters - normal avenues of communication are can't be used.  Phone lines are jammed or down.  Cell services are down.  Radio is usually the only type of communication that can be used under such circumstances.    I work in Salt Lake City.  In 1999 when we had a shooting in the Family History Library, as well as a tornado strike a few months later, radio was the only means of communication into downtown 
  Bought this to replace my at least 10 year old Bialetti aluminum pot, and I am not disappointed. It makes the best expresso ever and is easy to clean. I bought this along with the Aerolatte "to go" milk frother, and have been making great cappuccinos with skim milk. It is also very pretty to look at; I love this pot!  
 I thought the book was good.  My only complaint was the beggining was a little too much science, but than it was loaded with lots of good information such as how to parent children with ADD.  Most of the science stuff was interesting, but some good a little too technical. I have read several of Thom Hartmans books and would reccomend them all. His style is easy to read, yet full with practical information. I would not recocmend the book unless you had ADD or your kid or a close family member did.   
 Anne Lamott is back, with all of her glorious humor, angst, and wisdom. If you haven't discovered Anne yet, she is shock therapy for those of us who learned how to be religious before we learned how to be human.  In her previous book, Traveling Mercies, Anne shared her crooked journey through alcoholism, bulimia, and broken relationships to a connection with St. Andrews Presbyterian Church and Jesus Christ. Now, in Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith, Anne shares the new challenges to her faith, namely The Bush Administration, her aging mother, menopause, the loss of friends to illness, teaching Sunday School, and raising her teen-aged son, Sam. While many of her crises in Plan B are stock milestones of middle age they are no less poignant when rendered by Anne's pen.  Anne's power comes from her unflinching authenticity, a scarce quality in the self-serving industry of memoir writing. Anne describes her life has it happens, without bothering to airbrush away her neurotic impulses and imperfections. Her self-depreciating humor and honesty creates a picture of spirituality reminiscent of Dostoevsky; we are all simultaneously noble and depraved. As I read Plan B, I laughed with Anne at her foibles and became more honest about my own.   Anne Lamott, along with Fredrick Buechner, might be the best living Christian author that you can't find at a Christian book store, likely because Anne elevates cursing to a literary art form. More significantly, this author is openly pro-choice and pro-gay rights. She also addresses God as a feminine being and some readers might balk at her rabid Bush-bashing and extreme left-wing politics. However, I'd challenge any reader to see Anne as more than the sum of her politics and ideas. Reading anything by Anne Lamott creates the opportunity to remember that God wills and works through your bad attitudes, flawed character, and humanity. Wading through Anne's positions is worth any personal risk you might feel. Encountering her writing style is a joyous experience and you'll bump into God's grace as often as you will step in piles of human frailty.  BOOKBLOG RATING:  A  --LS 
 "The Martians have arrived. Let the war begin." A catchphrase that could easily be employed for Herbert George Wells's most acclaimed science fiction "The War of the Worlds". This is a novel revolving around the highly improbable but simultaneously stunningly imaginative idea that the earth is invaded by organisms residing on Mars. Composed in a first person narrative,"The War of the Worlds" is a gripping saga of the millions of people's agony and loss of ease in the face of a confrontation that would change the world for good.  The story begins directly with the theme. In the last years of the 19th.century,in the most unassuming and delicate of all propositions,England witnesses the most surreal threat:ten bizzare cylinders all containing Martians fall near London. A wave of bitter agony,nameless fear and hopeless apprehension rocks the peole and as the Martians gradually come to terms with the Earth's gravitational strength,the police and the military of surrounding regions stolidly enarm themselves for an imminent war. The greatest of all human fallacies is perhaps the absurd universal acknowledgement that humans are the most accomplished creatures anywhere. This myth is firmly exploited in the book a the narrator---an ardent follower of astronomy and scholar of philosophy---perceives a plethora of harrowing incidents that compel him to shudder to his boots.   The narrator's town of Maybury is completely demolished and so are the nearby towns of Woking,Weybridge,Shepperton and others. The narrator manages to traffic his wife to his cousin's place in Leatherhead in asumed safety but himself gets entangled hopelessly and helplessly in the boughs of life and death. In his maddening and desperate escape from the clutches of the more intelligent and powerful Martians,the narrator pairs up first with an artillerman and then with a curate. The latter is a lost soul whose faith in God and religion has broken in the wake of humanity's greatest ever calamity and the former is confident and visonery whose preferred modes of survival in a Martian dominated Earth is not that improbable,if at all naive. H.G.Wells's artistry lies in speedily building up to a great climax and in a plot so utterly novel and unique and symmetrical,this is a marvellous diusplay of wit,intelligence and clearness of structure.  "The War of the Worlds" on one level may appear to be a mere science fiction with vivid illustration of beings from outer space and the havoc they cause on our planet but the essence of the book transcends much beyond this demarcation. The weahness of mankind in the face of unknown,unheard and unthought catatrophes is firmly delineated in this landmark novel and Wells applies a very,very subtle satire on humans' grotesque complacency on teir own abilities. When the artilleryman admits,"we're down;we're beat" with "absolute conviction",the reader fathoms the author's surrender of "the greatest power in the world" to Fate. On a much higher level,"The War of the Worlds" is a massive comment on man's petty as well as magnanimous follies garbed in a dress of science fiction.  Composed in a sense of retrospection,the book does lose some of its charm from the very beginning that the narrator is alive and kicking. and the confinement of the sequence of events within a relatively small England territory narrows the scope of the novel and also trims down its volume. But even so,"The War of the Worlds" is a brilliant science fictin that leads the rteader on a journey on the back of an unfaithful wave that conpires to lead the world to the ultimate diasaster. H.G.Wells was a great visonery in the late 19th.century and it's no less remarkable achievement that this Englishman's great book is still being studied today and would be read for several decades to come. "The War of the Worlds" is a captivating and telling tale that would dazzle the reader by the shine of the writer's craftmanship.

 This is a fabulous book!  The experiments are easy to do, they are safe and they teach some of the basic principles of science in a way that even parents will be learning something new.  I bought this book after seeing the author at a bookstore doing a demonstration and I have not been disappointed.  Even if you don't know anything about science you will be able to do these experiments with your children...and you'll have fun!  
 I have come to the conclusion that the more CARTOONY/FUNNY PAGES Books by Chris Hart  are best written, clearly explained and  better informed.  This book is great to get a GOOD feel for the 60's retro Hanna Barbera/ Pink Panther Cool McCool [giving away my age!!!] style of cartoons.  The part about creating your on style and constructing heads/ bodies is good. The part on showing emotion is well thought out.  As mentioned before; the other books that deal w/ Manga/Mechas, etc are NOT that clear in terms of  expalaining content/ process; but the more HUMEROUS books are. 
 If you're a fan of Adult Swim then the antics on Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law probably aren't going to surprise you at all. Harvey Birdman is a failed superhero from a show in the 70s that has decided to pursue a law career (similar to Space Ghost Coast to Coast) representing other Hanna Barbera cartoons. The characters featured in this volume include the Jetsons, Grape Ape, Quick Draw McGraw, and other famous names you would recognize from Saturday morning cartoons.   Harvey Birdman was one of the four first shows that Adult Swim debuted in 2001. The other three are Aqua Teen Hungerforce, The Brak Show, and Sealab 2021. Birdman's antics during the show are the farthest thing from an actual lawyer but you would expect that from Adult Swim. Joining him is his loyal falcon Avenger who know acts as his secretary and Peanut who acts as his legal clerk. The random pop culture references found in other Adult Swim shows are present in Birdman and it's a great show to kick back and watch a couple of episodes. The episodes are only eleven minutes so I highly recommend the DVD so you can watch them in a row.  You get thirteen great episodes in this set along with some deleted scenes, audio commentary, and a couple other special features. It's not very expensive and it's a great value for your money. If you love Adult Swim then Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law is the right show for you. 
 If you loved the movie, you MUST have this. Listening to his "Encarnacion" song while driving is one of my new favorite pleasures 
 How JFK kept sane we will never know , obviously the JCS wanted to send us all into god knows where but you can bet they would have been safe in their hideaway . Seems to me , like Churchill had his mission in life , there at the right time , then so JFK was put in charge for his ability to change the thinking 
 Another amazing release by a talented band.  These guys never cease to amaze me with their lyrics,  melodies,  and sounds.  Ok,  so they are one of my favorites,  but if you have other 54-40 CD's,  then you'll know what I mean.  I wonder why these guys aren't giants in the industry,  but then again,  I like them the way they are.  This CD features such gems as Giants,  Ride,  and Seventeen On.  Oh ya,  Animal In Pain,  is a riot!  With so much intellegint rock packed into one CD,  I feel I've stolen something.  Keep up the good work guys 
 This is BAR NONE, the best 5-string banjo instrumental album ever recorded.  This is one of those rare albums where you can go five years between listens, and every time you hear it again, the first thing out of your mouth is, "This is still the best there ever was. It's as good now as it was the first time I heard it. 
 Ok,  let me start out by saying I love CC's work, she is almost my favorite, right behind Judith McNaught!  I did enjoy this book, it was a little hard to get into after the first few pages, I like how the girl was so headstrong to do the things she did but it just took too long and there were too many intermediaries in the story.  Warrior Song - the first of this series was really good, the best of the series, in my opinion.  Earth Song was good, I will probably sell the book and not read it again, it didnt hold me that long for me to read again.   Sorry Ms. Coulter,  You are a wonderful writer but this one was a bit lacking.  I guess we all have bad days. 
 Brian Stokes Mitchell ("Stokes" to his friends) is a hugely talented baritone who has starred in "Ragtime" and "Kiss Me, Kate," among others.  TV viewers may remember him from the late 70's, when he played "Jackpot" on the CBS drama "Trapper John, M.D."   This is a fantastic compilation of show tunes and standards, and each one is a revelation.  My personal favorites are "Something's Coming," "Being Alive," and "How Glory Goes."  Mr. Mitchell is one of the great leading men of our time, and debut cd's like this come along only once in a great while.  Get it and enjoy it 
 A great accomplishment.  Merlis breaks very fresh literary ground with this imaginative tale of contemporary hustler/stripper/heir Pyrrhus being led by an oracle (and a eunuch) to claim his birthright as the son of Achilles and conquerer of The Trojans in the Trojan War.  AN ARROW'S FLIGHT is a brilliant (and tres gay) retelling of THE ODYSSEY as well as an on-target commentary on current gay identity and politics.  The narrative presents a crazy and brilliant mix of then and now, classic and disposable, enduring and fleeting, myth and mansex, humor and tragedy, and much more...and amazingly it all makes sense!  With this novel Merlis surpasses even the highest hopes I had after his wonderful debut novel AMERICAN STUDIES.  I think this one is destined to be a classic gay novel in the years to come.  Bravo!    
 "As You Like It" is bar none, one of Shakespeare's VERY best works.  It is probably the most poetic of the comedies and contains perhaps as many famous quotations as any other of his plays.  Rosalind is perhaps his greatest female character and this work, along with the equally (or even more) brilliant "Midsummer Night's Dream," is the best example of Shakespeare's theme of the "dream world" vs. the "real" world.  This play, especially the scenes in the forest, is a celebration of language and the power of the freedom of the imagination.  It consequently can be read as a criticism of the "real world," here represented by Duke Ferdinand's court.  Like many of the other comedies, Shakespeare is mocking the "ideal" which many in his society would have praised.  Though this play deals with some pretty dark themes (which of his plays doesn't?) it is a light-hearted and fully enjoyable read 
 I had the opportunity to study with Warren Susman in the early 1980s at Rutgers and the experience completely changed the way I look at history.  Susman was an old-school scholar, given his place on the faculty based on his teaching and his ideas more than his publications (of which there are very few).  This book covers most of Susman's major ideas, showing that history can be seen through culture as much as through politics.  His piece on FDR and Mickey Mouse is probably his best-known and is included here.  One of my most-cherished college memories is walking with Susman to class once, discussing movies.  A great teacher who died much to soon 
 I think alot of the reviewers on both sides here have no business reviewing this book in the first place.  Let me explain with this example:  If you don't speak French and you pick up a book written in French you will probably recognize some of the words and even understand a few sentences based on knowledge you might have of basic French and because of the similarity of many French words to English words (or whatever language(s) you know).  But you won't be able to completely understand the book unless you sit down and translate it.  It would be stupid to proclaim that the book is a failure just because you don't understand the language.  In the same way, you might appreciate the beauty of the French language and think the book sounds pretty even if you can't understand it, but this is no reason to claim that the book is a masterpiece.    We might as well consider Finnegan's Wake as a book written in a different language that we aren't fluent in.  A book (or any work of art, for that matter) isn't bad just because you have to work to understand it.  That may make it frustrating but it doesn't make it bad.  So, if you don't think it's worth the time and effort to use reading guides or whatever to make sense of this book, then you should just leave it alone instead of going around acting like anything you have to say about the book has any merit whatsoever.  On another note, it's completely absurd to review this book just as you would a book by Stephen King - based on how entertaining the storyline was or how realistic certain characters were - simply because this is not what the book is aiming for in the first place.  This would be like judging the Mona Lisa as a piece of crap because you're a big fan of cave drawings showing a chain of events and you didn't see what the chain of events was in Mona Lisa.  You judge a work based on how well it succeeds at what it is trying to do, not at how well it succeeds at what everyone else it trying to do 
 when i first started listenin to Kid Rock, i was blown away. it was something totally new for me. well, heres my review  Bawitdaba-5/5 probably one of the greatist opening tracks of all time. has the famous line "MY NAME IS KIIIIIIIIIIIIIID...Kid Rock!"  Cowboy- 5/5 my 3rd favorite song. kid starts out with some slow rap then at the end it gets great.  Devil Without A Cause- 5/5 wow..this really shows Kid's ability to rap. with joe c finishing things off with a rap then starts yellin "WHO LIKES TO PARTY ROCK THE PARTY!?!!?" and stuff like that. R.I.P. Joe C  I Am The Bullgod- 4/5 a pretty good song but after awhile it gets old.  Roving Gangster(Rollin) - 4/5 like Bullgod, it can get repetitive, but still its good.  Wasting Time- 3/5 sounds like filler material to me. a decent song, but i usually just skip over it.  Welcome 2 The Party (Ode 2 The Old School)- 5/5 a pretty long song with some woman (trying to) rap in the middle, but still one of my favorite songs on this album. he raps for 2 min straight the first verse, then kicks things up a notch in the last.  I Got One For Ya- 3/5 More filler material. sounds like it shouldve been on cocky or his self titled cd. usually just skip over this song too.  Somebodys Gotta Feel This- 5/5 My favorite song. this song kicks so much arse its not even funny. its pumpin til the very last.  Fist of Rage- 5/5 a real heavy song with him screaming in the chorus. a long guitar solo in the middle.  Only God Knows Why- 5/5 the first Kid Rock song i ever heard. this is my 2nd fav. song on this album. this is actually a slow song used with a voice box( or something). I love this song. i cant skip it.  F-ck Off- 4/5 An angry song that features Eminem at the very end. An ok song, but i usually skip it. its kinda hard to hear kid's voice in this one.  Where U At Rock- 5/5 i really like this song. it ties with the title track for the best rhyming. wow  Black Chick, White Guy- 5/5 a slow song, but he still raps. 7 minutes long, he raps a story of two lovers and their problems. at the very end theres a remix of I Am The Bullgod, although its not as good as the original.  well there u go. this is Kid Rock at his best. If  your a Kid Rock fan, GET THIS ALBUM NOW!! 
 First, the few critiques- the historic quotes from famous men on the significance of the Bible contain several which have been shown to be spurious (esp the one attributed to George Washington); the archaeological supports for the Bible are debatable & dated; and the sections on Church History & The Book of Revelation are heavily Protestant, mildly anti-Catholic (not at Chick or Hislop level) & totally neglects Eastern Orthodoxy.  That said, I prefer it to the NIV updating because an honest Church History has to take a few whacks at Roman Catholicism, and the Revelation commentary blends historical, idealist and futurist views, which I regard as a much fuller perspective than the heavily futurist one in the NIV version. I may get the NIV one to supplement my original Halley's, but I'll always go to the original Halley's in my Bible studies.  Btw, I totally don't know what the racism charge is about.   
 Allison Bottke has written a fun, thought-provoking novel about sticking firm to one's faith in the midst of daily life. Her heroine, Dee Decker, wrestles with marital issues, work issues, and children issues--things every reader can identify with. I can't wait to read Allison's next novel 
 This crib came in five days and was in perfect shape.  We set it up in a reasonable amount of time. I can honestly say that it feels sturdier than any other cribs we were shopping for in the stores.   
 Many previous detailed reviews. This is an excellent book that analyzes the structure, spread and affect Islam has had on the world, how it has treated non-muslims, and shows its many flawed and deceiving faces. Islam needs to be understood for what it is by head-in-the-sand westerners and, besides analysis and understanding, western civilization certainly needs to identify a lasting cure for this violent, self-absorbed, hate-filled, psychotic plague before more demage is done 
 David McCullough is a wonderful story teller.  We can put aside genre compartmentalization when discussing one of his works because the author's apparent interests are so diverse.  How could one describe a book as manifest as The Great Bridge when seeking an idea of what it entails?  Well, of course there is the idea of archetechtural accomplishments, of the ups and downs and rising and falling of brilliant physical design coming to terms with the hard realities of labor and human failings.  There is mathematical wizardry and the oftimes rambling thoughts of creative genius versus the unglamorous sprawl of big city politics just after the civil war.  Here we have the story of American immigrant accomplishment told in swift and startling detail in a multi-generational biography of the great family Roebling.  It is a story of crime and deceit and deception and political manuevering and the ever-present threat of corruption's results and subsequent influence.  The Great Bridge is the story of American history coming into modern times, of great cities growing greater and the distance between rich and poor, aristocrat and poor laborer and the many social issues that arise out of both hardship and greed.  The Great Bridge is an indefinable book--a masterpiece of its kind and a book, for sheer adventure, thrills, terror, comedy, romance and heart-rending tragedy it is very hard to top.  Wonderful popular history told by perhaps the best at this game 
 Another enjoyable visit with the residents of Crozet, VA, both human and nonhuman. Those who enjoy the Lilian Jackson Braun Cat Who series are sure to enjoy the Mrs Murphy books as well. Michael Gellatly's illustrations also add to the appeal of this book.    There are a few loose threads never tied up and some contrived plot devices, but overall, this book is a good choice for an entertaining read 
 I ordered this for my daughter for her digital camera/camcorder and it was a great price for the size of memory card.  I have always been very satisfied with purchases from amazon.com A very good online company, with good products and great prices 
 For any fan of dark, inappropriate humor, this is the best buy in a long time. The episodes themselves are brilliantly funny, and the extras are even better (if possible). You get a (very long) blooper reel, commentary from Amy, Paul & Stephen on 9 of the funniest episodes, an interview with the cast from the Museum of TV and Radio archives, and so much more. The packaging is a bit unusual, but it's less unstable than one would think. A definite, definite purchase 
 Johnny Depp has proved himself masterful at creating interesting characters and making them his own.  In this movie, he does a fine comedic turn and humanizes the otherwise scary concept of pirate.  There's something of Oliver's Fagin to him that makes you want to invite him to dinner as long as you hide your wife, children, and anything else of value 
 Do you think grumpy is natural? Think again. Learn from the experts, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. They really make an odd couple "Odd Couple, The" - Neil Simon (1968).   Neighbors John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon), and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) have always been friendly rivals that play practical jokes on each other.  Things really heat up with the arrival of a vivacious neighbor Ariel Truax (Ann-Margret).  
 For Perl programmers looking to make more of the language than just scripting this is the ideal 'step up' book. Object Oriented features of Perl are covered well. Writing and publishing CPAN modules is also covered, as are unit testing concepts.  If you want to expand your Perl world view this is an ideal second book to go along with the classic Programming Perl 
 I liked this book a lot. I bought it in high school and it was a good book. It was a little elementary at some points. It talked about running a business such as T-Shirt Printing(where you put designs on a shirt and sell it). A lot of the information was great though. If youre in college it may be a waste of time it's more high school. It's for those who don't  know much about businesses. 
 So I would give this five stars, but I just can't. This book captivated me, I couldn't put it down and all that, but it's about the death of countless thousands of people. You can't love or like a book about this subject matter. It reads well and is put together well. Following the plight of six A-Bomb victims is a horrifying experience. This updated version has an additional, "Aftermath" chapter in which the lives of these six individuals is updated to around 1980. I find myself looking at humanity differently now. What the crap!? How something like this happened and how little it is talked about is unbelievable. Having read basically nothing else about this subject I would have to say that this book is a good point to start at that will not allow you to ignore this piece of human happening any farther. What happened and how what happened was treated is a true sign of how sad and despicable human beings can be. This should be required reading for everyone 
 This is a wonderful guide to the history, production, and collecting of Lincoln cents. The date/mintmark analysis is particularly useful for consultation everytime I purchase one of these coins. I found no faults whatsoever with this book 
 This can be a misunderstood book as indicated by some of the negative reviews. People tend to get defensive when you stir up the status quo. This is not meant to be a book on 'How to Fix All Marriages' or meant to imply that all failed marriages are the woman's fault. Really, the author is obviously not that simple minded. It is a book that addresses SPECIFIC issues of "Double Standards", self-centeredness and about men who aren't appreciated by their wives and feel dehumanized and taken for granted. There are many men who feel this way, and their feelings are not considered to be valid or important, which is why this book was written. This is NOT a book to advise women to be a submissive 'servant' to a dominating abusive husband. It is about respect and remembering that your partner is more than just a 'husband' or 'wife'. Your partner is (or should be) the most important person in your life and in your heart, and does not deserve to be put on the bottom of the list.  We live in a selfish, power hungry society. It is often believed that you must get what you want at the expense of others. As a result, many (not all) women consider reaching out to their husband in a genuinely caring and loving manner to be not looking out for themselves. But, FULLY loving yourself does not mean that you would not be capable of loving anyone else. Giving is usually more pleasurable and beneficial to the one doing the giving, if it is done out of true generosity and gratitude, not from a sense of duty or obligation. Appreciation is the key to transforming yourself, your partner and the relationship in ways you never dreamed possible. What you put out is what you get back. Happy, loving couples ENJOY doing things for each other, it comes naturally. There's no power struggle.  I was a bit put off by the title at first. But, the content of the book addresses VERY important and prominent relationship issues of respect and taking responsibility in an EQUAL partnership. That includes viewing that equality from the perspective of your partner as well as your own.  People come together and get married for different reasons and with different agendas. If the book doesn't happen to apply to your particular situation or relationship, that doesn't mean that it is a terrible book 
 We discovered this book almost by accident, and a happy accident it has been.  The title turned up as if by magic as a suggestion when my wife was searching for some totally unrelated titles...the eerie part being that our son's favorite color is yellow!  Obviously he loves the book.  It does a great job showing a child what a wonderful thing an imagination is; it's great for stoking imaginative play.  I heartily recommend it, even for kids who prefer blue, or green, or red, or orange.. 
 I used this book in my senior thesis paper on Plateau Indian Culture and Presbyterian Missions in the 1830-40's.  It did not only help me with understanding impacts of missionary work, but was written in a way that  opened my eyes to deep thoughts of humanity, religion, selfishness and  ethnocentricity. It is an eye-opener and a gift to any scholar's mind!!!   READ IT 
 My father let me borrow his copy of, Gettysburg, last summer.  When I finally got started, I couldn't stop.  Several days before Christmas I was looking for a Civil War book to give him in addition to returning the one I just finished.  I was delighted to discover that the next two volumes were already published.  I could not resist the temptation and started the middle book and once again and could let it go until I had read, Never call Retreat,   As for Christmas, well...., my Dad said he is enjoying, They Met at Gettysburg, By General Edward J. Stakpole.  His birthday is just around the corner.  Then, he will be able to really enjoy, Grant Comes East, and, Never Call Retreat,  	Another minor regret is that I did not follow my Father's advice and buy books thru Amazon.  I could have saved about 50 bucks.    	Additionally, the alternative events in the East might have had a positive impact for the Confederate cause in the West.  If the collaboration of Newt Gingrich and William Forstchen could produce an alternative history to the Western campaign, I would never stop reading. 
 I came across this item by accident while doing my Christmas shopping yesterday. Not only am I sure my 6 year old son will LOVE this...I LOVE IT! LOL! It is really cool. You push the top and it pops open while the wings shoot out. There is flashing lights and sounds. You have to put in any number of codes all beginning with BAT to access the games and activities.  It has a keyboard on it just like a real laptop which I am thrilled with. Now my son can type on his computer instead of mine! LOL! I played with it myself for probably half an hour. Sure there are some things he wont be able to do but it wouldnt be much fun if he already knew how to do it. It is definately something that will be with him for awhile.  The only small complaint I would have is that the screen could be bigger. For the size of the top of the laptop the actual screen that is used is very small. I dont see why they could not have utilized more of the screen and still had room to list the bat codes.  Either way, I am sure any Batman fan would love this, any little boy will love this...and any mother who is looking for a cool, fun, EDUCATIONAL toy will LOVE this!   The best part for me is the lights you can turn on. There is probably 2 or 3 settings for the lights that help you see the screen so much better. That is a great feature as well as the wings which dont really add much except that it will make any young boy think he has something Batman might actually use!   I TOTALLY reccommend this "toy" for anyone with boys ages 5 to 7 or even 8 
 This DVD is incredible! One of the best live DVDs I have ever seen! Deffinetly worth buying, you wont be sorry, even if your not a huge Gorillaz fan, I bet you'll love this DVD!! 
 Almost every song on this album is rated five stars as far as I'm concerned. Great musicians, excellent vocals and harmonies 
 To correct the previous reviewer's post, Dever's position on Israel is not some new "replacement" theology but the historic Christian understanding prior to the invent of 19th century dispensational theology. Dever views God's promises to Israel in light of a covenantal structure rather than a dispensational one. The Old Covenant completely fulfilled in Christ, must now be viewed through His fulfillment and establishment of the New.   The previous poster's claims of a 7 year tribulation and millenial kingdom etc. are not to be found in Dever's book because Dever simply has a different theological lens and eschatological viewpoint than that offered by Dispensationalism.  This should not cause a loss of rating, for it is not the substance of the book, rather, the book should be judged on its faithfulness to the Scriptures 
 I do not read a lot of book but this was a must read as soon as I started it.  John Grisham describes places and people like very few can do.  If you are anything like me the author must capture me in the first few pages or else I find something better to do.  Loved the book and felt it was worth the time it takes me to read 
  On its own terms,  this movie is a winner.  Why is it that totally true to history or not,  actors today cannot be this believable.  The performances are universally convincing. Made in 1985,  why is it that everyone in this movie put their heart into their performance,  and thus I was mesmerized and delighted.   When you shed a tear for these young people caught up in the tragedy of political manipulation,  it will be no more than the tears of these young actors,  so convincing and so deeply rendered.  How I wish I could own twenty films like this one!    
 In PREFAB, author Allison Arieff presents an interesting overview of "prefabricated" buildings, past, present, and future.  Yet, I would not recommend this book to average modular home consumers, as many of the projects described in PREFAB are highly customized, somewhat eccentric, and generally impractical for those looking to save time and money by utilizing prefab construction as opposed to regular, stick-built construction.  Some of the buildings aren't even single-family dwellings, but apartment buildings.  Nonetheless, PREFAB is a helpful resource for those who'd like to learn more about the history of prefabricated buildings, as well as the current state of affairs, and in which unusual directions the industry will be headed in the future.  Arieff begins PREFAB with a lengthy (29-page) discussion of the history of prefabricated homes, starting with panelized wood homes in England and the US in 1624, through the American mobile home boom after WWII, and ending with the current state of the industry.  The next three sections of the book are devoted to various modern prefab projects.  The first, titled "Production," presents "a diverse group of well-designed houses and multi-family dwellings that are either in production, or poised to be."  Of the three groups, "Production" is perhaps most relevant to the average consumer; it illustrates the sheer diversity of prefab homes that are available around the world.  It also reflects how beautiful prefab homes can be, both inside and out.  Next up is "Custom," an eclectic mix of "unique homes by architects less interested in the mass production of houses than in the aesthetic, environmental, and economic benefits of prefabrication."  The buildings in this section are stunning - the Penthouse at Albert Court, which sells for $4 to $5 million, is my favorite.  Finally, "Concept" features the strangest buildings of the bunch.  According the Arieff, the concept buildings represent "a diverse array of virtual and conceptual prefab projects that employ everything from websites to neoprene in order to create the next generation of prefabricated housing."  Experimental to the extreme, these plans seem geared towards architects, artists, and other design/construction professionals.  For the beginner, PREFAB is an interesting and engaging introduction to the history of prefabricated housing.  As my knowledge of construction and architecture is limited, I can't say whether students or professionals will find PREFAB especially enlightening.  I found the author's writing to be crisp and captivating, and I thought there was a good balance of pictures and text.  I would definitely recommend PREFAB to newbies who would like to know more about prefab housing; yet, I would direct those looking for a consumer or how-to guide to go elsewhere.  Overall, an interesting read, but probably not for everyone (for example, I can see how pros might want additional pictures, larger graphics, and more detailed floor/elevation plans, especially given the book's high price tag).    - Kelly Garbat 
 John Dean gives a very perceptive analysis of the "Conservative" political mind.  I especially enjoyed his observation, that conservative Christians can do whatever evil they wish, because they will be forgiven. 
         Some things are well worth waiting for and Edward P. Jonses's follow-up to his Pulitzer Prize winning debut novel "The Known World" (2003) is most assuredly one of them.   Once again he uses short story formats to illuminate and make memorable his characters, ordinary people, really, but to the reader they are unforgettable.  This author's evocation of  black life in America is incomparable.  	The 14 stories that comprise "All Aunt Hagar's Children" are set in   Washington, the city where Jones was raised and now lives.  He opens with "In The Blink of God's Eye," the story of Ruth and Aubrey, a young couple in their late teens and recently married.  Ruth does not always rest well in "godforsaken Washington" while Aubrey "always slept the sleep of a man not long out of boyhood."   One night when Ruth was wakeful she went out in back where she found a baby tied in a bundle hanging from a tree limb.  Thus, she thought Washington was "a city where they hung babies in night trees."  	As is his wont Jones treats readers to the earlier lives of his characters, rendering them all the more accessible and sympathetic.   This is especially true in "Resurrecting Methuselah" in which we meet Anita Channing who sits by the bedside of Bethany,  her ill daughter.  She sits in a wooden chair built a century and a half ago by a former slave.  Anita's husband, Percival,  is serving in Okinawa, where he spends much time with a prostitute, Sara Lee.   When Percival discovers he has breast cancer he calls Anita and asks her to come to him.  She reaches Honolulu, a stopover in her flight, where she has an opportunity to look back on her childhood and wonder what the future holds for herself and her child.  	"All Aunt Hagar's Children" concludes with "Tapestry," another story of a young couple, Anne and George,  marrying and leaving their rural roots behind.   George is a porter on a train, the train that carries them to Washington.  As the train slows close to its destination Anne whispers, Mama, Papa, "I'm a long way from home."  	For this reader that was the gist of all of these marvelous stories, people seeking a better life a long way from home.  	Jones is such an incredibly gifted writer, his prose is succinct, true, impeccably crafted.  Reading his work is not only a pleasure but a privilege as well.       - Gail Cooke     
 Typical hardcore "commin at ya" James Brown & Fred Wesley!  It's got the classic JB's sound and funk beat!  For the record, this cd doesn't have the version of "Down and Out in NY City" that has the vocal at the begining.  Don't let that stop you though.  Not as strong as "Slaughter's Big Rip-off" but excellent!  If you love "blaxploitation" soundtracks or just James Brown, this is essential 
 I think if Charles Bukowski, Dylan Thomas, and Fellini collaborated on a piece of writing, it's possible they would have come up with this screenplay. This movie is exciting because it's soooo different from anything I've ever seen. Deliciously non-linear. The substance abuse aspect is a little overdone but that's the destiny of "artist movies". I loved hearing the dialog, and Kristofferson's acting is the best I've ever seen by him. Anything so daring and so unconventional will naturally upset some people (like other reviewers here), but if you ask me that only validates the work. If ever I go to New York City, the Hotel Chelsea will be at the top of my list of places to visit. My favorite lines were by the crazy guy in the elevator, who after claiming to have had a conversation with Dylan Thomas said that ghosts naturally reside in places like the Chelsea because people will listen to them there. The DVD extras contain a couple of quirky interviews, one with director Ethan Hawke and the other with Robert Sean Leonard who plays a deeply troubled folksinger in the film 
 I was looking for a book like this and I wasn't sure what would work for me. So I headed to Borders and ask a sales girl there to help me look for a book, she looked up the books the store had. This book was one they had there. I took a good look at three books and I really liked this one. I haven't read all the way through it yet but (I just got it today) so far I think it will help with my recovery. So, if you need to go through recovery, I suggest you read this book.. I gave 5 stares because, I think its he best 
 Every time I read "Still I Rise" I start crying.  I can connect because I have encountered prejudice as well.  I think this is a great book 
 I was fascinated by this low-budget effort to portray a story in which the usual innocents are lured into a life of depravity and drug addiction. My Alpha copy was often so scarred and battered and dark that it actually enhanced the ambiance of dreary hopeliness for the main characters. A game cast tries to buoy this effort up despite the low-budget sets and budget. The best scenes are shot at the Dead Rat Bar where we're entertained by two long-gone and forgotten vocalists who were probably on the fringes of Hollywood anyway. Another good sequence is the Opium Den where a drug-crazed sister finds her drug-crazed brother who, like her, has become "a hop-head." The performers do an outstanding job trying to delineate their roles and the passage of nearly 70 years makes you wonder whatever became of them and the making of this film. For instance, how were they chosen to be in the cast, who did their wardrobes, what did they discuss between scenes, what did they do after work? This movie follows the tradition of "Reefer Madness" and "Marijuana", providing us with a glimpse of what our great-grandparents may have watched at the Bijou during those early days of the 30s 
 In depth, though provoking reading for those seeking deep, meaningful reflection. 
 I heard Ashcroft on NPR and just bought the book.  He may be one of the  most criticized men in politics but the book makes clear that doesn't bug him - he's just willing to do what's necessary to protect lives.  BTW, the blue drape - he had nothing to do with it 
 As a non-Muslim, I found the explanations of Islamic views very clear and well delivered.  The quotations from the Qu'ran and Ahadeeth are well selected.  Misconceptions of Islamic views are dealt with by reference to those specific quotations from primary sources, which have ignited those misinterpretations.  I found the book wholely honest and helpful.  No propaganda, just simple, straightforward discussion of gender equity according to the Qu'ran and Ahadeeth.  Included are many examples of cultural views in Muslim lands, which contradict Islamic views.  This differentiation is vital to the reader, who would tend to see current non-Qu'ranic practices, such as that of the Afgan Taliban, as Islamic when it is but a perversion from Islam.  I fully recommend this text for open-minded non-Muslims, who desire a fair treatment on the subject. 
 I been looking for a beat for a while that fits good and this belt fits very good---thank 
 Great movie, good actor's within, a real fun one for us who like the space type movies, worth to be added to your collection 
 Washington's General is a wonderful addition to the literature of this period. The book is a pager turner and is a complete joy to read. It would have been interesting and proper if the author presented Greene's membership in Freemasonry as a means of him having access to many of the revolutionary war leaders. Other than this important omission, this book is worth the price and then some 
 After the Bathina seductive body wash, this is a sexy cream that leaves your skin feeling silky soft without being overly moisturizing.   This cream may be best in the summer months as it is not overly rich once applied. It will work well when you are putting on lighter fabrics like silk or anything where a rich body cream would be a disaster. The secret of this formula seems to be the sesame seed oil and cocoa butter.   There is something powdery soft about this body cream. It has a "whispery don't tell" quality and seems to secretly sink into your skin, leaving only the most delicate hint of sweet cinnamon and faraway ocean breezes.   The Bathina cream is much more seductive than the body wash, although the two work very well together. You may be amazed at how soft this makes your skin and the scent is delicate enough to allow for the layering of your favorite perfume. I'd recommend the Anna Sui "Sui Love" perfume because it seems to have hints of the same whispery floral beauty.   The small "to go" size is probably good for two or three applications. I almost used half the container the first time. I'd go with the larger size even if you are buying the small body wash. I like using the body wash for bubble bath but it would also work well if you are going away for the weekend.   ~The Rebecca Review 
 There's not much to say. This collection of the Suncoast Chronicles is amazing. A great mystery and the excitement doesn't stop at all 
 This is a second-hand review as I haven't actually read the book myself, but I bought for someone who'd just broken up with her fiancee, and she says it helped her a lot.  She found it very funny and it cheered her up, what more could you ask 
 Great short stories! It is a wonderful read for myself, my daughter(8) and my son(4).  Both children enjoy the colorful idioms and the tales 
 This was an extraordinary book. Douglas Egerton does a marvelous job of telling the different lives of Denmark Vesey. The book is extremely well researched and tells the historical truth of Vesey's life. The author does a wonderful job of finding the true story of Denmark Vesey and incorporates  intriging insights into his life. This is a wonderful book that illustrates  what life was like for a dynamic slave who turned free. Egerton tells  Vesey's story in a fascinating way and does a great job of recapturing  Vesey's life. The author tells of how Vesey was a strong-willed, highly  intelligent leader who had an ingenious plot to help slaves and free blacks  to truly become free. The author shows how fascinating Vesey was even  though his plan failed. This is a marvelous book and I highly recomend  reading it!  It is an absolute joy to read 
 I have never picked up a more helpful book. This book helps you get started, ensights your thought process, but more than that it offers helpful hints and more references. I found web sites, writting groups, as well as hepful tips that are easy to understand. Every chapter is writen in plan, every day english that anyone would be able to understand 
 This is an exhibition catalog from the exhibit of the same name at the Metropolitan Musuem of Art in NY. I personally visited the exhibition and while the items were interesting, was underwhelmed by the small room that housed it. I was expecting a bigger display.  Most of the pieces in the exhibit are in the catalog along with others that didn't appear. The text is good and I recommend the catalog to anyone interested in early equestrian military pursuits 
 This is the best new business book I've seen in several years.  The book was a great read.  Every chapter added value.  Instead of repackaging old ideas, Weinzimmer provides guidelines that are well thought-out and supported, but radically innovative.  His discussions of "external framing" and "aligning a company for fast growth" really challenge a lot of faulty assumptions.  The thing that excited me most was his challenge to move from being "market-driven" to being a "market-driver" -- learning to anticipate customer needs and solutions before customers recognize them.  Best of all, this author provides easily understandable principles and down-to-earth suggestions for how to put them into action 
 This book is a good introduction to what happened in guatemala.  I do agree with another reviewer who felt that the author was a bit biased but by reading her story it is easy to understand why.  It would be good to also read some other accounts to get a better overview.  But some of the  first-person accounts were so eye-opening.  There is a great variety of  experiences shared 
 From the first of all of these amazing short stories, Ms. Klass captures the heart of parents everywhere. As a mother, I found myself laughing, crying, worrying and joyous at many moments during the reading of these stories. From childbirth to the death of a child, these stories are full of love and depth. Wonderful 
 This Garden Book has it all. What an array of information on just about anything you have in your yard growing. The writing is easy to understand and the many pictures are very helpful. This is a book every gardener or weekend tinkerer in the yard should have. From landscaping, to lawns to flowers, from trimming, to watering, and I could go on and on but what a great compilation of interesting information about your yard!! Get this book, you will not regret it, believe me 
 This is a thorough book. The basics of the three major eating disorders, anorexia, bulimia and obesity, are examined both individually and as a group, with opening chapters on adolescent eating behaviors and the sexual maturation process. Numerous case history outlines provide surprising insights into the mind of the eating disorder victim. You will not find what you might expect. Any parent with a daughter in sports should get this book. Eating disorders are a subject which parents today cannot study enoug 
 First things first: this is essentially a term paper, or a series of articles strung together. While that's not a bad thing, you shouldn't expect great *writing* here. That said, it's adequately done, and exhaustively researched... which is disturbing because there is no doubt that Bonds, and the rest of these guys cheated. No doubt at all. And they make no apologies for it either, essentially claiming since everyone else was doing it they had to do it too in order to compete (an excuse for bad behavior I hadn't heard since grammar school). Yes, this book takes an especially hard look at Barry Bonds, and for good reason. Inexplicably, yet luckily for him, he was the only one of dozens to not outright admit steroid use in his grand jury testimony, even though the extent of the evidence was essentially the same for all the athletes involved. And although the authors put forth a steady stream of facts, interviews and other hard evidence that Bonds is in fact guilty, we need only the very public "evidence" that at age 36, when every other human on the planet's body begins breaking down, Barry Bonds put on 40 pounds of pure muscle and increased his stats in every area of the game by an incredible margin. After reading this book I firmly believe that he, Palmiero, McGwire, Giambi, Jones, et all should have asterisks by their records. And the argument that "we don't know what Babe Ruth was injecting!" is a weak argument: the other thing this book does well is act as a steroid primer, and the modern drugs and techniques are simply no match for whatever those old timer could get their hands on. So, even thought it will make you mad, and maybe even sad, if you're a fan of baseball, or sports in general, you need to read this book 
 I was remembering this movie a couple of months ago and how much I liked it when it came out so I ordered it. Buyers should beware that even though Benji is one of the main stars, this movie has a little bit of bad language in it, so you might not want children under 11 or 12 to see it. The words are not too terrible, but not suitable for small ears either. Otherwise, it's a great movie 
 This was a good buy; inspirational design--good resource for leading the brainstorming process. Recommended 
 In 1994, Archeologist Gilbert Austin returns home after providing a lecture at the Middlesex Archeological Society.  Before going to sleep he returns the call of three decades old friend Karel Weissman only to learn from his associate's secretary that he committed suicide.  Stunned as they stayed in contact and having no idea what motivated Weismann to take poison, Gilbert is further shocked upon receiving the final working research papers of his colleague.  Weissman had insisted that mind parasites lived by feeding from the minds of human consciousness.  Wanting to ignore what seems absurd; Gilbert soon begins to believe in the Weissman theory as there is obvious proof once you accept the validity of the underlying concept surfaces.  At an archeological dig in Turkey he realizes that humanity is in a war of survival that has been ongoing for several centuries. Humanity just did not know it. Gilbert and a colleague Reich struggle to save humanity but they realize it may be too late to fight back as no weapon of sorts can be found that will not destroy the host.  The tale seems more like a memoir with much of the story line being passive and introspective, yet extremely deep.  Colin Wilson uses the MIND PARASITES as a horror-parable to explore the complex concept that a few can control the many in terms of thoughts.  The WMD fiasco and the subsequent Bushie spins support the author's premise although the book was written before the recent communication revolution that enables a select few to manipulate communication to the many.  Not easy to read, fans of cerebral reflexive science fiction will appreciate the Big Brother horror portrayed by Mr. Wilson's look at the collective consciousness of the masses manipulated by the brazen minority.

 Ever since I saw this film when I was 18, I've been haunted by images from it. While the dialogue does not move as easily as you might hope, I've rarely seen a movie that deals with the complexities of love in a more interesting way. If you enjoy the film version of the Unbearable Lightness of Being, you might enjoy this. Clive Owen, Saskia Reeves and Alan Rickman are all so brooding and intense... I've never seen any of them in a role with more sexual tension. 
 As a VC myself, I found this book to be very inspirational. What struck me as a common theme among the great VCs was that there was a sense of vision and purpose. Sure everyone wanted to make a lot of money but you get the feeling all of these guys cared about creating a frontier and exploring it. With the bursting of the internet bubble I think people need to get back to that. Unfortunately, VCs are too busy raiding distressed companies to really think about creating the next tech frontier. But the next great VC will be the one that follows the instincts laid out in this book. Hopefully it will be me 
 In the third to last chapter of The Periodic Table, the narrator - Levi - goes to his 25th University Anniversary. He meets a colleague of his, one that he did not know too well during university, and they swap stories on chemistry, a passion and an occupation both dear to their hearts and the thorn in their side. Levi informs the man of the latest book he is writing, a small book, one that, he hopes, will convey the quiet satisfaction he derives from chemistry, because it 'did not seem fair to me that the world should know everything about how the doctor, prostitute, sailor, assassin, countess, Ancient Roman, conspirator and Polynesian lives and nothing about how we transformers of matter live.'  That sentence sums up very well the thrust of the novel. Split into chapters named after a different element of the Periodic Table, Levi takes us on a journey through his life, from boyhood to adulthood, the primary preoccupation of which being chemistry. There is a very large section that he glosses over - the trauma he experienced in a Nazi concentration camp - and this is because he has, in his own words, more than adequately dealt with that subject matter previously. No, this book is not an upraised fist at Nazi Germany, but it does not shy away from the topic, either. First and foremost, it is a series of essays on chemistry. Not the grandiose, world-changing chemistry, but the small achievements, the humble failures, the baffling oddities.  First, is Argon. Argon is an inert gas, resistant to change. Just like his family, Levi muses, rapidly jumping back a century and recounting his extended family history from there, with liberal doses of Jewish linguistics and customs thrown in for good measure. Now, acquainted as to the sort of man Levi is, we wander through his college years, each chapter focusing both on his growth as a chemist and a person, but also on the element for which it is named. Interspersed throughout are a few, largely unrelated short stories that deal with a specific element in an interesting way, the story of lead being a particular highlight. These are stories that he composed as a young man, polished and presented in an easily consumed fashion in this, his endstone book.  The second last chapter briefly touches on Levi's World War II experience. Through a 'typical' chemistry story involving Vanadium, he engages in correspondence with a man who is later revealed to have been one of the many German officers in Bruno, where Levi was incarcerated. This story is sad, and for me was the most powerful of the fifteen or so on offer. Levi is frightened at the idea of meeting this man again - not because the German was specifically cruel, but because it brings back a life since over. The German, Dr Muller, is anxious to be forgiven, trying to 'settle his accounts with the past and they didn't tally'. For Muller, this meeting might even the score, for Levi, it could never. This chapter is one of the shortest, but carries with it the full weight of experience, sadness, and forgotten terror.  For the most part, however, the novel is not depressing or bleak. Rather, it shows the small joys allowed to a chemist who truly loves his occupation. Chemistry puzzles are solved, there are adventures involving chicken excrement and lipstick - don't ask - and throughout, there is a sense that chemistry can be fun, can be enjoyable, can be exciting. No, it is enjoyable, fun and exciting, but only for certain people. And for these people - Levi obviously included - it is a passion, a friend, a lover, and he wishes to share this joy with us, the sadly ignorant reader. I thank him for that 
 This album is divine for its storming and pounding. We have strong evidence here Cave is the last great romantic poet. The music focuses on a kinetic and roiling set of rhythms over which Cave sings his dirges. My favorite is "Wings of Flies" which has some pretty darkly humorous imagery ("she loves me, she loves me not!") as well as an adolescent flare 
 We have an Aussie/Healer mix (we think...she was a foundling) with a thick, soft coat. I've had her professionally groomed once a year for about 7 years at $60 to $75 a pop so last summer I decided to try it myself with this clipper kit.  To make a long story short, she didn't turn out so bad! (Well, the neighbors didn't laugh, anyway!) It took me a while to get the hang of it--I finally chucked the various combs and went with the bare clippers--but she didn't complain and I had a "cool" dog for much less $$$ than a pro cut.  The best part was I could keep her trimmed all summer as her heavy coat grew back.  No report as yet how long the blades last, but I'm already money ahead even if I must replace them next year 
 My son loves this cereal!!!  I always had to buy it at a health food store where it is usually almost $5 per box, so when it was on sale I would stock up.  I finally started buying another peanut butter cereal that also did not have gluten ingredients.  He said he didn't like it as well, but I thought he was just imagining the difference.  Well, I decided we would do a blindfolded taste test to prove he couldn't really tell the difference.  He was able to identify the Panda Puffs as his favorite every time no matter how we switched them around!  He has even asked for a case of this cereal for Christmas!  Guess that convinced me that there must be something to this cereal to make him like it so well.    When I received a $50 gift certificate through the Kidzeyes program as a prize, I used it for some gluten free grocery items from Amazon.  I liked the items we tried so much, I started an astore to promote the great tasting gluten free foods that are available at reasonable prices from  Amazon com.  In fact, that's the name of my astore: Great Tasting and Gluten Free. Here is the link: [...]  I have several items listed, including EnviroKidz Panda Puffs, with personal reviews of each.  We have five people in our family eating gluten free and quality is very important to us!  All the items I have on my page are personal favorites.   Now I order gluten free items from Amazon about once a week for my family.  Sure beats going to the health food store over an hour away and paying much more for less selection 
 This is the MOST important book ever authored about the Palestinian "Refugees Problem" written by the famous Israeli historian Benny Morris. It is full of details based on declassified Israeli, Hanagah, and Zionist documents. The book is must read for any person who wants to know the core facts surrounding the plight of the ethnically cleansed Palestinians 
 I have been reading MAKE since the very beginning, and it looks like they finally got it 100% right.  There are many great projects to try out, and a fair amount of history and back story.  If you love technology then check this out.  If you don't think your that smart, and want to try out working on tech, then check it out 
 Becky Bloomwood, now a Barney's personal shopper, has settled down in a West Village home with her soon-to-be husband, Luke Brandon.  Being a busy man, Luke leaves the wedding preperations to Becky.  Somehow in the mix Becky ends up with 2 weddings, and both she can't back out of.  One is being held by her mother, who she loves dearly and wouldn't want to hurt and another is being held by Luke's mother, a complete cow whom Becky doesn't like at all and visa versa.  Suze, her pregnant best friend, urges Becky to cancel Luke's mother's wedding but Becky learns that she could be sued by cancelling it and there is no way she could heartbreak her mother like that.  How will Ms. Bloomwood get out of this one?  This book is great.  Sophie Kinsella never fails to entertain.  Many say that sequels are never as good as the original, but she proves that stereotype wrong.  I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good laugh 
 This product is solid. Easy setup, solid construction, GREAT instructions, and COOL (as in cool to the touch, it's kewl too.)   I've spent too much money trying to find a good enclosure. Every enclosure I found had heat, power, or random / unexplainable connectivity issues. This product has been the best I've come across. I have 2 of these guys hooked up to Firewire, the other 2 hooked to USB. All perform as if they were installed as an internal drive. My only complaint is that the enclosure's light may cause temporary (yet blissful) blindness. Regardless, this is a GREAT product. I now have confidence my HDDs are not at the mercy of their enclosures. 
 I can't believe it took me until my mid-thirties to read this book. What is equally astonishing is the elequence Miss Austin was able to write this book at the young age of 21. Let me first speak to the well-done character development. The author does a great job of creating likeable, interesting characters. You have to love Elizabeth Bennet and her boldness. You must also love: Mr. Bennet's wonderful sense of humor, Mr. Collins' silly behavoir and what a haughty b*tch Mrs. de Bourgh is. Secondly, the author is very crafty in unfolding a plot in which the reader fully understands how their could have been lots of misunderstandings between Miss Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Very well-written and entertaining. Don't wait as long as I did. Read this book 
 My son is little so it may not be good for larger kids starting to potty train. He's about 27 pounds age 21 months.  Get some of those disinfectant wipes and clean it out each time and you're good. (Wear gloves and wash your hands after too.)  Fits in a small space in my small bathroom without an issue 
  The cast and director did their jobs and made an otherwise average story into a very enjoyable and humorous movie.  If you like this one, you should also try the movies (DVD) "Love Actually" and "Miss Congeniality."  HAPPY VIEWING.  
 I found Kirk's work to be an excellant antidote to the Religious Right and Neoconservative nonsense that the media and new intellectuals pass on as "conservatism" today. A good place to take back the Conservative philosophy, a philosophy of tolerance, respect, fairness, and progress, from the extremists bent on Right wing "Christian" tyranny 
 I read this story in Greek Mythology in university.  Jason is some kind of wise man.  His father was a doctor.  The Argonauts are a band of wise men, doctors, shamans, augurers, omen-readers, and shape-changers.  The Argo is  a ship of dreams.  The name Jason has become very popular.  I often ask  fellows named Jason if they know where their own name comes from, and  usually they do not.  Everyone named Jason should read the Argonautica.   Anyone who knows a Jason should give him a copy for a gift 
 I have a closet full of exercise dvds and as I grow older I wanted something more functional in its approach.  I really like this dvd.  I am only in phase one of three but that automatically gives me a goal.  I like the fact that the exercises are not the same old same old.  I highly recommend this dvd to anyone wanting to regain a taut strong core and hates traditional floor work.  
 This is the best book I have read on marketing global biobrands 
 I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but "da Fudge" deliver! This album is nicely engineered, produced and mastered, and the band is SMOKIN'!  One lick to pick: there's a cool drum fill that Carmine has certainly mastered: he plays it in EVERY SONG...well, almost!  Couldn't resist pointing that out...Carmine's cool! 
 Kennedy's "Rise and Fall of the Great Powers" is a classic that should rank with the great books and great ideas of the 20th century. Anyone who wants to understand what has happened in history, and what will most likely happen, should read this book.  Great theories and great books are often so because they state, in a convincing way obvious facts that we want to ignore because they are inconvenient or unflattering. Sigmund Freud's Psychopathology of everyday life and "Interpretation of Dreams" shocked the Victorian world by pointing out that a lot of human behavior is about sex. Darwin's "Origin of Species" and "Descent of Man" was a shocker because it pointed out that we are animals, descended from animals. Karl Marx's contribution, shorn of polemics, was to point out the importance of economics in history and ideology.  Kennedy amasses considerable evidence for the unattractive theory that wars are won by economic might (and not because providence is on the side of the "good guys"), that all empires are mortal, and that empires can kill themselves by economic over-extension.   He correctly predicted the economic problems of the Soviet Union, before it was obvious to all, and he predicted the over extension and deficit spending that would could the lot of the US in the future - and are the lot of the US in Iraq. This is not a popular thesis.   Every historian from Thucydides, and Polybius to Gibbon, Toynbee and Spengler has understood that empires are "mortal." Yet every empire and every citizen of every empire insisted that their empire was the "exception" that could never be challenged and never fail. That is what makes many uncomfortable about this book, but it cannot be ignored.  It is really beside the point to say that it was written nearly two decades ago and is therefore "out of date." "The Origin of  Species" was written nearly 150 years ago and is certainly "out of date" and "mistaken" in many details, but it is absurd to claim it should not be read for that reason. When Kennedy describes the dilemma faced by Spain in maintaining its costly presence in Flanders, he is describing essentially the same problems and considerations that face the USA in deciding whether to continue the war in Iraq.   Even if you think the US is exempt from the laws of history for some reason, you cannot ignore this book.  
 I've read the previous reviews about not being able to use it with this type of stove, but I have had no problems!!  It works great!  I was able to make pancakes, home fries and eggs all at the same time and it was a snap to clean up.  It is a little big to store in my cabinets, but I have a closet right off my kitchen so it gets stored in there 
 I work with Jim O'Shaughnessy and I would just like to clarify Mr. McMahan's comment on the data in the new edition.  The newest edition of What Works on Wall Street does in fact contain updated data through the end of 2003.  The prior editions were through 1994 and 1996, so in addition to new series, monthly analysis and several new chapters there are also seven more years of data.  As a biased observer (I would have omitted my star rating but Amazon won't allow me to post without it) I will refrain from commenting on the other statements appearing here, but should people be interested in judging for themselves please be careful that the edition purchased from Amazon is from May 2005 
 This is a novel of amiable drunks, lovable ne'er-do-wells, eccentric old ladies and one slightly-paralyzed dog.  Russo has a skill for writing likable characters -- even when they're irresponsible and self-destructive -- and after a while you get used to their being around.  When the book ends it feels like losing touch with a bunch of old friends.   I'm not sure Russo's writing is the Great American Novel (or anything close) but it's a pleasant diversion for sure 
 Even though L.M. Montgomery did not intend Anne of Green Gables to be a series, she still captivates with her eager readers in Anne of Avonlea. 	There are still quite a few differences, Anne has grown from a "queer", fiery, young girl to a wiser, calmer, auburn-headed schoolteacher. Yes, a schoolteacher. Also, as we follow Anne in this Bildungsroman literature, the romance between her and Gilbert Blythe peeks through shyness and past misadventures in this novel.  	Some people consider it a book not as interesting as the first, and perhaps this is because Anne is no longer a child and could not grow into a young woman with the same inexperienced attitude.  	Altogether, my opinion of the book is that it was a good follow-up and I sympathize that it would be hard to make up such great a book as Anne of Green Gables. 
 This is an fine set of interviews with engineers who have worked with the legends of rock and roll. Most of the time is spent discussion mic positioning, filtering, and mixes. There is some coverage of analog versus digital, and some amusing anecdotes about the performers. It's a fun read for those looking to glean a bit more sage wisdom from the pros. There are no diagrams, detailed specifications or settings to impart. This is higher level, about the approach of sound design and how one works with tricky personalities 
 Hell on earth is how Kabul is described under the authoritarian Taliban rulers.  Two couples are intertwined in a collective battle for their existence.  It's a profoundly sad story to see a community so helpless under the onslaught of intolerance.    You feel the women under their restrictive burka, you sense the fear of the men that are brutalized and abusive themselves.  In the end there are no answers, it's a disheartening novella to see that this sort of intolerance still exists.  Well written and sad to read 
 This is probably the best film book I've read in the last five years.  The organization of the book is extremely intelligent, the range of authors  is incredible, and their comments are always useful, thought provoking, and fun to read.  Most books that cover a range of films offer only descriptions of individual movies.  Lewis' book, of course, tells us about the important films of the nineties.  But it also explains the practices of the film industry during the period, the important stylistic developments, the conflict and cooperation between independent companies and established studios, shifts in the thinking about censorship, the relationships between video and film, and a whole lot more.  The tone of the writers is fantastic--they're all movie fans, they take movies very seriously, and they connect movies to important cultural and political trends.  This book is a constant pleasure.  If you have any interest in the films of the last decade of the twentieth century, this is the book for you 
 This is not a review but a suggestion as to your procedures in which to list a book. When searches for a work in translation, it is almost impossible to find which translation is used in the particular publication. As you know, the quality and reputation among translations can be very different, and buyers know this and are well moved by the choices to be made. You almost never list the translatoars name. And you often do not even tell us it is a work that is translated, or if translated what the original language is. Consider the Italian novel Kaputt. For The NY Review Books Classics your entry shows no translator and the 'Product Details' lists the Language as English. In similar fashion, the European Classics version shows a translator's name but states the language as English. Is it burdensome to say: 'English translation from the Italian'? A few months ago, when searching for some editions for Russian novels, I was stymied by which did whose translation. If you pride yourself in being an important resource of record for books, you must address these matters and give buyers what they need to know 
      Mutation is a science fiction mystery. It is a well written and thought out plot consisting of a genetic experiment, a child prodigy, murders, and a secret lab. The main character, Victor, has tunnel vision when it comes to his experiments. His lack of thinking ahead gives him a "guilty yet insane" sort of demeanor. He adds the sense that you know the truth, but don't want to; a very convincing character capable of conveying his thoughts without the reader having to read them. VJ is a hard character to read. . VJ, however, is supposed to be hard to predict. It is his basic personality. He has a very dark and secretive life, and is never one that likes to cuddle with his mom. He has no conscience or sense of right or wrong. VJ is the most surrealistic part of the story; being a child prodigy and all. This book has a very surprise ending that would encourage a sequel. I haven't found one yet if there is one. Anyway, this is an overall good book with a lot of red herrings and some dramatic irony. This is a good weekend read for the science fiction or medical mystery fan. 
 As a reader of the original translation by Gia-Fu Feng since publication  in 1974, I can offer that this book is an enlightened, fulfilling and  wholly heartening look at the times and spiritualism both Chuang Tsu and we  live in.  I recommend it highly for those whose spirit looks beyond our  contemporary travails and limited perspective 
 Wow. 11/10. Contextually possibly the greatest rap album of all time. For its time it's beyond description. Music in general builds upon prior releases. People copy people and make it their own. Without A you can't have B. Without B you can't have C. Without C you can't have Q. Not Bone. Bone is the alpha. There was nothing like it before. Ten times more importantly, there has not been & will never be anything like it after. You cannot copy Bone. You cannot build upon Bone. You only sit in awe of Bone. Bone is the inspiration for God. I might never review another album just for emphasis. This album is WOW. God damn. Wow. Seriously. God damn 
 This incredibly beautiful tribute to the legacy of Tom Ford, whose unbelievably sexy designs transformed the struggling fashion houses of Gucci and Yves Saint, is a must-have for any fashionista, photographer, or artist.  The gorgeous design of this book makes it worth every penny!  Ford himself has combined hundreds of his favorite campaign images, red-carpet snaps, editorial pages, personal portraits, and runway photos into a truly stunning compilation.    In addition, Ford includes a lucrative amount of fascinating analyses and summaries of each year along with his inspirations and personal feelings for each year.  Furthermore, the book includes a forward by Anna Wintour, an introduction by Graydon Carter, and an absorbing interview with the man himself by Bridget Foley 
 With the surfeit of publications on eating disorders, particularly anorexia nervosa, from a psychological and biomedical standpoint Helen Gremillion's Feeding Anorexia is both a refreshing and much needed addition to the literature on eating disorders. Through observations of a small adolescent inpatient eating disorder unit in the Western United States Gremillion uses ethnography to deconstruct the many facets of the unit including interactions among the staff, clinicians, patients and their families. Her "outsider" perspective allows for a unique critique of the treatment facility she observed. Gremillion's distinctive approach is a shift from the traditional route of analyzing "patient pathology" she instead focuses on the patient as a player in a complex power structure. She convincingly argues that some treatment programs for anorexia, despite their best efforts, reinforce aspects of anorexia by adding to the societal pressures on young women that are shaped by gender, fitness, self-control, and family dynamics. Gremillion's analysis not only breaks down problematic aspects of mainstream treatment, but also provides a brief introduction to a possible solution narrative therapy. Narrative therapy uses metaphor to establish a rapport between the patient and anorexia, separating the person from the disease. This externalization of anorexia can help individuals discover anorexia's voice and reveal its evil intentions, thus helping sufferers distinguish anorexia's influences from their own will. Examining the individuals relationship with anorexia also allows the client and family to develop a sense of responsibility for the extent to which anorexia influences them and thus a sense of control over it. As both a student and someone who has personally dealt with anorexia I have gained a great deal from reading Feeding Anorexia. I now have a new understanding of the theories and applications of medical anthropology and I have a new perspective on anorexia as a whole. Before reading Feeding Anorexia I accepted the common belief that the poor response among individuals to therapies and treatments for anorexia was due to the nature of the disorder. Now I see a broader picture of both the disorder and the means by which it is treated. In addition I was inspired to learn more about narrative therapy. Feeding Anorexia is sure to be a catalyst for discussion and controversy. It has already made me personally question, critique and analyze my own experience and has caused my thirst to understand eating disorders to increase. As she states, "a critique of psychiatric approaches to anorexia does not imply a disgruntled acceptance of the psychiatric status quo, or mere criticism." Accordingly Feeding Anorexia has caused me to focus my efforts on advocating for new treatment models and awareness 
 I do not have much to say other than this was a great purchase. I got this dvd set on a whim because I really liked the way the packaging looked. I was not that familiar with R&B but I knew enough. After watching all of the episodes I was amazed, this is a great show and I would recommend it for anyone! Plus the packaging is really nice :^) I have season two and plan to begin watching it as soon as I can. Buy this set if you love clever stories and dialogue with wonderfully bad animation. That sounds cheesy but this is fun cheese 
 This book isn't hilarious.  It's just plain old good and funny.  What a group of characters and a story that had me baffled until the very end and I'm really good at figuring these out!  Can't remember when I've had such a fun time with a book.  Mr. Doss' asides about what his characters are thinking are often very revealing about human nature and enough to keep you giggling to yourself.    Good light reading 
 Just to add to other great reviewers' points, this book is perfect for conveying joy in life's many possible activities, even when you don't have someone else to share them with. I counsel lots of folks to whom I loan my  copy - parents of one child who worry their child will be lonely if an  "only", single moms who also welcome reminders that life can be  fun even when you aren't in a relationship, and parents-to-be who worry  their child will feel badly about differences, for ex. if they're adopted  or conceived with the help of a donor [the topic of my book]. This pig  bravely goes on learning even when she's embarrassed or makes mistakes - so  this is a good book for parents and kids 
 The lipoprotein story is a hard one to tell to the public, but Dr. Superko does an extraordinary job. He tells us in plain English just why the national obsession with cholesterol has misguided us, and how the superior insights provided by lipoprotein testing uncovers hidden heart disease risk far more effectively.  He peppers his well-written book with gripping stories of real people who have had life-saving information provided through lipoprotein testing. I've personally met Dr. Superko, and I find his book to be as engaging as he is in real life. If you or a loved one evenly remotely suspect that heart disease could be in your future, Dr. Superko's book is the authoritative resource to turn to.        
 This is book #2 in the In Death Series. Once again Homicide Lt. Eve Dallas is trying to solve another serial murder in New York in the year 2058.  Her new romance with multi billionaire Irishman Roarke is tested when his name is linked with the victims. Roarke and Eve are very complex characters with a lot of issues from their past.  The more you learn the more you love.  This is another excellent book and once you finish it you will want to move on to the next. 
 loved this movie~ rather refreshing to see 4 filmakers work on one film using tim roth as the bellhop who was just fabulous~ chapter 3 certainly threw me off guard :) its a keeper in the collection dark humor comedy 
 Bob Goebel relates his experiences clearly and succinctly, and those  experiences are most interesting to the WWII flying buff. He even makes his  days before combat flying interesting and informative. His narration of  combat flying is thrilling and and suspenseful!! In short, this is a great  book.

 Fascinating treatment of the burgeoning struggle of urban sprawl (now exurban sprawl) vs. planned development in 21st century America.  Another "inconvenient truth, blending the source of the energy crisis, "green" concerns, local food production, and legal armageddon over eminent domain. Lively writing from a former Boston Globe reporter 
 This book's viewpoint is that of a British Jew, and he spends lots of time on British colonial history, and of course on the first World War.  Some of the stuff on the less momentous years was new to me.  There are some errors, e.g., on page 788:  "...a prolonged drought spreading westward from the Pacific Coast..."!  The 1927 account refers to Henry L. Stimson as an ex-Secretary of State, rather than an ex-Secretary of War.  (Stimson did not become Secretary of State till 1929.) FDR is said to have been inaugurated March 3, 1933!  There is limited attention to social trends, literature, and such.  I think a more analytic approach would have been more useful and attention-holding.  Much of the 33 and 1/3 years covered is dismal and sad, but we can't blame Gilbert for that. I feel sure I will read Volume II, I am sure 
 I am an architect and a former student of Roger K. Lewis.  This book was a suggested reading before my first year in studio.  After reading this book and then taking the classes, I can truly say that it tells the truth about the field.  If this book persuades you out of going into architecture, you would definitely not have been happy with it as a profession.  If you are seriously thinking about architecture as a career choice, then buy this book 
 Straightforward advice to organizing your craft space. The book is divided by type of craft: rubberstamping and stenciling, scrapbooking, paper crafting, quilting, stained glass and mosaics, beading, and yarn crafts and needlework. Rooms belonging to guest artists are featured with interesting, but perhaps not unique, storage ideas featured. (The guest artists included Dee Gruening, Anna Corba, Sandi Genovese, Freddy Moran, Susan Pickering Rothamel, Suze Weinberg, and Linda Woodward. Note: no beaders, knitters, crocheters, or needleworkers.)  Ultimately, most of us are probably cross-over crafters and we'll all find something useful in this book about organizing our particular mix of supplies.   Starting with a remedial schedule for organizing your room, quizzes follow. These "personality assessments" suggest style and color for you to use in creating your space. This was the least helpful section.  Styles range from the galvanized steel workshop to pretty shabby chic rooms where supplies are displayed like collections. There is the wild, colorful style of the quilt artist and the sterile wire baskets and butcher block counter look. One room even looked like a store. Gives new meaning to shopping in your own stash!  There were no suggestion for locating the storage or other items used in the rooms.   I am primarily a needleworker, and I was a little disappointed with the suggestions they had for storing needlework supplies (although I suppose we have fewer different types of supplies than scrapbookers, for example). Storing spools of metallic thread in jars may be pretty, it's just downright impractical. There were some other suggestions that I found impractical but others might embrace (like organizing books by color). Most of the "spaces" shown are full craft rooms or studios, but they did feature one or two spaces that are parts of other rooms, in one case part of a bedroom. Something for everyone in this book.  
 I've read this book half a dozen times, and I'll probably read it once or twice again before I die.  Written in the vernacular.  The narrator is Henry Wiggen, a pitcher for the New York Mammoths baseball team sometime in the late 1950s. One of the catchers is dying of Hodkins disease, and nobody knows but Wiggen.  A very funny, very sad story about the way we treat people better when we know they're dying.  Also a wonderful book about basebal 
 I have just recently discoverd Tom Waits. At first impression, he didn't seemed much and I couldn't really understand what the fuss was all about. Almost atonal melodies, guitar screeching, noise coming from all directions, it seemed to me as a definiton of chaos. So I decided to put down Tom Waits's record and try something different. And I did. It was his first album.   Now, that one, that is entirely different story. Altough I hear much influence of Bob Dylan, it's poetic storytelling, almost epic music and feeling of troubled world of individual out there, spoke to much. It was something completely different as Cleese would say. Than I progressed to second album, which was very much alike, and so on, and on until that peculiar thing, that strangeness of Tom Waits crept into my ear, and my mind, and remained there.  I could finaly understand his rasp-voiced mutterings, I could relate myself to characters of his songs, there were the times in which I wanted to kill him for his "music" made my ears bleed.  Why am I saying all of this? Because "Real gone" is one of those albums that you must grow fond of, or you will not be able to hear it properly. You must learn to like it, and than you will be able to discover "what the fuss was all about". If you by any chance, start with this one, you'll probably be repelled right there on the beginning. But as Tom Waits changes himself, so does his music shift itself, and one that listens to it must make changes also.  And as with all things that require acquired taste, once when you pass that line that divides the complete work between fields of pleasure and pain, you will have experience of your lif 
 Simply said, this CD is not coming out of my stereo anytime soon.  I love it to death and can't wait to see the group in concert 
 jon is a master at story-telling. for me, that is one of the best methods to convey important material.  struggling with a product or service that needs more sales? buy this book. there are tons of great ideas worth stealing to market anything and everything!  one of my favorite "go to" books of all time.  -ski 
 I read this book several times as a child. Along with the Oz books and "David and the Phoenix," it was my first introduction to fantasy. In it, a young New England girl wanders through the fog to another village in earlier, Colonial times. On her visits, she makes friends with another little girl in the village. There's a bittersweet feeling when she realizes that where the village once was, now only cellar holes remain. Ghosts, time-travel, and a hint of Brigadoon made this book one that I still remember as an adult. 
 I purchased this as a gift for my husband and he loves it.  Well made with good trim length settings, it's also easy to hold.  Recommended 
 American teacher Carla Tregellas is the last remaining heir to a huge mansion on the cliffs of Cornwall. When she arrives she is confronted by an elderly housekeeper who tells her the tale of one of her ancestors disappearing on a stormy night, apparently taken by a mysterious merman. Carla is the practical type who is not dissuaded by old legends and decides to stay the summer. She becomes entwined with the housekeepers grandson, the local vicar, a young doctor, the lawyer handling the estate, and a myriad of other interesting characters. Carla notices that they all seem very intent on her leaving and she stubbornly refuses to give in. Meanwhile she has dreams and some real horrors in the house. In spite of all that she falls in love with the old estate and plans to stay. That's when the real fireworks start.  This was an excellent mystery keeps you guessing until the amazing conclusion. Great fun to read 
 Astonishing. You have to see it to believe. Just turn off the lights, seat back and have fun. And Amazon delivery is realy great 
 I discovered this style of bra a few years back when I had a frozen shoulder and needed a front-closure bra.  My shoulder has healed, but I have stuck with this bra.  It is one of the most comfortable I've ever worn.  It is difficult to find front-closure bras that have only one clasp and do not have a racer-back or some kind of padding in the cups.  This bra suits my needs perfectly and I hope it is never discontinued.  It is available in black, white or nude.  
 I loved the movie and the picture quality is awesome. Amazon.com does a great job with customer service as well. The item was shipped quickly. If you enjoy mob movies this is one for you. Not a movie for children of any age. Cursing and violence are very big parts of this movie but they do not detract from the story if you are mature enough to handle it. Look into the story of the Bulger brothers in Boston for a reference as to where this story might have gotten it's inspiration. 
 For the past seven years I have worked full time as a historic preservation professional, compiling historic resource surveys, writing nominations for the National Register of Historic Places, and a wide variety of other preservation related projects. I serve on our local historic district commission and have just completed a city-wide survey of Kalamazoo's historic resources. Currently I am also teaching Historic Preservation at Western Michigan University and I was delighted to find Norm Tyler's book. This book is an excellent resource for the beginning preservationist, whether they be a student in a formal academic setting or someone who just likes old buildings. My students find it to be very readable and comprehensive. I am especially pleased to find the variety of real-life examples Tyler presents reflecting the way preservation is practiced and not just idealistic theory. This book was the preferred Christmas gift among preservationists in my area in 2000. I can recommend this book wholeheartedly to anyone interested in preserving our history 
   This 70's collaberation of pop hits is one of many in this series.  This particular one just so happens to have some titles that are really hard to locate by themselves.  You can also impress your friends with your uncanny ability of music knowledge when you rattle off the artist when you hear these songs on the radio.  Bill Whit 
 I read this book recently and was quite compelled by it.  Andrea Dworkin's analysis of the war on women is both powerful and shockingly brutal.  While i do not agree with all her views on different subject matter, i do echo her thoughts on acts of rape and the people who commit those acts.  this book voices her opinions on the different ways that women are raped every day.  I understand the horror that people go through and i truly agree with andrea when she says that women should do whatever possible to fight back.  Truly empowering and thought provoking 
 I very much enjoyed this book. I had intended to read it after I saw the film because I was very intrigued by the Tom Ripley character. I am anxious to read the next few 
 This book is a series of devotionals written by a woman during a daily prayer time with a friend.  As they met to pray each day, the Holy Spirit gave one of them a message and those daily messages make up this book. As God says in His Word, "Where two or three are gathered in My name, I AM there in the midst of them." The ladies wanted no recognition because they wanted God to receive all the praise and honor.  I have been blessed and believe that you will as well.  The major message I have received so far is "Do not fear, all is well!!"  Praise God!! 
 Hi there,      I am writing this review after having used the product for almost 2 months now. From the moment I bought my MacBook, I was looking for a case that would protect my macbook without sacrificing it's look. The very reason many people buy a mac is for it's beautiful design and who in the world would want to spoil that look and how would you actually do that without hurting it by day to day use? Voila! I came across this product. The case is pretty hard plastic and has some nice cuts that gives good grip while holding/carrying the macbook. It covers the macbook completely at the top and at the bottom with openings on the sides for the different ports. There are fin like openings on the bottom case for heat to dissipate. That way you wouldn't have to worry about the macbook overheating.     The only thing bothers me with this product is that once you put it in on your mac, it is difficult to remove it. I sometimes feel that I might damage the egdes when trying to open. This may also be because I am not doing it the right way ;-)  But anyways, I would recommend this product for any macbook lover that wants to protect it from being scratched or damaged.  Lok 
 The last thing in the world I ever feel like reading is a diet book but I picked the Skinny up at my hairdresser's and I couldn't put it down.  Even my lovely but slightly paunchy boyfriend picked up the copy I bought and read a good portion of it in just one sitting.  The magic of this book is its wonderful, funny, but quite persuasive writing.  It puts out a collection of ideas, some of which may be obvious to you (like portion control), that really sinks in more than, at least for me, other health and dietary advice ever has.  I think this is because the book avoids faddish nutritional advice and emphasizes finding real pleasure not in over-consumption but in the joyful appreciation of the food that we love, while learning to really listen to and take care of our bodies in a sane and balanced way.  As a New Yorker without a clue how to feed myself or stock my fridge, I found the section on how to stock my fridge and recipes for how to feed myself (for breakfast, lunch, dinner AND snacktime!!) extremely useful. There are no illusions spun here, just great advice based on common sense, good health science, and a real love for food.  And it's a fun read!! 
 This book changed my life!  As a personal trainer just starting out, I only had a few clients.  As my clientele grew I began to get in over my head.  The Personal Trainer Business Handbook by Ed Gaut helped me get a real business going!  Step by step, the author taught me everything I needed to do to keep my business in line.  The forms included in the book really helped me get a great idea of what I needed from my clients.  Now, I have a large business in which I manage trainers that work for me!  This is the best book I ever read!  Thank you Ed 
 I ordered this crib for my daughter who will arrive on or before March 30, 2007. We received this crib one week before the actual delivery date, so that was a nice surprise! My husband and I put the crib up with no problems at all! The wood is not the best quality, but what do you expect, you paid $180 for it! The finish is nice and makes it look like an expensive crib. There was only one scratch mark and it was on the back of the crib, so it really was not a big deal! Overall, we are extremely pleased with this crib and cannot wait for the arrival of our daughter 
 Really interesting book This man had a good eye and an outstanding knowledge of horses. This book covers the care, training and ridding in a way that is just as accurate now as it was a couple thousand years ago. One  must remember that these guys depended on their horses in order to do  battle and to travel, in other words to survive. It must also be remembered  that these ridders were not using sturrips as they had not been invented as  yet. Great book at any price - but really hard to find - a real good look  into practical horsemanship that hasen't changed much in 2,000 years -  maybe we have changed but the horse hasen' 
 An awe inspiring book that takes you out of your ego and into your true spritual self.  A road map for living and being alive through grace and service.  I highly recommend it 
 `Notes From The Underground' is a formidable work of philosophy and of psychology, not to mention its worth as a novel. In the space of around one hundred pages, Dostoyevsky manages to expound theories on reason, alienation, suffering, and human inaction. The book's importance and influence on generations of writers cannot be over-emphasised; Sartre and Camus are only two examples of people who have been directly influenced by this book.  The book is presented in two parts. Part one `Underground' is written in the form of the nameless narrator's rambling thoughts on reason and his claim that throughout history, human actions have been anything but influenced by reason. Underground Man's charge is that man values most the freedom to choose to act in opposition to reason's dictates. Dostoyevsky's critique of reason then, although it demands attention and is somewhat difficult to follow, sets the philosophical foundations for the rest of the book.  Part two `A Propos of the Wet Snow' is much easier to read, as the narrator recounts three episodes which happened when he was fifteen years younger and working as a civil servant in St. Petersburg. The first considers an incident in which an army officer insults him and goes on to detail Underground Man's subsequent internal anguish at his inability to commit an act of retribution. The second episode takes place at a farewell dinner for an acquaintance named Zverkov. The narrator is utterly disgusted with the company in which he finds himself but despite this, he is unable - even though he desires it - to make them realise this. The third episode details Underground Man's brief, painful and emotional relationship with a prostitute.  Dostoyevsky is refreshing in this book thanks not only to his incredibly powerful prose, but also for the intense but subtle way in which the stories reflect and indeed embody his philosophical theories. This dark and pessimistic portrayal of the nature of man may not sit very comfortably with many readers, however the ideas expressed in `Notes From The Underground' are as relevant and worthy of deliberation now as I am sure they were in 1864. 
 As a long time Steven King fan, I do not understand how I missed reading this series of books.  They are certainly one of his most involved and rivoting creations.  I highly recommend putting the time into them.  
 I bought this on a whim...and loved it. the characters are spot on, and the plot is interesting. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good read and a good buffy 
 The music score for Gone With the Wind is unsurpassed. Steiner's use of dramatic notes and love themes make up a great soundtrack. The Tara theme, Scarlett's theme and the Finale are symphonic. It's like hearing a great  overture for an equally great film. IF you liked Gone With The Wind the  movie the music is a vintage 
 Annette Simmons says that "My personal story is to learn, share everything I've learned, and earn the right to learn some more." I love this statement. For me, it captures the essence of what learning and teaching are all about. Annette Simmons doesn't disappoint when she promises to share everything she has learned about using story to influence others 
 We use this to serve ice water at meals.  It is so beautiful.  It holds a full 2 qts.  Not much else to say about it.  It is a water pitcher after all.  It is a pretty piece that just looks great on the table. We have two, one for each end of the table 
 this edition was larger and nicer in quality than i expected.  definitely one for the permanent collection.  perfect as a gift for a friend's new baby named "harold" (i know, go figure).    
 What's not to like on this album? Included are one-hit-wonders, underground classics and a song that proclaims the joys of (*ahem*) touching ones self. A great mix of music that any fan of the early 90's can relate to. Don't be surprised if you discover a gem or two that you never heard of before, but after listening to you can't live without. There's not one loser in this bunch of hits 
 I searched locally at Circuit City, Radio Shack and Target for a similar product and found Amazon to be a better deal for a brand name product that performs flawlessly 
 This is a great book on both theories of free speech and the related legal issues that surround this topic. It is a real eye-opener for students 
 Publisher and Amazon, ect., should list the cover artist as well, if it is different from interiors. Many reasons for this... Public can find the specific book they are looking for, and equal time is given to each artist. (instead of leaving the cover artist out altogether-which, unfortunately has been done since paperbacks were invented. I know, because I am a children's book cover artist. We get neither money or fame, but our work helps sell the book....It is criminal if someone else gets all the credit 
 You can be either a casual or even a non-fan of professional basketball and still enjoy Bill Reynolds's book on Bob Cousy.  He will take you back to a time in the late 1940's and early 1950's when professional basketball was merely a filler sport between football and baseball.  I feel the book is really two stories told in one book, the life of Bob Cousy and the role he played in professional basketball's beginnings and also the birth of the struggling NBA when they played in minor league cities such as Syracuse, New York, and Fort Wayne, Indiana.  It is also the story of early NBA superstars from other teams such as George Mikan of the Minneapolis Lakers, Bob Pettit of the St. Louis Hawks, and Oscar Robertson of the Cincinnati Royals.  Cousy also tells of his childhood insecurities while growing up in New York City, his decision to attend Holy Cross College in Worcester, Massachusetts, after playing only one and one half years of high school basketball, and how he became a Boston Celtic when coach Arnold "Red" Auerbach preferred to have two other players which were chosen in a dispersal draft.  The Celtics weren't able to become the NBA champs  until they added Bill Russell, a big man to play center.  How the Celtics managed to draft Russell with the third pick is an interesting story in itself.  NBA fan or not!  Boston Celtic fan or not!  You will enjoy this book. 
 The DVD is great. Lots of Subtitle options not to mention the fact that the Movie is just simply amazing with a great Cast 
 I don't know why in the world I ever bought this CD.  I was young, stupid, and I needed the money.  Wait, that's why I did something else.  Never mind.  Anyway, I admit I used to like this CD.  A lot.  I was in high school and I didn't know better.  Well, I guess I shouldn't be so hard on these guys.  There's not much of anything out there that can survive 15 years.  For example, I'm sure if I saw the way I dressed 15 years ago I would award myself no stars.  So in the spirit of fairness, I'll give Pocket Full of Kryptonite the rating I would have given it in 1991: Five Freakin' Stars, man!  Rock on, Spin Docs 
 This CD is Awesome, a must buy. If ur like me u may be unwilling to risk it on bands u havnt heard before. Take my word take a chance. The CD rocks. Their Style and lyric make this cd amazing. 
 A beautiful book, not to instruct one in hatha yoga but to inspire the path of the yogi with shared words and beauty 
 Greek History at its best. The author hit the jackpot with this book.I usually hate history books, but this one is very interesting. Rich Kurban and Harry Grivakis would love it. Even the great historian Brent Clef would  enjoy it.Nothing compares to Homer's Odyssy or Illiad, except maybe The  Snake, by Them Fakanegaz 
 This CD is amazing! EVERY song on it is fantastic! I am soo happy I bought this CD. I recommend it to anyone who likes air supply or has never listened to them before. 5 stars!!! : 
 With so many wondrous works, it is tempting to take Walcott's poetic virtuosity for granted. Of them all, this is my favorite, and this one features his virtuosity at its most shining. His effortlessly rhyming couplets sing themes of painting and poetry, biography and myth, existential pain and release,geography and spirit. And Pissarro the painter is duly celebrated.   
 I teach etiquette.  In one of my courses I teach those who wish to be etiquette teachers.  Even though I write etiquette articles and booklets myself, I give this book to everyone of my teachers--it is that good.  I only disagree with her views on gift giving, which isn't an overwhelming negative considering that the book is 896 pages and gift giving is a small element.   
 Reading both this book and the Vault Guide to the Case Interview are essential to doing well in case interviews from my experience.  It is worth the extra time to prepare

 This amazing books gives readers the ability to scrutinize literary texts from a feminist perspective.  Cixous clearly lays out her arguments and offers a unique perspective on the struggle of woman and how she is seen by the rest of the world.  This book is a must for any Women's Studies or English major 
 A friend highly recommended this book and I would do the same to you. You will gain valuable insights into the complex, evolving world of tweens and begin to understand the way they interpret the world around them. A real must have for the library of any marketer, designer or brand manager. 
 this is a classic that can be read over and over. well worth finding a copy for your library. it illustrates perseverence, will to live, and above all...compassion of spiri 
 This is a great book because it covers multiple Unix platforms: Solaris, HP, Linux, etc. If you only looking for one book to learn Unix - this is the way to go 
      Sandford takes a clear path between the often too visited extremes on McCartney.  He writes a clear and engaging book that comes across as honest and insightful.  I don't know what predisposition the other reviewers had, this is the best book on Paul to date.  Most books on the Beatles clearly bear the authors personal feelings.        The book is not a linear history or a simple American gloss of Paul's life.  The "smarts" of this book come in how the material and style both support a better understanding of Paul.  This is unfortunate for some reviewers.  The book is clearly much greater than the sum of it's chapters.  A great read 
 This book helps reassure you that there is a happy life possible after a divorce and that the mood swings and crazy feelings are normal. I have given this book to several of my friends, as well as using it myself 
 I am an artist and painting teacher working in oils, which I love.  But, increasingly, I have students who want to paint in acrylics.  There aren't that many books out there on the subject, but this clearly explains how to paint in acrylics and achieve the fine art look of oils.  It goes beyond, and shows what acrylics can do that oils can't.  So, now rather than think there are two mediums, watercolor and oil with acrylics somewhere far below - I now see acrylics as a third medium with it's own advantages and possibilities.  This book covers all of the basics that a good book or teacher covers ... color, temperature, value, edges and design.  "Capturing Light in Acrylics" should be on every acyrlic painter's shelf ... and maybe the oil painter's and watercolorist's, too 
 This book delightfully serves its purpose as a companion by offering a complete, detailed,  and engaging look at a variety of aspects dealing with this genre called the medieval romance. Usefully organized in a roughly chronological order, beginning with the romance's origins in France and its relations to other types of literature, the included essays--all by top scholars in their fields of study--closely examine the material aspects of the romance tradition (manuscripts and the like) as well as the broader thematic issues that emerge, including treatments of the supernatural and of women. Part Three deals with the romance tradition as it developed throughout western Europe and went on to inspire later prose works, most importantly the Don Quixote of Cervantes. Footnotes are usefully included at the ends of chapters (rather than the end of the book, which reduces page-flipping) and include suggestions for further reading. A lengthy bibliography at the back leads curious readers to further editions and criticism, and the index is very complete. The Cambridge companions are of a universal high quality, but this one in particular shows a coherency of style and clarity that the non-specialist can greatly appreciate. This is a book I keep within handy reaching-distance of my desk 
 Again, Jodi Picoult is excellent. You are truly able to engolf yourself in the characters and thier emotions 
 I love this book. Working as a data analyst in the CRM department, this book teaches me all the practical caculation/ideas for my work.  So far, this is the only book on the market that view database marketing from a quantitative point of view. On the other hand, it also instills the relationship marketing mind-set to the readers. For the rest of books avaliable in the markertplace on CRM/Database marketing, either it's too theoretical or IT. This is the best I read so far 
 I am so sick of all the fragrances out there that smell like chocolate, pie or cake. Why people want to smell like food puzzles me. That's why I was so glad to find a feminine floral scent with a little tease to it. Maybe Baby is delightful, not too heavy but making its presence known. The complements will flow. It's sweet (not too sweet though) and innocent while at the same time being flirty. If I had to pick a season it reminds me of it would be Spring. I can't describe a frangrance anymore than I can describe a wine but with all the stinkers out there I just had to put in a good word for this very wearable scent. 
 **** This is the story of a woman's recovery from the death of her husband, her soulmate, with whom she had a wonderful marriage. It is honest, compelling, and even though it deals with a serious subject, entertaining. Elizabeth Berg's writing style is lyrical and beautiful.  The main character, Betta, who is only around 50 years old, learns to build a new life for herself in unexpected ways. Even if you are not dealing with grief, or if the subject scares you off, this book is worth the read, because Betta's grief is presented in a human way that everyone can relate to. The simple things, ordinary people, and everyday life activities she takes comfort in are common to all of our lives.  It is a fairly short book (just over 200 pages), easily read in an evening. **** 
 Caution!! Avoid listening to the critics of dating. They can't pick up beautiful women and hope that you can't. You can go to Moscow, Russia where it is perfectly customary to meet and pick up beautiful women while their walking down the street. If your molded into the man that this book will turn you into. Then you can find, meet and date beautiful women anywhere,anyplace in the world. A word to the wise is to march to the beat of your own drum and not listen to the critics of doom. 
 Wow! This book is an eye opener. I'm saying this because most of us have never heard about the teachings in this book, although probably our grand-grandparents still knew it. The modern society and lifestyle made us neglect the laws of the Nature when taking care of our own body, to our own peril. Unfortunately, these days not even the doctors are aware of the importance of bowel care, even though until the 40's- 50's this was a well known fact. Probably after that the discovery of modern "cures" - such as antibiotics - and the growing power of pharmaceutical companies pushed these away from the medical agenda. Dr, Jensen provides insights of the studies from the end of 19th century and beginning of the 20th century. At that time, it was a well known fact - in the medical community and probably elsewhere - that toxemia is the root of most diseases. As a matter of fact, Dr. Jensen says "The name of a disease is given depending on where the toxins are located". Most of the toxins enter our body through the digestive tract, together with our food and drinks. Then, if we have a poor diet, we have toxic wastes. If we don't eat healthy, the bowel transit time slows down, and the wastes, instead of being eliminated, stay there, putrefy further, and become a breeding ground for bad bacterias and other parasites. After a while, the body cannot stand it any more, and the toxins and parasites enter the bloodstream, and settle in inherent weak parts. Sir W. Arbuthnot Lane, physician to the British Royal Family in the late nineteenth century and dawn of twentieth century was a master surgeon, and noticed in multiple occasions that operating the bowel cleared diseases located elsewhere in the body body. In his final 25 years of his life, he switched from practicing medicine to teaching nutrition and bowel care. This is only one example of what was well known in the 20's. BTW, did you know that the word "doctor" comes from Latin "docere", which means "to teach"? Unfortunately, this is not the case any more - doctors today are focused of treating instead of teaching patients to prevent diseases. I guess it makes much more sense financially. Says Dr. Jensen, bowel is the king. It is the most important organ to care for. The bowel has very few nervous receptors - otherwise you would feel digestion and bowel moving food almost all day long. So, if you can feel you have a bowel problem, you can be dead sure that there is a serious problem! Dr. Jensen provides some anatomy lessons about the digestive tract, about possible problems (constipation, diveticulitis, etc.), and the importance of chemical balance in the body - sodium (the carrier of many nutrients), potassium (muscle building), calcium (bones, teeth) - and how they are used by the body to neutralize some bad foods we are eating. But, after a while, the body exhausts the resources and disease starts to settle. The only way to get those is to eat healthy foods - processed as little as possible, preferably raw. For example, the body makes little use of table salt - it is inorganic and it is thrown away if you go over even a small quantity. Instead, the body needs organic salt - that is - the sodium which is part of the plants and animal tissues - that one can be easily assimilated. In a later chapter, Dr. Jensen explains his biggest discovery: he learn why the bowel is so important, and why parts of the bowel are associated with specific organs. That way, he was able to explain what he had learned from his teachers and he had observed on  his own pacients. Basically, he studied the development of the human embryo, and learned that the bowel appears very early, and that specific organs develop from tissue which was initially bowel wall! The book continues with presenting his "Ultimate Tissue Cleansing Program" - which is something you must consider very seriously. Then, he presents a 7 weeks (tissue) building and replacement program, to be used right after the cleansing program. He even presents menu suggestions for breakfast, lunch and dinner. BTW, the modern toilet is not good at all for our health, instead, the "natural" position - still used by most of the world - helps most with bowel care. Dr. Jensen presents six nutritional sins of the modern civilization and nine dietary laws to follow. For example, did you know pasteurized milk is very bad four your health, let alone ultra-pasteurized? Homogenized milk is even less healthy ! There were experiments and hidden - now pushed away by affected companies - that show the milk is only good raw! To quote Dr. Jensen, "In other words, pasteurization is a way of letting farms get by with reduced standards of cleanliness". The author presents us his Health and Harmony Food Regimen - which is a balanced diet to be used on a continuous basis, and is really very balanced and healthy. Not least, the book ends with amazing pictures showing the incredible eliminations from his patients' bowels - some of the feet-long and rubber-hard, and how diseases (ulcerations, arthritis, psoriasis) treated by following his program  Buy this book and practice from it, you'll thank yourself for the years to come 
 The Books arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. Thanks for being so prompted. 
 Having been involved in the world of real estate high-finance for nearly two decades, I was intrigued by what Mr. Bergsman might have to say on the subject. Turns out, his take on financing methods and personalities in the industry was right on target. -- I should know, as I worked with some of them. It's a fascinating industry, and the author has made a fascinating read out of it. A must read for anyone in real estate finance and to understand the barons of the industry.

 Not many writers are able to at his/her early twenties to have such a exquisite view of the world and complex subjects as Carson McCullers displays in her beautiful "The Heart is a Lonely Hunter". Maybe the fact that she was a sort of precocious genius she wrote the book helped her to sharp her senses to create a world apart inhabited by ordinary people, just trying to live their ordinary lives.   Her condition of being young also influenced her in the novel. As most young people, she didn't have many life experiences yet; therefore much of her inspiration comes from her own life and the people she knew. Her father was a jeweler, like Mick's father. She also studied piano -- and this is one of Mick's dreams. Moreover, Mick's coming of age has a lot in common with Carson's. She started working on this book when she was at the university and her idea was to make a novel about five isolated people, in which the narrative's structure would be inspired by a fugue (a musical composition featuring several repeating themes).  In the first part, she introduces the characters, the settings and the main thematic, which deals with of "man's revolt against his own inner isolation and his urge to express himself as fully as possible". Her main man in this case is the deaf-mute John Singer. The second part is the failure of each character, due to his options (and lack of them) and free will. The third part shows the faith of each character, and what they made of their lives after they met Singer.  Unquestionably the main theme is the isolation and the alienation of the human being. Each character -- even the supporting ones -- tries to break out their condition. The isolation is the result of the combination of personal and environmental factors. In this process, Singer -- who has the most difficult to communicate -- plays a key role to help each of the four main characters to find their own voice. He represents the hope throughout the whole narrative.  Carson has a hand to deal with the lost dream. Everyone in this novel cannot fulfill his/her dreams. The girl Mick, for instance, is too smart for her family, for her town; therefore she has to suffocate her talents and become an ordinary person. But, in her mind, she can keep the flame of her dream of becoming a musician alive.  Carson deals beautiful with language and character development. From the beginning one can notice that this is a writers who dominates her tool -- and not the other way round. Every character has his/her own motivations and these people change throughout the narrative. Because of it, "The heart is a lonely hunter" is a complex slice of life. More than a book, this novel X-rays ordinary lives and expose them, bringing us a little bit of hope to diminish our own sadness.  
 As one who practices in the mystic tradition of dzogchen, I greatly appreciate the insight and effort of Teasdale to articulate a universal perspective of spirituality. I share his approach to integrating core understandings of the great traditions and his desire to transcend (though not eliminate) differences. Far from "tedious," as one reviewer saw it, I thought that it was well written and easy to follow. Two reviewers criticized the book for failing to articulate each of the various traditions' or mystics' perspectives. They are correct. It does not. Yet that is not his purpose. There are other sources if that is what one is seeking. Rather, he is illustrating the interspirituality found in these diverse mystical traditions. Granted that his perspective is colored by his own Catholic tradition, but he is clearly open to and appreciative of what other traditions bring to the table. I thoroughly enjoyed the the book, one of the best I have read outside of those in my own tradition (my own bias showing here <grin>), and I highly recommend it 
 This obviously is not Bogart's most famous or memorable film, but it is an entertaining film noir that holds your interest from start to finish. They don't make 'em like this no more. The plot involves Bogart as a D.A., whose  star witness in bringing the head of a murder racket to justice dies before  the trial. In a lengthy flashback, Bogart retraces the case from the  beginning, looking for some bit of testimony that might help him nail the  killer before he goes scot free. Bogart is good as his usual tough-guy  self, and it's fun to watch the erie black-and-white cinematography. While  it's nothing to write home about, it is a good cheap thriller, much better  than many of the big-budget ones that have come out since then 
 This is the best book on child development I have ever read.  Dr. Hymes was my college professor and his understanding of children's needs at different stages is amazing.  We raised our 2 sons with his insight and  have personally proven these principles to be highly successful.  Dr. Hymes  helped me to understand the very critical stages in a young child's  development.  He fully explains in a clear and entertaining way, the  child's need for security, autonomy, and inititive and what obstacles stand  in the way of achieving these.  This book is the very best and I recommend  it to every new parent 
 AWESOME, A REALLY AWESOME FILM, MARTIN LANDAU IS FANTASIC , BUT SO MANY OVERLOOKED PERFORMANCES BY DEPP, PATRICIA ARQUETTE, BILL MURRAY, AND SARAH JESSICA PARKER. WHAT AN OFF-BEAT APPROACH OF MAKING A BIO PIC ABOUT SOMEONE, ESPECIALLY ABOUT AN ECCENTRIC LIKE ED WOOD, A B MOVIE DIRECTOR WHO LOVES WOMENS CLOTHING , THE GREAT THING ABOUT THE PICTURE IS THAT, THE MOVIE DOESNT BASE UPON THAT SPECIFIC FLAW, IF NOT, A FLAWLESS APPROACH TO  HiS RELATIONSHIPS AND HIS CORNY WAY OF DIRECTING, HE THOUGHT HE WAS GENUIS AND WAS TERRIBLE AT IT. A COMPLETE OPTIMISTIC 
 And now a word from David Lynch, as spoken by Dean Stockwell as Doctor Yueh in DUNE: "The tooth. The tooooootttttttth. Remember the tooth."  Seriously, my daughter loves Dora the Explorer and my goals are to get her to brush her teeth for longer than two minutes.  I bought this Dora the Explorer battery powered electric toothbrush, and she does.  Game. Set. Match.  Best money I ever spent on simultaneous child and parent satisfaction.  When I tested this model on my finger, I was surprised at how powerful it was for a child-sized unit. This electric toothbrush decidedly will not rip her little gums off her skull, but the teeth definitely get a good scrubbing.  Battery life is okay, I estimate it costs about ½ a cent for her to brush her teeth each time. The future value of that expenditure is far lower than the dental bills I'd otherwise have, so this is a money saving unit.  If your child in a member of the Dora cultus, this is one of the better items to own 
 These are all short stories, some very short; that's what he wrote. I remember reading a number of these (the science fiction ones mostly) in translation years ago. Rereading them now in the context of all his other work was really very interesting. As a collection of all his fictions, some of the items are a bit repetitive; the variations on the "knife fight" theme for instance. But the range of his imagination is fascinating, particularly in his thoughts about reality vs imagination and layers of reality and identity: a lot of it presages the information-based world of today, which sometimes seems to have left hard reality behind.  Perhaps the link to the internet is one reason Borges seems to have a bit of a following these days among technophiles. Is not the web exactly Borges' "Book of Sand" - a place that absorbs us with fascinating and unique pages of information, but when we turn to find them again, we never can? And how long will it be before an imagined "Orbis Tertius" engulfs entities such as the wikipedia we think we can rely on (one might suggest it's already happened - look up Tatooine, for instance...) What exactly is information when it's just a bunch of ones and zeros - everything's already been written in the "Library of Babel" after all!  The other fascinating thread to me was the influence of Arabic and Muslim themes; I'd never caught that before, but this collection includes a number of stories with an Arab perspective. Perhaps this is a well-known part of Spanish heritage; in any case, it was certainly interesting getting to know Borges through this collection, from the knife fights to the Arabian courts to the Immortals - not everything was great, but enough great stuff to be really worth spending some time with 
 I was first introduced to D.H. Lawrence in a Brit Lit class when I was in college.  We read SONS AND LOVERS, and I was totally blown away by Lawrence's verdant prose and by the novel's brutal, uncomfortable beauty.  My professor mentioned LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER frequently while we were studying Lawrence, and since then I've wanted to read this later, more well-known, more controversial work.  Finally, two years after that class, I got around to it.  LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER tells the story of a young woman named Constance Reid, who marries Sir Clifford Chatterley when he's home on leave for a month from the battlefields of World War I.  After a month of honeymooning, Clifford must return to the war; and sadly, when he returns six months later, he comes home "more or less in bits," paralyzed from the waist down. The newlyweds settle at Clifford's family home, Wragby, near the industrialized town of Tevershall.  Although Clifford cannot please Constance sexually, he and his wife are intellectually connected; they make love with words, and at first this is enough for Constance.  However, a brief affair with one of Clifford's colleagues makes Connie aware of her more carnal needs, of her desire for physical pleasure.  Enter Oliver Mellors, the Chatterleys' groundskeeper who lives a life of solitude in a secluded wooded cabin.  In Mellors, Connie is awakened to a higher consciousness, to the power of sexual pleasure and mutual satisfaction.  Her relationship with Mellors helps her emerge from her cocoon of prudishness to become a highly sexualized being.  The affair continues under Clifford's nose, and he is either too inattentive to notice or just pretends not to.  As a baronet, Clifford is in a position of power, but he finds himself completely powerless.  The mines of Tevershall, which he controls, are dying; and not only is his industry dead, so is his sexuality.  He, and his business, are impotent.  What makes him so interesting is the almost tender way in which Lawrence portrays him.  The scene in which he tries desperately to force his wheelchair's dying motor to roll uphill while Connie and Mellors look on is particularly heartbreaking.  Clifford is vain, and he has no use for sex or other things of a physical nature, but he also knows that the only way he can produce an heir is if Connie has sex with another man and allows Clifford to claim the child as his own.  His lack of power, and his reaction to the knowledge of it, make him compelling.  Unlike Clifford, Connie's other love interest, Oliver Mellors, is confident and unashamed and almost pagan in his celebration of physicality. He's a surprisingly endearing character, a common man with some very intelligent things to say, who isn't intimidated by class boundaries, who doesn't chastise himself for ravishing a married woman.  Constance Chatterley is a woman awakening to her sexual self, and Lawrence chronicles her metamorphosis in explicit, sensitive detail.  It's suprising how well Lawrence was able to write from a woman's perspective.  However, Connie's perception of her ideal relationship near the end of the novel probably didn't quite ring true for many female readers of the time (at least, not that they would admit):  "Complete intimacy!  She supposed that meant revealing everything concerning yourself to the other person, and his revealing everything concerning himself.  But that was a bore.  All that weary self-consciousness between a man and a woman!  a disease!"  It's observations like this that made LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER so controversial.  LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER has probably remained so popular for 80 years because of its sexual content, which was undoubtedly completely immoral for the time period in which is was written.  But of course the content is not anything too shocking in today's world of pay-per-view pornography and busty women on the covers of erotic fiction sold in supermarkets everywhere.  However, this book shouldn't be bunched into that category, by today's standards or any other age's; I would like to think LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER is still popular today because of Lawrence's incredibly brave writing.  Lawrence expounds on many controversial ideas in this, his last major novel before his death in 1930.  The novel is rife with criticism of post-WWI England and the failures of industrialization to support a growing economy.  Lawrence believes sensuality should be the means of connecting with environment, not through the workings of iron and gritty coal.  In LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER, industry is impotent; but men and women are sexually alive.  My only issue with the novel is that some of the sex scenes are absolutely ridiculous, and read like Lawrence was writing them merely for the shock factor.  His language is often unnecessarily crude, and the whole "John Thomas" and "Lady Jane" thing is just silly.  However, this ridiculousness is balanced nicely with some beautiful, sensual descriptions:  Connie's first orgasm, the use of twined flowers to symbolize purity in love, the beautiful language Mellors uses in his letter to Connie at the end of the novel:  "I love the chastity now that it flows between us.  It is like fresh water and rain...like a river of cool water in my soul."    It's undeniable that Lawrence's prose is absolutely intoxicating and exciting, and he proves it again and again in the pages of this novel, written even as his life was ending.  And that's what makes LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER memorable: not the sex, but the words used to describe the sex.  LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER is an intimate look at love and sex, a novel whose popularity has remained for 80 years--and probably will remain far into the future, and rightfully so

 Since I did not read Three Junes previously, I had no sense of let down that other readers seemed to have. I feel privileged to realize that when I pick up Three Junes I will probably think it is even better if half the criticism here is true. But as a first time Glass reader, I was really impressed. I love her writing style and I did not have a problem with storyline breaks and sections that went back and forth from past to present. If anything it made it more interesting. I do agree that I was actually not sympathetic to the two main characters, Greenie and Alan. I found the secondary characters much more appealing and enjoyable.   When I picked up the book, I did not realize that it dealt with 9/11, which I scrupulously avoid as a general rule. I was shocked to find myself reading about it, however, I do think she did a fantastic job portraying the event and the aftermath of New Yorkers as well as the rest of the country. Of the three storylines in the book, I was disappointed in the way Saga's storyline was wrapped up. It felt like the conclusion was an afterthought and I was dissatisfied by how she ended it. For that reason alone, I couldn't give it 5 stars. However, I am glad to have found a new author to add to my list of must reads. This was a very good book 
 Funnier and more entertaining than you ever thought reading a play could be, and absolutely more relevant now than ever, The Importance of Being Earnest is Oscar Wilde at his best. Thankfully short ( you can read it in an hour or so ) and filled with brilliant, biting humor. 
 Superb.  Dr. Marc Siegel's book "Bird Flu" portrays a concise, realistic and informative outlook on a media bred epidemic: fear and anxiety.  Certainly an epidemic from bird flu is possible, I know of no one who disagrees.  One, however, needs not confuse the terms possibility with probability.  The irrational belief that the bird flu virus has a greater chance of mutating to humans in opposition to the thousands of other viruses currently in existence is unfounded.  Certainly we should not remain naïve of such possibilities but we also need to take into consideration the probability of an epidemic from one particular virus that has yet to master the chain of specific mutations it would need in order to become pandemic.  Even if this virus mutated to infect humans on a large scale, who is to say that its virility and potential deadly effects would also not alter and wither.  If we resort to stockpiling antidotes to this one particular virus, must we then stockpile antidotes for every other potential viral metamorphosis?  It is not only impossible to achieve, it is also illogical to think that we should.  More research to develop means of developing appropriate vaccines quickly as well as global containment preparedness would be better served.  To Dr. Siegel I say "BRAVO" and I hope that you continue educating your readers with such rational approaches 
 purchased this as a gift but borrowed it to listen to .... a wonderful work and great to be able to listen to it while jogging or in the car.  my mother said the book is amazing as well.  
 I have a lot of CDs and this one has moved to the top of my playlist. On this two-CD compilation, there are 23 tracks that are mid- to downtempo: some have a flamenco quality, others a Balearic or a bossa quality. But all of them work together pretty well and deliver relaxing, melodic tracks with a laid-back groove behind them. You can listen to them again and again...   If you already like the styles of José Padilla (think early Café del Mar) or Nacho Sotomayor, then you'll probably enjoy the artists on this CD. I hope they release a "Flamenco Chill In 2." I want more 
 As a new mother, I have little time to read, and when I do pick up a book, I want it to be engrossing, a page turner, hard-to-put-down, well- written--everything you want in a book. Diary of a South Beach Party Girl is that book. Cooper's writing style really pulls you in--there must be at least some of Cooper in her main character as the author is clearly a literary chick herself. Smart writing, great story. Read this book 
 Straight forward: you should buy this.   Here's the pro's and cons  Pro's:  1 It has a nice screen, even though it is B&W, that would never get in the way. The screen is nice and large, perfect for the ebook-type person. With 3 different font sizes, you can see it in your way.  2 It has a lot of features. It has a book reader (Mobipocket Reader, a nice program), MP3 player, Date Book, To-Do, Calculater, Audio Book Player, and Address Book. Plus, you can download programs from places such as Windows Market Place or C Net downloads.com  3 It has handwriting recignition (or a touch screen keyboard). I always found this handy and while it's not always right, the people at Franklin really got this down.  4 The whole thing is touch screen. This means you can play games on it and not be restricted to only a certian area. I had this problem with my last PDA. This also means you can download games.  5 MMC cababilty. You can have gigabytes plus the 8mb on the RAM. The ebookman also allows you to back up data, a handy feature for battery drainage.   6 The software is easy to use. The simple drag and drop-download system is a breeze. While some people say that downloading the OS (operating system) from the site is a pain, they didn't mention that the CD already comes with the OS.  7 Convienient side scroll wheel with push in ability. You can use this instead of the scroll bars, and you can push the wheel in to enter. It's cool! Con's:  1 The batteries go fast! I advise to have a spare set, and back up the data on an MMC. Don't use the backlight, that is what burns it up. The handy thing is that it has a battery indicator, so you know when it is time to change up.  2 Limited file types. The ebookman allows mostly its own versions of files, such as audio books and ebooks. However, it does accept .txt (Notepad) and .MP3 (music), plus a bunch more.   3 While it has a speaker, if you plan to lisen to something you should bring some headphones. The speaker is nice, yet quiet.   4 The date book's alarm is very quick. What is cool about the alarms is that there is over 20 alarms that you can choose. However, the alarm only does one cycle, and then it stops. It uses an internal speaker, so you can barely here it while it is in a pocket.   Otherwise, the ebookman is pretty good. While I got this from my aunt and didn't pay a penny, I think that if this is your first PDA, it's a good choice to get it for your money. And if it is true that this is your first time, you also want to get a case, screen protectors, and MMC cards (for more memory). This won't total up to more than $20.   Many say the batteries are drained quickly. This is true (in about 2 weeks for frequent users), however if you do not use the backlight much you will be ok. The backlight for the 7 inch screen is the burner of all batteries. Watch the convienient battery power indicator, and you should be ok. That's what I think; the desision is up to you 
 If you are interested in this period in history, you should read this book. Shirer offers a day-by-day history of life in Germany during the rise of Nazism and beginning of the war. That alone would be enough for a great book, but there is much more. Shirer covers many aspects of the war; he writes eloquently and accurately about the naivety of pre-war British diplomacy, strategy on both sides, and the Nazi clique. He provides an early glimpse at horrors of Nazi genocide. And his personal story is fascinating, as he travels across Europe, worries about his family, and matches wits with his censors to get as much of the story out as he can. Berlin Diary is very well written and hard to put down. Gems of description abound; for example, he describes a visit to a Lisbon casino: "Tonight, Ed [Murrow] and I did the casino. The gaming rooms were full of a weird assortment of human beings, German and British spies, male and female, wealthy refuges who had mysteriously managed to get a lot of money out and were throwing it about freely, other refugees who were broke and were trying to win their passage money with a few desperate gambles with the fickle roulette wheel..." Highly recommended. 
 Creed is(or was) one of the most loathed mainstream rock bands in recent memory, and I never truly figured out why that was. Granted I only own Human Clay, and have only heard the singles from My Own Prison and Weathered. My brother bought Human Clay around the time it came out, and we almost listened the disc into little plastic particles!  Of course, I was only about 12 at the time, so I couldn't fully appreciate the album as much as others could, lyrically speaking. Well, about 6 months ago, I was getting ready to move, and I found a "weathered" jewel case sitting somewhere in a dusty old box. I popped it in, and all the memories came flooding back to me, I felt like I was twelve again. I swear I've listened to it another 50 times since I rediscovered it.   Human Clay is one of the better rock records of the last 10 years. Mark Tremonti's awesome lead guitar coupled with Scott Stapp's Vedderesc agressiveness are the two most immediate aspects of the record. These guys are definitely a step up from most of the mainstream crop, and the record hasn't aged one bit, it sounds like it could've come out just yesterday.         There aren't any weak songs on Human Clay, per se, although to get the weakest out of the way: "Wrong Way"...............And that's about it.  Other than that the only thing that bothers me about Human Clay is the fact that there are two versions of "With Arms Wide Open", which I find sort of needless. Now that the negatives are out of the way,  we'll get to where Human Clay Excels. The Opening track, "Are You Ready", definitley sets the tone for what's to come. Notable are the agressive vocal thrashes accompied by melodic guitar riffs, though neither seem to dominate eachother. The production quality on Human Clay is fantastic, though I'd have liked it if there were a few more songs on the album.  It kinda ends before you'd hoped it would,  with barely over an hour of music(including the "With Arms Wide Open" repeat).  This is the average as I understand it,  but maybe more and more bands are putting more than 10 songs on their records these days, and maybe that's spoiled me.    The best songs on Human Clay are definitely: "What If",  "Higher",  and "Faceless Man". Those are by far the ones I listen to the most, although I rarely if ever skip by any songs on the record, other than "Wrong Way".    There is a theory that different people hear the same music differently from eachother, and I think because of this band's popularity, it's created this massive debate. Don't debate, just enjoy this or something else. But please, if you haven't given Creed a shot yet, I can definitely recommend Human Clay to you 
 Visit any healthy manufacturing operation and you'll see a buzz of bewildering activity - parts being moved on overhead cranes, raw materials being wheeled in, line operators checking their production schedules before they change the line over to their next product. Those production schedules, as this book suggests, can really be a hindrance. Operators become dependent on them, although the schedules may not accurately reflect customer demand. The solution? Kanban, which is based on having a communication system right on the factory floor that communicates key indications of customer behavior - buying, ordering, canceling - directly to the workers themselves. Production activity, therefore, is actually scheduled based on customer demand rather than on past expectations, with the advantage that you hold less inventory and operate more effectively. This book (which comes with a compact disc of implementation directions) gives clear insight into this powerful scheduling system employed efficiently by Toyota and other world-class companies. We highly recommend it to executives, managers and supervisors of companies that earn their living by making widgets more successfully 
 This has more of the more up-to-date slangs present in Korea! It also includes many of the words that have double meanings, just as we do in English. Many dictionaries don't carry the alternative meanings that is used now, so this book really helps both English and Korean speakers who can pronounce the words correctly. Finally! I was able to use it extensively to communicate with many of my students and on my trips to Korea, and my younger cousins were able to use it to communicate back with me and others. This is the beginning of a great slang library 
 This is one book title that really gives the reader an accurate picture of its   contents!  Once again, Pathfinder Press has given the interested reader and student of history a first person account filled with primary source materials of a revolution.  The author, Victor Serge, was a contemporary revolutionary of Lenin and Leon Trotsky and watched the counter-revolution of Stalin from the inside. As Serge says, "Everything has changed."   He takes us from the days of the textile workers strike in Petrograd on the eve of the Russian Revolution to the debates over strategies and tactics of the Spanish Civil War.  One of the most compelling essays is The Condition of Women." Here Serge details the lot of thousands of young women as prostitutes, and the anti-woman legislation of  the Stalinist  Soviet Union.   Serge writes, "the freedom of abortion, a capital conquest of the revolution, ceased to exist in the summer of 1935."   This book is a unique look at the Russian Revolution and its betrayal.  It is well worth picking up.  
 The movie was great and every purchase with amazon has been excellent. Always prompt shipping and packaged very well Thanks and will do business again                                      Charles D Coole 
 This is in the post-apocalyptic survival genre and is rated 18+ due to violent content. A new virus has spread through humanity, hardening the skin and dissolving internal organs. Those who are still alive are crippled, cybernetic or immune. Meanwhile, the human desire for power continues and there is a new organization looking to rule the world. It's an interesting look at man and nature.  This first volume is very good. The art is excellent. The story is introduced well and in an interesting way. I'm looking forward to finding out not only what will happen to the characters, but filling in what has happened in the past 
 I've watched the video about 4 or 5 times and I have come to the conclusion that the film is about one of the best early Doris Day films in existence.  The dancing, the singing and the cute story are but a few of  the wonderful things the film has to offer.  The supporting cast,  especially S.Z. Sakall, who was a great Viennese actor in early 1930s,  provides one of the best examples of character acting in movie musical  history.  Florence Bates and Anne Triola, who teams with Billy DeWolfe, are  excellent in their roles, too.  You would be foolish to pass this one up 
 Being 45 and in perimenopause, I started to become depressed and found I cried very easily which is the opposite of what I'm normally like. This book was recommended by a friend and has truly changed my life. Hormones play a big part in mood, weight, fat distribution and many other things. I learned enough in this book to ask my gynecologist for a prescription to give my pharmacist, who does compounding, for hormone replacement in a cream form. I use Progesterone and Testosterone and feel much better. I was the first person my gynecologist prescribed hormonal cream for that had not gone thru menopause. This is truly a subject that you need to learn and personalize for yourself 
 Says comic book guy:  Consciousness Explained...most pretentious title ever!  Few will finish reading Dennett's 528-page book and say to themselves "Well that explains it."  In fact, Dennett does not claim to explain consciousness, saying instead that he paints, in broad strokes, the outline a scientific, non-question-begging theory of human consciousness would take.  Addressing the merits of such a theory are difficult, and Dennett provides two appendices, one for scientists and one for philosophers, aimed at tying his claims to specific experimental predictions.  That's a start.  Dennett has been accused of being long-winded, taking readers on long asides or cascading mind games until his main thesis has been obfuscated to oblivion.  That's harsh.  I don't value Dennett in spite of his asides, but because of them.  His thought experiments and analogies are brimming with insight, even if, in the end, their additive effect fails to sum up to a complete explanation of consciousness.  In fact, this is a ubiquitous feature of books about human consciousness, from Dennett to Hofstadter to Pinker--the epistemological journey is always more fascinating than its final destination, which seems forever tentative or illusory.  Dennett starts with thought experiments aimed at setting the mood for the rest of the book, including a perspective on hallucinations, from phantom-limbs to full blown phantom-people, that whets the appetite for the meal to come.  He moves on to the first opponent of his theory--Descartes' "ghost in the machine" dualism, exposing it as scientifically defunct from a physical point of view.  He spends much of the rest of the book battling what he calls Cartesian Materialism--a vestige of Descartes' idea of a central theatre of human consciousness within the brain.  His alternative, dubbed the "Joycean Machine" or "Pandemonium Architecture" of human consciousness does not crop up in a well-defined form.  Actually, a more important title would have been What Consciousness Isn't.  Consider the following that form Dennett's foundation.  Human beings and chimpanzees diverged from a common ancestor about six million years ago.  Since that splitting off, the human brain has evolved to four-times its original size, mostly through the enlargement of the cerebral cortex.  The evolution of human brains was not correlated with an evolution of bipedalism or human culture.  No major changes in human neuroanatomy have taken place in the last ten thousand years, meaning that physiologically we are just as cognitively capable as our illiterate, language and culturally bereft ancestors.   With no hardware-level changes, Dennett relies on the concept of a meme--or a unit of cultural replication--for a software level understanding of his Joycean Machine.  The meme was first coined by Richard Dawkins in 1976 and is not an uncontroversial idea.  Consider this--the wiring of a Chinese speaking brain and an English speaking brain must be different due to different lingual memes, but no one with any certainty can tell a Chinese brain from an English brain.  Without a proper model of its physical manifestation, it's difficult to make the case that memes have high fidelity replication or fall under similar modes of selection as genes, which Dawkins proposed as their biological analogues.  In The Extended Phenotype Dawkins backpedals in the face of criticism for his meme concept, claiming its primary purpose was to highlight important differences between cultural and biological evolution, and not to frame an entirely new science of memetics.  Dennett partially agrees that such a science is untenable in Darwin's Dangerous Idea.  Still, he relies heavily on it in Consciousness Explained in order to frame a software-level understanding of human consciousness.  The best part of this book is Dennett's use of thought experiments and his analysis of certain cases of brain damage, including the split-brain procedures used to treat severe epilepsy and a model for understanding scomota, a condition of partial blindness.  His CADBLIND thought experiment, where he delineates a system of computer-aided design machinery for creating and manipulating a three dimensional image and answering questions about it, sheds light on our familiar misconceptions of the "mind's eye".  Similarly, his attack on the philosophical concept of phenomenology, often interpreted as an attack on the existence of consciousness itself, offers keen insight into how his views differ from traditional materialist takes on human consciousness.  In a review of one of his newer books on human consciousness, Susan Blackmore (author of The Meme Machine) regrets that Dennett has since changed his mind about some of the concepts of consciousness proposed in this book.  I think even if he completely repudiated the beliefs stated in this book it will still be worth the read.  Again, it may not explain consciousness, but it takes you on a journey that is epic in scope and interesting at every turn.  I highly recommend this book. 
 This is probably one of the best books I have read in this century. We, elderly readers, have usually fair memories and can stack one writer against the other. By every comparison, Ms. Smith winns hands down. Her language is original and refreshing. Her characters very much alive. If they suffer from common falacies she can treat all of it in very humane and understanding way. The story she tells is fascinating,well conceived and even better executed. The resolution is unusual in any case.Of all the young writers publishing in English currently (and I've read a few) she is my favorite. P.S. Re next question - I'm 85 years old 
 I get the impression that Mr. Byrne is superbly sensitive to his surroundings and absorbs everything. I envy his photographic memory and ability to live completely in the moment. :o) This is the perfect book to curl up with under your favorite green soft blanket 
 I couldn't disagree more with the two reviewers how didn't like this book one bit. I read it last summer, thought it excellent, and was delighted to find the updated version newly in print. Lots of great ideas here. This lady knows her stuff! And it's a great concept -- change your life like a corporation would. And preferebly with a corporation nowhere in sight 
 Learn how to improve your odds on personal and business decisions. The book covers the processes of setting goals and assessing risk. The tools in Make Your Own Luck, such as the Prediction Map, are applicable to everyday life and managing one's investments. A concept of the book is that every important decision we make in our lifes is as a bet. As we make these bets we want to increase our chances of success and we must also evaluate how much additional risk we are placing on ourselves with each new bet. We also need to find ways to shed risk before taking on new risk.  
 I bought this small Coby CD player because I'm a spa consultant with BeautiControl so I go to other people's homes and Spa them...I needed to play my spa music, quietly, so it's perfect. The volume won't even blast your ear drums if you turn it all the way up. And, if I forget to ask my hostess if she has a stereo in the room I don't have to worry about it if I just bring this with me. Saves me the trouble and I don't need to worry about leaving my CD in her stereo afterwards. I was also looking for a light weight CD player because I bring a lot of other things with me also. It's great! I can plug it in or use batteries. I also plan to use it to bring music outdoors when I host parties out on the deck this summer 
 9/19/04  Yvonne Latty & Ron Tarver's book "We Were There" of the voices of African American Veterans(World War II,Korean War,Vietnam War,persian Gulf War) will make the reader susceptible to 'tear'. Although ,it gives much example of predjudice(s) eperienced by most of these Veterans at one time or another, incl often predjudice from other African Americans ,often predjudices from other non-black,non-white,it gives so many examples of just "bloody lost of limb,life,lucidness".  Each essay, is its own little autobiography, with the next essay being as compeling..The least compelling were those of Clothing Designer (FUBU Corporation)'s J. Alexander Martin[Navy E-4]Gulf War) & Army Brigadier General Vincent Brooks(Operation Iraqui Freedom)..(they were very involved. but not as close to the extraordinary sacrifices that "environmental(water to hygiene;friendly fire to hostile fire;canteen meals & Prisoner of War Meals; etc) brought to bear on most of these over 17 year olders to less than 40 year older troup 
 Everything I needed to know about politics I learned from Animal Farm.   Every revolution contains the seeds of its own corruption and the next revolution; one privileged class is always replaced by another.   As long as human nature is what it is, the need for revolution will not end and the manipulation of public sentiments will not end either.   All the usual suspects are personified here in the gullible sheep, to the loyal "work horse" who falsely believes his work makes him valuable to the party, to the pigs who learn to take advantage of their positions for their own gain at the expense of the others.   The governments tendency to use people for its own ends cannot be ignored in this all too familiar alegory.   A must read before you vote.  
 The Recital is a lower key story than I usually read, but very touching and sweet. The more I got to know the characters the more I liked them. The hero in the story was a tender hearted farmer and the heroine was a big city musician who was in her element teaching students at Gaylord in Chicago. The story started out pretty hilarious with the heroine, Joan, burning a meal for her sweetheart. Then came marriage and a move. I enjoyed experiencing the adjustments the older couple had to make as newleyweds. Some parts were sweet, yet flirtatious and fun. Other sections of the story were sentimental and spirited, especially their sparring on occasion. Overall, I grew to care about the characters so much that I got all choked up at the end. What a gripping story. It made me think about life, love, and enjoying the moment. I'm glad I stuck with this novel and highly recommend it 
 This is a good book despite Scott Fresner. I suggest that you don't buy anything else from him. He will sell you the moon if you let him 
 The first few books in this series are extremely fun and more on the light side. In the previous book Nita and Kit were really starting to mature. In this book, matters are much more series, darker, and closer to home. The book has more substance and is the better for it 
 Medieval culture is bookish.  The barbarian legacy is disguised.  Medieval man was a codifier, a builder of systems.  There was a Model of the Universe, a construct of answered questions. In the classical period the concept of Nature was greater than the goddess embodying it.  The angels of Scholasticism are the gods or aetherial creatures of the classical era.  Apuleius and Plato used what Lewis calls the Principle of the Triad.  Third things functiuoned as bridges between the other two.    Plotinus marks a transitional period, 200 to 500, when the medieval frame comes into being.  The era includes the reigns of Constantine, Christian, and Julian, the attempt at a Pagan revival.  Each side had the same educational attributes.  Although Plotinus is a genius, Lewis contends that Porphyry is the more influential writer.  Chalcidius transmitted Plato and produces the richest results in the work of the twelfth century Latin poets.  The contribution of pseudo-Dionysius to the Medieval Model is his angeology, CELESTIAL HIERARCHIES.  Boethius's CONSOLATION OF PHILOSOPHY should be noted here.  He was a scholar and aristocrat.    The medieval universe is finite.  There are moral and emotional consequences to cosmic dimensions.  The four elements, hot, cold, moist, dry are present in Milton, Cervantes, Spenser.  God causes the Primum Mobile to rotate.  (The planets retained their Pagan names and qualities.)  There is a relationship to Aristotle's Prime Mover.  Fortune is a wheel.  Everything below the moon is mutable.  The four humors vary daily and individually.    History and fiction cannot be distinguished in medieval books.  Medieval narratives of the past lack a sense of period.  There are seven liberal arts, the TRIVIUM, and the QUADRIVIUM.  Medieval poetry is filled with solid instruction.  The model is used in service of a realizing imagination.                 
 On my shelf of shamanic titles, this one sits prominently figured.  Cowan presents the traditional fantastic experiences of the shaman in an amazingly perceivable framework.  His depiction of archetypes in well-known myths and legends opens one to the ability to read all things symbolically, thus, as the dynamic spiritual presences that they are.  His telling of olde tales connects their spirit with a modern audience 
 I would recommend this book for highschool kids who can handle more difficult phrasing and literary styles..because it is a great read and depicts life in a time that most of us living today can't imagine: the Great Depression.  We've all seen some photos of the horrible ravages of the dust bowl era on farmfields in the 1930's..but the pictures included here by Walker Evans are of the faces that witnessed and were living through that ravaging..and they show it.  The passages are bleak, darkly humorous at times..and gritty..and best of all..they're real.  The passage on young Emma is flawless.  I would recommend to anyone who has already read and enjoyed this book a listen to Richard Buckner's album 'Bloomed'..in which he sets to minimal and appealing tune the words that describe Emma's plight.  A perfect antidote for the bland materialism of today's mall culture 
 Big Audio Dynamite's first album has got to be their absolute best. My first exposure to B.A.D. was hearing the song "Bad" in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", and it made me seek out this album. (This was before I was even a big Clash fan, and I later become one.) To my surprise, every single track was just as good as that one, if not better. From the western sampled "Medicine Show" (with clips from "The Good, The Bad & The Ugly" and "The Treasure Of Sierra Madre"), the catchy and kitschy "Sony", the dance hit "E=MC2", to the Reggae peppered "A Party", I can't find a track among these 8 songs that isn't good.  I highly recommend checking out anything of Big Audio Dynamite that you can get your hands on, but a lot of it is out of print. (The drastically underappreciated F-Punk being one of those) Luckily, the brilliant debut album is still in print, and even though it's still a bit hard to find, you can find it without nearly as much as hassle as some of the other releases. Grab this one 
 I used it like the instructions said and the most visible results were that my eyes had a more "awake" appearance and a tightening of the under-eye area. I've had it for over a yr now and there's a tiny bit left so I need to restock. It's a dense cream and you only need a tiny bit.I have ultrasensitive eyes and it didn't irritate my eyes and it did not have a greasy feel at all. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is not usable on the lids. I tend to get dry eye-lids.   
 This double CD is one of the best that MOS has put out in quite some time. I would give the edge to the Titan on this one although Johhny Vicious played a remarkable set. Tall Paul's set has some of the best electronic tracks ever; Star 69, Push, Synathesia, and makes this set flow exceptionally well. The last three tracks on CD 2 I can play over and over and over again and still never get sick of it. Johnny Vicious tends to lean more towards more vocal type tracks and thats why I have to give the edge to the Titan on this one. Regardless, this double disk set is definitley one worth buying 
 This book was also a must read for my son's Kindergarten book list. He knows it inside out and often reads it to me. He loves the monkeys in it. We both truly love this book 
 This book answered that question for me.  I know that the writers of this book or anyone else on earth does not truly know what heaven will be like, but they did an amazing job of illustrating what heaven might be like.  I have read the whole Left Behind Series and I have to say that The Rapture was one of my favorites.  The imagery in this book gave me such an excitement of what it will be like the day the Jesus returns for his children.  I absolutely loved this book and the Left Behind Series.  I am not an Eglish major or anything close to it and I know some people may complain about plots, and charcter development, and all this and that, but if you are a Christian and want to read a great series, then Left Behind is for you.  I also recommend this book to non-Christians who have any interest at all in Jesus Christ and his return 
 Unique, well-written -- poignant, humorous -- subtle, yet compelling. Hubble's comic timing and keen storytelling are second to none. This is one of the most wonderful gifts I've ever received. Read it! Give it to every person you know. It's unique and so very lovely. I am grateful to the person who recommended this gem. A Book of Bees is a wonderful revelation. Ostensibly about bee-keeping, but really about life 
 Finally, I found in "The American Film Musical" a critic who takes this genre seriously and has worked to understand its intricate and complex layers and patterns. Altman divides his study into three "subgenres" - the fairy tale musical, the show musical, and the folk musical - and demonstrates how most every example of the genre falls into one of these categories to some extent. As well as being devoted to the musical, Altman also provides a method for genre study in general, which some readers will want to skim or even skip if their only interest is research on the musical. However, to truly understand the workings of the genre it is beneficial to read the whole book, because the musical is surely one of the most complex art forms ever, and Altman does so much to break into the problems that many critics have ignored that it's worth being enlightened as to his process.  The book makes you reconsider all the presuppositions you may have about the film musical and what constitutes a musical. The patterns and workings he reveals, particularly with regard to the dual-focus narrative, are fascinating: instead of just the old "how many songs?" question, Altman uses the criteria of "coupling" to form his theory of what constitues a musical.  A definite YES for anyone searching through the dark for a more modern study of the genre 
 It's about time someone wrote a book on how to market a product from the inception to official launch, without complicated details that make the whole process frustrating. The detail of the chapters and the systematic way in which they are organized make the whole process of idea invention just so much easier 
 This was my very first Shannon Drake book, and I loved it.  I have gone on to buy others of hers, just because this one was so good!!  Keep up the good work Shannon! 
 I have always been a vivid dreamer and was introduced to this book by a dream mentor of mine. I found this book gave me direction into journaling my dreams and starting my journey to make sense of them.  
 This true story is well written with vivid descriptions of people and places in the USA and Kenya.  It reads like a polished novel.  It is an open and honest account, originally published in 1995, long before Obama was a prominent politician.  It is not a political book at all.   It is a saga of self-discovery that will continue to inspire many to seek more information about their respective heritages.  Given the growth in the number of mixed-race families and children in America, this book will continue to be in demand.

 As a woman who made the choice at a young age NOT to have children, it was great to find a book that supported and explored that option. Bravo! 
 Lisa Grunwald's novels are a rare find and Whatever Makes You Happy is no exception!  Her characters are so real, yet they grab hold of us as they go through their lives in surprising and interesting ways.  Grunwald brings new life to ordinary human relationships and keeps us guessing all the way. Whatever Makes You Happy wraps you in a world where you care deeply about the characters, but are able to explore with them the larger issues of happiness, love, faith and hope that she eloquently introduces. Brava!  
 Okay, so it is VERY different from the original PEYTON PLACE, but so was the book! Carol Lynley and Tuesday Weld are gorgeous, adorable and totally enjoyable. Eleanor Parker and Mary Astor are campier than a couple of drag queens. It is kitschy, early 60s soap opera at is best. This should be playing in revival houses as a double bill with the original. Watch for Bob Crane in a cameo role as a talk show sidekick.   Enjoyable commentary by film historian, original theatrical trailer and 2 short movie-tone news reels are fun special features, but it's a pity that Lynley wasn't invited to do a track with her own remembrances...she has great anecdotes!  Beautifully preserved soap fest, best when viewed as a double feature with the original PEYTON PLACE 
 This is Hank Williams at his best singing his best  This particular album holds a lot of memories for me  This album is the first real country music I ever heard  When I was a kid my dad had a Sony Dolby cassette player and he used to play this tape over and over again on it until it wore out  (there were two tapes)  I absolutely loved it then and I'm 20 now and still love it  Hank is the grandaddy of country and this album proves it  It's hard to narrow it down to just 40 hits  Almost every song he had was a great great song  Williams couldnt even read sheet music but boy could he write a hell of a song  If only he would have lived longer than 29....  In other words if you don't have this c.d and you love country music you need to hear this c.d!!!!  you'll be glad you di 
 A super book that clearly and succinctly explains Uranus transits through the houses and in aspect to all planets.  This is a terrific reference for both practicing astrologers and those navigating Uranus transits because Tierney explains the purpose of the transits while offering practical suggestions for navigating them 
 This movie has the realistic arts of violence with knives (not guns). LT bonham (tommy lee jones) who is a military instructor who trained Aaron hallam (benicio del toro) very well to become a killing machine. after the war experience aaron goes through in kosovo aaron cannot seem to turn off his deadly technique skills of killing. Now aaron gets out of control the cops can't stop him & opening fire at him won't help at all it just ends up with more casualties of cops and the only one who can stop him is LT which becomes a deadly cat mouse game and a gruesom battle between a teacher and a student which was a really good fight. This movie deserves 5/5 stars for good actors and A good storyline too. 
 How can I say anything negative about two of the greatest jazz musicians who ever lived.  The music was subperb.  Amazon sent me this CD in a most timely fashion.  All went smoothly 
 I think this book was absolutely fantastic. I read this book first and then I read the others though I still have to read a couple more. A flaw in all the books I have so far read about Anne is that the author has created no romance between Anne and Gilbert . I mean a little kissing wouldn't hurt at all and it would make the books so much more romantic and sweet . I don't mean to say that the author has to be totally Danielle Steel but it would have been nice if she had made her books romantic. The worst thing in this whole book was the incessant gossiping of the old ladies at the sewing party. I skipped it because it was so boring. Nevertheless I really like these books and I think the author has described the natural beauty very NICELY. You would feel as if you were there.I find Anne's children very adorable. And I would like to inform the other readers out there that Anne has six children:Jem, Walter, Di, Nan, Shirley and Rilla. I recommend this book to all as it is full of laughter and fun 
 i cant say anything else the other reviewers havent already said.  i own goat, liar, down, bang. goat is the best BY FAR.  monkey trick, nub, seasick, dudley, wow the whole album is spectacular. its the only one i listen to all the way through and then rewind to the start immediately... though if boilermaker and puss were on here, i would probably explode with excitement (perhaps a greatest hits is in order?) 
 Some reviewers below complain that this book is tedious.  Well, sure.  I bet the US Constitution and the Bible are tedious to someone who has no clue about, or doesn't care about, their context.  To anyone with some understanding of US history, the project of writing this book marks a step forward in race relations, however big or small that step may turn out to be.  If you care even a little about why this country is the way it is, this book crackles with a searing flame.    Ball writes about visiting a wary African American man in Chapter 6, and what that man says at the end of his interview speaks for me and my opinion of the book.  "Someone has to break the ice.  I gotta give you credit, you were man enough to do it."  People won't agree whether reconciliation or forgiveness apply in this situation, and I'm not sure either.  But this is the author's best effort at telling the objective truth about black-white relations as it was lived by individuals over the centuries.  "I decided I would make an effort, however inadequate and personal, to face the plantations, to reckon with them rather than ignore their realities or make excuses for them."    Chapter 9 describes the shocking child mortality figures on the plantations.  And on a slave voyage from Africa to Charleston, over a third of the captive passengers died en route - just the cost of doing business to the owners.  No wonder some try to deny this history; it's too painful.  Yet, the book also provides some episodes of humanity and hope.  Readers will emerge with a greater understanding of our history and human nature.  Maybe they'll become more vigilant against trespasses on human life and dignity in our own day as well 
 This is the beginning of the posthumous work of Mishima.  You will follow the lives of four people who got reincarnated in different time and in different place with Honda.  His flowing and elegant style hits the highest and psychological descriptions, that even characters did not realized themselves so well, are so elaborated and sometimes scare us.  It seems like weaving beautiful tapestry and you can feel the person of genius and bliss for enjoying the output of the genius.  But you may lost at the end like this story and come back to this story again and again 
 In Montmarte, a double murder occurs in the Moulin Rouge.  Gloom and doom French Inspector Maurice "More is Less" Laice and his superior Aline Lefèvre, a positive thinking active lesbian who at times lets her other "head" do her thinking, lead the investigation.  The crime scene produces nothing.  Thus the two cops turn to the victims seeking who might have a motive to kill the duo.  Lead dancer Manfred and Lisa the trainee are the victims; the culprit intermingled their corpses in some sort of macabre dance.  However, outside of the Moulin Rouge, the victims seem to have little in common as Manfred is a purebred native and Lisa is a Corsican emigrant.  The case goes nowhere sending the pessimistic Maurice deeper into depression while Aline tells him to find solace in orgasms.  Still the two cops argue about life, but keep digging within the Moulin Rouge community and the growing Corsican immigrants flocking to the city.   The key to this strong often amusing and as often gloomy French police procedural is the two cops, as opposite of a pair that readers will ever find.  Laice is a fortyish person who at times acts like an ailing octogenarian who no longer can get it up while the promiscuous Aline lives for multiple orgasms with her female partners.  At times the depth into the lead couple is so deep and powerful the murder mystery takes a back seat even with the fast-pacing of the plot that like the stars contrast between the upbeat and the downbeat.

 My "trusty" Ford Escort experienced cold shock when moved from TX to PA in December. It needed to be jump started -- the jump starter has been extremely easy and effective to use 
 My wife suggested this book.  From what I knew about it, I thought I was in for a very weird experience.  I thought I'd read a few pages and then start something else.  But I couldn't put it down.  The book was full of  interesting characters with fantastic backgrounds.  A few topics covered by the book:  incest, Greece, immigrating to the U.S., Detroit, race riots, silk worms, and of course a hermaphrodite.  Wow, this book was jammed with interesting characters, events and issues.  Give this book a try; you won't be sorry that you did 
 Intellgent, articulate and scathingly honest, this book is a slice of reality that shows the Sex Worker industry in a new light. Sarah Katherine's views on all the aspects of the work, from the highs to the lows, is refreshing and sometimes a little shocking. I was forced, during my reading, to feel a little uncomfortable at times because of how her words pierce the veil behind some of the darker aspects of her customers and how they can treat people. I've heard contra opinions and views, but I was happy to hear such an honest, unvarnished view of people and their needs. This book is a great read, although, like many, I'd like to hear more about the author's personal life, but the view we are given is fascinating and complex. Read this, and know a larger view of a seldom-seen world. 
 This play is very funny in places, very moving in places, very absorbing in places -- all of it in an apparently seamless whole of the high Stoppardian quality. How does the man do it? How does one write a  dissertation on the art of writing using a cricket bat as a teaching aid?  To quote another recent Stoppard's work: "It's a mystery!...&quot 
 There are other reviews that are more indepth and serious.   This is an absolutely fun movie and we are hoping they come out with another one just like it. Noah Wiley does a great job playing a librarian who is slightly put off kilter because he is thrust into dangerous, scary and different situations.   The characters are as believable as they can be given the situation they are placed in (working in a library that collects historical artifacts that may or may not exist).   My children particularly liked the end where the directors and artists discussed how they did their work.   This is a fun fun movie. Well worth the money. Enjoy. 
 Outstanding!! While reading I was transported into another time and place. Jung Chang is a contemporary of mine and as the story moved along I tried to think back to where I was at a particular time and compare my life expierences with hers. No comparison, what hardship's she and her family faced. Brave lady!! I also purchased "Mao" and can't wait for her next book 
 "The Changeling" has become a little bit dated, however, it is still a very good ghost story. The film stars (George C. Scott) as John Russell, a composer who has lost his family in a tragic accident. He rents a large estate in order to compose his music. It is here that he encounters the ghost of a young boy. Why is the boy haunting the estate? Why is he making contact with John Russell? As the film moves forward, John Russell contacts a medium and eventually begins to investigate the mansion.  From what he can gather, it was the former home of Senator Carmichael (Melvin Douglas). What ensues is the mystery of who the child is, and who is Senator Carmichael. What occurred in the mansion that is keeping this child there? This is more of a mystery than a horror film. The suspense of the film is through the nuances the director created by use of creepy sounds and effects in which the boy's wheelchair moves. The film is dated, and does not have the appeal it once had for me, however, it is still a good watch. Recommended. 
 I loved this book and I love this author!  When you read her books, it's like you're talking to your best friend.  I read Step Ball Change first and knew I'd HAVE to read everything Jeanne Ray's written.  So I read Julie and Romeo next.  This is a small, simple book - nothing heavy, nothing ponderous here - just total enjoyment.  So enjoyable, that I'm currently reading -and loving - Eat Cake.  The bad news is that she's only written 4 books - the good news is that her fifth - Julie and Romeo Get Lucky will be out June 1st!  Read this book - you won't regret it 
 You can't go wrong with this fantastic drug guide! It is listed under generic names but if you don't know the generic name you can look up in the index at the back of the book for the trade name.  I had a nurse/lawyer professor for my first year care plans and she wanted it all.  This book delivered it ALL: classification, pregnancy catagory, indications, mechanism of action, contraindications and precautions, adverse reactions and side effects, interactions, route and dosage, availability, nursing implications and even potential nursing diagnoses! Also implementation, patient/family teaching and evaluation.  Wow! I've been very impressed.  It came through for me so I didn't have to go out and buy another drug book which is saying something! Davis's Drug Guide has even more in the back of the book with many appendixes including: recent drug approvals, additional drugs, combination drugs and opthalmic meds all that  include class, indications, adverse reactions and side effects, route and dosage and contraindications and warnings.  Appendix E  is about natural/herbal products which is as thorough as the drugs that make up the main part of this book.  There are pictures of the intramuscular drug sites, formulas helpful for calculating doses, routine pediatric and adult immunizations,  recommendations for the safe handling of hazardous drugs, schedules of controlled substances, food sources for specific nutrients (ie foods rich in K, Na, Ca, Fe, vit K, vit D, low Na, foods that acidify urine as well as foods that alkalizine urine), and insulin and insulin therapy.  Also throughout the book there is plenty of red lettering amidst the black for high alert warnings where drug overdoses have occurred in the past.  The organized, easily found references in this guide could save your client's lives.  Just because a doctor orders it doesn't mean it is ok to give, as a nurse we have to look it up and know the safe dose and contraindications and more and this book has it all! Highly recommended! Good luck all future nurses! Soar! 
   I personally LOVE crunchy cheetos, but if you look at the nutrition facts they're not really that healthy. I love the crunch and the cheesiness. Everything about cheetos are great, I even love to lick the cheese off of my fingers. Although the fat, salt, calorie, and carbohyrdrate content are EXTREMELY terrible, the package may say 100% real chese, but its 100% real FAKE cheese. It's like everyone loves chocolate, but it's unhealthy.    I don't advise you to buy these snacks when you can eat something healthier, perhaps a bag of low sodium pretzels or a piece of fruit. I think you should definintely eat cheetos at least once in a while because they taste delicious, just not all the time. I don't want to sound like a paranoid health inspector, I'm just giving you my personal opinion on this product! I <3 CHEETOS 
 I love this CD!! I have to listen to it every Christmas.  Amy Grant puts a new spin on some old favorites and brought to life some new songs that I love.  "Mary's Song" is probably my most favorite song on the whole disk, but I just love it and would recommend it to anyone and everyone! 
 I saw this originally in the VHS "theatrical" release, mid  1990s. This Directors cut is streets ahead of the original theatrical version. It is hard to pigeon hole Barker in film, since his work is so diverse. Compare LORD OF ILLUSION with NIGHTBREED. The characters of Swann and D'mour are so tired and flat because they are so obviously world weary, at least that is my take on the characters. How else should Kevin have played Swann ?? Especially  since Swann  so willingly gives up his life. As for the followers, it specifically  says in the film "You are all  sheep... but I'm not your Shepherd...". Nix  was always focused on Swann. Like most of Barkers  work, he has a structured mythology, and the commentary Barker  gives shows that he is at least partly tutored in show level  magic. And to anyone familiar with occult  works, even from a Crowley-ian viewpoint, Barker has some schooling in that side of things. In part, I suspect Barker is playing to a small  audience who "know"... but he has proven his ability to be popular with films, so I suspect that Barker  does what he wants, and he is the arbiter of his own work. Works well if you are in on the "joke"... but it also works well  just as great entertainment. Thats the ambiguity and the entertainment value which is Clive Barker 
 This book is for paper-savers, and yes there are still a lot of us, even when we have computers.  It describes a powerful, uncomplicated system for filing and locating papers. It may seem odd to use codes instead of directly labeling the folders, but this allows for indexing a folder also under alternate keywords so the index is what makes this system so flexible.    If you keep the index in the file cabinet along with the files, anyone who needs to find something can locate the right folder quickly.  Even in the computer age, I would never bother to put this index on a computer or PDA. This would only make the index less accessible, and more work to maintain.   In fact, the index could also easily be used to find things in boxes or drawers just as easily as in file folders. The author uses as an example recording in an index where holiday decorations are stored.  The major weakness of this system would be the major weakness of any filing system: getting the rest of the family to use it 
 This book includes a scholarly history of the holy guardian angel and then explains thoroughly many techniques to access or communicate with one's holy guardian angel. On one hand it is clear and accessible but the book also includes a broad knowledge of ancient history.  The book is all you need to get in touch with the most important personal spiritual guide you can have 
 I ordered a pair of these online, a bit nervous as I wasn't ever able to hear them (I heard a pair of JBL SP6C's, the cheaper version, at Best Buy, and wasn't all that impressed, although it might have been the poor listening environment).    Anyway, the speakers arrived, we installed them (they look great and inconspicuous in our living room ceiling) and I'm quite impressed.  Note that we're using these for "whole-house" background music, not home theater, so my standards aren't as high as they would be in the HT case.  But for a 6.5" speaker, these put out a surprising amount of bass, and clear highs.  Right now we just have a cheap amplifier hooked up while we're shopping for a better one, and they still sound great.  These probably would be just fine for HT rear-speaker use (I wouldn't want any in-ceiling speaker for front or center HT use).  Our home theater downstairs already has JBL speakers (studio series for the fronts and center, northridge for the rears) and I've been very happy with them.    I recommend these for those who need a great looking and decent sounding in-ceiling speaker without breaking the bank.  
 Not a typical New Age album. I like the "woods" theme that runs throughout all of the tracks. There is also a nice fusion with classical music themes and generous use of more "standard" instruments like violins, oboes and flutes and less emphasis on such typical New Age mainstays like drum machines and things with names like "Moog." Even where there is synthesizers, etc. it tends to be sound very natural and playful (not overdone and depressing a la Tangerine Dream). Besides, I can't help but like the fact that the liner notes contain an acknowledgement to a cricket (named Claudette) who sat in on a session and who displayed "impeccable rhythm and incredible control of dynamics." Unfortunately, the cricket is no longer with the band - which may be why this is the only "Fresh Aire" CD I have 
 In exhaustive detail William J. Rothwell shows you the hows and whys of succession planning and management in this second edition of his landmark book. Given the general corporate predilection for systems and bureaucracies, top executives and managers of both large and small businesses will revel in the way Rothwell lays out his well-researched plan. His ample how-to lists and charts can be adapted to fit almost any industry. Despite the author's scholarly credentials and depth of information, his writing is not academic. We from getAbstract recommend this book to executives and managers, particularly if your company doesn't already have a succession plan 
 This book is gritty, grimy, and full of drama. Perfect if you like the street lit 
 Palmer's book is a good little guide except, unfortunately, for the incorrect and misleading description of the meaning of IQ scores.  This is a clear, handy guide to the world of IQ assessment and gifted children. I recommend it heartily, but I must add a strong caveat that the author and I have already discussed: Palmer describes score ranges for different levels or degrees of giftedness that seriously understate the meaning of scores above 135 IQ, mis-stating how highly intelligent and different-from-others these children really are. For example, on pages 18-19, he uses outdated descriptions and score ranges that no longer hold merit, and this is a significant error. The most recent test to use such scores, the old Stanford-Binet (Form LM), was last updated in 1972 and has been replaced. That test is no longer considered valid, and further, the wide score ranges reported by that test seriously confuse those who would need to depend upon them today. Current valid group and individual tests (described nicely in his book) report scores on a normalized bell curve and tend to reach their limits at 150 IQ.  Someone who scores at 144 on a current test, for example, is "exceptionally" to "profoundly gifted," not "moderately gifted" and in need of few academic adjustments, as Palmer claims. A score of 144 is almost three standard deviations above the mean score, meaning a score in the top 0.2%. Such a child is not "moderately gifted" and will need learning adjustments. On page 82 he states, "Bear in mind that many children whose IQ measures in the moderately gifted range (130 to 145) can thrive in a general education program." It is true in some academic settings, what I call a Type III School, that children at the low end of this range will thrive in the regular setting, but for children above 135--and certainly above 140--major adjustments are necessary. Again, this confusion stems from using a no longer valid test score range.  Most educators and psychologists are somewhat confused about how today's scores relate to scores from older tests, resulting in many professionals overlooking level of giftedness as an important issue related to classroom and social adjustment. As the author of Riverside Publishing's Use of the SB5 in the Assessment of High Abilities (2003), I encourage parents to read the free bulletin, available on the Riverside website, in order to fully understand the meaning of any gifted-level IQ scores.    All that said, Dr. Palmer covers every imaginable issue and question parents might have when they consider whether or not their child is gifted and whether or not to have their child assessed. I know of no other book or guide that covers these topics so clearly. Just be aware that his descriptions of IQ ranges and meanings of the scores are incorrect. 
 Great book!  I had administered earlier versions of Microsoft Exchange but was new to Exchange 2000.  There was not a single question that I had that this book did not have an answer for.  Outstanding 
 I thought this CD was very nicely done. It's been done using "local" Hawaiian musicians/artists so I wouldn't have thought it to have "soul?". You don't have to live in Hawaii to enjoy this 
 As a progressive rock fan, any dipping into straight pop is, at best, a guilty pleasure for me.  This album is simply wonderful and I often find myself cruising down some lonely stretch of Texas highway, singing along with Belinda.  It helps quite a bit that Belinda Carlisle has an absolutely dreamy voice - that's right, pop singers used to be able to sing!  Where this album really stands out, though, is that the songs are actually quite complex, by pop standards, and that the musicians are really allowed to shine - the violin solo on La Luna, short though it may be, is  gorgeous.  I would own this album for that violin solo alone ... but almost every other song on the album is just as beautifully embellished.  The only song on the album I dislike is (We Want) The Same Thing - too poppish for my tastes - but I can't think of any other pop album that has so many strong tracks.  If one must own a Belinda Carlisle album, this is the one 
 Countries around the world are trying to develop their economies to compete with the U.S.  If you haven't read about this book - I guarantee you will be amazed at how fast other countries are coming up to speed - and how FAST it is happening! A very frightening book if you have children due to the emerging trends on employment in the U.S., and will impact the how you coach your children on choice of careers 
 I first heard this album while walking through a small shop in Sisters, Oregon, and was quite taken with Coulter's interpretation of these Scottish songs. When I want to relax, this is one of the first album's I think of 
 As an owner of the original 1986 print I was very pleased with this reprint. The paper is strong and the printing looks very good.  At the end there are a few new extra pages with some interesting never before seen concepts by Mr. Froud.  I wish there will be a Making of photo book someday, but as for now this is the must own book for LABYRINTH fans.  Oh, and forget the RETURN TO THE LABYRINTH Manga...please! ;- 
 Bringing the cultures of China back into the world, once again, Amy Tan completes yet another exquisite piece of work, in composing The Bonesetter's Daughter. Ruth Luyi Young is the daughter of LuLing Liu Young, two characters in which the novel's central theme revolves around, discussing the importance of family and mother-daughter relationships. As the novel is written in the perspective of both Ruth and LuLing, one can easily trace the steps of their family's early history, culture, and traditions, such as the importance of ink making and Chinese calligraphy, the history of the bonesetter, and the famous "curse of the bonesetter's daughter" which was cast upon Ruth and LuLing's family. During the course of these events, Ruth and LuLing both come face to face with reality, realizing that life is not as easy as it may seem and that everyone should cherish it no matter what, which subsequently impacts their relationship towards each other and brings them even closer together. The Bonesetter's Daughter is a story that all teens, and even mothers should read, because it reminds people of what they have and to not take advantage of it. It especially reminds daughters and mothers of the importance of that special mother-daughter bond and how important family should be 
 A lot of books I've read down through the years, even books I have enjoyed, I have forgotten almost as soon as I finished them. This book not only have I not forgotten, but I continue to be affected by it. It is part of the reason I've "adopted" an African girl and have an awakened interest in Sudan, etc. and try and keep a soft heart for these people.  Rwanda I remember unfolding as a horrible tale at the time, but the numbers were so staggering and the tales of genocide so horrible that not only were they difficult to comprehend they were even difficult to believe. It is one reason why I've never fully bought into the idea that all the Germans were "ten miles from Dachau"- that is to say they knew what was going on. They may have, and undoubtedly some could of done more, but like Rwanda it is almost psychologically impossible to make yourself believe that humans are capable of these kind of atrocities.  And in Rwanda it all happened so fast. A few radio spots, a few speechs, and suddenly a terror campaign developed where 800,000 men, women and children were killed, mostly hacked to death by machete. Former teachers, former students, next door neigbors, even clergy could be perpetrator or victim. Like Nazi Germany, the tales of heroism are all the more poignant for their scarcity, and all the more to be marveled at. Those familiar with the movie Hotel Rwanda have some glimpses into the Schindler-like cleverness that rescued some of the Tutsi people from the Hutu attackers.  The book mostly blames the perpetrators, as it clearly should, but it also highlights by merciless observation the ineffectual and even criminal postion of the UN at that time. False hope is worse than no hope, and those counting on rescue that never came were worse off than those who took it upon themselves to become refugees- although the refugee camps were a grim escape route as the book points out in several chapters.  Well written, well told. It is not a pleasant subject, but something about the closeness of it- the intimacy between the participants, makes genocide a word saturated with sad but vivid meaning, and the mask is ripped off to reveal once again that we live in a fallen world. Almost a must read for our century, in my opinion 
 I've had one for a year, and love it.  I bought a second one as a gift.  They are so much more convinient than a mony clip or wallet 
 Just discovered this author with this book.  Held my attention, provided humor, suspense and entertainment.  The author's story is imaginative and the story line is just complicated enough to hold the reader's attention while not befuddling him.  I look forward to reading another in the series 
 This book proves that philosophy can be both powerful and relevant to everybody's life! I'm a teenage girl who has suffered from low self-esteem but Bruce Lee's teachings have opened my eyes to a whole new way of looking  at life! Now I see and..more importantly.. understand that we are all the  same and that looking at others as "different" or  "better" or "worse" than us is truly the mind's worst  disease. John Little is a masterful philosopher himself to have seen and  presented such a deep philosophy in such an enjoyable manner. And with this  book, he has shared Master Lee's brilliant and penetrating observations on  love, relationships, racism and life. What a mind-opening book. I call it  "therapy for the sane!" Read this book and really get to know  about life 
 There are very few works that come near this masterpiece of American literature ("To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Moby Dick" are the closest in my opinion).  Not only do you need to read this book; you need to read this book multiple times.  It never gets old.  It is so complex and multi-layered that you truly find something new with each reading. It is a shame that so many students feel "forced" to read this.  Reading this book is a privilege and a delight.  It is funny, touching, witty, satirical and one of the most important books that exisits.  Although it was written and set in the past the themes are universal and timeless.  Do not hesitate to read this book 
 I loved the Beauty Series especially the first book which had the shock of the new about it. The sequel was enjoyable but lacked the impact of the first book.  It was a bdsm novel and those who fail to take that into account would not understand it...the world of BDSM is like the world of fairy stories with its own rules and conventions...and some damned wicked witches too :)    I am interested that Anne Rice is so anti fan fiction though. Isn't the Beauty Series fan fiction on Charles Perrault's character 
 This is being written without any corrections.  It is certainly a lot easier than manually typing for someone who can't type worth a darn.  Recommend it highl 
 Making Great Decisions is a great book! The authors do not only provide a complete collection of effective decision making tools but also make professional decision making concepts simple to use and simple to understand. The result is a versatile book suitable to support decision makers and problem solvers in various settings. For professionals, it provides a quick reference of important concepts and a guide for the decision making process. For personal decisions, Making Great Decisions is a treasure box of powerful tools without the need for the resources of a corporate headquarters. Beyond decision making, the book also helps with handling complex problems and identifying situations when different techniques of decision making can be useful. As a capstone, the authors also explain the relation between good morals and good decisions - an important lesson to learn in many parts of the world. The reader will find the book useful in such different environments like the public and private sector, or U.S. and international settings (I work and make decisions in Hungary's public sector). Making Great Decisions will be essential for professionals who need to convince partners with less developed decision making culture of the advantages of formal decision making. Think of joint ventures in emerging markets or reconstruction in Iraq! Cooperation with locals in decision making can be crucial for lasting results, and building trust or winning support is easier if you can explain the process clearly and quickly. Beyond improving their own decisions, personal decision makers can understand how decisions are made by organizations of various scales. Real life, personal stories transform the learning experience into a recreational activity even for individuals not really fond of management and economic topics. I recommend Making Great Decisions for everyone who wants to handle problems in personal life or carrier more effectively without the risk of loosing important points between the lines of boring textbooks 
 I remembered this book from my elementary school library, and was delighted to find that it had been reprinted.  This book is meant to be read out loud and deciphered - our children ages 16 down to 6 were entertained, as were the adults in the house too.  This book is just plain fun 
 Maxwell's Quick reference is the best little book to have as a medical student. Everybody in my class had one. Helpful with ACLS and EKGs, Lab values and equations, how to write orders and dictate/write notes and how to do H & P's . Also includes OBGYN and developmental milestones for pediatrics.  To top it off it has a great neurology section with charts and nerological exam helpers, including the mini-mental status, which is handy for psychiatry as well.  On the back is an Eye chart.  Included are several blank pages for note taking.  Mine are filled up now that I am almost through residency. Fun to look back at what I wrote as a student. But, this book was a savior then, and it is still helpful now. Get it, its cheap and handy.  
 I was a little dubious about this book when it was suggested that I read it, but I respect the co-worker who suggested it and decided to give it a try.  It is an informative and emotionally challenging read.  The book offers a different perspective about parenting, without passing negative judgements as many subject-related books do.  The most useful component of this book is that it suggests small changes and shifts in focus to help families support a child who struggles emotionally and socially.  These small changes do bring some measure of peace for parents who have been struggling to help their children become productive and successful people in the world 
 Looks very good on my stove and pleased with the quality 
         Scott Brick, who reads the Unabridged edition, is one of the most proficient voice performers to be found.  Dubbed a Golden voice by AudioFile, he's also garnered a Science Fiction Audie and a few Earphones Awards.  Gifted and versatile he brings the same standard of excellence to every title he reads, whether it be a mystery, historical biography or as in this case a high tech thriller.  His voice is clear, distinct and a pleasure to hear.  	The Abridged version is read by Jason Culp, an actor who has appeared both on stage and on television, most memorably on Days Of Our Lives and General Hospital.  While he does not have Mr. Brick's experience with audio books, his narrative is worthy and highly listenable.  	Fans of Clive Cussler and Jack Du Brul know what to expect - an exciting tale with action galore.  They won't be disappointed with Skeleton Coast.    	The covert combat ship with Juan Cabrillo and crew on board almost became history.    But luck was with them one more time, and they escaped virtually unscathed  after a mission on the Congo River.   Their survival is a good thing for a boat being fired upon.      Cabrillo responds to the craft's mayday, saving the vessel and a gorgeous woman passenger, Macintyre Sloane.  She's been searching for the HMS Rove which was buried under sand in 1896.  Why?  Because the Rove holds untold millions in raw diamonds.  	Of course, Sloane's not the only one after the fortune, and some would just as soon kill her to make sure she doesn't get it.  Cabrillo soon finds that saving Sloane has put him in more danger than he knew existed.  	Typical Cussler, which is terrific.           - Gail Cooke      	 
 Man this is a lecherous record, but lechery never felt so good.  This has got to be up there as the coolest half hour of tunes ever made.  You must own this.  One of the top twenty albums of the 70's for sure.  Really creepy but amazing.  The sea change comparison is on point, but this album is much less languid, and much more intriguing and exciting.  Buy it and creep yourslef out as you think how cool it is 
 This is a lovingly written biography about a famous film star from the 1940s and early 1950s.  The book goes into detail about all of Grable's films and successes as well as touching on her family life.  I found out  many things from this book.  For one, I had no idea Betty Grable was such a  popular actress.  For all I knew, she appeared on "I Love Lucy"  and did two or three movies.  I was certainly wrong!  It also includes  passing comments on a bevy of other stars, especially Marilyn Monroe and  Alice Faye.  This is a must buy for you if you enjoy Betty Grable, her  films, or the culture of the 1940s and 1950s 
 In her Xenogensis series, Butler is exploring how human beings will respond to changes brought by aliens as the humans struggle to survive.  This particular book, continues the human race's struggle to adapt and  change while maintaining some basic humanity.  The characters are numerous  and sometimes and the situations are complex but perhaps this complexity is  what Butler wants us to feel 
 Regardless of the type of attack an business might experience, this book deals with how to recover and make the best of a bad situation. This is not a politically motivated book, rather an insightful look at the best managers in the world today. What businesses can learn from Israeli management skills is that emergencies can occur naturally or unaturally. When they do occur, business might know how to survive the storm and rebuild 
 I am sad to say that I ALREADY READ that great book ALREADY DEAD!  What a WINNER!  Joe Pitt is Mr. Huston's newest character.  He is awesome.  This book is soooooooooo different from the usual and normal vampire books.  It is refreshing.  Yes, there is blood involved!  But it is just so different from the capes, sex, fangs, sun-up, sun-down, coffins -- yet it is all that -- but much, much MORE!  It is thrilling, exciting, fun, and scary!    The pace is fast and action packed.  The characters are weird, wild, and wonderful.    Mr. Huston can certainly tell a tale!  Don't miss this book.  You MUST read this book.  Then read his other two books, CAUGHT STEALING and SIX BAD THINGS.  While these are not vampire books, they are awesome and you will be left wanting for more.   Read the review listed above by BOOKMARKS -- I guess it is a compliment to love this book because then you are, to quote them, YOUNG, COOL, HIP, and UNSHOCKABLE.  Read this book.  Cross your fingers and we'll get another one!  Thanks Mr. Huston!!!!  Thanks!  Pam 
 Ok, I'm not really out to toot my own horn here, but I was already very good at photoshop before I got this book.  I think photoshop is one of the most important programs I own, and I use it all the time to do my own business cards and webpages, etc.  So I got this book because I'm a rather esoteric person and I want to gain real mastery over things that I'm good at.  This book did not let me down at all.  It shows you how to do some very cool moves in PS, and it gives you the background knowledge about why they work too.  If you are looking to become a true afficionado of this program, this is a great book to take with you on a long weekend 
 This book is practical. It doesn't ask you to magically turn your feelings off or to become a saint. There are things that often happen in life whether by people who are close to us or random strangers than can hurt us very deeply. When we are not able to come to terms with these events and they start to grow within our minds and take up too much space, the quality of our life suffers. This author respects our feelings, but lets us know how and why we can move through life's difficult situations and not allow them to consume us 
 If you love movies, or have friends who love movies- this is one of the most fun, informative, and entertaining books you could own or give as a gift. What a blast 
 This book gives you valuable information on how to create a low cost  curriculum. It has been a wonderful tool through the past 3 years. I keep  going back to this book for information! A must have for any beginning home  schooling mom 
 This book had more planning detail than did Martha Stewart's, which was excellent.  Like Martha Stewart, it also had excellent advice on traditions, etiquette and menus.  The decorations were very extravaggant, sometimes it seemed a bit much, but basically it is a matter of taste and budget, if you plan to use this book for decoration ideas. If you want simple elegance go with Martha, if you want a more lavish and abundant look, go with Colin. Both are comparable, the biggest difference is decoration style 
 I received the box collection 1-3, and 2 separate discs sets for series 4 and 5; and they are all my favorite dvds.  i watch them every nite at bedtime.  It appears only series 5 set has english subtitles and not the other series.  As well as commentaries available on perhaps series 4, but not all of them.  It is the must have for collections of highly educated people. If you like hilarious crass them you'll love ABFAB 
 Thank you, I like this program and it does what I need it to do 
 Ever have that 1 question on 'how to' conduct yourself in a business situation?  This book has the answers and the guidance on 'what to do.'  Even the most experienced professional comes across a business situation question ... it's nice to have the answer before the situation occurs 
 What a great book!  420 pages, hardback, and every single page is worth reading, not one page is boring.  You just want to keep reading and keep turning pages!  This is my first Nora Roberts' book.  I can't believe how good she writes!  I would recommend this book to everyone!  It's got murder, mystery, romance, people, the love of the land...  I'd love to find another book like this one!  I really enjoyed it.    (I'll let the other reviewers tell you about the story, I'm not so good at that. 
 Brilliantly hilarious, carefully crafted, beautifully expressive! Thumbs up for David Sedaris' Naked.   From the very first pages, Sedaris launches into a very individual style which he maintains throughout the book. Recounting personal stories and memories, Sedaris takes stabs at every member of his family, and anyone else he's had the fortune (or misfortune) to come in contact with. Addressing topics many wouldn't dare with a witty note and a laughable slant.   Sedaris stabs unabashedly at the American economy, issues of race, sexuality, gender, immigration, education, parenting, holidays, religion, and anything else he can possibly get his hands on. And he does it in a way that has you laughing from cover to cover. Sedaris' is a very real humor: To the point, and unrestricted.  The book itself seems to have very little linear motion. Each story contained within its own moment in time, wrapped up nicely into a complete, ever humerous chapter. Once started, it's nearly impossible to put down before finishing. A great read for anyone 
 Easy to understand.Much easier then other books on the market. A must for anybody that has the disease 
 Praising, That's It! by Tom Goff, Carmichael, CA   Rainer Maria Rilke: Sonnets to Orpheus.  Translated by Edward Snow. $22 (hb). 122p.  North Point Press,  19 Union Square West, NY 10003.  Published 2004.  ISBN # 0-86547-611-x.  For some years now, Edward Snow's free-verse translations of Rilke have allowed that German-speaking Czech poet (really an almost stateless wanderer for much of his life) to speak in English as the modernist he was at heart, his mastery of the sonnet, the elegy, and other verse forms notwithstanding.  Chances are that if you know the two books of New Poems-their sculptural intensities inspired by Rodin-you know them in Snow's version; and he has had equivalent success with Rilke's earlier Book of Images, as well as the Uncollected Poems, his terrific choice of works the poet mysteriously failed to unify.  So much does Snow emphasize the unknown Rilke, the poet of unsuspected toughness, of constant flickers of poetic improvisation, that he risks slighting the writer's pet projects.  In particular, Snow would like to revise the myth Rilke himself generated: that after beginning the Duino Elegies in high style in 1912-ready to utter his whole vision of life's and death's interconnectedness-he fell helplessly silent for almost ten years.  Silent, that is, until (working furiously in a secluded tower in Switzerland) he recaptured his touch in one magic February, in 1922.  Inspired as perhaps no other poet has ever been, Rilke poured forth the mystical utterances that would complete the Elegies, prompted by a creative icebreaker: the fifty-five Sonnets that are our subject.  So goes the legend, much of it true, if we credit Rilke's account of his suffering and triumph.   But Snow's introduction to his recent (2000) translation of the Elegies should be read between the lines: it's clear that this sequence of ten poetic meditations in the grand manner is not completely to Snow's taste, nicely rendered as his version is.  So it's a relief to see enthusiasm return as Snow now discusses, and then renders, the Sonnets to Orpheus, with a clarity and  (unrhymed) musicality these intimate poems-often inspirational teachings-require.    The Sonnets came to the poet as he pondered the last letters of Vera Ouckama Knoop (a friend of the poet's daughter Ruth); these described vividly the leukemia that ended this talented dancer-musician's life at nineteen.  Thoughts of Vera's fate mingled with musings about the mythic poet Orpheus, and with certain experiments in the sonnet form Rilke had recently been attempting (so much for the notion of total prior "blockage").   Once Rilke was started, there was no stopping the singing, as this example illustrates: 	 Wait..., this taste...Already it's escaping. 	...A bit of music, feet tapping, a hum-: You girls, with your silences, your warmth, dance the knowledge of the tasted fruit.  Dance the orange.  Who can forget it, the way it fights, drowning in itself, against its sweetness.  You've possessed it. Its deliciousness has entered you.  Dance the orange.  Fling the warmer landscape out from you, so the ripe fruit may glow in its native breezes!  Aglow yourselves, peel  perfume from perfume!  Create a kinship with the pure, reluctant rind, with the juice that fills the happy fruit!  			[First Part, Sonnet 15]  	Fine as this poem is on its own, it also benefits from the context.  Other sonnets help adumbrate its theme: how life's intensified by death, so that this poem's images might emanate from an "orange" realm habitable only by the dead, conjured into being by Orpheus (the Greek poet-musician, spirit of resurrection and transcendence); Vera may be among the "girls" the speaker summons, as if in the person of Orpheus himself.  (Snow, to be sure, would emphasize that "may be" and that "as if.")   	In past reviews, Snow's musicality has sometimes been faulted.  I beg to differ; he is true to the tone and tune of the work. If extended works of poetry have each a distinct voiceprint, the Duino  Elegies would fluctuate steeply, even erratically, above and below a vocal midpoint, as the poet swings from oratorical crowd control to anguished or ecstatic soliloquy and back.  The Sonnets to Orpheus have a more even tenor, yet still pulse with vibrancy.  They speak, intimate, instruct, reminisce, epiphanize, epitomize, or intone, with something like Buddhist serenity.    Snow has remarked of the Elegies that these, in the poet's view, were his masterwork, the Sonnets merely an unexpected "reward or `bonus' confirming the high oracular achievement" of the former.   But in Snow's new version, the Sonnets render that verdict exactly reversible:  it is as if Rilke suffered his spectacular blockage and release simply to say through the Sonnets (as one of them exclaims) "Praising, that's it!"  Rilke may have been summoned, like his Greek singer, to earn the right to that simple praise of life-life lived up to and over the threshold of death.  So: reader, go out and get ready to dance that particular orange.         
 Yeah, Yeah, I know.... He is a sellout. People these  days like to say "contrived" because they think it  makes them sound smart. This is a really good album with the mix of alot of things.. You hear Blues, Soul, Rock and a small bit of pop. Really, I think all of these things made the album as strong as it is.  I think blues albums need this or they start to become repetitive. This album is just full of really good songs that have some blues playing with soul like vocals. It mixs alot of the different genres I listen too.  Best tracks:  -Second Guessing -Walking Away -Cherry Red Wine -Still Rainin' -Wander This World -The Levee -Breakin Me -Leaving To Stay   It's a real shame he went to far pop on his next album 
 While I enjoyed this, I also felt that (1) it seemed likely to be more fully appreciated by a fan of world music than a novice; and (2) for world music, it seemed pretty subdued overall.  First, only 3 of the 11 pieces will likely be familiar to many American listeners.  Some of the songs are traditional holiday songs in their cultures--one of these is the lovely "Nadal de Luintra," from Galicia, Spain, where the language is a version of Portuguese and the culture is Celtic (!).  Other songs are original compositions, like Ivan Lins' "Noite para Festejar."  While wonderfully Brazilian, this song might as well be an homage to Yemaya as to Papae Noel.  Another _World Christmas_ from 1996 (the compilation benefits Special Olympics and features Cesaria Evora, Angelique Kidjo, Papa Wemba, the Gipsy Kings, Ruben Blades, Dianne Reeves, & others) has almost the reverse proportion of familiar to unfamiliar holiday songs, and would likely appeal more to a world music novice.  Also, with its Latin & Afropop rhythms, that compilation was much more lively overall than this one.  This one does have a thumping Cajun piece from Michel Doucet, but other pieces are very soothing.  Even one of the Latin pieces on this one, the vallenato "Diciembre" from Colombia, seemed very gentle.  The steel drums seemed very plodding (compare with their use on "Santa Claus is Coming to Town" on the other compilation).  The Hawaiian instrumental was lovely and very, *very* mellow.  The choices are interesting, too:  there are *2* from Galicia, but nothing from Africa (unless you count the diaspora cultures of Jamaica, Barbados, & Brazil).  Maybe on Putumayo's next holiday release, we'll hear more from Africa.  (Why not Asia, as well?  True, much of Asia does not observe the holiday, but most Filipinos and some Koreans do).  Putumayo's liner notes are excellent and are an aid in appreciating the music.  I am looking forward to a sequel

 I want to thank Mr. Juarez for writing such and honest hard-hitting account of his years as an officer in the Chicago Police Department. You have shown that anyone who puts on the badge must confront not only the bad actors in our society but also the demons     nestled in one's own psyche. This is cautionary tale with a deeply redeeming ending; a must-read for anyone who is considering a career in law enforcement. 
 For all you naysayers out there, you definitly do not know art. This is a work of perfect art by one of the greatest artists of all, Luca Turilli. The CD of course is the 3rd in his solo trilogy, the finale of his story. The Infinite Wonders of Creation centers on the concept of spiritualism and mother earth in general. Joining Luca and head vocalist Olaf Hayer in this album is female vocalist Bridget Fogle, and to amazing results.  Going through track by track.  1: Secrets of the Forgotten Ages: 7/10 - an excellent intro track, leads you into the new feel and sound of the album but doesn't really take off, its just there.  2: Mother Nature: 10/10 - Female Vocalist Bridget Fogle really gets to shine in this powerful but stunningly beautiful piece centered on exactly as the title says. This track alone proves many naysayers wrong about her, her voice lends itself to the theme beautifully and Mother Nature was written for her and her alone it would seem.  3: Angels of the Winter Dawn: 10+/10 - Simple amazing, it blew me away, starting with the powerful vocals of Olaf Hayer then leading into a duet with Bridget Fogle, this track is definitly the highlight of the entire album, that will get you singing and airguitaring along over and over. It will get stuck in your head and no that is not a bad thing.  4: Altitudes: 7/10 - Another Bridget Fogle lead track, its beautiful but could have been better as I'll get into later, something was just missing.  5: The Miracle of Life: 10/10 - It opens with the sounds of Dolphins and Whales then Olaf takes off again with Bridget, it seems whenever they do a duet, the song is gold and this song is pure gold, Bridget and Olaf sing with eachother and bounce off perfectly creating an amazing blend of vocals to go with Luca Turilli's powerful instrumentals.  6: Silver Moon: 7/10 - Bridget leads in this beautiful ballad, not as powerful as the songs with Olaf but it suits the song well.  7: Cosmic Revelation: 8/10 - Beautiful female led ballad, that really captures the mood of the cosmos and sets the mood for what is to come next.  8: Pyramids and Stargates: 10/10 - Olaf is back and with Bridget again strikes up a duet, about the Egyptian Pyraminds and the spiritual and cosmotic wonder of the Pyramids and Stargates, a truly powerful piece of music.  9: Mystic and Divine: 10/10 - A duet again, Olaf as the main vocals Bridget as backup setting the soprano tone, one cant describe this piece, it simply is there and when you hear it, it captures the spirit of what Luca wished to be seen and as the album is the about the Infinite Wonders of Creation, this piece captures that moment perfectly.  10: The Infinite Wonders of Creation: 9/10 - a Little bit of everything and everyone in this piece, it works but not to the perfection of many of the other duets, maybe because there is just so much in it, it is by far the longest of the songs in the entire CD but not the least, as the CD reaches its climatic finale.  Bonus: Altitudes (piano version): 9/10 - this is how this song was to be heard, the version earlier in the CD, is beautiful but the song works better with the simpler instrumental, the piano accompanyment with the almost operatic sound of Bridget's voice makes this version all the more beautiful.   Overall, buy this CD, it does everything one would ask in a CD, it captures all the emotions, hope, love, sorry, anger, joy,everything and does this all while sparking your imagination and wonder of the glorious and Infinite Wonders of Creation 
 The book gives a interesting view into the history, politics and religion of LDS Utah. It illustrates the circustances surounding Mark Hoffman and his crime, and how he was able to do as he did. I can see why some opponents to the book claim it to be anti-Mormon. It is very blunt in the facts regarding the LDS Church's involment as well as the business practices of church members.   
 I teach a beginner writing course for ESL students preparing for college, and we use this book to help students develop that all-important voice. The stories are simple but full of feeling, and resonate deeply with my mostly Latino students. Yes, there are incomplete sentences and words that don't belong in academic writing, but I find my students understand the concept of personal vs. academic writing, and can enjoy the book on its own terms. In addition, it could easily form the basis of a reading course for students once they are beyond the very early stages of learning English. 
 I enjoyed reading this book with my 8 year old daughter.  It is a very touching story about a family who lives on the move and does not have many of the things that families take for granted...like a real home, friends, the reassuring familiarity of school and daily routines.  It is a thought  provoking look at a very different sort of life.  I think it made my  daughter appreciate some of the things she just assumed that everyone has.   It's an advanced read. More of a book to read together as the words are  somewhat difficult and the storyline sometimes needs some explanation.  But  the characters are wonderful and good triumphs over evil in the end.  We  love a happy ending!  I'm sure we will read it often over the years 
      Victory presents a philosophical story of a man who learns that his own philosophy has robbed him of a life worth living.  The novel is Conrad's answer to the prevailing view that only facts matter, that emotions such as love have no basis in reality.            The protagonist, Axel Heyst, is the son of a philosopher who once wrote, "Of the strategems of life, the most cruel is the consolation of love."  His philosophy Conrad compares to a "terrible trumpet which had filled heaven and earth with ruins..."After his father dies, Heyst wanders the globe, looking "only for facts" until he becomes enchanted with a South Sea archipelago.  Therafter, he is drawn to two people who provide models of friendship and love.  Morrison, a small craft owner whose generosity has left him bankrupt, Heyst helps out of his bind only to fail to understand why the man is so grateful and anxious to repay him.  But it is the girl Lena who fills him with an emotion that he cannot express or understand until the novel's end.  After rescuing her from a life of exploitation, Heyst takes her back to his island where he is determined to live apart from the world.         It's only after his island is invaded by two criminals that Heyst discovers how much his actions toward Morrison and Lena were motivated by love.  When he learns that the jealous hotelkeeper, Schomberg, has told everyone that "the Swede" had swindled his friend out of all his money before sending him to England to die, Heyst becomes upset, even though he had never cared what the world thought of him.  When the malefactors Jones and Ricardo threaten Lena's life, he at last becomes involved in the world that he had left behind.         Suspenseful and chilling, Heyst's fight with the criminals ends with a victory having multiple meanings.  Unlike with his other work, Conrad falls back on the plot device of coincidence to make a satisfactory ending, but the artifice only slightly mars a book that should be read as much for its message as for its story 
 This book is awesome, It mentions great ways to reframe our toxic way of thinking in an optimistic approach. I would love to teach this material in a class because it affects all of us 100%. The concepts and ideas are  staggering and if we apply these principles to our daily lives we are going  to live longer and more productive lives as well as reduce depression,  hostility and divorce. If you can read, read this book, you will not be  disappointed!   If you are a therapist ot teacher it would be even more  beneficial for you to spread this wonderful knowledge like wildfire.  thanx   : 
 This is the same book as How to Play and Win at Gin Rummy by Chet Wander.  See my review of it.  This is the hardcopy version.  This is one book that you want to read.  If you have a choice the writing in this book is larger than the paperback 
 Whether you have a passing fancy with movie editing, or just want to understand the anatomy of one of our greatest media achievements, you will like this book.  It is brief, clear and drops you into the world of film in a blink of an eye 
 Frankly, and without embellishment, one of the most sincere and important books I've ever read on churchgoing. I was desperate for an entertaining and accessible-yet-astute account of the history of American churchgoing, told without the usual tilted, pejorative, all-others-will-burn dogma. Butler Bass writes compassionately about her personal journey -- she went from a narrower mindset to a more inclusive spiritual practice. This book might leave you as invigorated and hopeful as it did me 
 I was so happy to find this book!  My daughter really liked the quiz and found it so helpful as a starting point to figuring out how to set up her dorm room....also sent one to her roommate-to-be so they could connect for the first time.  It was a great way for them to sketch out how they wanted their room and  share some conversations and ideas.  Highly recommend keeping a few on hand to have as gifts for those kids experiencing dorm life... 
 After reading Peter Levine's book I found a practioner of "Somatic Experiencing" from his web site in my city. From the first day I saw her I have been releasing trauma in the gentlest way I have ever experienced. This method has helped me release trauma that no other method has ever done and releases from the deepest layers I thought I would just have to live with forever. I have very  complex PTSD from years of severe and sadistic child abuse from several perpretrators. Talk therapy, journaling, art therapy were helpful but just couldn't clear the fear, grief, hopelessness, that I carried. Emotional Freedom technique was also helpful and some other body therapies but this is my favorite.   There is a LOT more to the healing techniques of Somatic Experiencing than in this book. I look forward to learning more techniques to clear the trauma from my body/mind. Somatic Experiencing is giving me the life I struggled so hard for  in many years of previous therapy to attain. And it is so much easier, with less tears, hard work and pain! I have never experienced the levels of inner peace and calm that I have now. All my relationships are improving as well.   For someone like myself, this will take more than 6 sessions as one person mentioned. I have a highly skilled therapist who is trained by Dr. Peter Levine in Somatic Experiencing. I know it will take many months to complete my healing but I have accomplished more in 15 sessions with her than being in therapy off and on for 16 years, reading books, and doing all kinds of things to get my life back.   My life is just easier in every way. Thank you, Dr. Peter Levine, for helping me heal so I have a life worth living and making a difference in my son's life as well 
 I thought that director Yôji Yamada could not possibly top Twilight Samurai, but I was wrong. This is a great film for even those that are not martial arts fans.  The acting is great, the screenplay is excellent and believable.   Director Yamada also had great cinematographers and music.  Since the story for both Twilight Samurai and Hidden Blade were written by the same author and took place in the same part of Japan, one reviewer unfairly indicated the story was a rehash of the first. Definitely, I disagree with this assessment.    I don't want to give anything away. For those that are like me, be sure to have a box of tissues handy when you see this memorable film.  I rented it and was so taken by the film (even watching it twice during the same weekend), that I purchased the DVD immediately from Amazon. 
 We enjoyed reading all of Dave Pelzer's books.  Excellent reading for all 
 After checking out the Graedon's book, we stocked up on a few items as we headed out of town for a weekend camping trip. One of their recommendations is Alka-Seltzer for bee stings. (We had never heard of this!) When one of  our daughters was unfortunate enough to cross paths with a bee while  identifying wild flowers, we popped a wet Alka-Seltzer on the site of the  sting. She was skeptical, but the pain and swelling was completely gone in  a few minutes. We won't go anywhere without Alka-Seltzer this summer and a  few of the other home remedies they recommend. Excellent! Everybody needs a  copy in their home library 
 The author has done a wonderful job of researching the years of the dust bowl. I found this book to be excellent although depressing, if that makes sense.  I am in awe that anyone stayed on the prairies and survived at all. Eating pickled tumble weed to your family because nothing else would grow. May we all learn to respect the land and never let this happen again 
 What a wonderful cookbook. Every glossy photo will have you salivating for more! This book has a balanced collection of recipes for every diet. There are meaty dishes, fabulous seafood dishes, vegetarian dishes and most of them seem pretty light. The dessert collection is small but very appealing. I have to say the best part of this book is the simplicity of the recipes. Nothing too intimidating but still adventurous. Highlights: Chocolate Crepes with Tangerines and Dark Chocolate Orange Sauce Mediterranean Orzo Salad Roasted Salmon with peas and edamame beans with a raw pea pesto Salmon and ginger cakes with Orange-Miso dipping sauce Walnut Pancakes with carmelized bananas This cookbook is a great addition to any cookbook collection.  
 Normally you would have to pay 100.00$ each for good boat plans.  Here are  16 for under 10.00$ Here is the rare step hydroplane. Here is the  centerboard daysailor. Mahogany lake boats?, choose from 4 or more.    Enjoy 
 simply smooth. all tracks are oustanding. its difficult to point a favourate 
 I didn't think I'd like this book as much as I actually did.  It was informative, questioning, and thought provoking.  Great for someone who knows little about ecological literacy but wants to know more.  A good beginner's book for someone starting to realize the intrinsic value in nature 
 This is a great book for one who is looking for an easy-to-understand but in-depth analysis of Kieslowski's various films. Although the most recent trilogy is yet to be incorporated into this text, this book nonetheless serves as both a foundation and structure for studies on the 'transcendental' image. This book also cites varying philosophers and important literary figures. A good sum-up point would be the fact that almost all characters, as described by the author, are in between something, usually dichotomies, like life and death. 
 Biggest gripe is that the book has scarcely any mention of the internet, since it was written in the 90s sometime.  All the concepts, examples, and language are geared toward a young, potential investor, a teenager pretty much.  Easy reads are nice sometimes, and this is one of them.  Lots of support for the free market, which made me happy.  Also strong support for stocks as a method of investment vs other investment possibilities.  Even though the book is devoid of the internet, it is a small enough commitment to be definitely a worthy read 
 John Kenneth Galbraith is the personification of Liberalism.  And if you want a detailed insight into what the enduring essence of Liberalism is, not as it is defined by its political enemies, but by its greatest exponent in America, this lengthy, detailed, and highly readable biography of Galbraith is for you.  Ambitious in its scope and breadth, this book is far more than a "life" of Galbraith.  You get three books for the price of one here.  You get, of course, a biography of Galbraith, a man of considerable brilliance who led a fascinating life.  You get a history of American polity, particularly in economics, from the Depression to the close of the Twentieth Century.  And perhaps most important, you get the story of how Galbraith's central ideal, the ideal of an intelligent public policy exercised by democratically elected government has fared in America during this period.   Central to Galbraith's economics is the belief that representative government can be a powerful force for good, and (to use Galbraith's term) an essential "countervailing power" to private interest.  Starting with Galbraith's career as an agricultural economist in the New Deal, and going to the end of the Clinton administration, Parker's book follows Galbraith's responses to, and in some cases impact upon, the key events and political and economic controversies of the times.  Along the way the reader gains a detailed insight into how the post-WWII American consensus of a partnership between government, business, and labor, committed to the common good, began to break down in the 1970s and 1980s, and how we arrived at today's "conventional wisdom" (another term that Galbraith coined) that cynically practices the self-fulfilling prophecy that nothing beneficial can emanate from the public sector.   For those who are particularly interested in academic economics, this biography gives a fascinating account of Galbraith's long battle against the rise of a brand of mathematical microeconomics uninterested in any so-called "exogenous" factors such as observable facts and real-world issues, and which had nothing to offer in social policy beyond, as Parker writes, "a future of endless consumption of endlessly more goods."  As an alternative to the metric of "allocational efficiency" (for example, "just in time" practices, outsourcing jobs to cut costs) Galbraith proposed an alternative metric he called "the minimization of social tension."  Although Galbraith is often now considered marginalized by his political and intellectual opponents, this book makes a powerful case for revisiting his approach to economics as being inseparably linked to institutional, political, and even psychological issues.  As Parker writes, Galbraith's approach to economics is concerned above all with "the fundamental issue of how societies and civilizations work".   Now more than ever this book is a necessary reminder of why Galbraith's voice is of continuing relevance.  Parker, himself an eminent economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, has succeeded with a light touch in highlighting the resonance today of Galbraith's approach to basic questions of public policy.  Often his narrative of Galbraith's thinking on an issue he faced at a particular point in his career suggests a critique of the economic policies being pursued today. Galbraith the economist, the writer, and the public figure was all too often right when the "conventional wisdom" was wrong.  His highly literate and often ironic expression of unpopular views are well worth listening to, from the ineffectiveness of strategic bombing in World War II, to the  disastrous American involvement in Vietnam, to the true economic, moral, political, and opportunity costs of the militarization of America in the Cold War, to the Social Darwinism which is the all-too-inevitable consequence of untrammeled worship of "the market" as "the omniscient, the omnipotent, the omnipresent metric by which all was to be measured", and which replaced the old partnership consensus starting in the 1980's 
 I was timid to use my Merkur razor for the first time, and was very careful around my neck. A week or so after starting I feel like a pro. These razors are very sharp and keep their edge for at least six or seven shaves. It truly doesn't even feel like I'm shaving, the cut is so effortless 
 I first heard of "The Celebration" in "The New York Times Guide to the Best 1000 Movies Ever Made".  That book has been a good guide to movies I would otherwise have missed.  However, it also includes "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" so I use a certain amount of scepticism when viewing its' selections.  Some movies that are "on the edge" like "Naked Lunch" had no appeal for me whatsoever.  However, "The Celebration" is definitely "on the edge" and it is also an excellent movie.  It accomplishes this status by inviting us into a dysfunctional celebration of a dysfunctional family and leaves us feeling like dysfunctional observers.    "The Celebration" gives us opportunities to formulate opinions of fact and personalities and then turns everything around to challenge what we've already concluded.  It makes us uncomfortable while getting us focussed so as not to miss anything that may happen next.  In the end we are both sorry that things turned out the way they did and thankful for the opportunity to have witnessed it.  As for myself, I am all the happier that I am related to whom I am related too.  These kind of skeletons are too much for any closet.  I understand that there is a lot of innovations in "The Celebration".  That is all well and good and I'm sure that the hardcore students of the cinema are thrilled with the results.  However, different as it may be, it is still a movie that captures its' audience for what it is rather than how it got there.  It's probably not a good movie to watch at family reunions, however.   
 There were two versions of the Messengers, a Quintet and Sextet. The Quintet of Shorter, Morgan, Timmons, Merrit, produced many great albums, but did not have the incredibly powerful drive that the later sextet sessions would produce. The Messengers classic sextet version yielded 7 or so studio albums 3 for the Prestige/riverside unit and four for Bluenote. The first for the sextet of Hubbard, Fuller, and Shorter, was "Mosaic", then Followed by "Buhainas delight". The group made three prestige albums "Caravan", "Ugetsu" recorded live at birdland, and "Kyoto". The Thunderous "Free for all" on bluenote was the 'new' sextets Bluenote Debut and featured Blakeys Volcanic playing. "Indestructable" was The Messengers last for bluenote and featured the same sextet except Lee Morgan went in for Freddie Hubbard. "Indestructable" is not as hard driving and volcanic as "Free For All" or "Mosaic" but is still a very prolific recording and the group is very solid. The material is all original, two each by Fuller and Shorter; and one each by Morgan and Walton. The opener, "Egyptian" by fuller, has a feeling that makes it "Indestructable". "Sortie" Also by fuller, features Lee Morgans bright, hip trumpet playing. "Calling miss Kadija" is a 3/4, 24 bar blues or 6/4, 12 bar blues by Morgan who has written many similar pieces. "When Love is New", a Walton tune, seems like the title of a standard but is a quite original ballad. The latter two tunes, "Mister Jin" and "It's a Long Way Down" are Shorter originals and have very unique Harmony and balance. Every single player is in top notch form and the only flaw is that the bass could have been recorded better. "Indestructable" lives upto it's title. 
  I am a dedicated martial artist that has been frustrated in my attempts to attain greater flexibility. Despite my previous instructor's claim that these types of machines are a waste of time & money, I decided to investigate the potential effectiveness of the "Versaflex". Based on this investigation, I purchased this machine & in the very short amount of time that I have used it, I am really happy. For me it makes stretching very relaxing & comfortable. I am very impressed!  
 A fascinating book!  Well-supported with evidence and inspoiring case examples, and a good read as well.  Quality bedtime or pleasure reading, whether you think you're a music lover or not.  Highly recommende 
 The book "Hiroshima" by John Hersey is a wonderful work of literature that characterizes and explains the atomic bombing of the city Hiroshima so well that you can almost imagine the whole ordeal in your mind. John Hersey uses imagery throughout the book. Phrases such as "everything flashed whiter than any white she had ever seen" captivate the reader and make the book interesting and enjoyable. The author also writes in a style like no other. He tells the story of six victims that survived the bombing. He tells the story from their point of view and their experiences. It not only tells of the victim's accounts of the bombing experience, it also tells of how the victims live their lives after the bombing and far after the war. Some victims suffer from radiation sicknesses, and the author tells how they live with it and how they get over it. The book often leaves you hanging skipping from person to person and it makes you want to read the book all in one sitting. The book also creates in the reader a sympathy for those victims of the bombing. As you read the book you learn and feel more and more sympathetic for these people. Overall this book is a great read, and I would recommend it for anyone who is particularly interested in World War II 
 This movie has been my #1 Comedy for many years... still is... and most likely will continue to be for many years to come.  It speaks to anyone "raised" in a cubicle - you will find in almost all the characters "someone" you knew at some point in your life, when you worked at "so and so".  So many real-life scenarios I felt as if someone had been watching me with a camera back in those days!  And every time I've watched it (and yes... that number is in the "double" digits) I always find something that I overlooked or have forgotten about and rediscover it with delight and laugh out loud all over again, as if for the first time!  A true gem!  Feeling blue?  Just pop this movie... you'll forget your worries - if only for a couple of hours.. 
 Tomie De Paola's version of "The Legend of the Bluebonnet" is a wonderful tale of sacrifice, and homage to the importance of family and community.  The young Native American girl has been orphaned due to a terrible drought, and lives alone.  Yet, she is willing to give up the only thread of the connection to her past.  She sacrifices her prized possesion, her doll by placing it upon the sacrifical fires of her tribe.  The sacrifice is rewarded by the gods with rains to end the drought which claimed her family.  There is yet another gift from the gods for the girl's unselfish act.  Beautiful bluebonnets now grow in the wilds commemorating the child's gift to the gods on the behalf of her people.  The artful depiction of the drought, and the renewal of the earth when the rains come tell the tale of the desperation, and the hope in "The Legend of Bluebonnet".  This selection pairs nicely with Barbara Cooney's "Miss Rhumphius" for classroom literature comparisons.  This is a must for the elementray library.  A fine example of integrated science literature 
 I think if Charles Bukowski, Dylan Thomas, and Fellini collaborated on a piece of writing, it's possible they would have come up with this screenplay. This movie is exciting because it's soooo different from anything I've ever seen. Deliciously non-linear. The substance abuse aspect is a little overdone but that's the destiny of "artist movies". I loved hearing the dialog, and Kristofferson's acting is the best I've ever seen by him. Anything so daring and so unconventional will naturally upset some people (like other reviewers here), but if you ask me that only validates the work. If ever I go to New York City, the Hotel Chelsea will be at the top of my list of places to visit. My favorite lines were by the crazy guy in the elevator, who after claiming to have had a conversation with Dylan Thomas said that ghosts naturally reside in places like the Chelsea because people will listen to them there. The DVD extras contain a couple of quirky interviews, one with director Ethan Hawke and the other with Robert Sean Leonard who plays a deeply troubled folksinger in the film 
 Clever and funny, this tongue-in-cheek book is for "grown-ups" who love babies and aren't afraid to act like one. A perfect gift for new parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and siblings of babies. And did I mention "witty"? My favorite is #66, which I would have named "The Sisyphus." These "97 ways" actually work--or I know alot of silly babies. Don't forget to leave a copy around for the babysitter 
 Kind of a basic look at behavioral finance. Easy too read, not very long (approx. 110 pgs). Overall a good introduction to the tendenecies people have when investing 
 How good? Well, as soon as I finished reading American Gods I didn't immediately turn back to Page 1 and start reading it again (I have only ever done this once), but I did immediately go online to see whether Anansi Boys, the sequel, was available in paperback yet. It wasn't. I'm going to have to wait, dammit! :-) But I was completely absorbed from start to finish and will be re-reading it again very soon.  Prior to reading American Gods I had only seen the concept of 'gods among us' explored by Douglas Adams in his Dirk Gently books, where it is treated realistically and handled with dignity by Adams' deliciously humorous prose. Neil Gaiman takes the concept further, exploring the ramifications of multi-cultural pantheons (having been introduced to the New World by assorted multi-national settlers) trying to get by in modern America, and the problems arising therefrom, in a completely realistic way: I could imagine everthing in American Gods actually happening, which I didn't with Adams.  The focus on roadside tourist attractions strongly reminded me of Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita, but Gaiman's attendent observations and extraordinary attention to detail struck me as being much more personal and direct.  The story is told largely through the experiences of Shadow, a mortal who finds himself working for one of the American gods and having to come to terms with their perspective on life and approach to doing business. In the end, of course, his involvement in events is critical to their outcome.  Like watching The Shawshank Redemption, American Gods is a story that unfolds, rather than a series of scenes staged for effect, and in this respect I cannot praise it highly enough. I found it a thoroughly engrossing read on all levels, immediately earning itself a place in my all-time top ten novels 
 An amazingly insightful helpful tool to reinvent your life. I recommend it for anyone who wishes to alter their current state of being in a positive way 
  crocs are very comfy and are great for walking and for wareing to the beach. I ware mine everyday. they are very useful because u can just slide them on or u can put the strap on and run in them and they wont come off 
 This is an excellent book about dogs, readable even by those who do not like them. Elizabeth Maxwell Thomas writes fascinating stories about daily life with her pets, anecdotes both humorous and sad. As I read about her wonderful dogs--the incredibly intelligent Sundog, sweet Pearl, confused Misty, and goofy Ruby--I found myself looking at my dog, wondering why she wasn't nearly as interesting as Thomas's. (If I had to choose a favorite dog from the book, the human-like Sundog would be my choice.) There are also scientific bits about how wolves gradually became domesticated and why, dogs of Third World nations, and so on. This is a great book, one that everyone should read 
 Van McDermid, a first-rate writer of psychological thrillers, can be tantalizing in her detail and measured pace.  I'm just used to fast paced, gory stories.  This book introduces the Tony Hill and Carole Jordan characters and the uncertainty of their relationship is believable.  The characters gradually develop depth and start a reltionship that will last for a number of books and TV movies.  I can't tell you how it ends, but you will be surprised.  The pace of the book presented the only negative part of the experience.  The TV movies don't waste any time, but McDermid, much like P.D. James, takes a lot of time building characters and settings.  Overall I enjoyed this book.  I did find it tiring 
 I absolutely loved this book. I could not put it down. Right from the start, you are pulled into Koontz's world. I must have looked like a starving maniac while reading this book. Highly recommend it 
  I bought this sweet little thing because I am planning a day in NYC and don't want to bring along my regular camera, which is bulky. This camera is nice and small and would fit in any purse or coat pocket. It has 5 MP and a 3X optical zoom which is great for the price. The pictures I took outside turned out outstanding. Inside pics were a bit pixelated, but I may have had the settings wrong. The camera is easy to use right out of the box.  Perfect for a second camera to keep on you just in case 
 Maybe some people got a bad batch of this laundry detergent- I ordered a case, and every bottle has been fine. They all have the no-drip cap and the consistency is just like any liquid detergent. This product has worked great for my family, which, by the way, includes three teenaged boys who really know how to make clothes dirty. I would definitely buy this product again 
 Great sharing of experience and informative. I read half the book in a day or 2. I couldn't put it down. It isn't a specialty book, it covers many aspects of the national geographic photographer. Worth the money and much cheaper then retail in Barnes and Noble 
 Tom Brokaw said of this book:  "Three Cups of Tea is one of the most remarkable adventure stories of our time.  Greg Mortenson's dangerous and difficult quest to build schools in the wildest parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan is not only a thrilling read, it's proof that one ordinary person, with the right combination of characgter and determination, really can change the world"  For me, Three cups of Tea is a beautiful true story of one man's efforts to improve the lives of children, particularly girls, located in remote villages in Pakistan and Afghanistan.  The book is well written, keeping suspense and interest as the story is told.  Of particular interest is the description of life in these remote villages and the frightening and agressive work by the Taliban in setting up Madrassa schools to train and recruit terrorists to the Radical Islamic cause.  Congressman Mary Bono said .."and I'm his biggest fan. "The sacrifices that he and his family have made are staggering. "He represents the best of America" (page 291).  This book is a good read that will leave you with both a better undertsanding of the struggle for the future of our civilization as well as a warm feeling that something can be done by a common man and all of us 
 John Belushi has been, I think, one of the most misunderstood late celebrities in recent memory. This was due in large part to a certain book by a certain reporter, whose name I won't speak here. Judy Belushi Pisano went a long way towards setting the record straight in "Samurai Widow," letting the public into her grieving process and the aftermath of John's death in 1982.   Now we've come full circle with this wonderful biography of the man himself, told by those who knew him best. John was many things to many people, and all facets of his life and personality are talked about in this book, often with amazing candor.  I also have to comment on the wealth of photos included in the book, many from the private collections of Judith and the Belushi family. They're a real treat to see (John was a very cute little boy) and add to the sense that this is a very personal biography.  Fans of John will love this book. It reveals the funny, kind, infuriating, generous person that we as his fans, who could only know and love him through his work, always knew he really was 
 Thank you for asking.  You know I sent for this book during a very busy time for the Post Office; yet I got the book quickly and in fine shape.  I really needed it when I got it.  I had to give an overview of church bookkeeping and accounting to my church last week.  I used the book to outline my presentation to the Finance Committee!  I was a hit, thanks to the book.  They appointed me bookkeeper for the church.  I told them that I could not accept the position on a permanant basis.  I did accept it as a tempt until they get a permanent (younger person--I'm 76).    Since you have been sooooooo nice, could you recommend a Basic Accounting book that I could use as the church's bookkeepper?  I would like to give our small church (300-350 people) some good accounting methods/principles. The Basis Accounting book should be for just basic accounting, not church accounting or bookkeepping.  I just got that from you.  You're great. Thank you sooooo much, George Mucherso 
 Whats great about this book is not just the content, about which all other reviews have been raving anyway, but its paper, spiral binding and hard cover.  The glossy paper makes it readable even if you shine a low-energy red light on it. The spiral-binding allows you to flip thru the pages easily while you hold the book folded in 360 degrees. And the hard-bound cover enables you to hold the book with one hand over your head while you shine the torch on the book with other hand and gaze at the stars above 
 This import collection is far superior to their other "Songs To Learn And Sing" disc. It reminds me of how much better the Police import "Greatest Hits" is than the "Classics" album. "Ballyhoo" is 18 tracks, and includes songs like "Over The Wall", "The Game", and the cover of "People Are Strange" that the other collection missed. Plus it has "Lips Like Sugar", which I think is one of the best alternative songs of the 80's. If you hesitate to get this because of the price, I bought it used through Amazon for less than half that amount, and in perfect condition. A must for fans of The Cure, Smiths, etc 
 In this novel, O'Brien masterfully charts the impact of violent traumas on one man, from a dreadful experience as a child, through his involvement in Vietnam and the My Lai massacre, to the disappearance of his wife.  O'Brien's exploration of the complex relationship between real events and unfulfilled desires, coupled with his discussion of the nature and value of truth, makes for a fascinating read.  O'Brien pairs actual testimony from soldiers in My Lai with a fictional mystery, allowing him to humanize those who participated in the massacre without at all diminishing the atrocity.  O'Brien is an amazing writer, and though In the Lake of the Woods provides no solution to the mystery it presents, the novel does not feel at all incomplete.  Rather, it is a read well-worth whatever frustration comes from not knowing the 'truth' of the situation 
 These are the most comfortable underwear I have ever worn. They are so soft and flexible, it almost feels like you aren't even wearing underwear. I plan on purchasing more of this item 
 I'm surprised by some of the negativity in the other reviews posted here, because Antoine Bello's debut mystery novel is a tremendous surprise, clever, witty, gripping and beautifully constructed. Creating a parallel world where building jigsaw puzzles is one of the big spectator sports, Bello perfectly satirizes how sports are reported, how the participants act and interact with others, the development of prodigies, and then he creates a puzzle itself out of the topic, forcing readers to think far more interactively about the mystery than most books in the genre.  It's certainly different, and that might put off some people, but it's a daring and fresh work in the oft-tired mystery world. And if you or anyone you know likes to build jigsaw puzzles, this is an absolute must buy 
 This is the best power metal album that I have ever heard, you will not be dissapointed!, I guarantee you! This album has a lot of varieety within their songs, but the group still maintains BG's esscence. Instant requirment in your collection!  Spanish: No duden en comprar este album, simplemente es el mejor de power q he escuchado JAMÁS 
 Great vacuum.  I like the fact that you can see the lint in the canister so you know when it's time to empty.  Sucks lint like a fiend.  I even sucked up my wife's sock by accident.  It didn't skip a beat.  Long cord allows the user to do several rooms without switching outlets.  Not too heavy to lug around, either.  Very well engineered.  I read many reviews about the turbo head attachment.  Most didn't like it, but I found it to work very well.  No issues whatsoever.  It worked very well on my carpeted staircase 
 The author does a good job of explaining HDTV and surround sound clearly. Not a book you'd read cover to cover at the beach, but if you just dip into it when you need to know something, it does its job quite well 
      There's certainly no dearth of information or misinformation on ADHD available to the public.  However, compiling a comprehensive knowledge base for the newly initiated is a challenge.  I came across this book after reading nearly everything the public library had to offer on ADHD.  In this book Dr. Flick succinctly puts together an excellent resource on all the evidence-based information on ADHD.  He also includes sections on "alternative" treatments that will appeal to some but is careful to indicate where science meets the marketting.       If you're new to ADHD this tome may be a little intimidating.  The writing is here is a bit more dry than some other good sources on the subject like Barkley, Rosenthal, Phelan or Hallowell.  Also as with all books on ADHD published before 2000-2002 some of the details on medication are out of date.  The only serious omission is an explicit section on choosing good professionals to help you manage ADHD.  But if you read and assimilate all the information in this book you should become a good judge of whether or not every member of your treatment team is functioning well.       If you are only buying one book on ADHD to keep on your shelf at home this is it 
 "The Gift of Being Yourself" is an exceptional investigation of the subject of self-identity.   The author, David Benner, is able to masterfully bridge the Biblical paradox of death-to-self and self-discovery.  He writes, "For if we find our true self we find God, and if we find God, we find our most authentic self."  We don't find our true self by seeking self-identity but by seeking God.    Benner sees our identity not as a creation but as a discovery and as a gift from God.  By discovering and living our uniqueness, we fulfill our destiny.  The purpose of the book is to assist people in the transformational journey of becoming their true self in Christ and living out the vocation that this involves.  To do so we must know ourselves as known by God.  In knowing ourselves and knowing God we can experience the gift of being ourselves.      The author contends that through self-deception, we tend to confuse our true self with some ideal self we wish we were. We adopt mask that portray us differently than who we authentically are. Self-discovery is not to escape reality but to commit to it.  We must decide to accept what is really there and accept ourselves as we are and accept God as He is, not how we would want each to be. Spiritual transformation does not result from fixing our problems.  Our sin nature is not self-fixable.  Instead, spiritual transformation results from turning to God in the midst of our problems and meeting God just as we are.    It starts by coming to know God.  If we come to know God, we come to know love, and to love God is to know God.  It's not simply knowing about God, but it is personally meeting God in Jesus.  To do so Benner recommends Spirit-guided meditation of the Gospels and meeting God in the events of life through prayerfully reviewing each day.  Benner puts a high value on solitude throughout the process of self-discovery.  He gives instruction and insights into carrying out these disciplines.      All of us tend to reject our true self that is created in the likeness of God.  Instead we chose a way independent of God that is our false self.  This false-self is created out of placing my value in what I have, what I do and what people think of me, rather than in God's loving acceptance of me.  If we do not want to live in bondage to our false-self we must be prepared to be other than our image of our self.  We must allow God to embrace us just the way we really are.    Coming to know and trust God's love is a lifelong process.  It begins by letting God know our desire to experience His perfect love.  We must allow God to accept us just as we are and enable us to accept ourselves. In doing this we dare to allow God access to the dark parts of our soul.  Self-acceptance always precedes genuine self-surrender and self-transformation.   Following a discovery of our authentic self, Benner then moves into a discovery of our vocation.  Our vocation is always a response to a Divine call to take our place in the Kingdom of God.  It always involves the care of God's creation and people, moving us to humility, love, self-sacrifice and stewardship.  From Luke 4 Benner wonderfully explains that Jesus' understanding of vocation came out of wrestling with God, himself and the devil in the solitude of the wilderness.    "The Gift of Being Yourself" is a thoughtful, practical, and easy read.  It is not the definitive textbook for self-discovery nor does it fully answer all of the questions.  Yet, the small investment of time you spend reading the book may provide just what you've needed to begin the journey of self-discovery through an encounter with God.  
 Thank God. I heard Girlfriend, the single, on the radio one day about a year or two ago. That lead to a download and the purchase of the album a few days later. What seemed impulsive was overpowered by the feeling that a masterpiece had been uncovered. I hate the superlative language thrown around for these sorts of things, but this has proven to be no flight of fancy. This guy, Matthew Sweet, writes songs that connect.  You can feel it.   The twin guitar virtuosos who appear here deserve big credit. Big drive. Big. It sounds great. Gritty and foot stompin'. And, what a recording. Near 49 now. Sometimes its raw. Sometimes its ennui. This recording captures both ends.  It also rocks. randolph wish 
 For real, you gotta give this man props. I repect him and his music, but it's not my style. He still managed to make this a good album, so it's all good. Much repect.  
 My son loved these shoes. Even though he is two all he could say was CARS 
 I had heard rumors of Edward Lee and what a great horror writer he was but I had never read any of his books.  So I took a chance and ordered Messenger and devoured the book in two days.    This book is NOT for the squeamish and while not the greatest of 'writers' Edward Lee is a wonderful 'storyteller'.  While the book just kind of floats along from one violent act to another without a lot of character development it is still a fun as hell read with plenty of Oh My God spots.  If you are a true Splatterpunk fan I HIGHYLY reccomend Edward Lee...Just remember if you get hooked on the guy the majority of his books are VERY hard to find and average about 40 bucks a book 
   Not only that,the words to 'Danny Boy' were written by an Englishman,'Maggie' was written by a Canadian and 'I'll Take you Home Again Kathleen' was written in America, and was a promise to bring the writer's lover back from out west to New York;not from America back to Ireland.There is no end of the things that are not as they first might seem.One of my favorites is that 'The Birdman of Alcatraz,Robert Stroud,who did all that research on birds, while serving a life sentence for murder,did it in Leavenworth prison,not Alcatraz.   If you enjoy reading this sort of of thing;Ripley was the undisputed master of turning up this stuff,from all over the world.Although there have been many imitators,and some pretty good ones at that,he was the inventor and the best at the game.   I have been a big fan and reader of Ripley since I was about 10 years old,and I am now approaching 70.As a young lad I got his first Believe It or Not! and noticed it was recently reprinted as a reproduction and selling in a 'big box bookstore'.It is exactly like the one I had so many years ago.    Over the years ,I have read and collected many of these books over the years.My favorites were the paperback series that started in1950,and about 30 same out,Also many large 'Special' books like this one.Also a series of Comic books.Just when it looked like the end to his long trail,the TV series started.It,s been a long run and I've never tired of it because there's always new material. One of my favorite books about Ripley was 'Ripley -The Modern Marco Polo' by Bob Considine.In this book ,Considine,a pal of Ripley's, tells so much about Ripley that one realizes that his life was as wild and just as unbelievable as the stuff he wrote about.After all these years,his cartoon is still carried daily in nany newspapers.Unfortunately not here in Toronto,and maybe not where you live;but fear not,it's on the Net under 'Believe It or Not'.There are several BION Museums around the country with wonderful exhibits.I visited the one in Niagara Falls a couple of years ago.Enjoyed it very much,but surprised that they had no books to sell;hopefully that oversight has been corrected by now.   I must say the printing,paper,almost exclusive use of color photography,and overall construction of this book is excellent.I would like to offer just one bit of criticism,that being of some printing on top of pictures.This accomplishes very little other than making for difficult legibility.(examples are pages 59,78,134 144,153 & 179)   A great book for people off all ages.                   
 Avishai Cohen has done some real honest modern jazz. The flavor is urban and technical. I get the feel of a New York city musician but his booking agent is on the west coast. Go figure. This will certainly wind up on the list of one of Jazz Times' reviewers best of 2000. Anyone who gets beyond Kenny G will find this CD to be a delight. I will be checking out other music by Avishai 
 The book is used for a class and has come in very handy.  Lots of information inside that helps 
 I loved most of the ideas that were in the book and will use some of them for our special day 
 Great look at what goes on behind the making of the X-Files.  From set and actor problems to the interesting adventures with Vancouver locals.    X-Philers and fans of the show will love this inside look 
 This is an extremely informative book on terrorism across the world. It is straightfoward and pact full of information and statistics. Best of all, the author tells it like it is- regardless of how it makes either side look.   You will understand who the terrorists are, who they target, and why. This book gets to the real root of the problem. If you read some of the descriptions on the book, you'll realize how it also abolishes some of the misconceptions many people have on terrorists.   The reviewers who criticize the book do not like the idea that perhaps states are partly to blame for terrorism. The reviewer "Security Nerd" for example, claims we should read and stick to past notions of terrorism. We should continue to believe that terrorists are wackos who kill for the sake of killing. Yes, terrorists can be very brutal and evil (i.e. Zarqawi), but simply pummeling them won't solve anything. We need to get to the root of the problem. Pape does this extremely well. He makes it clear that there is a difference between justifying and understanding a problem, and that his goal is to achieve the latter. Strongly recommended 
 This is only one more great collection of music.  I saw Johnny in Las Vegas in May 2006 and he continues to be amazing and gives you the feeling that he is singing just to you.  This collection is soothing and made to sooth the beast in all of us no matter what that beast may be. Thank God for a voice and person like Johnny Mathis. 
 Ann Pitman uses loads of great photographs and personal insights in this book to inform and entertain her readers.  I have found this book to be a valuable resource!  This book is a must have for the new or advanced collector.  
 My husband and I take turns carrying our youngest in his carrier my husband loves it hands down compared to the coventional harness carrier. He feels more in touch with his son and very close to him. He can position him which ever way is most comfortable for the task at hand wheather it be sleeping, sitting, walking or just cuddling 
 This book took Vietnam War to be the background to narrate the story of the barrack's life. The story is about three young paratroopers who are Philip, Hubbard and Lewis. They are from different families, and they have  different characters. Everything seems so insignificant and common, but  actually it is very natural and lifelike. This book shows perceptive  clarity, I understood it 
 This practical book contains lots of ready to use reproducible pages.  A must have for busy teachers.  Just reproduce, cut and assemble with a round head pin 
 My wife and I bought this chopper and love it! We were frustrated with electric choppers because they tended to turn everything into mush. This chopper creates perfectly sized cuts (especially for our favorite - quesadillas!) and can handle large size pieces.   For example, I use this for onions, but also for bell peppers. You can approx. quarter chop a bell pepper and place it (unseeded) on the press - then give it a definitive push and walah! I do not suggest putting in a half-onion (as shown in the picture), cutting the food surface to be fairly flat makes a big difference.   I recommend using it on a flat surface, as it does require a little extra push (hence the "bubble" on the top as a "press here" type button). We have not experienced any trouble with it breaking or being too difficult (we've had it for about 1 year) - although we did lose the cleaning piece, so it takes a little more effort to clean now. (Hope this helps!) As my husband says, "It does what its suppose to...saves time...it works."  You have to push on the end of the chopper not in the middle 
 From basic principles to advanced moves, this book is the best way to start in a more secure life style.  I was looking for self defense stuff, something that can help in a hard situation, in this book I found out something that make me more confident and secure, with our without gadgets, in every situation 
 Dog Law gives a great overview of all sorts of legislation concerning dogs.  Many owners know about general dog laws, like leash laws and curbing you dog, but Randolph covers much more.  Things like dangerous dog laws, puppy lemon laws and laws concering veterinarians are covered.  This book  however, does not provide specific laws for individual states.  Overall it  is a great reference for the responsible dog owner 
 I was a heavy smoker and drinker for almost 3 decades, until my COPD diagnosis last fall (at the age of 42).  The situation was absolutely hopeless, my dr told me to quit smoking immediately, and there was a chance that my emphysema could reverse, but attempting to quit had been TORTURE in the past and I knew even this wouldn't make me quit.  As a last ditch effort, I ordered The Easy Way to Quit Smoking, and...it WORKED. within two months I stopped my 2-3 pack per day habit. I've been smoke free for ten months.  At the same time that i purchased it, I also bought The Easy Way to Control Alcohol.  It took a while to manage both, but as of tonight I'm 2 weeks and two days completely sober.  I never could've done it without these books.   Make sure you give it a few reads, it takes some time for the info to sink in. I HIGHLY recommend these Allen Carr's books, my quality of life has been drastically improved for buying them. 
 These tasty bars have 100% of your RDA of 10 vitamins and minerals and at least 25% of 11 other vitamins and minerals.  They are filling so make a great "breakfast bar" if you are in a hurry.  They make a great snack for an adult or child who doesn't eat properly and/or forgets to take a daily vitamin. I have tried most of the flavors and have enjoyed them all 
 Another great CD from Nevermore!  These guys fill the CD with high quality crunch along with Warrel Danes haunting vocals.  I actually enjoy every song!  I like that they combine softer music with harder music, if done right, it can make a powerful combination, and they do it right.  Currently track 5 is my favorite

 "How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be older than this particular day of June...If it were only the other way! If it where I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! For that-for that-I would give everything! Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my own soul for that!"  Meet Dorian Gray. He has the perfect look. He shines with such youth and beauty that he amazes everyone he comes in contact with. According to Lord Henry Wotton, however, he does not fully realize what he has. When their mutual friend, Basil Hallward, a painter, decides to paint a portrait of Dorian, he ends up capturing that youth and beauty almost perfectly in his painting. Dorian is mezmerized by it. After listening to Lord Henry's philosophy about how youth and good looks are more important than being good-hearted, Dorian claims he would do anything to let the picture grow old and decay, while he will stay young and beautiful for the rest of his life.  It is only a downward spiral for Dorian after that. He continues to believe in the ways of Lord Henry. His face remains perfect and unlined as he commits sin after sin. The only way anyone would have known Dorian's true colors would be to take a look at his portrait; for his face on the portrait would take on the age lines and the sinister look that Dorian truly should bare in the flesh. The sight of his picture horrifies Dorian so deeply that he locks it up, and would not let anyone look at it. Dorian himself is too afraid to look at it. However, this does not stop Dorian from listening to Lord Henry and believing the same way he does.  Overall, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great novel. The wit, humor, horror, and philosophy all comes together to make this story exactly what the description of the book says: timeless. The philosophical views of Lord Henry alone will make you question your own outlook on life. The plot is somewhat predictable, and so is the ending, but this doesn't keep Oscar Wilde's only full-length novel from being a great read. Also included in this book are his short stories, Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, The Happy Prince, and The Birthday of the Infanta. Go ahead and pick this book up and start reading

 This is a great item to present to a person leaving for Basic Training.  It is a very high quality Bible, yet small so it can be easily stowed.  The slide-tab closure keeps the Bible shut, which is nice when being carried to on-base services or while traveling.  The special sections are very encouraging to a service person.  I have purchased three of these Bibles (for my son, my daughter, and my daughter-in-law who are in the USAF) 
 I wasn't that familiar with jazz music before I saw this documentary, but I found it fascinating and very moving. The music was involving, and the life story very dramatic.  It made me want to explore this music much more.  A great documentary 
 Wow what can I say about this album. This was the one of the first ones that really you couldn't listen to around your parents, along with Too Short and others. Every song is memorable. I give every song a 5/5. My favorites are Easier Said Than Done, Still Talkin, Nobody Move, and No More ?s. There are no love songs just straight street here. Everybody should know these songs by the beginning lines. Woke up quick at about noon just thought that I had to be compton soon, gotta get drunk before my day begin before my mama start bi++++n about my friends. Or My name is Eazy yeah this is true gettin your attention is what Im gonna do hardcore yo I can never be stopped askem if im def and they say the boy go's off.

If you don't know these you aren't an old school hip hop fan. RIP Eazy, we miss  
 This is a fantastic Shakespeare Resource for the everyday person who is interested in knowing more. Spread out clearly with plenty of pictures and interesting facts - this book is a joy to flick through and offers easy to find information. Really, really good 
 Should be manadatory reading for all MBA program 
 I enjoyed this book immensely. I appreciated the song-by-song analysis from someone who obviously is a true scholar of music -- his articulation of what were the ingredients that went into making the Beatles' music so great truly enhanced my appreciation of them.  His knowledge of biographical and historical information -- such priceless vignettes as John's gleeful enjoyment of an obscure, chaotic Side B by a one-hit wonder group -- puts their music in a wider context, further deepening our understanding of how their music developed.  I dabble in music theory so I did appreciate the technical aspects of the book, such as getting into chord progression and such. I read this book many times -- it has provided me with many enjoyable hours 
 Dear Senator is an exceptional memoir, important not only because of the courage it took to write, but also because it reveals so much about the complexity of Strom Thurmond's double-sided character. Some skeptics have said that he "raped a black maid" and took care of the resulting offspring financially like a "massa" to a slave, but I beg to differ. Thurmond didn't have to do any of the things he chose to do for his mulatto daughter and he risked a lot by making special trips to see Essie Mae and giving her cash. He also can't be blamed for his daughter's long silence. He never told her to not tell anyone. That was Essie Mae's choice alone.  I am a loyal Democrat and supporter of civil rights, so before reading this book, I thought that Strom Thurmond was one of the most evil legislators America has ever elected. However, after finishing Washington-William's page turner, I believe that at heart, Thurmond was actually a very good man. A part of him obviously believed the racist rhetoric he preached as governor and as a U.S. senator (or else he wouldn't have preached it), but I believe that at heart, he was a decent person. He had two opposing forces fighting for resolution inside his head and he ultimately gave credence to the one that would propel his career-- not the most noble choice, but understandable 
 Ted Kennedy, after consuming numerous alcoholic beverages, leaves a private party with a young lady not his wife.  His wife, you see, is pregnant and is at home back in Massachussetts.    Sen. Kennedy is driving with a suspended license.    A local peace officer wonders if Kennedy's car is lost after seeing it first go one way and then back up and start going a different way. He approaches it on foot.  The car then takes off at a high rate of speed.    Shortly after this, the car drives off of Chappaquiddick Bridge, flips over and lands upside down in 8 feet of water.  Sen. Kennedy exits the vehicle.  The young woman with him does not.    For the next 9 hours, instead of simply calling the police and rescue workers, Sen. Kennedy desperately goes to work on an alibi.    Kennedy confesses the accident to two people, one of whom is his cousin and lawyer, Joseph Gargan.  They press him to report the accident, which he is understandably reluctant to do.  The two men press Kennedy so much, he surprises them by shouting that he will report the accident and then dives into the lake and swims the harbor to the hotel where he was staying.    Taking Kennedy at his word, Gargan and the other man remain on the Island.  In the morning, Gargan is stunned to find Kennedy chatting with friends and getting ready to head for breakfast.    Not only did Kennedy not report the accident, he also took pains to be seen by a hotel staff member late that night and madee a point of asking the man what time it was.    Two fishermen discovered the upside down car next to the bridge that morning, while Kennedy was still feverishly working on his alibi.    To drink and drive is a crime.  To flee the scene of an accident is a crime.  To fail to render aid to someone injured in an accident you caused is a crime.  While sleeping around on your wife is not a crime, it does display poor judgement and a low moral character.    Senator Kennedy did all these things and because he is a Kennedy, he got away with it.  Had you or I gotten drunk and driven off a bridge with someone in the car with us, and we left them to die while we chose not to report the accident and instead tried to invent an alibi, you or I would go to prison.  We are not Kennedys.    The key merit of this book is that it demonstrates how in America today someone with power and influence can engage in criminal conduct and not only never be called to account for their crimes, but can even flourish and sit in position of moral authority over others.   
 One of thee best, no explaination needed, this is a good gift for anyone or for a young adult of about 12 
 If I were to recommend one Willie Nelson CD to have in my car it would be this one. Not one boring song on the whole CD.  Willie is a unique singer who seems to have a talent for attracting listeners from all walks of life, ethnic, racial, etc leanings.  Classy guy in my book and dang fun to boot 
 I use large ruled one as notebook for my arab language classes, large ruled one for work, small ruled one as vade mecum (always have it with me and use it to jot down EVERYTHING that comes to mind, addresses, phone numbers, PINs, moonphases, webpages to check, you name it), large blank paged one as BOS. I just LOVE it, its durable, elegant, compact.. and widely available in Croatia, thank God : 
 I'm not an amplifier specialist but overall this receiver does a pretty good job. The sound is crispy and it has far enough power for my needs. The only reason I don't put 5 stars is that it's not really good looking. But then that's pretty subjective.. 
 It is the age old question.  The first time I ever saw this on a friend's DVD shelf, I though that it must be some old 1930s noir movie titled "The Rock", but no, it was Michael Bay's action movie.  And I love me some Criterion collection, though I have to wonder why they put out The Rock and yet have long neglected Orson Welles' films.  In any case, the reason this movie deserves Criterion status is that it's probably one of the best action movies ever made.  If you are looking for slam-bang, hammy acting, bullets everywhere, bad puns, buddy-cop drama, pseudo-governmental double-crossing, well, this is about as good as it gets.  Whether or not it's you cup of tea is a different issue.  But you just have to read Ebert's review to see why this movie is so damn good.  So buy it, put on your best surround, get an HDTV and watch the flashy explosions 
 For those who love Mexican rappers as much as i do this is the cd. It mixes diffrent types of musica that dirives from other LAtin American countries and throws some nice lyrics in it. I personally enjoyed it and  even though it came out a while back I still rock it in the 99/00 Luv, NIN 
 Like most of us who enjoy poker, if it is on, I am watching.  Season 2 of the World Poker Tour was the most exciting, as prize pools escalated to record numbers. You get all of the exciting tournaments to watch anytime you like.  I have watched all of the DVDs over a dozen times and they are still fun to watch. My favorite BONUS in this DVD set is the added commentary in 4 of the tournaments, 2 with Daniel Negreanu and Erick Lindgren and 2 with Antonio "the magician" Esfandiari and Phil "the unabomber" Laak.  The insights of these 4 professionals are worth the price of the entire set. Let's hope they do this in the 3rd season DVD set...hopefully in more of the tournaments too.   The only downside is the 8th DVD is just some poker tips and player profiles. It was not that great, but that is being really picky because also on the 8th DVD is an aftermath review of the WPT champuionship where Daniel Negreanu, Annie Duke, and Phil Hellmuth break down why the losers lost, how the winner won, and the tells, body language, and mental breakdowns that occurred throughout the game.  This dvd set is the best I will buy this year unless season 3 comes out this year.  I do not see how a poker fan would be disappointed.  The final tables in season 2 were loaded with the greatest players ever to sit at a table and you get to sit there with them and look at their cards, judge their decisions, and root for your favorites, what could be better??   Hope this helped some of you 
 Seasons One through Five were remarkably uniform, each season introducing new characters and developing storylines, but not really bringing about much in the way of major changes.  Season Six was different because of the single-season departure of Michael Shanks.  But Season Seven is the season where things were, as Elvis would say, all shook up.  For many fans the most painful moment in the season was the shocking and unanticipated death of Dr. Janet Fraiser, played by Teryl Rothery.  Along with Tony Amendola (Master Bra'tac) and Carmen Argenziano (Jacob Carter/Selmak), Rothery was the most important non-opening credits actor in the entire run of the show, appearing prominently in several dozen episodes.  She has been an extraordinarily busy actress, showing up on virtually every show ever made in Vancouver (off the top of my head I remember her in episodes of DEAD LIKE ME, THE X-FILES, and SMALLVILLE), but the show she is most closely identified with is STARGATE SG-1.  Her death outraged and disturbed a host of fans.  The most I can say about her death is that it helped correct one of the great shortcomings of STARGATE:  how safe the characters all were.  One of the things that BUFFY brought to genre television was the practice of making the world unsafe for characters.  The moment when Angelus breaks Jenny Calendar's neck was one of the most shocking scenes I had ever seen.  Until then, all major characters on all shows were more or less protected and safe.  There over a dozen major deaths in BUFFY and ANGEL, and many fantasy and Sci-fi shows followed its example.  Shows are simply more compelling when there is a real threat that major characters will die, and the very best shows are not afraid to have a body count (witness Season Two of VERONICA MARS).    The death of Dr. Fraiser was hardly the only change.  Michael Shanks's Daniel Jackson returned to the show, necessitating the departure of Corin Nemec.  Plot wise, we witness a major change as General Hammond is relieved of his command of SGC (though he has never quite left the series entirely).  Don Davis's departure is understandable.  In fact, as the series headed into its 8th season it was remarkable that so few major characters had left the show.  Filming a series is a grueling affair and it is astonishing that so few performers had burned out.  Michael Shanks left for one year but returned.  Don Davis left as a full time performer.  And Richard Dean Anderson would start reducing his involvement in the show.  In this way, Season Seven can be seen as part of a trend that has continued.    Personally, I think the changes have been great for the show.  Though it never quite started to feel stale, there had been a bit of sameness to the show that didn't help make it as good as it could be.  Compared to some of the very best shows on TV (BUFFY, FARSCAPE, LOST, ANGEL, 24, or even SMALLVILLE) STARGATE had far less character and narrative development.  But Season Seven started changing that.  The season ended with some major narrative changes as well.  The alliance between the SGC and the Tok'ra became strained and threatened to collapse.  And after multiple hints through the season that there was a great city of the Ancients that contained technology that would help them defend earth, it was discovered that this city was none other than Atlantis, leading not just to a thrilling season finale but to a spin off series.  All in all, this was yet another strong season in one of the most consistently excellent Sci-fi series we have seen, and certainly the longest lived.   
 This book is as entertaining and informative as Kurlansky's other tomes about food items.  Even someone who doesn't share his love of all things New York can appreciate this book, which, like his others, shows the impact and importance of a basic food item to all levels of society and government. 
 I am disappointed that some reviewer brought down the rating of this magnificent book with a review that is unbelievably off-target. As a mythology insructor and writer of books utilizing myth, and a psychotherapist who relates myth to the process of human transformation, I find this the most in-depth and meaningful guide to Greek mythology available - out of over 100 I have read. The questions and commentaries are particularly in-depth but above the level of junior high school and high school students. For those who wish to understand not only mythology but also its deeper implications and relevance 
 In brief, the author's thesis is that our only quasi-reliable source for the historic Yeshua (= Jesus) are Paul's letters, or at least the 7 which are most probably his.  These date from 49-63 A.D., before the catastrophe of the Destruction of the Second Temple, and the four canonical Gospels post-date that event, at least in Akenson's view, and hence are not reliable sources regarding pre-Destruction proto-Christianity and its roots in the life and death of Yeshua.  The importance of Paul as a periscope into the early decades following the Crucifixion is indeed a welcome insight, seemingly overlooked by the Historic Jesus authors.  As Akenson reminds us, Paul attests to the Eucharist (communion), the Last Supper, the Crucifixion, and the Resurrection, within a short time after these events took place, and he believes Paul was certainly tutored in Yeshua "folklore" (his term) during Paul's fortnight stay with Peter and others who knew Yeshua intimately.  The second half of the book, which is excellent and quite moving (particularly the final chapter), more than redeems the first half, which is cranky, sarcastic, and caustically unfair to Akenson's "opponents" - that is, Akenson displays an emotional range similar to many of Paul's letters, from the all-too-human to the celestial.  As to the attack-dog sarcasm: Akenson's Big Insight is that Paul is the best (only) source for pre-Destruction proto-Christianity, and so any suggestion in competing authors that the Four Gospels (or any noncanonical gospel) may predate the Destruction of the Temple, is subjected to childish (and needlessly mean-spirited) ridicule rather than sober disputation - reminiscent of the bitter dogma wars that formed (and ruined) the early Church;  Akenson would have been right at home in the 4th century.  For a refreshingly different take on this, see Robinson's "Redating the New Testament," which argues, convincingly for me, that the chief basis for dating the Four Gospels after 70 A.D., Jesus' prediction that the Temple will be destroyed, is far from determinative:  Jesus may well simply have predicted the Temple's fate.  (Robinson notes that the Gospels do not make the sort of big deal out of this correct prediction that might be expected if it were written "after the fact," for example.  If Robinson and others are correct, then the Four Gospels may well constitute largely first-generation accounts, a possibility which is anathema to those who are deeply uncomfortable with the miracle accounts and the Resurrection.)  Akenson's fury at such heresy seems based principally in his characterization of the pre-70 daters as Fundamentalists (and no doubt their view of Akenson and the Jesus Seminar folks is reciprocally vituperative).  But you certainly don't have to be a Fundamentalist to accept pre-70 dates for the canonical Gospels (and for that matter, there seems no good reason the Gospel of Thomas can't arguably be dated to just after Jesus' death, if not actually during his lifetime -- apparently the surviving manuscript is far older than those of Paul's letters, if that were a persuasive factor (it's not).)  The late Morton Smith takes it on the chin for concocting a gay hoax in the form of the Secret Gospel of Mark, and Crossan and others who treat that work seriously are lampooned as worse than country bumpkins.  As his discussion progresses, Akenson gradually calms down and writes beautifully and convincingly about Paul (despite Akenson's criticism of neologisms (and then his use of them throughout the book -- "Judahism," etc.), he occasionally slips and calls Saul "Paul") and the glimpses his letters afford at the historic Jesus.  The work ends with a discussion of the great Sermon on Love in 1 Corinthians 13, which Akenson believes closely reflects Jesus' own teachings.  The fact that it also closely reflects the Last Supper sermon in John suggests again what may be the central flaw of Akenson's Gospel-dating.  A very good read, all in all 
 I had heard great things about this book, but after beginning my copy I wasn't sure what to think. The first few dozen pages are very slippery. The acts are dim, the messages subtle. Halberstam uses odd language here and there, slipping between hard-nosed reporting and glossy editorializing. The first act in the book revolves around a conversation that by itself seems only one of thousands at the national governing level, a chat that gently draws us into a cloudy and cloudier picture, which Halberstam to his credit clears for us page after page after page.  Halberstam gives us characterizations that clearly define the players we are dealing with. In so many instances it feels like we are back in 1960s America, speaking with the principals, knowing their psyches and professional backgrounds and the probable reasons for their decisions. A long book indeed, but lean, actually concise, painting a picture that never fails to amaze, puzzle and anger. Halberstam roots out the subtleties and sustains a very complicated chronology in a very readable text. Of all the sustained histories I have ever read, especially one in a single volume, this has to get my vote for one of America's best examples 
 The 19th century Brits were a wonderful lot in their witty, literate debauchery. There's no fact so delightful to me in reading about Victorians than the over-obvious fact of how un-Victorian the titled classes were. Byron was hardly unique in his promiscuity, nor in his sexual proclivities.  MacCarthy has done a splendid job in her research and her writing. The subject is pregnant with the possiblity of failure but this treatment succeeds both in holding the reader's attention and delighting with the structure and prose.  The one criticism with which I concur with another reviewer is MacCarthy's seeming aversion to commas. Their lack where they could have aided the reader is so obvious as to be absolutely jarring in their absence 
 I finally made my first purchase from Amazon's Unbox Video Downloads just to try the service and am happy to report a solid customer experience. For $1.99, I purchased and downloaded one of my favorite episodes of "The Twilight Zone", and it took about twenty minutes to download through a broadband connection. I don't think it's the most ideal way to see full-length motion pictures, but for a 26-minute classic TV program, I think my 17" LCD monitor makes for a suitable viewing experience, and the video quality of the downloaded file is clean.  Aired on September 15, 1961 as the show's third season opener, the episode is a Cold War fantasy appropriately called "Two" about the last two survivors on earth, a man and a woman, after an apocalyptic world war in 2109. Written and directed by TV veteran Montgomery Pittman, the simple plot revolves around the complicating fact that he is an American infantryman and she is an invading Russian soldier. Like two feral animals, they glare at each other among the debris of a deserted town destroyed by the war. He even knocks her out her after she aggressively throws pots and pans at him. The reality of their solitary existence, however, gradually dawns on them, especially after they see an evening dress in a shop window inspiring her to speak her only word of dialogue - "Prekrassnyi" - the Russian word for "lovely".  What really makes this episode memorable is the unlikely casting. Two years before she twitched her nose on "Bewitched", a brunette Elizabeth Montgomery, looking appropriately ravaged and sporting a deadly ray gun, plays the untrusting Russian soldier with surprising fierceness and vulnerability. The American is played by perennial tough-guy Charles Bronson, fresh from "The Magnificent Seven". Even though he has to spout some inane philosophical lines to describe the futility of war, he leavens his natural sullenness with a determined romanticism. They make an odd couple, but it works splendidly. I also learned that canned fried chicken will become a staple in the 22nd century. Narrated by Rod Serling in his inimitably halting manner, the show ends with my favorite line in his signature postscript: "This has been...a love story." This is classic TV 
 I really think this book gives a great inside in to the economics of ilegal activities 
 I will always see the history of race in America differently after reading this courageous book.  Professor Saunt complicates issues that once seemed more simple, but I take this as a result of his deep research and honesty about a sensitive matter. The book left me with great sympathy for those minority people who have had to make difficult choices in order to survive in an impossible, racist environment.  What Faulkner saw intuitively, Saunt documents with careful research, that we are all brothers in America, literally.  The lines between the races in America are tenuous at best, and often non-existent, much more a matter of choice and chance and upbringing than of blood and DNA.  
 I simply adore this movie. It is a modern fairytale. Watching it for the 1st time was like being immersed in a magical land..  Timeless and without a place....a true fairytale!  It is a bit dark (as most true folk/fairytales are) but that just gives it enough of an edge to make it that much more so complex.  A beautiful, delightful and enchantment 
 I am a fan of Greg Iles - it's always good to see a Mississippi boy make good.   In *Dead Sleep*, he introduces a fascinating premise and follows through with a tremendously entertaining - though slightly flawed - tale.  The good, the bad below:  *1*  He does an excellent job of telling the story from a female point of view. Jordan Glass was believable, and her character was (to my mind) thoroughly developed.  I understood her motivations, and while I might not agree with her choices, I could easily determine why she does the things she does.  *2*  The whole plot-line concerning the paintings was unique and well-drawn.  It is also well-paced - a rare phenomenon for thrillers these days.  He keeps the reader interested from beginning to end.  -3-  The romance angle between Jordan and Kaiser was a little . . . forced.  Talking about kids on a first date in the middle of a serial murder investigation (while agent Wendy was looking on no less) seemed a little odd.  Thrillers and romance novels should not mix.  -4-  The ending was a little too convenient.  The "loose ends" were slightly annoying after spending so much time with these characters.  Overall, this is a very entertaining novel. Iles seems to be getting better at his craft, mastering many different types of plot, rather than veering into formula.  I am eager to see where his talent takes him (and us) next . .  
 I know that Joni Mitchell's fans are divide about the relative merits of her different albums but although I love all her music, I generally prefer the early folk albums and this my favorite of the lot.  The album opens with Tin angel, a great about finding new love but just a taster for what follows. The second song, Chelsea morning, is among the finest songs that Joni ever wrote. It is followed by another classic, I don't know where I stand, which Barbra Streisand covered for her album, Stoney end.  More great songs follow = That song about the midway, Roses blue, The gallery, I think I understand, Songs to aging children come, The fiddle and the drum - each and every one of them a real gem.  But, even with all those classic songs, the best is saved for last - Both sides now. With its references to clouds, this is actually the title track of the album. Legend has it that Joni rang up Judy Collins in the small hours one morning begging her to record it. Whether that is true or not, Judy certainly recorded the song and an American top ten hit with it, firmly establishing the careers of both these great ladies.  So I'll ignore those who say that this is Joni's worst album - I regard it as her best and, of course, Joni would never have had the chance to develop her career if this and the other early albums had failed to make an impact.  If you enjoy this album, you may also enjoy Joni's other early albums - Ladies of the canyon (featuring Woodstock and Big yellow taxi), For the roses (featurimg You turn me on I'm a radio), the untitled debut album and, of course, Blue, generally regarded as the best of these early albums - it's brilliant, but I've looked at them from both sides now and I still like Clouds best 
 Just started and finished this book in one four hour run. In marketing there is one genuine good book out of ten copycats. This is one of the genuine ones.   This book is written in an easy to understand language, with great examples and analogies. It is about how to position and market your product or service, no matter what it is. A must read 
 Very knowledgable book on nutrition including information for children and older adults.  As a culinary professional I wanted to read up on the latest nutrition especially on soy and to improve my diet.  I am also considering taking some courses, one of them is Sanitation.  The Study Guide for the National Servsafe Exam by Dr. Leonardi was a book I found also very knowledgable and I am certain that it will help me with my exam once I decide when to take it 
 There are portions of this book that I do not subscribe to, but in whole it made me look at myself, my expectations, and lack of patience and resulting control. The stories contained illustrated the power struggles I was breeding. My ulitmate methods vary somewhat from the book, but we are definitely living in a more positive family situation 
 I was initially concerned the 16:10 image ratio would cause game screens to scale or crop but Age of Empires displays full-screen perfectly with its own in-game setting for the monitor's native resolution of 1680x1050.  If you are accustomed to a screen resolution of 1600x1200, which is 100 pixels per inch on a 4:3 ratio screen, you may notice slightly larger pixels on this monitor which has 89 pixels per inch.  Adaptation to this change is easy.  The extra width of this screen is a pleasure for spreadsheet work or side by side applications.  The screen is bright, sharp and consistent.  Colors are true and text is clear and sharp.  This is an excellent monitor at a very reasonable price 
 This collection of Wittgenstein's "remarks" written over a time period of forty years was first published as "Vermischte Bemerkungen" in the original German in 1977. These remarks are taken from his private manuscripts and diaries, which were finally translated into English in 1980.   As a vast majority of Wittgenstein's manuscripts or notebooks were written with no intent by the author for publication, it makes one wonder how the philosopher would feel about this book. He comments on a vast array of subjects from architecture, Shakespeare and music. And, of course, his philosophical musings, some remarks actually taken from his famous text, Philosophical Investigations.   It would be helpful if the reader had some previous knowledge of Wittgenstein's work and life before embarking on this text, however, I don't believe it to be absolutely essential. Surprisingly, numerous remarks throughout the text can stand alone on their own merit without contextualization. On the other hand, these remarks can also contribute to a greater understanding of Wittgenstein's philosophy, thus, in the end, Culture and Value is an excellent addition to the Wittgenstein Corpus.    I've come to understand that reading Wittgenstein is about a process of thought, a new method of thinking about our language and the world. Wittgenstein is not about a theory of reality but a process of thinking, asking different questions, never taking anything for granted, always pushing against conventional wisdom, pushing thought to its limits. At times these "aphorisms" can communicate as nonsense, ephemeral, disconnected, etc, but reading them slowly, immersing oneself into them, can produce some interesting results.   One of my favourite aphorisms: "Nothing is so difficult as not deceiving oneself."  Or one of his descriptions of genius: "There is no more light in a genius than in any other honest man - but he has a particular kind of lens to concentrate this light into a burning point."  Reading Wittgenstein's remarks gives us a point of entry into his essential concerns as a philosopher and a human being. In fact the last remarks were written in 1951, the year of his death.   Culture and Value is that type of philosophical text that can be picked up occasionally over many years and one will continue to find stimulus for thought.         
 Real interesting film here. The 13th floor is a brilliant conceptual film, and although I found it bit 'hollywood' with it's gratuitous 'action scenes', it still holds up as a really interesting story from start to finish. It also has one of those twists at the end that surprise you even when you thought all the surprises were understood. I like films that do that.   The basic story of the movie is about a virtual reality software program that is so 'real' it actual can take a live person's consciousness and move into a cyber reality, like 1930 Los Angeles and the participant experiences life there exactly like his waking life here, only in that everything is the product of computer modelling. It's really a very interesting concept because that is what quantum physicists are saying our own brain does! All in all, a thoroughly entertaining movie. It's a brain teaser, and those who like science fiction and subjects that make you think outside the box, this one is a must see 
 Professional sports at the NFL level are so full of people as are depicted in this book that I was tempted to look at it as a very funny work of non-fiction. It is populated with characters - funny ones - serious ones - dangerous ones - stupid ones and many very curvy ones. As usual, Mike has an ear for how people in this genre carry themselves and while the plot of the story - whether or not Jammer Molloy, son of the owner of the New York Hawks will be allowed to become an owner of the team after his daddy dies and leaves it to him, is never in serious doubt, it is the "how" of making this happen that is entertaining and not "whether.". No one writes this kind of book better than Mike Lupica. At least not yet 
 Why So Slow? The Advancement of Women, by Virginia Valian, is a book with a mission.  It is not Professor Valian's objective in writing this book to discuss the issues of women in leadership positions with the limited number of other academics studying the issue.  It is her objective to shake the people responsible for "the accumulation of disadvantage" of women, and to make them, or their supervisors, accountable for the recruitment and retention of women.  I know this is particularly acute, and action needed, at our nation's universities, where women tend to be recruited less often than men, especially in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields, and are promoted at a rate slower than equally qualified males.  The book reviews relevant research, discusses the psychological issues involved in our development of "gender schemas," and discusses remedies.  I have heard Professor Valian discuss the issues raised in her book, and she speaks (and writes) with authority and conviction.  This book, while not light reading, is written for the educated non-specialist.  You can't read it and not be disturbed at how qualified and competent people can be considered unqualified or less competent.  This is a book to read, then get to work 
 Straydog is a great read and it was a fun and quick read. I loved and also enjoyed it all the way through it. I recomend it to poeple that love animals and also maybe help out at shelters with animals. Myabe this book might also save an animals life in somehow. It might inspire someone. This book was great 
 As a high school computer science teacher, I have looked at all the APCS review books around, and I can tell you with confidence that this book is unquestionably the best preparation for the AP Computer Science exam.  It offers a solid review of all the APCS material; especially impressive is the thorough and creative review of the marine biology case study on the website.  The book also has plenty of review exercises and four complete practice exams, including free-response questions.  Simply put, those of my students who used this book did the best on the exam 
 Another masterpiece from Rockport. I recently purchase these shoes and I am so happy with this product. It is very comfortable. Its worth every single penny 
 I would not call Wim Crouwel little-known.  He gets talked about and lauded quite a bit.  He has even been called one of the most influencial designers of this century.    It's hard to believe he was doing the stuff he was doing years ago 
 Running a private music studio can be challenging, especially when it comes to the business end of things.  Even though I have no employees, I found Ms. McMurtry's book immensely helpful.  I especially appreciated the tips on identifying and connecting with my best customer.  Learning how to write a marketing plan to support what I wanted from my business enabled me to keep my focus. The book helped me attract the type of students that best fit my needs while running my studio as an efficient, profit generating entity.  I highly recommend it to sole practitioners, like myself 
 If you have read and like  A People's History of the United States,  you will enjoy this volume as well.  It is more or less the same story told in A people's history, the only difference is that the story is told from the people who lived over the course the years through their letters, speeches, essays, writings, and song lyrics.  The only thing absent is Zinn's commentary, only introductions to the historical documents.  A great companion to A Peoples History.  Thank you Howard for offering us these voices.  At this time in our history,  we need these voices now more than ever.  
 With so many books on leadership, it's rare that one stands out as both comprehensive and new.  I was skeptical that a book on "women's leadership" could effectively speak to both genders.  I was surprised.  While, I don't necessarily agree with all of the authors, I do appreciate the common theme that the best leaders do more listening, collaborating, and coalition-building.  We can all get in that boat 
 Details, details, details. That's really what successful event planning is all about, and that's the key to this very successful event-planning manual. Author Judy Allen notes, lists, copes with and gives an example of virtually every detail in planning anything from a sedate corporate event in a major city to a huge celebration on a remote island. She provides examples galore plus tips, questions and answers, sample cost sheets and schedules. How much floor space does a person need to be comfortable in a tent? Answer: 20 square feet. How many bathrooms should be available for a party? Answer: One per 75 guests. And don't forget to ask about the stemware, adequate parking and even the photographer's back-up camera battery. This author seems to have thought every contingency, as the book's ambitious title promises. Her one glaring omission is that she does not include the party planner's fee - our guess is that she'd be worth it. We highly recommend this well-organized, very practical book to all event planners. Don't send out press releases for your party without consulting Judy Allen 
 The conclusion and final disintegration of the formerly powerful patriarchal family.  Brings one through the third generation of tradegy, loss, and spiritual transformation and leaves almost every individual in misery.  I enjoyed the first and final books in this trilogy and feel I came away with a better understanding of the conflicting forces at work in Egypt as well as the impact of culture and morality on individual actions and spirituality 
 This is my first photography book and I love it.  I'm a beginner but I've learned a lot of technical skills in this book.  Great pictures and nice easy methods of explaining technical terms and photographic procedures 
 ...or at least that I've personally read. Normally I don't seem to get into many fantasy books; science-fiction is my genre. So imagine my surprise when I was drawn into this fantasy book with no desire to put it down in sight.  Greg Park has created a new world for any and all fantasy lovers to delve into with "Veil of Darkness". The characters are the most in depth, real people you can find outside of real life. The locales are exquisitely described, and the reader can immediately see himself behind Jase, following them across the plains and through the forests, into the cities and towns, all while on the run from the Shadowhounds.  This book is a must-read for any lover of fantasy anywhere. You'll be hard pressed to find many better fantasy novels than this, and the next few can only promise to be just as good 
 As usual, the critical voices are few and far between. And their criticisms lack substance. One negative reviewer obviously did not even read this book, basing her review entirely on the cover and her own antipathy towards short men and popular culture.  In this volume, Bujold treads new ground with Miles. This book is about relationships, not space battles. Again, widget-lovers should go elsewhere. Based on the negative review that I read I hazard that pretentious blowhards should stay away as well 
 If you have a vehicle that you don't use very often, use the Battery Tender to keep the battery charged.  It slow-charges your battery, then maintains the charge.  It works great 
 I am in the infant stages of my conversion to Judaism, and this book really cemented my conviction that this is the right decision for me.  I felt that Rabbi Kushner clearly explained what Judaism is all about to him and, in many instances, to me as well.  The chapter dealing with the dietary laws I found particularly helpful and enlightening, as this is one of the most intimidating factors for me in converting to Judaism and living as an observant Jew.  Rabbi Kushner's explanations helped me understand the dietary laws in a different way, as allowing the sacred to enter into mealtimes -- which takes the focus off food -- and I immediately began "keeping kosher" to an extent.    I didn't feel that this book slammed Christianity, but I'm not a Christian so my perspective is decidedly one-sided.  I did feel that this is a book about Judaism, not about Christianity.  There are places where Rabbi Kushner compares and contrasts the two religions, but I didn't get the sense that he was saying, "Our way is better than your way."  I DID get the sense that he is a man who feels deeply connected to God, and sees his religion as the source of that connection.  While it's likely that a (relatively) small number Christians would read this book, it seems to be intended for Jews -- a book for Jews about Judaism, written by a Jew.  The references to Christianity did not seem to be an instruction guide on Christianity so much as a way for Jews to understand their own religion within the context of modern American society, which is predominantly Christian.  If you are interested in learning more about Judaism -- what do Jews believe? what is the Jewish religion all about? -- then I think this is a very good introduction.  Rabbi Kushner's explanations are easy to read and understand and at the same time very enlightening.  Don't let this be the extent of your studies into Judaism, but it is a fine place to start 
 As so many other readers have stated, this is a dark story filled with bitter and unfulfilled characters.  Still, Ansay's prose is so adept that I was impressed with how, well, disturbed her words made me feel.  Not all stories have a plot that winds its way around a framework of neat chapters.  Vinegar Hill is as much a character study as a story, and Ellen, Ansay's lead character, is both a spectator and participant in her life.  That balance shifts painfully slowly throughout the book.  There are no easy endings and some characters are left to their own dark broodings.  But such is the way in life.  Sometimes it's the story that disturbs that stays with you.  For me, this is one such novel.  It's not a summer beach read, but it's well worth reading 
 This cd is beyond words...The first lady was in the zone on How high the moon...She scatted, she hit the highs and lows, she imitated all the instruments...If you don't get a shiver down your spine after hearing this, then you just don't get it...This cd will blow you away. It's one of the best live cd's I own...It's a great feel-good cd...Mack the knife is another great song...I love Bobby's and Pop's versions but Ella just takes it to another level...What song couldn't she sing?...It's worth buying for How high the moon and Mack the knife alone...She's in total control of her voice on this cd and it shows...I'm a young cat and heard this first in my Grandparents house. When I heard how high the moon I just lost it. I must have played that song 20 times that day...I didn't know a person could do the things Ella did with her voice...To this day this cd still blows me away 
 The Nintendo DS lite fits in the case perfectly.  The LCD protector films are nice but a bit thin.  It's difficult to put them on the screen without trapping air bubbles, even though the bubbles don't seem to affect the view when the LCD is lit.  The net in the game compartment seems too loose and does not hold the games well in place.  The loop on the outside is a nice feature 
 Another good one from the " Classic Western Star" a must have for your collection 
 A back to basics concept.  Keeps you healthy, full, and feeling great 
 Joseph H. Pilates, the German inventor of the Pilates exercise method must be smiling in the heavens.   The lifelong pacifist who was born in Dusseldorf, Germany in 1880... devoted his life to the study of physical education.  He moved to the United States in 1926 and afterwards became active with the New York City Ballet.  "Pilates; body in motion," by Alycea Ungaro of Tribeca Bodyworks is a treasure chest of Pilate exercises for a hard body.    Mr. Pilates passed away in 1967 but not without leaving behind his philosophy of form.  He established six basic principles...breath, concentration, control, centering, precision and flow in order for men and women to attain, "the inherited birthright of physical perfection."  This book is comprehensive.  It includes an introduction and four exercise programs.  The introduction and beginner's program are short...but the intermediate and advanced programs provide a wealth of drills.  Please be warned...this is difficult stuff (especially for the over 50 crowd)...even for those who frequent the gym on a regular basis.  The key to success is to follow the instructions carefully and gradually work your body into shape.  If you rush the program your body will be talking to you (with pain or soreness) the following morning.  At the risk of being redundant...do not fast-forward the exercise unless you are in outstanding condition...the Pilates school of thought looks easy but is a challenge to master correctly.  The photos in this slim book are excellent.  Moreover, the narrative is clear and succinct.  Highly recommended.  Bert Ruiz           
 I think that I enjoy this story more than my children. Great for children at least age 4 and up. Too lengthy for a toddler. But this a great story for family time especially if you can memorize it and tell it to the children.. 
 Dr. Hall has done a superb work by fitting all the pieces that are needed for a successful software risk management. The way this book is explained is fairly comprehensive, going from  a high level view, and later "drilling down" into important particular concepts. You can not go wrong following the "Managing Risk" methodology when developing your next project, especially under the current international regulations and standards for corporate governance... 
 I recently got my ironing board, and I must tell you that is the best thing I ever had for ironing. It's size is adequate for ironing my shirts pant's etc. It's handy and doesnt take much space, I can place it inside my closet, and also take it with me on my trips.I really recommend this item to anyone interested in saving space while doing your job 
 If you want to remember that day that you rushed to the television as I did and if you want to watch the horrible events unfold before your eyes and the feelings you felt that inspired you to act, then this is the video to watch.  Are you a conspiracy theorist, or are you a follower of patriotism and the men who led this country after the events that happened that day?  Or are you one of millions that would just rather not remember at all and want to go on with your life?  No matter...  This was ground zero, and if you want to see the world that it is today and all the events going on then you need to relive the horror of that day.  Because this is the root of what is happening.   There are no clear answers yet.  I've heard the conspiracy theorists and as someone who knows air travel, aircraft, the aviation system, I can tell you their conclusions are so full of holes that they make themselves look silly to people who live aviation on the scale it was exloited that day.  Or are you a patriot blindly following the people who lead in order to prevent another disaster?  Then I can tell you that their stories and actions are just as full of holes as the conspiracies.  They paint a misrepresented picture also.    Or are you that complacent person who either doesn't want to remember at all or doesn't care?    Ground zero was where it started.  Before you get set into following one side or the other, it's best to revisit the events of that day and remember the innocents who died and those who suffered.  Watch it then ask yourself if you are so willing to jump on one bandwagon or the other?    The greatest tragedy of all right now is that all these years after, citizens have stood by and let a government of bickering and self servicing interests coast by with not having laid a single stone on top of another to memorialize the events of that day.  That in itself is a statement of a country of apathy.  If we are all that apathetic, then perhaps it's time to go back to ground zero and feel the pain once again.  This is the video that will make that happen... 
 I found this series by accident, looking for a new book to read.  When I saw all the thousands of wonderful reviews of this book, I ordered the first 3 of the 6 book series not knowing if I would like even the first book.  To my surprise, this is the most wonderful book I've ever read in my life.  You absolutely fall in love with the characters and Diana Gabaldon's writing style is beyond amazing.  Her use of words and the way she puts the scenes together are staggering!  I highly recommend this book and the rest of the series for anyone who loves to read.  I am almost done with Voyager (the 3rd in the series) and look forward to finishing the rest, and will probably re-read them again, something that I would never have considered doing with any book.  THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW WONDERFUL IT IS TO BE A PART OF JAMIE AND CLAIRE'S WORLD.  
 Great movie for WWII buffs.  One of the best submarine movies in my opinion.  However, people who are not hard core war movie viewers will likley find it too slow and boring.  They did a great job getting it on DVD 
 Splendor in the grass is one of my favorite movies of all time. The romantic drama starring Natalie Wood and Warren Beatty (in his first role) are absolutely wonderful in this tale of young love in Kanas in the 1920s. I just adore and admire Natalie Wood, she is a stunning actress, she is beautiful and mesmerizing in this role. If you love old hollywood romances, then this movie is the truest form of passion at simplistic measures.

 Summer of Night was one of the most incredible books I have ever read and mind you it's not because I'd rather read a book on a Friday night than party, much to my boyfriends dismay as I so often do.  Dan Simmons wove a masterful tale of 1960's Illinois with its cozy little town and streets, Saturday outdoor movies and the kids who were the true heroes of the story. It reminded me of Goonies in places as we quickly grow to like Dale and his younger brother Lawrance, Mike, Duane and Kevin and Jim Harlan, friends, schoolmates and brave, lovable kids who have turned this book in a magical tale that swept in front of my eyes. I have never read a more real story that has horror, fantasy and people dying feeling as real as this tale. The characters all stand out in their own way, so clear, so precise so pristine that when bad things happened to some of them, I had a tissue dabbing my eyes. The book is long, counting 600 pages but I know I will read it over again in a few years and I'm sure it will taste even better, just like leftover dinner with the deepening flavors and spices.  The story itself is around a school called Old Central, where Tubby, a not so god kid disappears on the last day. It's a huge old building that is going to be closed down as all the kids are supposed to go to a new school. Dale, Lawrance, Mike, Duane, Kev and Jim all go to the same school but they are very young, around 11 yrs old, some younger, some tad older yet they are real kids; at times with bratty tough attitudes, yet Simmons doesn't pretend to sketch out a superhero in a child's body, he takes each characters and builds on it making them as real to me as my own family. I grew to love each one of them as they enriched my book with their plans to find the missing kid. As the kids started to piece together what was going on, very bad things started to happen. Unusual dark forces such as walking corpses and black worms polluted their world as sun settled and sent real life terror that was really more terrifying than any other horror book I have ever read. I laughed, cried and even took a day of from work just to sit and read this book as it slowly and beautifully unfolded its mysteries to me.  Dan Simmons used the most intense, sublime and imaginary language to spin his tale, that I have never read before in a scary book. I could feel the first day of summer, the sunshine, the happiness and the approaching gloom with the kids he so intensely described. I could probably use every single one of his sentences as a quite but when he said this about the evil things my hair really stood straight, as it was true: "Beyond the cone of light, large things circled and waited". Evil did strike at night but made some terrifying appearances at day time. When the kids run into mysterious soldiers, butchered animals in a barn with  human sacrifices, mysterious holes in the ground, random neighbours dying with cries of terror on their face they know that nothing is imagined and that It wont go away unless they stop it.   So don't miss this glorious story, but have some time to read it and don't miss the sequel that follows where the ending stopped years in the future, its called A Winter Haunting and I cant wait to read it 
 This is the second of two Live at the Village Vanguard albums from the Paul Motian trio.  Recorded in June 1995, it is a good sampling of what you'll hear if you go to their annual gig at that same club: some Monk, a standard, and a few Motian originals.  The pot is sweetened by the Mingus ballad that gives this album its name.  The set opens with a brilliant, extended interpretation of Monk's "Misterioso".  Frisell's countryfied solo (he plays nearly devoid of electronic effects on this disc) is a highlight.  "Duke Ellington's Sound of Love" and "Good Morning Heartache" are fine ballad performances; the first is profound, the second is touching.  As far as the Motian originals, "Mumbo Jumbo" is one of the drummer's best compositions and gets an intense reading here.  Lovano's duet with Motian on the second half of the tune showcases both at their finest.  "Once Around the Park" opens with a solo introduction by Frisell and slides into a very nice, swinging performance.  I highly recommend this disc.  Its twin, Live at the Village Vanguard, is also excellent if not quite at Sound of Love's level.  Nevertheless if you like one, get the other. 
 Although not one of his more popular novels, Charles Dickens' Hard Times still stands as a classic among classics.  Carrying on with his highly prolific writing style, this novel is a bit more bleak than his other renown works, but enjoyable from the start, especially with Dickens' excellent choice of character naming. Suitable for most ages, this classic should not be passed up.  And with the Norton annotations and notes, this edition will help readers understand better the context in which the author writes in 
 The Beatles' "Blue Album" celebrates their talent by boasting nothing but just some of their infamous hits from the years 1967-1970. These songs come from several of the greatest rock albums of all time including Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, The Beatles ("The White Album"), Abbey Road and Let It Be. The Beatles' "Blue Album" both proves their genius and demonstrates their singular talent that no other band can replicate.   The two CD set allows us to realize that The Beatles wrote many different types of songs with different styles. This is also essential music that offers something for just about anyone who listens to the two CD set. The first CD starts off strong with the popular and psychedelic "Strawberry Fields Forever," other psychedelic and experimental songs include "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds" and "I Am The Walrus." There are beautiful ballads celebrating love including "All You Need Is Love" and "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da." The Beatles also address the angst of a love that is no longer in the songs "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" and "The Long And Winding Road." Finally, the band sings songs that are just plain fun including "Octopus's Garden" and "Back In The U.S.S.R."   Another reviewer makes an excellent point: If you want to understand the sharp differences in style between John Lennon and Paul McCartney at this time in their careers there is no better comparison than between "Hey Jude," which is an classic ballad indeed, and "Revolution," which is rather conceited, smug and bitter all at once.   The Beatles' use of the unconscious when writing trippy songs like "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and "A Day In The Life" enabled them to reach out to their fans and ultimately the world. The lyrics make sense even when they make no sense; this only adds to the beauty of the more psychedelic, trippy songs. Moreover, the songs on this two CD set work so well because they address universal themes of wanting to be loved, celebrating love and mourning a lost love.   The liner notes boast the lyrics to each song and great color photos of the band. The liner notes include the song credits, too.   Indeed, The Beatles were so prolific in their writing and performing that this two CD set barely skims the surface of what they truly accomplished between the years 1967 and 1970. If you like this CD set I highly recommend you buy individual Beatles' albums to discover more about the band's creativity and boldness.   Overall, this two CD set is more than just an introductory retrospective of The Beatles' music during the turbulent late 1960s. The "Blue Album" celebrates The Beatles' ability to communicate their political beliefs and amorous feelings for other people through their songs. These songs remind us to understand and appreciate the blessings of love, the evils of war and the importance of world peace--now.   I highly recommend this CD for Beatles fans, fans of great 1970s rock music and anyone who wants to experience how The Beatles taught us what was right through their music. This two CD set is a must have for any Beatles' collector as well as for anyone who wants to study the history of rock and roll.  
 I'm only in Chapter 2, and it is already clear that Denning makes a lot of great points in this book.  It is most definitely worth every penny and more!  My biggest complaint is that the book is written like a 19th century philosophy treatise!  Philosophy was one of my majors in college, so I am well-aware of the agony in reading philosophical text - instead of getting straight to the point, it meanders and loses the reader after every third sentence!  In the first chapter of this book, Denning goes on and on about things you could care less about for over 20 pages.  I had a sigh of relief when he finally put down all his points in the chapter in just two pages at the end of the chapter!  When I was reading in the plane, I thought at first the reason for my agony was that I was tired.  However, each time I got bored with Denning's book, I switched to a novel, and I was not tired anymore!  Hey, wait a minute!  I thought this was supposed to be a book on storytelling!  Why then was it written like an obscure Ph.D. dissertation?  You don't believe me?  See for yourself.  Here's a sampling of the torture:  "Second, the apparent paradox of zero improvement in performance from teams in organizations overall - along with extraordinary gains reportedly made in specific instances - reflects the fact that teams are found at both ends of the effectiveness spectrum."  Now do you believe me!?  :)  I'm not saying the entire book looks like the glob you see above.  My point is simply that there are numerous sentences here that will require you to pause, say "Huh?", and then reread.  So, if you are a speed reading junkie like me, please be very patient!  Speed reading is not recommended.  Despite the stated criticism, Denning makes really good points in this book.  The book has my complete endorsement due to the great points.  Besides, as my philosophy professors used to tell me in college, if you don't have the patience to tread through the gobbledygook of philosophical treatises, then maybe you're not scholarly enough to major in philosophy 
 This is great. I enjoyed and gained so much insight listening to it driving in the car.  Mrs. Kepcher's voice was very easy to listen to.  It wasnt at all monotones like some books I have listeded to in the past. I highly recommend this book. Perfect to the college graduate who is looking to get his foot in the door.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.  FIVE STAR 
 Mr Herzogs book is a winner.  I have read it several times and find it informative.  He explains in great detail each conflict and also gives us many details of the events that occurred between each conflict.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in gaining a clear understanding of this part of the world 
 This is a great opera introduction for kids.  The story is really easy to follow and the CD is a great addition.  I highly recommend this for anyone 
 Interesting book but I am not suprised by what Crichton found in his three years of research. My wife worked for a nationally recognised 'scientist' before we were married and had told me that he regularly disregarded and discarded findings in his research that did not support his 'views', and that his results always seemed to find new questions that would justify new research.   The one couple in our circle of friends who are both 'professional greens' (paychecks from environmental organisations) become absolutely frothy at the mouth at the mention of this book. They insist 'it's all not true'. When I asked them to specify a particular part that's untrue they seem utterly incapable of rational discourse continueing with shouts of 'all of it, all of it! Crichton's sold out! Open your mind, he's sold out!' Personally I'm glad they set me straight. For a second I thought they were the one's with the closed mind... 
 I saw this film more than 14 months ago. At that time, I was not quite acquainted with films and didn't watch as many as I do now. This was surprisingly one of the first Brad Pitt films I had seen. To me he was only a good looking actor. After watching the epic like Seven years in Tibet, I know I am a fan for life.  When this film starts and Pitt is shown as an army officer somewhere in Europe (think it was Hungary) I thought it would be based on the war solely.This film brought the adventurer's spirit in me. There is more than nature,huge land masses,different kinds of people and hills in Seven Years In Tibet. This movie celebrates friendship in a way that is quite difficult for me to comprehend. The relationship between Dalai Lama & Pitt was heartening. What is more hearetening was Pitt's character in the film and how he stood alone in the windmills of time.  Pitt's character is both stupid and mentally very strong in the film. I'd rather not describe how it evolves into that of a satisfied mind. Tibet is beautiful. Being an Indian, I knew some of the places that are shown in this movie so it felt special.  Lastly, this is one of the most under rated films I have seen. I own this movie now. Amazon recommends Kundun if you like this film but I do not. There is no film of the same stature as Seven Years In Tibet.If you're a newbie and want to watch some other Brad Pitt epics then I suggest you watch "Seven" , "Sleepers" and the best film he did "Troy" Kundun was a rather slow documentary like film plus no Brad Pitt.  
 The bucolic, rustic village of Three Pines, in the Southern region of Quebec is last place where you'd think murder would be committed. It's the sort of town where the only reason the doors are locked is to prevent neighbors from dropping off baskets of zucchini at harvest time.  But this quaint community of artists, writers and retirees is shaken to its very core when one of their most beloved residents Jane Neal is found brutally murdered in the local forest.  Most devastated is local painter Clara Morrow, who together with her husband Peter was Jane's closest friend and confidante. Both are mystified at why someone would want to kill this kindly and gentile seventy-six year old woman, who was an ex-school teacher, tended roses, and was active in the community running the Anglican Church Women, and supporting the various art clubs.   Enter author Louise Penny's main protagonist, Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the Sûreté du Québec, a man of formidable talents who is enlisted with the task of hunting down Jane's killer. With the help of his deputy Jean Guy Beavior, Gamache begins his investigation, steadily unraveling the clues and long buried secrets that still haunt the inhabitants of this small town.   It is soon discovered that an arrow had pierced poor Jane's heart. Coincidently it is bow-hunting season, so initially Jane's death could have been an accident. But therein lies the problem, Gamache and Beavior can't find the murder weapon and no one has bothered to come forward. As the pall of grief settles on the community, the detectives discover that Jane died just as her painting Fair Day, was accepted for the local art show, much to the chagrin of some of the committee members.   As fragments of the crime begin to materialize, Gamache is blindsided by the Croft family, their teenage son truculent Phillippe becoming a likely suspect as he had a run-in with Jane and was also an experienced marksman. Gamache, however, becomes caught up in a certainty he cannot prove, there's no motive for the crime. As the picture becomes more distinct, Gamache is convinced that is it Jane's angry and materialistic niece Yolande Fontaine, who is responsible; this cold and bitter woman is absolutely frantic to take over her aunt's house.  The clues eventually come back to Jane's Fair Day painting, where what is most peculiar is that all the people of the village although still recognizable, were painted as stick figures. Gamache is also sure that in this case the act of murder was committed decades before the actual action, something had happened in this community and it had lead inexorably to Jane's death many years later. This doesn't help Clara; Jane was her mentor and her life and now she has to face a world suddenly and violently without her best friend, without the touch comfort and kindness.  The author creates an eclectic cast of characters, all of them very endemic and characteristic of this small, insular and like-minded community: there's Peter's grieving and emotionally shut off friend Ben Hadley who harbors a secret desires for Clara and conceals a difficult past; there's also the town's only gay couple Olivier and Gabri, who run the local bed and breakfast, selling antiques on the side.  There's Ruth, an embittered poet was once friendly with Jane, and suspicion momentarily falls on her, as she has suspicious motives tied to the death of a mutual friend of hers and Jane's. Penny keeps the plot moving as the unhurried, unperturbed and unstoppable Gamache and his team of crack detectives, including the insecure and arrogant young Yvette Nichol, navigates an intricate web of deception, where art runs in the family and where everyone around treats it like law.   Still Life's Armand Gamache signifies the debut of a fresh face on the Canadian crime fiction circuit; there's no doubt that he's an appealing and multi-talented hero. As Armand gets the heart of Jane's murder and the secrets are revealed, he finds himself almost falling in love with all these townsfolk, where their long-lived peace has been threatened in this old and bucolic village that "hasn't become old without knowing grief."

 Well done Rodney .What a fasinating insight into the ancient Cretan worl 
 Hamilton does a fairly good representation of Upper Michigan and the twin cities of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan/Ontario and area. Clearly he has spent enough time there to cite specific locations and directions, and he captures the atmosphere pretty good, if somewhat cliche. The location lends a different backdrop to basic plotlines, and he works that backdrop into the stories in this series. A refreshing approach to a well used genre.   This is a good weekend read and very enjoyable -perfect for an afternoon by the pool or a rainy weekend at the cottage. It is a little on the 'easy reading' side of things, and not as involved plotwise as something by Ludlum or Clancy, but it is very easy to fall into the story very quickly, or pick it up again after a break. A good style for a tired mind after a busy week. I have recommended this series to others and will continue to do so as I look forward to the next book.  -Start at the beginning, as parts of the stories build on each other.

 Finally!  Someone has documented the distortion of Christianity practiced by the Bush administration.  Bush divides up people and countries into "you are for us or you are against us" and into those that are good and those that are "evil."  This is the opposite of what Jesus taught.  Mr. Wakefield brings out a lot of history about how the religious right have "hijaacked" and distored the Christian message.  I especially liked the last chapter where the author educated me about a counter movement aimed at bringing out the more authentic aspects of Christian - and Jewish - spirituality.  
 The DVD has a excellent number of episodes in the DVD. It is just as good as I thought it would be. 
 Friedrich is a great book that discusses what one of the many Jewish families during WWII had to deal with. Friedrich is the main character of the story but the story is told by one of his friends, who's family is lending them an attic room for a hide-away shelter.   Friedrich deals with several harsh events that really actually give you a sense of how it was for Jews to live in that time period. The ending of the book became a little confusing to me, but other than that, the book was excelent.  I would recomend this book to older youth that are intrested in learning of history. And maybe if you aren't into history you might like this book too! I hope my review was helpful to you. 
 I've gotten through about 1/3 of the book and I'm highly amused.  The first 50 pages are muddled and rather pointless so far.  However, I've laughed my way through them.  One thing Eco has is a very sophisticated sense of humor.  If you enjoy a mental challenge and writing that's loaded with wit, I'd suggest picking up this book.  I never knew there were four kinds of people before: morons, fools, lunatics and cretins.  And I may just be a fool.  :) 
 This is a terrific book.  I am a big fan of Gene - as well as the way she is presented.  The use of shadow and light in the wonderful photography makes her looks very real.  In addition, the thing that makes Gene special is that she has a whole story - of how she was discovered and became an actress.  They have interviews with various friends, enemies and family, again, making her become very real.  Two thumbs up 
 This is a fascinating account of Wall Street in the nineties, and frankly I am surprised it has received such little attention.   The author was an analyst in the telecommunications arena and his account of the backstairs dealings, and how investors are systematically misled, is riveting.  I think there might be something of a personal "score-settling" character to this book, for which I have deducted a star. However, I think it nevertheless is required reading to understand the 1990s 
 We purchased this for our 10 year-old and he loves it. He was most thrilled to see that it really does run in the bathtub. I think he would only have been happier if it came with a remote control so he could steer it 
 I came to this book by way of the film. The book is a delightful set of essays about raising kids (boys), buying a home and working (writing). The book stands the test of time well, continuing to be funny and relevant. The book's only problem is that it is too short 
 This is the first Neil Stevenson book that I read, and although I am already a Gibson fan, I had no idea what I was in for. Maybe I was expecting cryptic jargon and emotionally sterile characters, but this was much more lush than that.  I got hooked on this one character, Nell, which the story followed through to the very end, despite multiple parallel stories. Nell is a young girl in poverty who puts up with her mother's many abusive boyfriends. Her brother gets ahold of an interactive (mediatronic) book and brings it home to Nell, and this book teaches her many things, including how to read, self-defense, programming, and so forth. I don't want to give away any plot spoilers or reveal the true nature of her mouse army, but let's just say that the ones who have nothing to lose can be revolutionary.   An interesting structural aspect of the book is its recursive nature - the "Primer" that Nell and other girls interact with sets up a story within the main plot, and it makes an interesting and wholesome periodic alternation between the two. The boundary between the "Primer"  world and the "real" world are blurred and easily transgressed by ractors (actors for mediatronic devices). The explicit pop culture references, also, facilitates in bringing the reader into Stevenson's world, and I began to think of the nanotechnology and mediatronics in terms of how it would function in our world. Thus the fractal nature of these many realities becomes confusing from one view to the next.   This book has rich characters, and amazingly lush imagery. An example is his description of the animated glyphs on chopsticks; another is "kidnapper", a mechanical robot horse that serves as a transport vehicle. This book is complex - it now ranks high on my sci-fi faves list 
 This was one of the most enjoyable books I have read in awhile, even if it was light in the philosophy context in certain chapters.  I particularly enjoyed the analysis of what it means to be a fan of a losing team.  As a Cubs fan, I can sympathize with that. The most particularly interesting chapter to me was the chapter on the philosophical aspect of the intentional walk. I would highly recommend this book to true baseball fans. 
 I watched this show when it first came on Adult Swim (in fact I still remember the old Adult Swim commercials, This and Sealab 2021 were my favortie shows on this late night block. I was also a huge fan of Cartoon Planet (I also have those 2 CDs) and I thought Brak was the coolest of the 3 characters. Then after that show got cancelled, this show came on. I liked it a lot and I wish they would make more episodes, but unfortunately half the people out there don't like Brak because of his voice and that's probably the reason that the show is cancelled. For those who loved Brak or like Adult Swim shows, this is a must have (and volume 2), but for those who like Adult Swim but was annoyed by Brak should look else where 
 I trust the product too be what they say 
 Computer Forensics, Incident Response Essentials, is a great book for two groups of people:  1)	All computer forensics investigators looking for a better description of the process of collecting and analyzing  data.  The book provides great descriptions of the methods for maintaining chain of custody and storage. This is done through the use of example forms and scenarios.  Since evidence handling principles are easily overlooked, this book seeks to provide pragmatic techniques for proper evidence preservation.  2)	Someone interesting in learning what computer forensics is about.  This book is great at providing a high-level description of what computer forensics is used for and how it works.  The book does not go into intricate detail on any one software package.  Instead, it provides you with a great overview description of numerous software packages and tools.  By doing this, the reader can attain a better understanding of what value computer forensics can provide.  Since the field is relatively new, it is important for people to understand what computer forensics is capable of.  I highly recommend this book if you are just getting into the field, or if you are tired of reading books that continually tout Encase as the only solution.  This book is a critical addition to any computer forensic investigators library. 
 A very moving book.  It reminds me of an onion, in that, as a child grows up, they can reread the story, and come away with a different perspective every time.  Right now, my 4 year old thinks it's a story about a naughty boy whose mommy still loves him, even though he is bad.  Later she will understand the ideas of unconditional love, the cycles of life, mother/child bonds, etc.  I believe that those people who called it creepy read the book more  literally than was intended.  I hope we can all agree that it is a bad idea to climb into the window of a house that does not belong to you in the dead of night...um, right?  (Gosh, I hope my mother in law is reading this!)  Just kidding mom!    Seriously, this is not a silly story, and not even a simple story, but it is a good story.  I would read it yourself first, to anticipate any of the tough questions your kids might have for you...it is definitely thought-provoking.       
 This book is an awesome resource for teachers of middle school mathematics. If you are someone who is always trying to get kids to learn and truly appreciate math by engaging them in stimulating lessons, but instead you find that standards and curriculum seem to get in the way, this book is a find.  The book begins with an explanation of the different levels of activities based on the congnitive demands they place on the students, and it continues with indepth, thought-provoking case studies that are extremely realistic and easy to relate to.  This text is useful and accessible.  
 Add two more topics to power, sex and suicide, and you have covered what the book is about, the topics being the origins of life and Lane's primary interest, aging.  No, mitochondria were not involved in the origin of life, but just as they power cells by creating a charge differential across their membranes, earliest life is theorized to have begun when ocean and volcanic fluids mixed, creating bubbles (think cells) with a naturally occurring charge differential, and the metals which can catalyze organic reactions. 	This work is more polished and unified than Lane's previous effort, "Oxygen", and will bowl you over, whether or not you have read "Oxygen". 	Much as Lane loves the theories he is espousing, he loves even more the scientific reasoning which supports the theories: a good thing as the theories are in flux. While Lane is generally clear, and not  technical, this can be a little misleading: the reader should have some background in evolution and concepts like the "selfish gene", and know something about how the cell works. Lane has as a small glossary, but I actually had more trouble with some terms which appear self-explanatory on the surface, but which are used differently by different scientists: metabolic efficiency, stress.  	I don't buy Lane's conclusion that eukaryotes, or their equivalent, arose only once.  Just because all current eukaryotes have one common ancestor is no proof at all to me that there were not unsuccessful lines.  I am also struck by the amount of "simple" empirical research which needs to be accomplished; e.g, do we actually make do with fewer cells as we age and some cells die without being replaced? 
 I bought Howard Shanet's book about 15 years after I had been playing guitar for 10 years, and after a short flirtation with the violin.    Although I had learned to play guitar quite well during that time, and although I had managed to fake my way through playing violin in the school orchestra when I was a teenager, I was frustrated by not being able to read and write music well.   In the following years, I bought numerous books - most of them guitar books with chords and guitar tablature which I understood fine, and others books on how to read and write music, which I found confusing, complicated and frustrating.  Despite progressing to writing and playing songs, and playing in bands, I resigned myself to thinking that I'd always have to rely on a combination of a tape recorder, chord symbols, and my own quirky form of notation in order to write down the music that I wrote.  Finally, I found Mr. Shanet's book, and it explained all that I had been confused about in clear, simple and enjoyable ways. I do think that people are right when they say that learning the mechanics of music (notation etc.) is related to mathematics; a subject that I have always failed miserably in, and that's where Mr. Shanet's book excels - he explains all of this in simple terms.  Just to be clear about this, I have a pretty good sense of rhythm and timing, it's just that I could never write it down in standard musical notation, nor could I read it very well.   The whole process of counting from, and writing to, paper was too complicated a process, and no other book had ever unlocked this process for me until I found 'Learn to Read Music'.  Another book that I found recently that seems to use the same kind of approach, relative to learning the piano, is 'Play Piano in a Flash' by Scott "The Piano Guy" Houston.  I cannot recommend 'Learn to Read Music' highly enough. Don't be put off by the fact that it was published in 1956: it is a gem and a classic, and I hope that Howard Shanet is still around, and is aware of the wonderful contribution that he has made to music education.  
 I think this is an excellent introduction to NLP.  Because its well written and easy to read, it has explanations in the glossary of any the words newcomers might not understand so its easy to understand even if your a complete newbie, and like Andy Smith says its quite short (even though it seems like it is now longer than the edition Andy was writing about.)  Despite some of the criticisms of NLP that I've seen around,  there is nothing in this book that looks anything like pseudoscience or Scientology or magic.  And I couldn't find anything about visual managers or phrenology-like diagrams. (There are some smiley faces in one chapter but they arent anything to do with phrenology are they?) Instead it is a really useful, straight forward guide to using NLP, and specially in businesses.  In fact according to Science Digest -   "NLP could be the most important synthesis of knowledge about human communications to emerge since the sixties."  The book is actually made up of two parts.  The first 16 chapters deal with things like the NLP presuppositions and various NLP methods and techniques.  All of these chapters have exercises at the end, called checkpoint actions, so you can try out what you've just learned about.  I found that very useful as it allows you to put the NLP ideas into practise right away.  Chapters 17-24 explain how the techniques can be used in all kinds of situations such as sales, negotiations and appraisals with each situation having its own chapter.  This is a great book with lots of interesting ideas about how to understand and communicate better with other people, even in situations which could otherwise be difficult.  I highly recommend it 
 It's hard to believe, but I never heard of Wind in the Willows until I was about 16 years old, when it was first read aloud to me, around a glowing campfire. It was an instant love affair.  Years later, I shared the classic with my children. So when we found an animated version of the book for sale in a neighbor's tag sale, we snapped it up. We've loved the film ever since.  The animal characters--Badger, Mole, Toad, Weasel  and all the others--congregate often at Toad Hall and elsewhere, and the story takes many delightful turns.  This animated version, directed by Dave Unwin, is every bit as classic as the book. Your children will surely love it as much as we did--including the child in this particular mom.  --Alyssa A. Lappe 
   Anodea Judith's voice comes across loud and clear: We are in a time of crisis - a global rite of passage - and only by studying our past - the evolution of civilization - can we know where we're headed. This is the most interesting and readable book about history - and our future - I've ever seen.  In fact, I never understood the patterns of our history prior to reading this.  She tells not "his-story," but OUR story.  That's where we've come from.  But she then turns to our future, showing us that we have a choice, right now, and that our choice will lead us either into a glorious future (if we can open our hearts to each other and to the planet), or to more death and destruction if we do not.  Although it sounds alarming, alarms are good to have if you're trying to wake up in time.   In her previous works, she looked at human psychology through the lens of the Chakra system.  In this book, she uses that lens again to examine the development of civilizations.  Because she is a brilliant psychotherapist, it is as if she has Western Civilization on the couch, trying to understand the source of his wounds and bizarre behavior by examining his past. Once understood, she describes the rite of passage he must go through and the decisions he must make (we must make) in order to turn from a mixed-up, selfish and dangerous teenager into a whole, healed adult.  Tribal cultures knew how to take children and turn them into functioning adults.  We seem to have lost that knowledge, so we've remained in our  teenage mania.    I couldn't recommend this book more highly.  This is a book for anyone who wants to understand how we got into this mess, and how we can get out of it.  It provides a hopeful look at our future, but it is clear that our time to wake up - into the heart - is now. 
 There's a laugh a minute in this satirical page turner about the trials, tribulations and foibles of the ego driven staff at "Sellevision".  
 five outstanding eric dolphy compositions performed with wonderful uniqueness by a quintet of jazz masters. dolphy himself plays alto sax, flute & bass clarinet on this recording. he is joined by freddie hubbard on trumpet, bobby hutcherson on vibes, tony williams on drums, and richard davis on bass. rock fans out there might know richard davis as the master of acoustic bass who contributed to the making of van morrison's all-time classic album "astral weeks." on "out to lunch" all five of these great musicians are soulfully creative and a shear joy to listen to. regarded as a jazz classic, this recording certainly deserves that distinction. great stuff 
 Sleep No More by Greg Isles is a soulful chiller of a thriller.   When John Waters, a happily married family man, is approached by a beautiful intriguing stranger who whispers one mysterious word--soon--his life takes an unexpected turn. Suddenly everything he knows as truth and reality spirals out of control as someone from his past reappears. But it is the way that she reappears that will shock you. And it is what she does next that will chill you even further.  This novel is rather difficult to review without giving away the plot or the key mystery, but it is sure to give you goosebumps and you won't look at those around you the same way ever again. It is a mix of horror and suspense, a bit of fantastical and a ton of thriller, and overall, it's one novel you won't want to miss. Greg Isles keeps the tension taut until the bitter end. Kudos!  ~Cheryl Kaye Tardif Author of Whale Song (978-1-897339-02-2) [... 
 If you're looking for beautiful love songs sang by an old pro, this is it.  Englebert has his own style and was true to form in this cd.  I'm not a real fan of his but I bought this as a gift for someone who was and I ended up listening to it  because of the selection of songs included.  If your an Englebert fan and also if you're not, this will please.  My only complaint is there are not enough songs included 
 I received my Mogu about 5 months ago and I've gone to sleep holding it ever since!  They really are nice to hold.  Would reccomend 100% 
 Helen Oyeyemi was born in Nigeria and moved to London when she was four. She wrote "The Icarus Girl" over a seven month period while at school, studying for her A-Levels. By the time she got her results, she'd signed a two-book deal worth an alleged £400,000.    Jess Harrison is an eight-year old girl, an only child and nearly determined to be a loner. She seems nearly to be afraid of making friends, avoids going outside to play as much as possible and keeps her thoughts to herself. She also reads a great deal - "Little Women" is a great favourite and she is also very partial to Shakespeare. However, Jess often suffers from panic attacks and the occasional strange fever.    Jess' parents, Daniel and Sarah, met at university. Daniel was born and raised in England, though Sarah is Nigerian and only came to England to study medicine. She promptly switched courses to study English Literature and is now a successful writer. Fifteen years after she left Nigeria, Sarah is now returning to Nigeria for the first time with her husband and daughter. Although there are some awkward moments for Sarah, meeting the Nigerian side of the family also proves difficult for Jess. While the relations she meet include aunts, uncles and cousins, her grandfather proves to be very much the dominant character : he `rules' the compound in which the family live. It's clear he disapproves of Sarah's decision to switch from medicine to English Literature and her decision to remain in England. In fact, he doesn't seem to entirely approve of Daniel either. However, there is a bond between grandfather and granddaughter - he clearly loves her and she seeks her approval. Although Jess knows she has a Yoruba name - Wuraola - her grandfather is the first person to call her by that name. Not being called Jess, however, is something that initially confuses and scares her a little.    The compound in which the family lives was built in the 1870s by Jess' great-grandfather. Jess' grandfather currently lives at the centre of the compound, with an old and deserted building called the Boys' Quarters located at the back of it. It had once been home to the compound's servants, though it has now been lying empty for many years and now isn't fit for habitation. The trouble for Jess starts when she realises that someone is, in fact, living in the Boys' Quarters - apparently without anyone else in the compound being aware of it. The cuckoo is a young Yoruba girl called Titiola who becomes Jess' first ever friend. As Jess has trouble with the pronunciation, she calls her new companion Tilly-Tilly. While there are a few minor skirmishes in Nigeria, the trouble only really begins when Jess returns to England - and Tilly-Tilly miraculously arrives shortly afterwards. Her friend's arrival brings a few changes in Jess, and she learns a bit more about her life.    This is a fantastic book, and one that I can't recommend highly enough. I have a great deal of admiration for Helen Oyeyemi, completing a book like this in her most difficult school year - and still achieving the grades to gain a place at Cambridge. I'm very much looking forward to her second novel. 
 Great pda it has a lot of space and a little faster the the zire31. the zire72 compared zire31 this is a very good pda. but the camera is not so good because it just is 1.2 megapixels. 
 great resource for small children, but would recommend instead the book for preschoolers which has more information and techniques for toddlers 
 This is the best technique book I have ever read.  The book is very practical in the order that it is layed out; and clear in showing the relationship between the the arts.  The clearity and order of the photos make it very easy to follow each technique from start to finish.  Each technique is true to its Japanese art; their does not look to have any mix of other arts or peronal change to any of the movements.  This is an excelent book 
 Wow! This book is unbelieveable. I had never heard of Rees Howells before reading this book. But as I read, I was challenged and convicted, by his faith and his willingness to do whatever God asked of him.   I disagree with the reviewer who said that this book has a theological problem. The things Rees did (like not wearing a hat and growing his hair long) are things the Lord asked him to do. They are things that he didn't just decide to do on his own. I think that is an important distinction to make. I also believe it is impossible to effectively intercede unless you walk a mile in their shoes. There were occassions when Rees did this in a literal sense. But it seems to me, that he did it more often in a spiritual sense.   I found myself identifying a lot with Rees as I read. The man was not perfect, he definitely had faults. I don't mean to imply that I think he didn't. But the Lord used him in a mighty way and I think Rees has things to teach us all.   I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to break out of complacent Christianity. This book will change your life and your relationship with the Lord, if you read it with an open mind and an open, teachable heart. This is a book to read slowly. You will want to take time to digest and meditate on it. I would also recommend reading it more than once. I have often found that I always gain new insights on the second or third time through. This is one book you will want to glean every possible insight from. There is so much here.   This is one of the most life-changing books I have ever read. 
 Alice McDermott's new novel "After This" takes readers on a journey with the Keane family whose are experiencing one of American history's darkest times. The members of this family, and some of their friends, is also one that endures a myriad of social disturbances, such as drugs, coitus, pregnancy, and college retention. This will be a great novel for anyone that is interested in a story that integrates superior storytelling, characters that come to life, and excellent foreshadowing. 
 Chances are you don't know who Lincoln Perry is, and chances are you do know who Stepin Fetchit is, even though you may never have seen any of Fetchit's movies.  Fetchit was Perry's stage persona, famous for playing the "shiftless darky," the slow-talking, drowsy shuffler that was the comic bane of his white masters.  Perry was as full of contradictions as the character he portrayed, and both get a full biography in _Stepin Fetchit: The Life & Times of Lincoln Perry_ (Pantheon) by Mel Watkins.  Watkins has previously written a history of African American comedy, and so is well acquainted with Fetchit, his fellow performers, and the social changes of the twentieth century that led to the changes in feeling about Fetchit's screen character.  This biography is not just about the man and character, but about a particular aspect of twentieth century American race relations.  Perry was born in 1902 in Key West, Florida, and followed his father into performing, working tent shows, carnivals, and eventually vaudeville.  Movies were not a career that black performers considered at the time, because if depicted, blacks were played by whites in blackface.  Perry may have taken a job as a porter at MGM, and in 1927 he acted in _In Old Kentucky_, his first film appearance, one which got him some critical notice.  Perry did not invent Fetchit's "torpid physical presence and halting, meandering speech," but he performed the role with meticulous attention and timing.  When onstage before an audience, a key part of his act (it sounds like the sort of transformation for which Andy Kaufman was famous) was to come meandering out, looking lost and confused, and start a whining, incoherent monologue.  He would then suddenly burst into a spirited dance that showed that the sloth and stupidity were nothing but pretense.  Watkins makes the point that on the screen, there was no such transformation; Perry's sluggard, always performed with skillful languor, was the only role he got to play.  He became the first true black movie star, and one of the first to have a studio contract.  Like so many actors of his time, he spent lavishly and foolishly.  Throughout his movie career, he would irritate studio executives so much that he would get fired from a movie or from his contract, whereupon he would go back to the road for work on the stage.  He was criticized by the civil rights movement in the 1940s, and was unemployable because of it, although he could have made a comeback in drama in the sixties.  He died in a home for Hollywood actors in 1985.  Watkins has provided a full picture of a complex man of real talent who used it in a timely way, a way that simply became unfashionable as times changed.  Perry's aggressive demands to be treated (and paid) like white stars branded him a troublemaker.  His fame opened doors for other black actors in less controversial roles, but his name stands for a now-regrettable image.  This entertaining biography shows that there was more to him than the image. 
 I have been purchasing from Amazon for several years and have never had a problem with any of my orders. I have recomended Amazon to all of my friends and relatives, and will continue buying from Amazon in the future.    Thank You, Lind 
 This action-adventure fantasy takes place around Halloween in 1992 Los Angeles, a city full of ghosts and ghost predators. The action begins when 11-year-old Koot Hoomie Parganas (Kootie for short) rebels against his Mahatma-worshiping, vegetarian weirdo parents, breaks open their plaster bust of Dante, steals the glass vial inside and runs away.  Robbed and beaten up, he tries to go home but it's too late. He has set events in motion that have caused the murder of his parents and the convergence of forces drawn by the powerful ghost trapped in the vial - Thomas Edison.  Edison's ghost is a beacon, drawing rapacious "ghost-eaters" to hunt down Kootie, a bewildered boy who can't always tell his friends from his enemies. It also draws two other ghost-ridden people - Pete Sullivan, a man haunted by the drowning death of his father and hunted by an obsessed ghost eater, the film maker DeLarava, and Dr. Angelica Elizalde, a psychiatrist whose unconventional methods backfired on Halloween two years ago, killing several patients.  Powers sets these people on a collision course through a Lost Angeles so grittily, glitzily realized, you'll feel like you're walking its haunted streets in person. His eye for detail and the slight skewing of ordinary expectations heightens the atmospheric tension and creates an especially frightening world for the appealing and bewildered Kootie . Well-written, weirdly imaginative and fast-paced, the book's only fault is length. Long after most of the mysteries are solved, the protagonists are still running around barely escaping annihilation and it grows, unfortunately, repetitious. Powers redeems this minor fault, however, with a spectacular finale on the luxurious and history-loaded ship, the Queen Mary 
 Well...I think the title of my review says it all - this novel, in my humble opinion, stands as the best of his many highly accomplished and beautifully written novels. I don't even know how to go about reviewing this except by saying that it's an unconventional love story about two people who fall in love through words - more specifically, the writing of letters. In many ways, it conjures up a slightly different version of Book 5 of Dante's "Inferno" in the sense that although it is not books that bring the two young lovers together, it is still the written word. Unfortunately, or fortunately, 57 years pass before the two of them finally find one another, although only one of the two has been pining after his lost love, pining away by having dozens and dozens of affairs with women from all walks of life.   The language is about as fantastic as it gets. There is a certain weight behind each sentence that makes every one both poetic and full of imagery, but at the same time very quick and easy to read. The novel flows so beautifully through time, events, and people, that you can't help but be caught up in it. Unlike in 100 Years of Solitude where you can feel the historical weight weighing down the otherwise pristine novel, this one blends all aspects of the novel into a masterpiece.   Simply the best from one of the best. 
 I started to watch the film and the first thing I saw was a disclaimer that the DVD had been edited for content, and I stopped right there. A couple of Amazon reviewers mention this too. I found more information about it on IMBD, at [...]. Apparently, there is a legal issue involved, which does not affect the story, but required the removal of a dead actor's name. So don't let it throw you like it threw me 
 This was the first novel by Ms Gregory that I've read and I did enjoy it. There were some flaws. First, I question some historical accuracy....that brother George was [...] for example. In truth many historians portray him as quite a womanizer. Secondly, how could Mary, sister to Anne Boleyn and Henry's first mistress, be so utterly unaware of what life at court was all about? Her sister was so astute...as was her brother, father and mother.  Mary is portrayed as almost witless at times and she could not possibly have been such a dimwit and survived a week in that hot-bed of intrigue and deceit that was Henry's court. At this time, woman were merely chattel so the high ideals of woman's rights espoused by many characters didn't quite work.  On the other hand,  I do think Ms. Gregory's prose moves right along, and she  was accurate on major political details. In addition, she captured wonderfully the ambiance of court life, the beauty of the gowns, the lavish feasts and celebrations, and the totally decadent lifestyle.   She also  captured the character of Henry the VIII, a man so deluded by his own place in life he thought he could usurp God. How could he not see himself as an abolute ruler with all the fawning and false admiration from his courtiers? I saw him as a sad man, facing old age and diminished physical strength without an honest and loving companion, without a single person he could truly trust. He had everything and nothing.  This book held my interest throughout which is saying something for a book of what, 700 pages? and made we want to read non-fiction books about this time. 
 Fay is a spoiled, manipulative woman operating on a level far beyond anything the men in her life can contend with.  Her brother is an emotionally stunted man: as wishy-washy as his sister is decisive.  Her husband and lover are both victims of Fay's selfish scheming.  Dick has presented Fay's marriage break-up in a very specific way.  He's got things to say about the sexual balance of power and the nascent craziness in late 50s California. I'd be curious to know how these observations were received when they were written.  Many of them are still relevant and interesting.   On the surface there's nothing sinister about Fay's actions.  When people get to know her better, they find her unreflective and a little childish; but they give her the benefit of the doubt.  By the time they've peeled back the next layer and realized that everything she does is carefully calculated as part of her grand plan, it's too late and the person is already trapped.  The final revelation is that Fay's grand plan is nothing more than a selfish, shallow desire for respectability; and the victim knows then that he's stuck in someone else's nightmare.  The moral is to never trust surface appearances - even if the sex is good.  A self-evident point, you may think; but Dick has done his job so well that you may find yourself examining your own partner's actions and intentions more carefully after reading this book 
 The `Neo-Luddite' position, as it has been called, the view that evils of modern technology vastly outweigh the benefits, that technology is leading us in a destructive direction, that the benefits of technology are greatly over-hyped and over-sold, that our attitude and approach toward technology and new technological `advances' is at best nave, at worst suicidal, and long overdue for re-evaluation, is argued pervasively in this important book. My caveat here is that one engages a most depressing read - yet, this statement cries out, long and hard, and, inevitably, is one which must be heard by all who claim to call earth home.  Unfortunately, as I write, it is now fifteen years since publication of this towering, tormented masterpiece, which I rate with Walden, Sand County Almanac, Silent Spring, and few others.  Characteristically, the world, less a modicum of its population, has not even given it a sideways look, has not read the book, has largely (virtually) ignored it.  Why?  Do we, at the root cause, read solely or primarily to justify or enhance arguments for our own, pre-established beliefs? The common line of denial/dismissal goes approximately: "You drive a car. You use a computer.  If you tree-huggers were to really walk your talk  - you'd be back living in caves, eating grass and roots."  The claim is that the argument to question the value and nature of our existing technology in a broadly based, open forum, to restrict by rule of law, if necessary, the further growth of technology, and to establish strict and unremitting, publicly adjudicated, criteria for new applications of technology is unrealistic and foolish. Mander begins by recounting the history of the argument, "The economics of continued technological growth on a finite planet, came into question.  And `appropriate technology' became the catch-term for new low-impact technology that operated on decentralized, small-scale principles: solar energy versus nuclear energy, diverse intensive farming versus agribusiness, steady-state economics versus economic growth    . . .  So careful were we not to be thought too radical that we rarely exposed the real problem: a system of logic, and a set of assumptions, that led to the problems . . .  And at each stage of technical development, we fell more deeply into the techno-maelstorm."  Mander then turns to a restatement of his signal observations of the effects of mass T.V. watching  ". . . our minds were being channeled and simplified to match the channeled and simplified physical environment - suburbs, malls, freeways, high-rise buildings . . .  Television was engaging all of humanity in similar thought patterns, similar experiences, similar imagery, and a similar context of reality, which was poisonous to diversity of culture." All of which, the children of the Age of McDonaldsization are blithely unaware. Mander further delineates the difficulty:  "Saying no to a technology, any technology, was (and still is) beyond us.  Virtually unthinkable.  It does not even occur to most of us  that we have the right our ability to turn back a whole technology.  No precedent our support exists for it in our culture . . . In a truly democratic society, any new technology would be subject to exhaustive debate."  Here, we confront the seemingly universal impasse for implementation of progressive values.  They are always contingent on some sort of consensual agreement, which, in turn, is contingent on opportunities for consensual discussion.  In post 9/11 America, how accessible are such opportunities? We ought to be grateful to Mander at the least for locating the issues within an appropriate ideological venue for discussion. In the section entitled, The Madness of the Astronaut (can we not but help recall Clarke's 2001?), Mander points to "the arrogance of Technological Man, the technopioneers assume they are authorized to go anywhere and rearrange anything, including alterations in the structure of human life, animal life, and now natural form itself.  In doing so, they are acting in service to the fundamental principle that has informed technical evolution in the modern era: If it can be done, do it. There are no boundaries, no rules, no sets of standards by which to moderate these activities.  No sense of right or wrong, no taboos; there's only what will succeed in the marketplace."  We are only beginning to experience the consequences.   The second part of the book focuses on the fate of societies who dare, usually by dictates of tradition and ancestral memory, to opt out of living inside a machine with the rest of us and follow alternative, wiser paths. Eloquent, essential.  
 The collaboration of Danah Zohar and Ian Marshall, Spiritual Capital: Wealth We Can Live By offers a highly critical view of the business and ethical practices of capitalism as it is practiced today, with its amorality vested in short-term self-interest, reaping profits, obsession with shareholder value, isolationist thinking, and reckless disregard of long-term consquences. Arguing for the need for a radical new philosophy for corporate governance that adjusts the meaning and purpose of wealth creation, and using the principles of "spiritual capital" and "spiritual intelligence" to define the needs of humanity and human government, Spiritual Capital is a passionately presented charge for people to make a difference 
 My daughter, the 2-year-old Maisy fan, has not been disappointed by this one.  All of Maisy's friends are hiding, and somehow, she finds them all... including Maisy herself at the end!  
 Very thought provoking stories.  Of course I want to align myself with the "good women" however I realize that we are all part of the "good" and "bad" 
 I know that a good number of people would purchase this biography on the basis of what new light could be shed on Ted Hughes' relationship with you-know-who, or through curiosity on what the infamous poet was really like, from birth to death, but either way, I think you'll be satisfied and a whole lot more once you put it down.    I checked this out at my local library and became immersed in every chapter in no time flat. The book is hard to put down because it is written extremely well and offers broad insight into everything that made Hughes who he was. It's obvious that Hughes was a very engaging presence even in childhood, and the biography, like so many others, inevitably plunges into his first meeting and ultimately unstable relationship with Sylvia Plath (an entire chapter serves as a quick summary of Plath's life before the fated meeting).  What separates this biography from, say, "Her Husband", is that after Plath commits suicide, the book carries on in Hughes' favor, chronicling his rather difficult life onward, indulging us with every detail as to the seemingly major damage done to his reputation in the wake of Plath and Assia's suicide, his short-lived relationships with the few women in his later years, his artistic struggles, and his eventual redemption. The book does not glorify him or draw a biased line just because it's his biography, although some would beg to differ; it simply tells it like it is. Some moments of his life were great, but most were rife with darkness, and it makes you understand that he was not a man to be hated for his indiscretions, but a man to be cherished for his grand vision and bold demeanor. There is no question that he and Plath, two extraordinary poets that made each other famous, have made their peace in the afterlife.      
 Great stuff from Shaara.  "Rise" has a different feel than the Civil War trilogy but also is somehow a little less compelling, though hard to figure exactly why.  Perhaps it relates to Michael Shaara's fascinating depiction of Lee in Killer Angels; Jeff is good, but he has not yet topped his dad's work 
 This book is a collection of magazine articles written by Robert Ruark in the 1950s.  For those who don't know who Ruark was, he was a journalist and novelist of the 40s and 50s.  In the post-war era, he became known as one of the most acerbic journalists and developed a national reputation.  He went on a safari in the early 1950s that changed his life.  He spent much of the next decade or more traveling to East Africa to hunt big game and birds, and writing about his experiences.  He was a profilic author and wrote thousands of magazine articles and several novels of widely varying quality.  There are twenty articles in this collection divided up into three sections.  The first section is a selection of articles (written mostly for Field and Stream) just after Ruark went on his first safari.  He describes his thoughts and impressions of the hunt, of life in the wilds of East Africa, and some of his companions.  He also discusses the complexities and dangers of hunting various types of big game including lions, leopards, elephants, rhinos, and cape buffalo.  All I can say is that a safari in the 50s must have been an unbelievable experience.  The second section is devoted primarily to Ruark's impression of the Mau-Mau uprising in the mid-50s.  These section is more of a recounting of various tales of people caught up in the Mau-Mau violence than discussions about hunting.  The third section returns to discussions on hunting, but now we see a more mature Ruark who takes more pleasuring in facilitating the hunting of others rather than his own shooting.  He still retains a keen interest in bird hunting though throughout this later period.  I was inspired to buy this book after having read Hemingway's `Green Hills of Africa' and was not disappointed.  Ruark cetainly was not the writer that Hemingway was, but this collection of Ruark's articles contains far more information on the details and experiences of big game hunting, even if it lacks Hemingway's literary flourish.  I am no expert on African hunting/safari literature, but I feel that Ruark's article bring me as close to the experience without actually doing it myself.  The editor, Michael McIntosh, has written a nice introduction that is part a biography of Ruark (a conflicted man at best) and part a literary criticism of Ruark.  There are also some very nice line drawings interspersed through the text.  Overall this work lies somewhere below a `classic', but it is definitely worth a look if you have any interest in hunting, East Africa, or safari in an era now gone forever 
 Gardner provides scholarly essays on science, literature and religion which  present both essays and book reviews covering Gardner's many, often interrelated interests. Fans of the essays format in general and Gardner in particular will relish the diversity of topic and the lively, witty reflections 
 We enjoyed this film very much.  We live in St. Louis and because of the scenes shot here, it was very interesting.  Good family movie 
 I'm a baby boomer and believe that diet and exercise are extremely important for my overall health, but I get too busy, too bored, too tired, burned out and fall off the wagon.  I couldn't put Joe X down.  I kept wanting to turn the page to learn what would happen next.  It was so easy to relate my experience with exercise and lack of exercise to Joe X's philosophy.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants to be young at heart and enthusastic about getting up in the morning 
 I must say i have never spent such a long time reading in one sitting as i did this book.  The characters are not as deep as other characters Baldacci has written about in the past, such as the characters in "The Winner."  There are a lot of people to keep in mind while reading the book, and it is important to remember their jobs and what their role is, which is hard at times because there are so many of them.  It is a great thriller nonetheless and is fun for those who like good whodunit novel 
 On reading this book, my first thought was that if getting good returns were so easy, why aren't more people following Neff and Dreman's strategy? I read this book just after finishing Dreman's, and it seems that Neff says exactly the same thing as Dreman. Of course I should say rather that Neff speaks more from practice while Dreman's book seemed to contain more of a research and academic focus. I found it interesting because Neff narrates his experiences in a detailed manner against a backdrop of varying economic conditions from the go-go era of the sixties, through inflation and oil scares in the seventies, rising interest rates, and various boom and bust cycles. The latter was particularly relevant for me, since I believe that currently (2006), we are also facing some inflationary fears and rising oil prices. Admittedly, if you are just looking for investment advice, its not the best book however I think much can be gleaned from Neff's experiences. Given hindsight and the fact that the book was published in 1999, I found it remarkable that Neff had advised investing in REITs and home builders back in 1999. (Of course that would have led to a windfall these past 3-4 years!)  Overall I advise reading it, even if it may sometimes sound repetitive, so that its drummed into oneself that low P/Es are safer and speculative booms eventually end in tears 
 I thought it was extremely well written with a lot of helpful hints; well worth the price 
 .......than this one. i read this so long ago and just wanted to come on here and add my 5 star rating to everyone else's. i'm def gonna read this book again soo 
 I use Chris Van Allsburg books in my classroom all the time, but I think this may be my favorite!  A wonderful story about treating others kindly, and revenge of a sibling who is often tricked.  I love it 
 It is so refreshing to "go back" sometimes to real music. Tony Joe White has really over impressed me with this fantastic album of blues, country, rock...as best described. I purchased this one along with the new Van Morrison Magic Time and both CDs are so enjoyable from two musical talents and legends. My acid jazz, soul, funk and other CDs have not returned to the machine since these arrived. Please, if you get a chance to take a trip back to mother earth try and have a listen to this one. 
 This book is a good one, but has one little problem, the book doesn't have much coherence because there are too many people writting the book. You can note the difference of redaction between the chapters because were written for different person and that's what make the book very difficult to read, because one chapters are good, but others are very bad.  I prefer a book written by a few person because are much clear. 
 I kinda like Misty of Chincoteage books.They are not the best books ever.It is about a ship carrying ponies that wrecks and the ponies swim to Chincoteage.Awhile later these kids catch the Phantom and her baby Misty.They are ponies.Good book 
 Robert Pinsky brilliantly translates into terza rima, the difficult rhyme scheme Dante wrote the Divine Comedy in, & does it with such grace, such linguistic precision & genius that the reader almost doesn't feel like it was difficult at all.  This is something I don't know of any other translations that have been able to do in this work that's notoriously very difficult to translate.  This amalgamation of the great timeless & inspired genius of Dante & the brilliance & severe dedication to poetic mastery of Robert Pinsky is far & away my favorite translation of the Inferno.  Pinsky makes it so much more fun to read than other translations I know!  Pinsky's version is great poetry, rife with perfect rhythms & mellifluous music 
 "Received wisdom" places Senator Joseph R.McCarthy(1908-1957)only a few notches below the likes of Hitler and Stalin in the pantheon of great political villains of the twentieth century.The fabled "visiting Martian" might find this hard to understand.While Stalin,Hitler and co waded thru the blood of the millions of victims of their tyranny,Senator McCarthy never killed anyone,never started any wars,never even had anyone put in jail! He did once drunkenly assault columnist Drew Pearson in a tender spot though! The Martian would doubtless have his amazement compounded by the knowledge that McCarthy spent his career opposing communism,a despotic totalitarian political system,responsible for countless deaths and vicious oppression across the world,setting himself against those in his own country who sought to serve the interests of foreign communist regimes and who eagerly wished to overturn the US political system in favor of the communist one. This biography by Arthur Herman,seeks to explain the "how and why" of Joe McCarthy,the man,his career,the political context in which he operated,and the Senator's legacy.This is a broadly sympathetic picture of the the Senator and his "crusade".The only similar pro-McCarthy biographies before Herman which I am aware of,are those by Joe's friends and colleagues-William F.Buckley and Brent Bozell(1954)and Roy Cohn(1968).Biographers who have tended to "have the floor" on McCarthy,are Richard Rovere(1959)and heavyweight writer Thomas C.Reeves(1982).The latters biography has probably been seen as the "standard" one up to now(admirers of the Reeves take on McCarthy might not be so pleased about his later demolition job biography of liberal icon Jack Kennedy!) Herman has the advantage in having access to intelligence material de-classified in the US(especially the "Venona" documents),and the Soviet archives opened after the fall of communism.This allows a much fairer assessment of the period,and McCarthy's career,grounded in solid research. Here we see that the so-called "Red scare" of the 40's and 50's,far from being based in unjustified hysterical paranoia,exploited by seedy political operators like McCarthy,Jenner,McCarran and co,was a response to a subversive threat which was all too real.Soviet spies and agents of influence-many directly in league with Russian intelligence, were working within the heart of the American political and cultural establishment,secretly promoting communism at home and overseas.It was indeed "a conspiracy so immense"(McCarthy's words),which had seen,for example,the widespread entry of communist agents into highly influential positions within Roosevelt's Democratic administration,often with access to classified material which they passed on to Moscow.Stalin was allowed to swallow up large chunks of "liberated" Europe,China fell to Mao and communist North Korea invaded the capitalist South-all this seemingly with US acquiescence.Those,such a Whittaker Chambers(a former communist agent),who had warned the authorities what was happening in their midst,were largely ignored or ridiculed by a complacent administration and a "liberal"leaning press.It was only when the revelations surfaced about Alger Hiss,that a reluctant establishment was forced to at least look seriously at the issue.However it was generally the "outsiders"-poiitical mavericks like Richard Nixon and J.Parnell Thomas of The Un-American Activities Committee(HUAC) and Senators like McCarthy and William E.Jenner-who forced the issue to the forefront of politics.Many of the political and media elite found men like McCarthy "vulgar"-rowdy and unsympathetic.Unlike(say)the Soviet agent from Harvard,Alger Hiss,who they initially championed,farm boy Joe McCarthy was not "one of them". The idea of a reign of terror by "redhunters" is seen to be a misleading exaggeration-in fact it was often more "respectable" and acceptable in many circles to be opposed to the likes of McCarthy than be for him-there was massive hostility in much of the press,and among the political and legal elite(though Joe did,of course have his cheerleaders too-notably in the Hearst papers and among veterans groups).The CBS TV network could still run a breathtakingly unbalanced attack on McCarthy by Ed Murrow on "See it now"(mythologized by Hollywood at the moment in "Goodnight and good luck"),at the height of "McCarthyism"(this term itself-significantly-was coined by McCarthy's target,the academic Owen Lattimore-a State Department advisor on China,who did much to promote the cause  of the murderous maniac Mao and his communists in the United States)  Herman does not shrink from identifying McCarthy's faults and failings-he was a heavy drinker(it killed him),had a volatile temper,often didn't do adequate research,exaggerated,lied(which politician has not?),was a publicity hound who loved to be in the headlines,and was prone to serious errors of judgement(the biggest being over his blind faith in the Chief Counsel to his Senate Committee,Roy M.Cohn-this directly led to his downfall).But we are given a portrait here far removed from the one dimensional ogre of legend-McCarthy was basically kindly,he didn't tend to hold grudges(Drew Pearson excepted!),even when it came to his biggest political enemies like Secretary of State Dean Acheson(meeting Acheson in an elevator,McCarthy shot out his hand saying "Hi Dean!"-Acheson,coldly furious,stiffly ignored Joe,a reaction which left the Senator genuinely puzzled).His methods could be clumsy and his manner harsh(though no more than other government investigators in other areas),yet he was often right about his targets.In this context,Herman looks carefully at some of McCarthy's best known "victims" like George C. Marshall(so insouciant in allowing pro-communist advisors to guide him into effectively handing millions of Chinese to Mao),Owen Lattimore,Irving Peress and Annie Lee Moss.Even the notorious 1954 Army case(known as the "Army-McCarthy hearings")-which would destroy him politically and eventually personally-shows McCarthy was quite justified in launching his probe into Army "leaks",and came to grief thanks to his unreliable subordinates(especially Roy Cohn),his unfortunate television image and style(in contrast to his slippery unctious adversary,Army counsel Joseph Welch)and because he had taken on the massed ranks of a jittery political establishment(Democrat and Republican-including President Eisenhower),which finally decided to unite against him. McCarthy's last years were a miserable record of political oblivion,heroic boozing(he became a hopeless alcoholic)and poor health.Ignored by the press(which was especially hard to take)and fair weather friends-only a few stuck by him such as Bill Jenner,Roy Cohn and notably Bobby Kennedy(who briefly worked for Joe and liked him)-McCarthy died of liver disease,still in his 40's.Yet when he passed away,even his inveterate enemy and victim Drew Pearson expressed genuine regret 
 The content in this book can be applied to adult children. It has a lot of practical advice. The reading voice is natural and easy to listen. It was very helpful to me 
 This book was wonderful for my physiology class.  It wasn't the required text, and I actually didn't get it until 2/3 through the semester.  It was wonderful for the endocrine section, and if you're a visual learner, the illustrations will stick with you.  Costanzo wrote the BRS for physiology, so you can always use those questions to test your knowledge.    The writing is clear and simple.  I'll be using it to study for boards as well as review for pharmacology 
 Very good product. Small, easy to store. Well worth the very reasonable price 
 Though I usually go in for tough police thrillers, I sometimes mix things up by reading a light, funny mystery or- like this book- a quiet, thoughtful mystery set in a small town (a "cozy", I believe this type of mystery novel is called).  "Still Life" nicely combines the easygoing attributes of a "cozy" mystery- quirky, eccentric characters, a small-town setting, pretty much no violence- with a little modernity, in the form of occasional well-placed profanity (though not much) and modern demographics (a gay couple is included among the main characters).  The main detective character, intelligent and interesting, owes a little to Christie's Hercule Poirot, but not everything.  The mystery itself is pretty interesting, too, though some aspects of its solution are a little broad and clunky, as are some of the explanations of why ultimately cleared characters were acting suspicious for a time.  Any shortcomings are quibbles, however, and shouldn't deter one from trying out this nicely done mystery story set in a quiet little corner of Quebec 
  Spawned from the original ten studio albums, and starting with "The Best Of The Alan Parsons Project" disc in 1983, there have been over twenty-five Alan Parsons Project compilation CD's issued!   From an audio standpoint, there is wide-ranging divergent quality between all those CD's, each being a result of the advance of mastering technology at the point in time it was compiled.   In terms of content, however, with the majority of these compilations being single-disc, they all ultimately failed in an appropriate presentation of a catalog so rich in material.   With the release of this 3CD, 48-track set, "The Dutch Collection", the combination of the best standard-CD audio, along with the most comprehensive representation of the greatness of the Parsons/Woolfson partnership, has finally been achieved. Shy of a complete reissue of the entire catalog in remastered form, which has yet to be done (and hopefully this set is a harbinger of that), The Dutch Collection is the set all APP fans should acquire.   Track-by-track, I have exhaustingly A/B'd the audio in this set against the former best of the "best of's". In the majority of the set, I would declare it the benchmark against all others.   There are a few curious exceptions. I found the mastering of "Sirius/Eye In The Sky" on the now-defunct "Platinum & Gold Collection" to be superior. There also seems to be a few millisecond chop of the first piano chord off "Time" on this set: The piano, complete with intact first chord, is definitely more in the forefront on the "Platinum" disc. And, on "Sooner Or Later", the better audio nod, again, definitely goes to the "P&G" CD.   Other minor notes: The 2002 Japanese K2-mastered "Best Of" single-disc CD has the full versions of "I Robot", "Lucifer" and "La Sagrada Familia", where the long sound-effect intros to all of those tracks have been edited for this set. And, they didn't name it "The Dutch Collection" for nothing: The only English language in the package is the logo on the front!   This set carries combined Sony-BMG/Arista/Sony-Legacy logos. As this set represents the best and most complete audio-restoration work to date of the bulk of the APP catalog (46 of the 92 total studio album tracks), one hopes that in 2007 we will finally see a full re-release of all the APP albums in remastered form. It would also be great to see them in Japanese LP-mini-sleeves with all those amazing Hipgnosis-produced jackets replicated in detail.   Also, the inclusion here of a two-minute unreleased track, "No Answers Only Questions", a simple and stunningly beautiful acoustic guitar/vocal song, makes one wonder what other Parsons/Wooflson gems have never seen the light of day. Extensive non-album material would certainly be the hallmark of any complete APP catalog re-issue program (although I personally could do without the "disco-fied" version of the "Separate Lives [Alternative Mix]", the only other non-album track that appears on this set).   Until the Great Alan Parsons Project Re-Issue Event occurs, however, The Dutch Collection is the standard against which all other APP CD's will be judged against.   It is also the one compilation that no true APP fan should be without 
 This book is not for everybody. It is for the professional mathematician (or physicist, or alike). All concepts are very well explained, and Billigsley does go down to the core of everything. It is, as far as I'm concerned, among the best books in math ever written, with favorites such as Feynman's lectures and Herstein's algebra manual. If you are a mathematician and want to have the top reference in probability, this is it 
 1776 is a nice general read on the events corresponding to the first significant year of the Revolution.  David McCullough is a nice story teller, but he is not a military historian.  Such was not the intent of this book.  What I like is that its a nice, fast moving narrative on the 1776 campaign.  Thank god we don't have another rehash of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, with Franklin, Jefferson et. al. doing all their careful draghts.  McCullogh, the voice of History on Public TV, was sensible not to drag the reader through that well known territory again.    The Book covers the seige of Boston just after Bunker Hill to Trenton/Princeton.  One can argue as one reviewer does that much of the book takes place outside the confines of 1776, but that is a matter of conjecture.  In order to understand the events of that year, one must look at both the years surrounding it.  History rarely falls neatly into dates and years as historians often to try to make it.  That said, McCullough provides a nice narrative of the Battle for New York and surrounding areas, as well as the retreat through New Jersey.  This subject is not covered in as much detail as other books, but the story moves along nicely with the usual first-hand quotes to liven up the text.  Battle descriptions are brief, lack detail of regments, movements, etc., but provide the general reader a good idea of what went on.    Washington takes the usual criticism for the often glarring mistakes he made in and around New York, but McCullough like most American historians loves the inner soul of Washy.  So we get some of the usual hero worship again of Washy and Co., but its well done.  Subordinates Greene and Knox are also shown as his reliable sub-commanders who like Washy, make mistakes, but slowly, and painfully learn from them.  Charles Lee and Gates are the bad guys!  Its the standard American tale of taking a thumpin', but learning from it.  American historians love this aspect of the Revolution, and usually revel in it to the exclusion of much other information.  Thus many of the books on the American Revolution tend to repeat the same stuff over and over.  Some take longer to do it, some less.  McCullough falls into the latter category here.    To be honest I don't know why this book was a No.1 non-fiction best seller, but probably McCullough's established name has something to do with it.  That and the fact that he is a good story teller and editor.  A nice read on the first significant year of the Revolution for the general reader.  Not spectacular, but good over all.   
 What more can be said, this collection of songs is beautiful, poetic, and I have no regrets about purchasing it 
 Fetter means "chain or shackle placed on ankle and feet".   This book ministers to the spirit man of them who choose to read. This is an awesome work from a great man of the faith. Be empowered, delivered and set free from the things that have clouded the vision for wholness and restrained brothers and sisters from a great destiny 
 Darcy Wakefield's memoir of her first year with ALS is beautifully written, and one finds inspiriation with the turn of every page. What one would imagine to be a dark tale, is instead, full of light and the breath of life. Darcy faces her challenges with, optimisim, honesty, and, a keen sense of humor. I never would have thought one could fill so much living into one year, and that she does 
 You're Not You is the kind of book you can't stop reading but at the same time you want it to never end. And when the book ends, you don't want to begin a new one out of respect. It's a book that stays with you long after the last page is turned. It's perhaps the best book I read in 2006. Kudos to Wildgen on an excellent first novel. I can't wait for more. 
 My 5 year old is a Barbie junkie. She has all of the movies. This one is probably her least favorite, but she has still watched it quite a few times since Christmas. 
 This book seems full of interesting ideas - I predict it could have a significant impact if its ideas were to become widely known 
 I had no experience building web sites when I bought Jim Buyen's book "FrontPage INSIDE OUT". In just a few weeks, I had my first site up and running. Two more sites quickly followed. The book is 1000+ pages of invaluable information. Plus, the book comes with a CD for viewing on your computer. The cost-to-value ratio of this book is also good. One tip the author included about "Adding Favorites" icons to user's browsers was worth the cost of the book alone. Don't be intimitated by the size of this book. As you improve your knowledge, things become crystal clear 
 i remember this book from preschool and loved it - great book for all children 
  Would "Caligula" or "Nero" be shocked at what their city, the Eternal City, has become so many years into the distant future? Or would they (probably more likely) find themselves fitting right in somehow? This is one of the notions that I found myself pondering as I watched this movie. It really is a great movie, and it is certainly worth any true film fan's time. I may have even liked (some of it at least) better than (again, some of) La Dolce Vita.    Having grown up in an Italian family - my father was born in a "pagliarone" ( roughly, slang dialect term meaning "stone hut") in an ancient and very rural village in Molise - I myself was definitely right at home , so to speak, watching scenes like the famous "dinner on the piazza". (Personally I could watch that scene again and again and not get tired of it, but...maybe it is "an Italian thing", so to speak, and others would not find it so amusing).  However there certainly is no dearth of general humour to be found in the antics of the wild cast of characters which Fellini always brings into his films. And Roma of course is no exception to this. For example the bedridden obese old woman in a hairnet, who owns the building that he stays in in Rome when he first arrives in Rome, who tells him, "now let's just live in peace and not bust each other's balls"!  Or the bald old man who does a rather convincing Mussolini impersonation.  My personal favorite though would probably be the ultra-tanned "Continental" type of guy who approaches the female American tourist the second she gets off the bus, telling her, "You VERY bella" and offering to take her picture for her.  Or the young man in the piazza scene (which is supposed to have taken place some thirty years prior) who is wearing a gold medallion and one of those black nylon "do-rags" (the kind that rap stars wear today), yelling up to his dark beautiful brooding girlfriend to get down to the piazza before he throws her off the balcony.  Sure these are walking stereotypes, these characters, and negative ones at that.   But, as they say, there is a kernel of truth (at least) in all stereotypes is there not? For instance the entire "dinner on the piazza" scene, any Italian or Italian-American must admit, does definitely resemble some sort of "prototypical" pre-emigration summer-night-in-Bensonhurst or some place like that, with plenty of gold chains, "dago-t's", and "pane e vino" to go around.      On a more serious note however the most touching scene (and this is a point that is usually generally agreed upon I think by most of the movie's fans) is the scene of the sudden (and apparently accidental) destruction of the ancient Roman frescoes by the modern work-crew. Obviously this is Fellini's artistic condemnation , if you will, of the massive industrialization of the City in modern times, and the (clearly potentially disastrous) effects of what we may call the "godless modern" encountering the ancient and sacred. Cruel and loud machinery encountering the long-buried, the "resting-in-peace", the "sacred".  Such imagery, like Fellini's vision of the vanishing ancient frescoes, is so evocative it can truly make the viewer want to weep.     Athough Rome has improved much since Fellini filmed it back in 1972, in this film, during both of the time periods that he shows it to us, the City appears to have been delusional. Vaguely delirious with fever perhaps. Or in the throes of a long restless night full of tossings-and-turnings and wild "half-waking" dreams. And it is these dreams that in fact constitute the "images" and "vignettes" that Fellini shows to us throughout the film.          
 E. Lockhart is the best. Her books always make me laugh. The Boy Book did not disappoint. Great book for teens. A+ Can't wait for a next one 
 I loved the Avatar books, they make an impressive addition to the DS9 universe. The characters are expanded, Ezri finally truly begins to come into her own after the continuing confusion, throughout the 7th season, due to her joining. Ro Laren is a welcome addition (I've always liked her character) and the recovery from the Dominion War provides a good backdrop for the story. I made the same mistake as some people--I bought one book and the other sold out before I could get to it--save yourself some stress, buy them both together 
 This book came recommended by a psychologist.  Here Snarch sets out principles from real life situations and examples to help one better understand the dynamics involved in great marriages.  While some of the descriptions are quite detailed, yet the text is readable and fairly easy to follow.  Some of the text is very explicit, but in appropriate context for the subject matter.  Overall it is highly recommended for anyone wanting to understand or improve a marriage. 
 ...but you pulled me in where all the waters of love run deep"! I still keep playing this song over and over again from the moment I bought this CD! All the songs are really great - and rare too - but this particular song (not appearing in Whispers Greatest Hits), back from 1971, is a must have for every R&B (and not only Whispers') fan! 
 My fiance and I had a friend marry us, so we had to come up with our own ceremony.  We didn't want to write it ourselves, but we didn't want a cookie-cutter religious ceremony either.  This book was the answer we were looking for.  I bought many books, but ended up only using this one.  It's extremely well organized, and even comes with worksheets!  It's organized by type of ceremony you want (i.e. traditional religious, contemporary non-religious, quick, second time around), and this was perfect for us.  The readings, vows, and everything in that section ended up being exactly what we were looking to say.  We read through the whole book to make sure other selections in other sections weren't better, but we always ended up loving what was in the section for the type of wedding we wanted.  The people who did this book have impecable taste.  This book focuses on love, commitment, and in some cases religion without being cheesy or overdone.  They have all the classic wedding things you'd expect (such as Corinthians for readings), but they also add readings that are less traditional, but equally romantic and applicable to your ceremony.  It has a sense of uniqueness, but still traditional.  I highly recommend this book to anyone doing their own ceremony, or even people who just want to add a little something extra.  I couldn't have done my ceremony without it!  Between the organization and taste, this book was really well done.  It was such a relief that they organized it by ceremony type (and then by type in the back, such as readings, vows, ring vows), so you're not feeling lost reading through 100 different readings and hating all of them.  This is a bride must-have 
 I cannot recall ever reading a college textbook written with such grace and quiet authority.  Everything from the cave paintings to the latest post modern is mentioned.  Every art work described is illustrated as well.  Gombrich tends to return to the same themes throughout history so you can see how different artists portrayed a king, a child, etc.  Great care is taken to show why a later phase succeeded an earlier one.  Connections of art to national styles and world history are explained well.    Of course, the majority of famous works must be left out, but you can find internet sites to supplement your favorites.  If you like history, are inclined to visual display, and appreciate well-crafted prose, this book will deliver on all counts 
 Directed by the dancemaster himself, Gene Kelly takes a hilarious look at the art of deception: Infidelity!  Without being vulgar or mean-spirited, the story revolves around a restless husband (played splendidly by Matthau) being taught the finer points on how to cheat by a zen master of infidelity: a leering Robert Morse, whose approach to the subject combines the brilliance and cunning of a 5-star general with the stealth of a ninja. Morse freely dispenses words of wisdom to the eager Matthau, who gapes incredulously at his mentor's sage advice. The irony here is that while Matthau is ogling gorgeous women throughout the movie, he is married to a drop-dead beautiful wife of his own, the lovely Inger Stevens.    One of the highlights of the movie is that when Morse makes a point we get to see it acted out by an all-star cast of legendary performers. In fact the list of actors is a who's-who of comedic legends. My favorite scene is the one with Joey Bishop (what woman?).  Given the politically correct nature of our times and the overtly sexist nature of the movie, with it's closepups of jiggling breasts, swishing derrieres, and curvaceous legs, I doubt this film could be made in the new millennium, especially with it's women-as-subservient-to-men connotations.  All that aside, one of the funniest comedies of it's era and one of my favorites.   
 This book is definetly funny. I especially liked it when Gary and Wally were in a compition of love.It was very humorus and tells about wisdom and kindness. I recomend it for ANY kid!!!! 
 This book is quite informative and interesting to read.  If you love any math at all, you should definitally read it 
 Excellent examples and how-to's for faux finishes.  Even though it uses oils, the techniques for application can be used for water-based paints, but remember, oils give much more depth and translucency than water-based.  I, now, use water-based paints in my business and still refer to this book.  Book details TECHNIQUES step-by-step with beautiful color PICTURES, gives  MATERIAL LISTS & PAINT COLORS.  ALSO,includes chapter on building a  professional BUSINESS. Another plus to this book, is it is one of the few  that discusses the polishing and finishing of the work. Good price from  Amazon also 
 This CD was a very uplifting experience. She has done a wonderful work here 
 A product of it's time, this is a super stylish meditation on aging, love, terminal illness and perfect hair.  Bowie is gorgeous.  Deneuve is ageless, stunning.  Sarandon is nubile and sensual.  Tony Scott's direction is ham handed at times, heavy on the early MTV style imagery:  doves, sheer curtains, levelor blinds, et. al.  If you can get past the fear that Bonnie Tyler may emerge from the shadows at any time to belt out 'Total Eclipse of the Heart', this is an effectively scary concoction, drawing parallels between the surprising aging of a vampire's lovers and the (at the time) burgeoning AIDS epidemic.  All this and an opening with Bauhaus in a 'batcave' style bar!  Look for Ann Magnuson and Willem Defoe in minor roles 
 ...and points out that a lot in life is a matter of perspective.   Immediately the reader can identify with the author, whose somewhat flowery prose stills sounds a lot like how we would write about something that we knew a LOT about. Obviously this is a man who enjoys his chosen careers of botanist and writer.   Above all Pollan brings the reader into his atmosphere, and is able to educate without any of the normal side-effects of education--boredom, effort, no beer money. His descriptions of plant and bee sex are entertaining, to put it mildly.   I enjoyed it so much a was a hair's width from stealing it from my friend Alex in Boulder. But then I came here and ordered a copy along with "The Omnivore's Dilemma". Yes, it's that good. - Iva 
 Let's face it: Truman Capote was his own worst enemy. He started out in the dumps, with a mother who didn't love him and a huckster father who wound up in jail. Nice role models. Abandoned, raised by various cousins in the South, fought over by his two repugnant parents, he ultimately found himself in Greenwich, Connecticut with his "loving" mother and stepfather. His mother apparently was horrified by Truman's runtlike appearance and effeminate manners and never missed a chance to abuse the hell out of him. With that template of self-hatred embedded in his soul, he was headed on a path of compensating self-aggrandisement and inevitable self-destruction.  All that said, the man could tell a tale, and exquisitely. He was full of talent, and it comes storming out in some of these wonderful early stories such as "Jug of Silver," "My Side of the Matter," "A Tree of Night," "House of Flowers," and "A Christmas Memory." The wonderful "The Grass Harp" is also a miracle in brilliant writing, which he completed at age 26 and is foreshadowed in some of this early work, as is "Breakfast at Tiffany's." I would mislead you if I didn't mention that some of the stories here are obviously not so great imitations of Eudora Welty and Carson McCullers. But don't throw out the baby with the bathwater. You'd miss out on some wonderful stuff if you did. Too much has been written about Capote's "wasted" life and early promise not being fulfilled. I don't know about that. He wrote quite a bit. I say let's celebrate what he gave us, through his masked suffering and pain, and let's dwell on the fineness of his artistry and his superb entertainments, in plain view in this collection. Of course, Random House succeeds again in producing a lovely book, the type highly readable and the look and feel inviting. This is a winner 
 Intricate, warm, soulful, delicate, heavy, thunderous.  Rumah Sakit's instrumental pieces bring to mind all these things.  Equal parts Steve Reich, Led Zeppelin, Don Caballero, and just plain gorgeousness.  They kick the crushing math rock when it's appropriate, and rein it in for some shimmery bliss when it is not.  I listen to this album at least 3 times a week.  Pure beauty 
 WOW..it has been so long since a book has moved this hardened soul,so for this masterpice i am very grateful.  I really appreciated the fact that Mr Rimpoche did not tone down the book too much to appeal to the new age peacnik liberals who want to find a watered down version of  buddhism. The most important lessson for me was Hell is just as real in Buddhist mythology as The semitic traditions,in fact more so as it is presented in a matter of fact way,not as some abstract reality. Just a cursory glance at what is happening in our lifes and the world around us will show you that hell exist already and just as we are able to easily concieve of a happines that transcends any experince we can have in his world,we should  acknowledge that a a magnified hell is also an equally valid reality.  Another revealing aspect of this book was that the tibetan account  of dying and what happens to the soul after death,the realtionshipo between the living and dying is exactly the same as in the islamic tradition.The karmic recollection after death is no different than the weighing of scales ,the scrolls of right and wrong deeds found in the moniotheistic traditions.As the quran says "whosoever has done an iota of good ,he will see it that day, and whosoever has done an iota of evil he will see it that day" The bardo is called the barzakh in islam the meeting point between two realities,the transitory phase between this life and the next,and the whole experince of what happens in the barzakh and how the dead and living afffect each other is the same exactly..  The book will give an insight on how to live and how to die for a person of any religion and will give clarity to the rituals for the dying in other traditions that perhaps people have lost the significance of, a long time ago.  Most importantly the book will hopefully wake us up to the fact that actions not dogma  will determine what happens in the next life.Our actions ,even the smallest ones are recorded by the universe.you cannot escape from your actions behind some religous formula, for that reason it is as significant to a christian or a muslim as a buddhist 
 I own this book, and it is the best cross stitch medium for Native American designs that I've seen on the market. The charts are large and easy to read. The finishing instructions are clear and concise. This is a very good publication from start to finish and worthy of a "5-star" rating. Highly recommend!!! A +++++ 
 The book's co-authors quote management guru Peter Drucker, who just passed away at the age of 95, in the opening paragraph of the acknowledgements: "Innovation and marketing are the only two valuable activities of a firm. The rest are costs." It's a predictably strong insight from the high priest of business principles and a tenet upon which Sunil Gupta and Donald R. Lehmann, both professors at the Columbia Business School in NY, base their treatise here. In fact, since the dot-com bubble burst five years ago, marketing was deemed dispensable when it came to valuating this responsibility in the eyes of Wall Street and its dominions. However, the co-authors have come to recognize the value of marketing in fortifying customer retention since it is no longer enough to view customers as intangible assets in need of periodic nurturing.  Their book specifically focuses on the issue of calculating customer equity (or as they put it, customer lifetime value) and examines what positively impacts it. According to Gupta and Lehmann, in order to calculate customer value, companies must capture three pieces of related data. First, they need to track the financial and other interactions with specific customers. Companies must then understand how profitability margins may vary over a customer lifetime with the hope that a customer becomes more profitable over time. Finally, they must track customer defection rates, which is the most difficult calculation given that most retail businesses have customers in non-contractual relationships. At the same time, it is this last factor that presents the greatest opportunity. The co-authors provide calculations that show improving customer retention by 1% improves customer value by almost 5%. Moreover, they show how retention is a virtuous cycle, i.e., the higher the current retention rate, the higher the impact of improving retention.  There are numerous tables worth examining which show how increasing the margin multiple increases the lifetime value. Here is an example - given the margin multiple for a company with a 60% retention rate and a discount rate of 10% is only 1.2, that translates into the lifetime value of a customer generating profits of $100 annually is only $120. Increasing the retention rate to 90%, however, with the same 10% discount rate, makes the multiple jump to 4.5 and consequently translates the lifetime value to be $450.  Obviously the greater the number of retained customers, the better corporate profitability will be given the collective impact on the bottom line. This is a good theoretical framework, but certainly market conditions change frequently enough to render the formula somewhat simplistic. If margins change as costs of capital and ongoing expenses change, then the formula becomes more of a guesstimate of how profitable the lifetime value will be. In fact, much of the book is plagued by such fluctuating and invariably uncontrollable factors.  While Gupta and Lehmann acknowledge the nebulous nature of their tenets, they provide a counterbalance in the form of sound business logic, specifically that companies need to start moving toward customer-based accounting and a customer-based organization. This means numbers such as customer satisfaction, churn, loyalty, same customer sales/revenue, new customer acquisitions, and acquisition, expansion, and retention costs need to be consistently and frequently assessed and displayed. Because customer equity is so vital to profitability and even stock market value, Gupta and Lehmann assert quite correctly that it is not as important to pinpoint the accuracy of these calculations as it is to start instilling these determinants of long-run profitability into mainline performance reporting.  The co-authors aren't entirely consistent in their approach as they still discuss intangible assets such as awareness and brand equity without attempting to quantify them in the same way as customer value. This may be worthy of another book entirely, but it seems like a gap to me. They also seem intent on excessively discrediting the more qualitative thinking during the dot-com period without acknowledging the lack of incentive in moving to this direction at the time. However, their point is really to show how much money customers could give you over the years, and to that degree, the book is invaluable as Gupta and Lehmann profess, it's better to be "vaguely correct" than "precisely wrong". I would agree 
 This book is a must-read for all Jim Henson fans! This book tells Jim's life story from his early days working on a local puppet show to the Muppet's 3D movie for Disney. Jim Henson had an amazing life and he lives on in the characters he created for us 
 I have now given this cd as gifts to 24-year-old, 25-year-old, and 3 50-year-olds. I  have received these incredible phone calls from them ALL, calling from their cars telling me this is the most AWESOME cd. The joy in their voices tells it all and of course, I am also listening to the same cd. It is one of the finest discoveries I have made in years - I want to share it with all my friends so they too can be moved by the music. 
 This book is magnificent. I found myself so encrossed in the story. I am just amazed at how Nora Roberts can make you feel. The romantic scenes with Margo and Josh were so powerful. The passion, desire and love between the two of them was so strong. You could only wish you had that type of love in a lifetime. Bravo Nora you are magnificent 
 The basic message of most essays in this book is that growth management and inclusionary zoning simply don't matter as much as their vigourous critics suggest: that neither program does much good or much harm.   For example, one of the earliest essays compares Montgomery County, Maryland (which has a growth management policy that preserves some of the county's farmland, and which also has inclusionary zoning) with Fairfax County, Va. (which is much less restrictive as to both issues), and concludes that affordability problems existed at a roughly similar rate in both counties.  Similarly, another essay evaluates Oregon's urban growth boundary and its affect on housing prices in Portland, and concludes that Portland has not become more expensive any faster than other western cities with conventional zoning.  (Although as William Fischel points out in a reply to that essay, a city with no zoning at all would be cheaper than either Portland OR other heavily zoned cities).   One small quibble: the essays betrayed lots of confusion about what the ultimate goal of national housing policy should be.  For example, one response to the Portland essay (Fischel's) complains that prices are too high in the West- while another reply suggests that Oregon's policies might actually reduce home values by trying to urbanize essentially suburban areas.    Government housing policy is afflicted by the same confusion - on the one hand, government funnels money into housing in order to increase affordability, but on the other hand government restricts development in order to bid up housing prices.  We as a culture cannot decide whether we want expensive housing to protect existing homeowners or less expensive housing to protect the people who aren't homeowners.   
 I must say that this book is a real must-have for everyone who owns a dog. I only wish that I heard about this book earlier, because it gives a really good insight into dogs and the way dogs think, learn and behave. This book is rich in both good information and humor and helps you appreciate dogs as they really are, not as we would (some of us) like them to be. It also has a chapter about basic, intermediate and advanced training of the most important commands: sit, stay, come when called etc.   
 I'm not a real Hitchcock fan, but this movie by far is my favorite of anything he's done.  The story line, suspense and drama is absolutely first rate.  If you want to try a Hitchcock film, this one is it 
 Ophuls is a master film maker and watching Lola Montes is to watch what movies at their best are capable of. That said, I am interested to know what happened to the missing segments of this film - you always hear about it being cut callously - but I am not sure whether the original film still exists... Anyway, see the movie despite inferior versions 
 Artemis Fowl is back (finally)! I was terrified that my favorite Irish billionaire genius teenager was gone for good because author Eoin Colfer has been publishing a variety of books in the last couple of years that had nothing to do with good old Artemis. But, fortunately, the boy genius hasn't been forgotten. He's back and more brilliant than ever in this fifth installment of the high-tech fantasy series.  As THE LOST COLONY opens, Artemis is fourteen years old and experiencing the uncomfortable pangs of puberty. While that alone is enough to keep most teens busy for a few years, Artemis has to contend with his surging hormones while trying to save an entire fairy race as it teeters on the brink of extinction. But it's that kind of multitasking that has made Artemis Fowl an international sensation.  THE LOST COLONY has all the elements that Fowl fans have come to expect, including a dizzying array of fairy-issue gadgets, danger whizzing past our heroes from a variety of sources, ingenious plans, and a bodyguard who is as loyal as he is lethal. This book also includes a few new characters who were, for the most part, likeable and fun. The one notable exception is a twelve-year-old French girl who could give Artemis a run for his money in the genius category. She is pretty, rich, and highly annoying. I often found myself wishing that one of the other characters would "accidentally" dunk her in a sewer, or shave her head, or something equally unpleasant. Is it wrong for me to have feelings of aggression toward a fictional character? No, I don't think so. And you'll understand what I mean once you read the book.  Fans of the ARTEMIS FOWL series will not be disappointed in this newest adventure. There were a few problems with the story, including some hard-to-follow descriptions of how Artemis and company escape their latest predicament, and an irritating French girl (see above). Overall, though, I found this an enjoyable book with an ending that knocked me for a loop.  And, as always, I was left wondering what mischief Artemis will dream up next.  Reviewed by:  K.

 I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It gave me a glimpse of an Irish history that I did not know about. So what if a few dates or characters mentioned in the book might be held to conjecture. History can be written in many ways by many people with different beliefs but the facts remain so. The monks literally saved thousands and thousands of written books, ancient Greek, Roman and Hebrew texts that would have been lost to history for good.   
 The name of the song is "Sleepwalk" by Santo & Johnny.  I don't know if you'll remember that you ever asked this question but there's your answer 
 What's not to like? Light, compact and comes with the strap, case and wipe cloth.  They are perfect.  Keep in mind 12 power can be more challeging to hold still 
 This is the FUNNIEST bit of comedy I have heard in a long time!  Comedy  has been saturated on cable TV, and most comedians have a 'few good jokes',  but Kathleen's are non-stop, and very funny. My wife and I love comedy, and  have not heard anything this funny since our fave comic Ben Elton got us  splitting our guts when we lived in Sydney.  Get this if you like listening  to some funny stuff that still even sounds great on the nth listen!! 
 My 2-yr-old is so in love with this book.  She is fascinated by the simple story and also by the great illustrations.  It is one of her must-read bedtime books. It is indeed a "feeling good book", however I think it is only appropriate for children under 4-yrs. 
 An important contribution to a critical subject.  Change management consulting often suffers from "hack" approaches.  Whether change can in fact be managed is another issue 
 i listen to all kinds of music and i bought the cd after i saw the "lets make love..." video.  they are a unique catchy band with great party beats. i love the singers voice. the lyrics are cool, a couple songs alittle weird, but overall a very good album, and gives pop rock a GOOd name 
 I have been using this text for a number of years in undergraduate classes. It provides both an historical perspective to mass communication and a review of communication research methods. It can also be used to introduce students to mass communication theory 
 This thorough and common sense work on the art of teaching is essential reading for all educators.  It is crammed with practical advice as well as philosophical truths about training and imparting knowledge to students 
 The book begins with a rich descriptions of the various settings in which the stories of the Choctaw people continue to be told.  Mould provides vivid accounts of a range of storytelling sessions and clearly shows that it isn't accurate to view this tradition as a lost art.  He then provides a useful description of salient aspects of Choctaw history and culture to contextualize the stories.  His discussions of the various narrative genres and the various spiritual and supernatural beings are especially intriguing.  The book then consists of a well-organized and highly readable presentation of fascinating  stories.  Some of them were compiled from previous collections while others are stories that he collected with the assistance of people within the Choctaw community.  The stories are interesting reading and provide an important documentation of a vibrant storytelling tradition.  It is especially interesting to read these stories while thinking about the continuity of contemporary tales with the older stories of the past

 Amazon.com does things right. The calendar arrived ahead of schedule, the day before 2006, just like I like. It was packaged superiorly, absolutely pristine. The calendar is beautiful and I appreciate Amazon's service. Happy New Year, Jos 
 This is a classic green tea that brews up to a pale amber liquor with a fine grassy scent. Savor this tea for a delicate and elusive experience. The taste is barley, sweet hay and the faintest herbal taste. The aftertaste is very mild and fresh.  Green tea is touted for its health benefits--not just antioxidants but also because it is supposed to help you lose weight!! Green tea averages about 10-30 mg of caffeine as opposed to 90 mg in a cup of coffee. Tazo does not put how much caffeine is in their tea on the box 
 typical John Gray take on male/female differences in dealing with loss, break-ups, or divorce, I found myself learning more & realizing what we tend to do without awareness when we have had our hearts broken & life altered, especially after any long-term marriage/relationship of 20+ years, it is not only a loss/death of a marriage, it is a total change of life-style, mind-set,& new set of rules, but what John Gray helped me to see is without healing properly from this event or any major loss, that if we don't grieve, & feel all the emotions from sadness, sorrow, fear, to anger we can't release the unhealthy part of that relationship & move forward to love & be more balanced in a new relationship, I think it will help me & others who have a desire to grow & be more balanced, without as John says by (giving too much or avoiding intimacy) I would advise this to anyone ready to move forward in their life with a open heart towards others.

 I love the Anna Pigeon books and have read several, and I know that our Anna eventually finds herself in terrifying danger in every one. (Sometimes I feel that Barr is too cruel to her main character.) But this one started out grim and scary, with no sign of ever becoming less so. The firestorm itself was riveting, but the descriptions of blackened skin, etc., were too much for me. I hated to bail out, because I was already engrossed in the story, but it was giving me nightmares. The occasional cutaways to Stanton's point of view, while offering a break from the tension and horror of the post-firestorm setting, did not allow enough breathing room.  I give it 4 stars because the main reason I didn't finish it is that I am a wimp. However, I do think the story could have been equally interesting without being so (in my mind, unnecessarily) dark 
 For students of the history and evolution of intelligence and it's major players, ISRAEL'S SECRET WARS is one of the best comprehensive surveys of the subject available. Messer's. Black and Morris provide a balanced, thoughtfully researched, and well-written account of the complex world of intelligence operations.  The concluding points taken are poignant, and pithy.  o	Israel has consistently been good at human intelligence, the oldest form of spycraft, which remains, despite sophisticated surveillance satellites, computer cryptanalysis and the other vast technological advances of recent years, the best way to find out what an enemy is doing, thinking and planning.  o	The classic ideological spy, motivated by a belief in the system of his country's enemy, does not exist in the Middle East conflict. There are no closet Arab Zionists, no Syrian, Iraqi, Egyptian or Palestinian Kim Philbys who believe that the transformation of Palestine into Israel, the dispossession and partial exile of an Arab people, is a good and positive thing. o	Ingenuity, ruthlessness and dishonesty have played their part in this history, as they have done, and continue to do, to a greater or lesser degree, in the work of all intelligence and security services everywhere. o	Israel's secret services have always gone far beyond the traditional tasks of espionage and counter-espionage. Early operational versatility - was carried over {from the British}into the years of independence. o	Obtaining weapons and advanced technologies secretly, and often illegally, and denying them to enemies remain a preoccupation. o	Using the media to disseminate stories and warnings that help Israeli operations and undermine the country's enemies has long been a speciality. 
 When I think about it, it scares me that James Herriot almost never got published. It was through a small bit of luck/fate/intuition, whatever you want to call it, that his writing was made into a book.   He has since become the most well know vet in the world (although he is now dead), and his writing has entertained people all over the world. This book, published quite a bit later than his other ones, caps off the series. Another fun 350-or-so pages of writing that will make you both sad and happy at the same time.   I highly recommend this book as well as the others in the series. 
 This book is very clever. It expands on the topics covered in "Dragonology". There are items to pull out and there is another section on dragon writing to translate. 
 Blondie were the fore runner to all the new wave/punk bands; From No Doubt, Garbage, Cranberries, even Madonna and Greenday have all been influenced by the magic of Blondie, and it's easy to see how on this fantastic collection.  Featuring punk, dance, reggae, and even rap, the songs run the whole gamut.  There are the frenetic paced infectiously catchy `Denis' and `Dreaming' (both UK top 5 hits), the tick tock reggae of `The tide is high' (UK & US #1), the Chic-inspired, funky horn laden rap `Rapture' (US #1, UK top 5), the synth layered shimmery dance songs `Heart of glass' (UK & US #1) and `Atomic' (UK #1) both inspired by Donna Summer's `I feel love', the doo wop `In the flesh', the movie soundtrack `Union city blues' (not available on any studio album and UK #11), and the Giorgio Moroder co penned and produced rock/dance `Call me' (US & UK #1).  Then there's the country/pop `One way or another', the beautiful 60s sounding `Picture this' (UK top 20), the sweet 'Sunday girl' (UK #1), their UK breakthrough hit `(I'm always touched by your) presence dear' (UK #10), and my absolute favourite, the deliriously upbeat `Hanging on the telephone (UK #5).  Debbie Harry's sweet yet glacial vocals coupled with the band's innovative sound. Pure magic! Get Blondie's more recent CDs too; `No exit' and `The curse of Blondie'. Great! 
 Working with Excel since ten years and writing add-ins with VBA and also by using the C API, I can claim myself as an experienced user.  In this book the reader may find everything regarding add-in development with VBA, VB6 or C, which cannot be found elsewhere.  This book is REALLY a great source of information for me and I keep it always within easy reach on my desk. If the price for it would be ten times higher, it would be still worth it 
 Like all of Maurice Keen's books, this one is insightful, well-written, and based on thorough scholarship.  This is the place to start a study of  the subject 
 Diamond Sky is rife with adventure. You can feel the wind on your face as your read along. The characters seem to jump off the page in this story about two women in big trouble. Through circumstances beyond their control, they have would up fleeing Russian Mafia thugs in a sailboat they barely know how to handle. The Mafia guys are gun runners and diamond smugglers and their latest cache of diamonds is hidden aboard our heroines' sailboat, only they don't know it. They only know the Russians are bad news.  I loved Beth Shannon and her step-daughter Noelle. They take everything the bad guys throw at them, deal with it and move on. There's a movie here, I know it. I'd just love to see this story up on the silver screen. Action, adventure, smugglers and diamonds, it doesn't get much better than this. I really liked this book.  It's important to be fair when telling others about a book you like, so I should let you know that Mr. Stewart, one of the writers of this book, and I are friends, though we haven't seen each other for a couple of years, and may never see each other again. You see, we both lived on sailboats in the Caribbean, belonged to the same writer's group in Trinidad, have several of the same friends. But my gal Sara and I wanted a baby more than continuing our island hopping, sea going lifestyle. For the first year a baby on board wasn't a problem and we do know lots of people who have raised their children on their boats, keeping them right up until they went off to college, but we wanted Devon to experience baseball and hot dogs, high school someday and most of all we wanted him to grow up surrounded by children his own age. And we really wanted him to have a dog. So we sold our boat and moved to the land. Jack Stewart is still out there somewhere, looking for that next adventure. I hope you give his book a try. I liked it. Yes we are friends, but I really did like his book. But then I like all his books, I think he is a terrific writer.  Jack Priest, Sailor Home from the Se 
 This book has been a lifesaver for me!  After 7 years of suffering from a myriad of symptoms, going from doctor to doctor, with no resolution to my problems, I finally got some relief after reading this book. Little did I know, all my symptoms were related to one root cause: systemic candidiasis.  After doing some research on the internet, I was led to this book.  I had seen several recommendations for it, and excellent reviews. This book will help you to confirm what is happening in your body, and give specific steps you can take to start treating yourself to feel better.  I have been putting Dr. Crook's suggestions into practice for a little over a month now and I feel so much better!  So far, I have only been able to use homeopathic remedies - no prescription drugs - and have noted a marked improvement in my general health and well-being. I highly recommend this book to anyone who suspects they have a systemic yeast infection 
 This is one of several movies which deal with the attatchments of life as reviewed through deathbed scenarios.Some others are "The Jacket", "Butterfly Effect", to some extent "The Machinist" and even "Donny Darko" all films in which you never cease to find new interpretations with repeated viewings. These films are learning experiences and this is one of the better ones 
 Ogilvy might have made his mark starting over 40 years ago, but his approach is timeless.  It is often helpful to harken back to the sage advise of the kings of business from an earlier and more genteel time to try to identify the things we have forgotten -- and are worse for having done so.  Ogilvy reflects class, an ethos of hard work, and an appreciation for what it takes to be competitive.  This book is not about advertising per se -- it's about how to start and run a business that will capture and hold clients for decades, and at the same time make the founder proud of his or her achievements.  You'll be proud to place it next to your Benjamin Graham tomes on your bookshelf 
 This book is great... I read the reviews and they were all true!!! The author's language is clear and simple.  The books gives you all the forms, checklist, pros and cons on the foreclosing homes, dos and dont's.  and for the price, you can't go wrong, even if you just get it for the forms and list of websites and reference he gives in the books, it is worth it 
 Fans of Guy Williams will be thrilled by the prodigious research and this carefully crafted biography penned by author Antoinette Girgenti Lane.  Lane conducted scores upon scores of personal interviews with the actor's wife, fellow actors, directors, producers, stuntmen, children, sibling, friends and virtually everyone who had significant contact with Williams.  Lane's efforts in this regard are remarkable but this personal history is further augmented by the written record.  Ms Lane quotes from a wealth of domestic and foreign newspaper articles and magazines.  She has produced, in 500 well written pages, the essence of Guy Williams.  This is an important work and a must have for any Guy Williams fan.     Williams had an up and down acting career.  He appeared in several movies and starred as the father on the TV series "Lost in Space" but he achieved world wide fame for his earlier roll in "Zorro".  With his European origin, athletic skills and dashing good looks he was a natural to play the swashbuckling Fox, the champion of the downtrodden, El Zorro.  The man had charm and joie de vie like many leading man of his day but we learn that Williams was not an empty suit.  He preferred to read and had an undying love of knowledge for its own sake.   He was a skilled sailor, a talented fencer, an amateur astronomer and lived with a quiet dignity.  When his fortunes faded in Hollywood he complained to no one.  When things were financially hard, he was still cheerful, generous and kind.  In middle age his fame as Zorro soared anew as reruns of the series begain to air in South America and later in Japan.    I admit, prior to reading this book, I had no real interest in Williams.  I picked it up because it had an interesting cover but after reading the author's introduction, I was hooked.  I brought the book home that day and as I read those pages I came to like the man.  Did he have faults?  Of course; no one is without some blame.  But in all the interviews not a single associate, including his ex-wife, had a harsh word for Williams.  I liked his grace, his charm and his wit and so, apparently, did they.  No one spoke badly of Williams because he was a most considerate man and one of that all too rare breed, a complete gentleman.  His attention to and kind treatment of a troubled young teenager gives the reader a glimpse at the nature of a man no one chooses to speak of badly.  Guy Williams was Zorro and Lane lets us understand why. 
 Eschewing easy answers, Peter Kreeft calls us to explore the mystery of suffering.  Examining the thoughts of philosophers, artists, and prophets, he shares clues to the why of suffering.  This culminates in Jesus, "the one who would solve the problem of suffering by suffering, who would solve the problem of death by dying, and in so doing transform the meaning of suffering and death."  People of our day think feeling good is the ultimate objective, and therefore see suffering as an incredibly bad thing.  But when you realize the ultimate objective is the glory of God, suffering is truly a momentary light affliction.  Peter Kreeft helps us understand that 
 I'm a lover of Shakespeare's works. I found a used copy of George Krapp's 'Troilus and Cressida' at a local book store. This Modern Library version is an reprint of his classic translation. If you love to read the sources for Shakespeare (Plutarch, Chaucer,Homer and Ovid) then I believe readers will enjoy this poem 
 I bought this book at the Spokane library. Witch Child is about a fourteen year old girl named Mary, and her grandmother who live on the end of the woods with Marie's cat, and rabbit. I takes place in 1659-1660. Her grandmother is accused of being a Witch, and then gets hanged.    Everyone that walks past Mary, call her Witch Child or Spawn of the devil. Two men in long black coats and black hats kill Marie's two pets. They say these are not god's creatures. The book ends when you just love the book, and ends in the middle saying Maries diary ends here. This book is a true story Written from Mary's Diary; historians found these pages that are old papers from back then. I know you will enjoy this book, because I know I did!  
 This is a hard book to put down once you start even if economics or global finance is not your forte. Joseph Stiglitz goes to great lengths to make this work accessible to everyone; the books information packed pages will give you a greater understanding of the surrounding world.   The author primarily focuses on the IMF/WTO and the impact of the "Washington Consensus" policies that the international financial institutions have imposed around the world. His critique of the IMF's role and policies is set within the context of a number of developing regions around the world, which helps the reader to understand the practical vs. ideological impacts of the proposed reforms at hand. If you are interested to know why the Russian "perestroika" failed or how IMF's policies exacerbated the East Asian Crisis in the late 90's, this is a must read 
 This book teaches good thinking habits for the children and the adults.  We often want to resort back to the way our parents raised us and sometimes it's old hat.  Old hat isn't always bad, but getting the kids to empower  themselves is much better. A little wordy but not too bad.  It's the same  thinking process as another book we found extremely helpful in motivating  our children, "Mommy-CEO."  Both books demostrate a logical plan  for the entire family.  This approach allows the children to  "think" on their own and keeps them focused.  My mom was very  controlling and I just had to change my parenting skills and habits for my  own sanity.  I think we are all stronger, healthier and much happier 
 This was my first Nora Roberts book and it will not be my last.  I could not put this book down.  Her writing style allows the reader to hear and visualize the characters.  I will recommend this book to everyone 
 When I started reading this book I was kind of skeptical because I pretty much knew the arguments for dispensationalism. However, as I kept reading the book I found out that there were lots of things I didn't know about the arguments for dispensationalism.  This book should be read by both dispensationalists and non-dispensationalists. For the dispensationalist to understand their system more; for the non-dispensationalist to understand the system period. Ryrie's chapter on Hermenuetics is good. I also thought his chapters on Progressive Dispensationalism and Covenant Theology were helpful. Though he doesn't get too indepth on why Covenant Theology is unbiblical, he does bring up questions and insights about Covenant Theology. This book is a recommended read for those who are trying to understand this movement within the conservative-evangelical circle. Even if you're not a dispensationalist this book is a great help to understand why dispensationalists are dispensationalists 
 Barbara Johnson is a joy! Her sense of humor and writing style make this an exjoyable book. Unlike most humor writers, her style is clean and wholesome...no vulgarities.  Recommended to every woman who is approaching or is in middle age or older, and is looking at peri-menopause and beyond with dread instead of anticipation.  This book is uplifting.!  There is some humor that is a bit "corny", but it's a laughable kind of corny.  Definitely "thumbs up" for this work 
 Similar worldwide incidents, interdimensional and time travel, Native American connection, sentient beings billions of years ahead of us...these are but a pin point of the riveting topics Dr. Lynne Kitei touches on in her terrific book.  The Doctor has done an excellent job in putting everything together. She has also done an excellent job of getting the word out, not only in her book, but in a brilliant Documentary as well. Very impressive work.  What is astounding is that she remained quiet for so long. Her tenacity, perseverance and commitment gives one hope that significant information will be forthcoming from others of knowledge and integrity concerning what has, is and will be occurring to our planet in the days to come 
 As the Greek Food Host at Bella Online, I refer to many Greek cookbooks.  Greek Cooking For Everyone is one of my favorites.  The recipes are very traditional, yet the ingredients are readily available to American cooks.  The first few pages of the cookbook offer background information on the staples of Greek cuisine, and tips on stocking a Greek kitchen, which is very helpful and informative.  This cookbook is divided into menus rather than types of food (i.e. 'meat menus', 'fish menus', etc.), so that each section provides a meal complete with appetizers and side dishes.  Most recipes are for four or more people, so if you are looking for recipes for two, you will have to adjust the measurements. Although this is not the type of cookbook that includes professional, color photographs of Greece, it is a very handy reference and a great source of traditional Greek recipes 
 I agree with other reviewers that the pulls are a little stiff on this book, but i just slip a finger in the page while a pull and they all go easily. Not a big deal to me at all. I cannot let my 10 month old play with this book like she does many of her others, but I knew that from the start. She finds it mesmerizing though and I have a feeling that we will get years of use out of this one!! 
 Great book about the massive growth of the industry.  I think it lets doctors off too easily; they're definitely part of the problem.  It's amazing how free pens so deeply influence the so-called professionals.  Probably, sales reps should pass out shiny gold stars too - it works with grade schoolers 
 Great reissue by Reebok of a shoe immensely popular in the early 1990's.  It would be nice to see this trend of recreating classic styles from the past continue forward.  The 4600 High could come back in more color schemes, with some colors vintage and some others contemporary.  Perhaps more "real" hi-tops could be brought back by Reebok and other companies as well.    
 When I was younger, I wrote poetry all of the time, but it was a very intimate, secret self who wrote those poems.  As I grew up, I thought that the angst of my earlier days was best bottled away.  One day, at 45, I started to develop stress-related illnesses and had to find a way to re-connect with who I really am, find a way to figure out what is real and what is pretense.  Enter this book.  My earlier poems, luckily still stored away in a file in my home, told me what I used to know, and in writing poems for today, I can celebrate the journey since then.    I wish I could meet the author of this lovingly written adventure/book --he impresses me, through his own poetry and his writing, as someone who can accept people as they are and then gently, patiently, invite them to find their own voice and grow 
 I did watch John Edward's program a few times when it was on TV, especially his celebrity readings (one of which was with Roma Downey) and he openly talked about the fact that he prayed the Rosary before each program. I happened upon this book because I created and maintain Roma's Official website. I'm a cradle Catholic as is Roma (Irish Catholic) and John Edward. I found the information on prayer beads from other cultures and religions interesting. But as a Catholic who attended Catholic school, a lot of it was information I already knew. The very best part of it all is Roma Downey on the CD. She first gives you instructions on how to say the Rosary and then says the whole Rosary. There is lovely background music as well. It's really beautiful and it's almost like praying the Rosary with her in the room with you :-) She speaks for about 28 minutes. Then John Edward starts talking and it's like being jolted into reality...I just don't find his voice to be soothing at all. Roma didn't collect any money for being part of this project, all she asked was that money be donated to the charity Operation Smile. I find it strange that no where in the description of the book here at Amazon does it even mention Roma Downey and it doesn't come up if you put her name in their search engine. But on the bottom of the front cover of the book it does say: "Includes a FREE BONUS Meditation CD featuring actress Roma Downey."  There is an element of New Age beliefs to the book....most Catholics won't be offended, some will...John Edward has a mixed bag of fans.  Buy it if for no other reason than for Roma on the CD! 
 'War devours everything' is the general theme of this more recent adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's famous novel. Directed by Delbert Mann, the film satisfies on many levels with a very good script; good cinematography and direction; and, the good acting talents of Richard Thomas, Ernest Borgnine, Donald Pleasance, and Ian Holm. The story is a first-person narrative detailing the life of its author, Paul Baumer (Richard Thomas), during the period of The Great War from 1916-1918.  Baumer just graduated from high school and, like every other good German, he signs up for the war along with his classmates to serve his Fatherland: it is the ideal that has been pounded into them by their school teacher (Donald Pleasance.)  At first all gleaming with overconfidence, the narrator and his friends soon realize that there's no glory in war even if one has dutifuly served the Fatherland and received an Iron Cross pinned to their chest by the Kaiser himself.  As with the book, the narrative uses the characters to show how the reality of war, in one way or another, destroys or changes the ideals of life: it is rich in showing the futility and beastiality of war.  The film really looks at the two main schools of thought that were a product of WWI; positivists such as Bertrand Russel who thought that modern progress was a positive factor to humanity if guided by moral values and, the school of nihilism that thought morality was relative and human existence purposeless: that modern industrialization was not a sign of progress but the beginning of the end.  Baumer and his friends are, at first, the voices of the positivists: despite the war, they're all still obsessed with their dreams of becoming artists/writers, theologists, farmers, and foresters.  Their  sergeant (Ernest Borgnine) is the sobering pragmatist who teaches the youths to dispense with idealism and to bear only the brutal reality of war in their thoughts: he teaches them the practical skills of finding good food and to survive by using their shovels to kill the enemy instead of the bayonet.  Slowly but surely, each of the narrator's friends become victims of the war despite their idealism: some of them are killed precisely because of their idealism.  In short, the narrative subtly explores every possible facet of war in how it permanently destroys, disfigures, or otherwise changes life and the human spirit: it explores the utter futility and dehumanization of war.  Although one follows Baumer's optimism throughout the story, one realizes that optimism ultimately changes nothing in terms of the reality of war: only one's perception of it. The story actually leaves the question open as to whether an optimistic outlook serves any purpose at all in either war or peace. The film also shows the growing gap between the young soldiers and the elder generations who still saw war in the context of the 19th century: as a glorious and heroic duty/sacrifice to the State. In contrast, the youths are ages apart as they've experienced first hand the horror and desolation of modern warfare which their elders cannot possibly understand (e.g. machine guns, planes, mustard gas, etc.)  This is an excellent film that has great direction, cinematography, and acting that is far above the standards of a made-for-tv film.  The filming in the Czech Republic is always a good place for German/Austrian related films (i.e. Amadeus.)  The script was well done to bring out the poignant themes in the book.  There are some inaccuracies and limitations in its depiction of the military and equipment during that time but a lot of it is budget related as opposed to being signs of incompetence (i.e. no artillery is shown, few aircraft, no tanks, etc.)  With the way the soldiers are constantly placing their rifles muzzle first into the mud in every scene, it makes you wonder whether it was the script's soldiers or the actors who received such incompetent training in handling a firearm in battle.  There's also a scene where a corporal badmouths a sergeant and everyone seems to think it's normal.  Anyway, these are simply minor defects that have no major impact on the film.  I strongly recommend it as the only other version, although a classic film, is black and white and over 70 years old.  Good companions to this film would be 'The Lost Batallion', 'Gallipoli', and 'The Blue Max' which all deal with WWI.  In terms of theme, a good counterpoint to this film is 'Cross of Iron' which is also a great film in exploring the futility/absurdity of war except that it is set in WWII from the German perspective.  Unlike this film, 'Cross of Iron' is grounded in a nihilistic theme that rejects the notion of idealism having any use either in warfare or life in general: making the theme perhaps even bleaker than this one. 
 The Continual Improvement Process: From Strategy To The Bottom Line by Craig Cochran (Project Manager, Center for International standards & Quality, Georgia Tech Economic Development Institute) is a guidebook especially for business managers and owners, offering practical wisdom for effective problem solving, learning to identify and communicate what is important, and generally crafting an environment that fosters improvement in efficiency, customer satisfaction, revenue, and more. Black-and-white diagrams help to clearly delineate the basic principles, and straightforward prose presents suggestions in easy-to-grasp terms for readers of all backgrounds. An excellent sourcebook for strategic planning ideas 
 I ordered this product and it arrived 2 days later. It is genuine Canon ink for a great price. I will definitely buy at amazon.com again 
 Great book. Very vivid descriptions of language, character and the family structure of non-native society in London. I feel that this book could explain the conflict any transplant could experience in a foriegn land.  It almost explains, though, that once you have tasted the western world, there is no going back.  Didn't care for the ending, though-- too much like a Wes Anderson movie where the players all congregate toward one spot rather unnaturally.  If you desire wit, involved reading and changes in eras, White Teeth is definitely for you. 
 I must say this was an incredibly fun sourcebook to read.  At times it had me laughing with humorous quotations such as; "I am amazed, o wall, that you have not collapsed and fallen, since you must bear the tedious stupidities of so many scrawlers" and at other times I would shudder; "Good God, what scrawny little slaves they were!  Their skin was everywhere embroidered with purple welts from their many beatings.  Their backs, scarred from floggings... their complexions were an ugly yellow..."    Using a slew of both primary and secondary sources, Jo-Ann Shelton takes us through the life of the Romans.  Covering topics as varied as slavery, provincial administration, the family unit, the magistrates and occupations, we are brought directly into Roman life with all of its practices, norms, values and peculiarities.  The key feature of this book is the focus on the common Roman and how they lived with a section devoted entirely to woman in Roman society, a much overlooked topic.  From dinner parties to funeral clubs, all aspects of the common Romans life are discussed.    In all a very worthwhile book to own and use as both a source of reference and entertainment! 
 Paul Gilroy brings a fresh eye and mind to the challenging task of examining black cultural and political manifestations as they affect the transglobal community. Gilroy, unlike some cultural theorists, sees the  interconnectedness between those discourses around race, class, gender, and  sexuality and its impact on the black and world communities. It is his  articulation of how these entities are intertwined that makes for a fresh  and insightful examination of contemporary black diasporic experience 
 Joseph Goldstein has the ability to explain the essence of Buddhism and it's core teachings in a very understandable and condensed format.  If you are confused by the different Buddhist sects and dogmas, or are interested in the basics of Buddhist practice, then this book is for you.  Goldstein has the background and insight to be a believable expert and teacher 
 West of Home is a series of letters that Laura wrote to Almanzo while she was visitng Rose Wilder Lane in 1915 San Fransisco.  Due to the farm, it was decided that Almanzo would stay at home while Laura went out for a long visit with Rose.  Laura wrote in great detail of all the happenings.  She was Almanzo's eyes in the same way as she was her blind sister Mary's eyes.  She described the landscape, the 1915 Expo, Rose's life and work and the great foods of the California area.  Rose was homesick for her parents and sent Laura the money for train fare and money home to help with Laura's absence.  You can tell by the letters to Almanzo that he had written her about the happenings on the farm.  It's too bad they weren't published along with these.  You can tell Laura and Almanzo greatly miss each other but Laura is enjoying her time with Rose and Rose's husband Gillette.  A wonderful look of San Francisco in the year 1915 
 I first purchased one of these for my older daughter in Germany. It's five years old and still looks great. My younger daughter loved hers - I purchased the twist top attachment (she's too young for a sport bottle top) and she drinks from the open bottle more easily than a cup. Perfect size for little mouths.   I was concerned that these are not meant for the dishwasher, and I was skeptical of the claim that they only needed rinsing. It's absolutely true. I bought some special cleaning tabs and I've used them only a few times - always when traveling and some sort of juice has been forgotten for days. (It's so easy to clean them out this way - warm water plus cleaning tab, 30 minutes later it's brand new inside) Great for lunches or backpacks, no glass to shatter or plastic lining to transfer taste. Can't live without them now 
 After the mediocre Force Heretic trilogy, the New Jedi Order story arc was in serious need of a novel to turn things around.  Greg Keyes was up to the task with 'The Final Prophecy.'  Keyes' novel shifts the focus of the story away from the most familiar characters in the Star Wars universe and places it in the hands of some lesser knowns.  The result makes for an excellent read.  The story features Tahiri and Corran Horn.  Tahiri is still integrating her two personalities:  her old self, the Jedi student, and a Yuuzhan Vong personality engrafted into her by the shapers of the invading Yuuzhan Vong race.  Tahiri has become one of the most interesting, if not the most interesting, characters of the NJO.  She is not a cliched Jedi character.  Many revelations into her character are made over the course of the novel.  Corran Horn is familiar to most readers of Star Wars novels.  He has played a part in many of the best novels to date.  He agrees to lead a mission to Coruscant to retrieve the shaper Nem Yin and the Prophet of the Shamed Ones of the Yuuzhan Vong, and to take them to the planet of prophecy--Zenoma Sekot.  Tahiri joins him primarily because she made a promise to a dying shamed one that she would find the planet, and because her Vong abilities and knowledge would be of particular use on the mission.  The relationship between Tahiri and Corran Horn is classic Star Wars.  There is a sense of mistrust at the beginning of the novel, but the two characters settle into a mentor/student relationship nicely.  Keyes' ability to write a novel that feels like Star Wars without relying heavily on the classic characters of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, or Princess Leia speaks well of his abilities.    The interaction between the Jedi is one of the great strengths of the novel.  Another strength is the action sequecnes.  Keyes does a superb job with both the hand-to-hand, or light saber to amphistaff, combat as well as the detailing the fight between General Antilles' fleet and that of the Vong in space.  The only weakness of the novel is that once again, a NJO series novel relies heavily on Zenoma Sekot, the sentient planet.  Sekot still seems like it should be in the Star Trek universe, not in the Star Wars universe.  Fortunately, clues laid in previous novels about the origins and mystery of Sekot start to unfold in this novel in a way that makes the series and the tie in to 'Rogue Planet,' a prequel era novel, make sense.  Still, I would rather have seen the authors of the NJO work out a solution to the Vong in a different way.  I highly recommend this novel.  Star Wars fans will enjoy it.  Those that prefer reading about the classic characters would be better off reading a different novel.  I'd still recommend reading the NJO from the beginning, which is R.A. Salvatore's 'Vector Prime,' and I'd recommend reading 'Rogue Planet' in order to understand the prequel era tie-in.  However, this novel could be read without leaving a new reader too confused 
 I have struggled with my house for years.  Finally, I am getting it straigten out and feel comfortable having guests again 
 This is by far one of the greatest books I have ever read.  It details the amazing story of a boy with health problems who is pushed by his father to rise above these problems and not use them as a crutch.  TR is able to not just rise to normal physical activity, but rather he rises above the norms and becomes an extraordinary soldier, leader, speaker and president.  His fearless nature, instilled in him by his father since childhood, is seen in his bold moves as the leader of the Rough Riders and as a proactive president.  McCullough is able to capture the privelaged, sophisticated upbringing as well as the adventurous westerner that lives inside the same person; Theodore Roosevelt.  A great read for anyone unfamiliar with TR 
 Devil In A Blue Dress is a beautiful book, with its Southern dialect and the change of the pace of Los Angeles's tough streets. Devil In A Blue Dress tells the story of Ekeziel 'Easy' Rawlins and his quest to pay his mortrage after he is fired from his job at a defense plant. The books explores the racial and gender segregation in post war America. It invites you, the reader, into a web of desire and intrigue 
 This is a story of Lizzie she is a modern girl who like all girls she is looking for love.   This book is alittle Sex in the City, Bridget Jones all wrapped up in a Jane Austen flavor.    The book is fun and a fast book to read.  I thoroughly enjoyed.  
 Doctor Zhivago, written by Boris Pasternak, is a story about the turmoil of revolutionary Russia and its people.  It begins a few years before the Bolshevik Revolution and follows events that lead to Civil War and the establishment of the Soviet government.  The main character is Dr. Zhivago, a kind and passionate man, who is constantly affected by these events. The book has excellent historical value as well as detail of its characters so that it fully embodies the disorderly mindset of the people.  This is most evident in Dr. Zhivago's relationship with a woman named Lara.  He and his wife Tonya were happily married but when he was drafted to a medical outpost he fell in love with the nurse Lara.  Though the Doctor is a good man he is torn between his two loves and inevitably cheats on Tonya.  His relationship with Lara beautifully parallels the political struggle that was taking place in Russia.  She represents the Communist Russia that the people longed for.  She is so close yet unattainable; every time the doctor begins to settle with her they experience pain and hardship, whether it be by outside forces or their own actions.  She is impossible to reach, impossible to forget, and their relationship, like the revolution, was impossible stop once it began.  Dr. Zhivago allows the reader to witness a struggle of the human mind's judgment and its desires.  It demonstrates that our decisions can start us in one direction and that life's unforeseeable circumstances can easily lead us astray. 
 After his singing career began to wane, Frank Sinatra began his meteoric rise in the movies. One of his best comedic roles was in the musical Guys and Dolls. But here's another little-seen gem, a Frank Sinatra sleeper that many viewers have caught bits of but which only recently appeared on DVD.   After seeing this film, I tried to track it down, not knowing the name of it, and finally found it in Leonard Maltin's film guide (check out his review). They don't make movies like this anymore. That overused cliche is an understatement for this film where everything works, especially the chemistry between Sinatra and Eleanor Parker, but the show stealer is his twelve year old son, Ally, who takes care of the always drinking, always dreaming Sinatra. Edward G. Robinson tries to straighten him out, at bottom still believing in him. If you're wondering if Capra ever made anything as endearing as It's a Wonderful Life, yes he did, and here it is, a great family film now on DVD.  
 A lot of people tend to say that this anime is confusing and doesn't have a real plot. They say that overall, it doesn't really have anything good going for it. But I LOVED it. I believe that it was the authors' and directors' intent to leave it open for interpretation. I remember seeing it with some friends, and aftewards, we were a bit confused. But it led to a wonderful in depth conversation between all of us about life, death, reality and imagination as well as a bit of tragedy. It was a great experience to hear each others interpretations of the story and to discuss it.  Interlude is a bit confusing and not an anime to be taken lightly. It focuses a lot on the line between the real and un-real. It's for the people who like to think, interpret and discuss. For me, it was a very rewarding experience to watch this and have discussion after. I'd recommend it to anyone who was willing to think deeply about what they're seeing as they watch. 
 This book is one of the hardest I've ever read on an emotional level.  There were times I was so enraged at my government it was all I could do not to pack up and head over the Canadian border.  I'm a fast reader and this book took me extra long to finish because there were places where I had to stop. I was overwhelmed.  I've never read anything by Samantha Powers before but I will certainly be keeping my eye out for other offerings from her.  I prefer non-fiction in a journalistic style and this is superior for the genre.  For all the rage I still feel for my government on the issue of genocide, I must thank Powers for introducing me to some new heroes - Proxmire, McCloskey, Daillaire and Lemkin.  And I'm also grateful for her inclusion in the book of the "are" vs "do" philosophy.  Having just removed myself from a fanatical catholic environment that stressed merit for who you are vs. what you do, I was elated that someone in the universe (Powers) gets it and can state it so simply.  Judging one on what they are (Kurd, Jew, conservative, etc) rather than what they do is rife with possibilities for erroneous insights.  And fanatics of any label aren't known for accurate insights.  After all, Hitler was a evil nut, and that was fine until he started to act like one.  If Powers returns to this topic in the future I hope it will be to spell out exactly what my national interests are so that the government can clearly see it is never correct to allow bullies to exterminate those they can.  I hope she will not have to add update chapters on our failure in Dafur, but fear she will 
 I first came across the photographs of Joyce Tenneson in The Sun Magazine; I was instantly entranced. Here were photographs that spoke volumes, that said here is the spirit of woman that has been hidden by fashion, jewelry, makeup and society's expectations. They are photographs that you can spend hours with. Her work reminds me of that of Imogene Cunningham, though their years are far separated. The book does not need the quotes, the photographs speak on their own 
 After seeing the recent Larry Clark collection at the International Center of Photography in New York, I decided I needed this collection.  I had never experienced this side of Tulsa (the city) before.  I make frequent trips there for daily outings (it's only 2 hours away), but I've never experienced the harsh reality of the meth addict lifestyle that was portrayed in this book.  Of course, that was 40 years ago, times change, and the drug is more commonplace in this area now.  What I've always liked about Larry Clark's work is that it doesn't set out to glorify situations such as those portrayed in "Tulsa".  It's more about cause and effect.  The reality that your actions bring about some other action.  Playing with guns can lead to accidental gunshot wounds.  Pregnant?  Shooting up may kill the baby.  The photographs here are grim, disturbing, yet beautiful.  Something which isn't the subject of much glamourized photography.  I just wish his other books were re-released 
 This cd of Sonny Rollins is the second jazz cd I have ever purchased.  I bought it along with Louis Armstrong, The Definitive Collection.  As I stated in my review of Louis' cd, I am a hard core rock 'n roll/heavy metal girl and have never intentionally listened to jazz before...but I think I'm hooked now!  I listened to samples of a LOT of albums before I made this purchase, and Sonny's music reeled me in like no other, with the exception of Louis.  After listening to this cd, I am going to look for more of Sonny's albums to buy.  I'm sure his music can turn anyone into a jazz fan...it did me, and that's quite an amazing feat 
 I started reading this book last year in August together with my husband. It took us a couple of months and during that period we both smoked one here, one there, and always had a hidden pack somewhere in the house. The day before Thanksgiving I smoked my last cigarette, and since then I've been SO happy not smoking... I don't smell like an ashtray anymore, my clothes, my hair, my hands, my breath, my car, my house, are all clean now. My skin looks way better, and being close to 40 this means a lot! I smell everything now, and TASTE more too. Little by little, everything mentioned in the book takes effect. As Allen Carr describes with accurate perfection and acid humor, all smokers' feelings, believings, self-lying techniques, and so on, all he says will happen after reading the book, REALLY HAPPENS!!! I already recommended this book to a dozen people at least, and gave two as a gift. When I see people go out of my office building to smoke, many times a day, from very early in the morning to late PM, I FEEL DEEPLY SORRY FOR THEM. They are still trapped and I'm finally free. I'M NOT AN ADDICT ANYMORE, and it was so easy... The first step is admitting that every smoker really wishes to quit, but they are scared... PEOPLE WAKE UP!!! Smoking is NOT cool, it's for no-brainers... In a year (Aug 2005 thru July 2006) I put on 20 lb, but after reading Allen Carr's Easyweigh to lose Weight, I already lost 10lb (in 2 months). Thanks Allen, you helped me BIG TIME!!! I'll never stop spreading the word.....  :- 
 All of my questions about Hell were addressed in this simple book.  In an upfront, honest, clear, and useful manner Emanuel Swedenborg tells of the conversations that he has had with Devils and Evil Spirits.  He does not try to impress, or persuade, he just informs.  This book was such a relief.  I expected a series of unbelievable encounters, but instead I found accounts of situations that are exlemplary of real interactions.  This book is understandable.  It is very true.  It is helpful and uncomprimising in its integrity.  I reccomend it.  No matter what you believe about the afterlife, it will help you to understand many of the reasons why life is the way that it is 
 A powerful evocation of the pre-World War I period in America. Doctorow painfully dramatizes (as well as personalizes) the social abuses of the latter 19th Century but still manages to re-affirm the possibilities inherent in the American dream. The focus is on a single, not-so-typical American family, although such luminaries of the era as Harry Houdini, Henry Ford, and Pierpont Morgan also appear as minor characters. Father goes on an expedition to the North Pole and comes back with more than he bargained for. Mother's brother becomes embroiled in a torrid love affair with a notorious beauty who has played a significant role in a famous murder case. And the main plot line shows how the entire family is endangered (and has their lives dramatically changed) by their involvement in a black family's fight for due process.  But this isn't as small a novel as "To Kill a Mockingbird". Doctorow's focus on the family and the personal side of these events is only the lynchpin that holds together a sweeping, wide-ranging look at turn-of-the-century society as a whole. Perhaps not since "War and Peace" has one novel so successfully combined the intimately personal with the grand scope of history. Politics, racism, sexual mores, yellow journalism, corruption, the entertainment revolution, terrorism, labor relations: all pass under Doctorow's analytical gaze. Easy to read and not overlong, this would be a great book for high school students to read in learning about pre-War American society, if it weren't for the sexual content, which is higher than average for a work of this kind.  As it is, this novel is episodic enough that teachers could assign excerpts without killing the power of the whole book.  Very highly recommended 
 I read this book in the language it was first published in, Hebrew. I found it remarkable . It showed in a deeper way than any other research I had seen the connection between the lives of the philosophers and their thought.  I will give just one telling example. Scharfstein discovered that most of the great philosophers had lost at least one parent at a very early age. The need to think deeply about the world, to understand the meaning of it all, relates certainly to that early and great loss.  This work is illuminating throughout and recommended to any real lover of philosophy, of trying to understand the world 
 This is the first episode where we really see the heart of Tony in his dealings with a teenager struggling with the horrible death of his father. A must see 
 The minute I heard there was a new Stooges cd out, I ran to buy it, even though the reviews I had read were mediocre. I wasnt sold on it at first and the sound is slightly muddy, but after a couple of listens, I havent had it out of my cd player in over a week !!!  Turns out to be next to classic Iggy, some lyrics are lightheaded, but most are great songs. My faves are ATM, My very fave is My Idea Of Fun, the creepy title track with balladeer, crooner Iggy in rare form, ALL stand out but maybe 2 that are fillers. If you like Iggy and Stooges, GET IT ASAP.  Take my suggestion on listening more than once, you will be sold.  Norman C- Housto 
 If you want to learn photography and you would prefer to learn (or supplement your learning) by intensive case study, this is the book for you. Ansel Adams is a master at controlling composition, light and perspective, and he conveys his unique methodology admirably in this book. This book covers much more than his epic landscapes -- there are a lot of still life, portrait and architectural case studies. And he's not just discussing the zone system, but also everything else involved, including packing the right equipment, leaving at the right time, and hunting down the right subject. And above all, patience and persistence. The photos themselves are reproduced with admirable tone, sharpness, and contrast, as they are in all the books in this series. And although there are only forty of them, each case study runs two or three pages in addition to a full page photo. And if you like this, check out Ansel Adams' classic three part intensive introduction to photography, in the same series as this book: The Camera, The Print, and The Negative 
 If you like to read about different kinds of homes and what lives in them, you would like this book. It is about a cactus that lives for 150 years! In that time about 38 animals make holes and move in. After 150 years it falls over and 10 to 20 more animals move in. This is a great book 
  This album is amazing! These guys are definately the future of heavy metal. They guitar playing is amazing which is the most important ingredient in a good album. Sure the singing is the best ever, but it is okay. The bass playing, and drum playing are good as well. This album is definately worth every penny 
 Based on the description, I expected this to be a DaVinci Code knock-off, but gave it a shot since I recieved a free copy.  Comparing Labyrinth to The Davinci Code do it injustice; this is definately not an imitator and is worth reading in it's own right.  I enjoyed the characters, plot, and switching between the past and present.  I'm not sure it has literary value (I wouldn't argue that The DaVinci Code does, either), but it's certainly complex enough to make you think about the plot and character relationships without being difficult to follow 
 You have to appreciate the genius that is Richard O'Brien to truly enjoy this soundtrack (and the movie, for that matter), but it's great.  Buy it if you care to.  Not for the casual experimenter, though 
 This book is THE BEST!  it's got everything you need to know about the jumps spins and techniques of this sport!  READ IT AND YOU'LL WANT TO KEEP IT WITHIN REACH FOREVER (if you're a skater)  haha  no really, it's great!  BUY IT 
 Professor Swain wrote an incredible account of both black and white  representatives of African-Americans (both minority and majority districts)  in the US Congress.  She examines the history of blacks in Congress, the  definition of "black interests," and the difference between black  descriptive and substantive representation.  The book was originally  written between the 1990 general election and the 1992 Presidential  election.  Although this may seem to make the book out of date, Dr. Swain  updated her manuscript with an addendum to the first edition.  This chapter  covers the Republican Sweep of the 1994 general election and discusses its  consequences to black descriptive and substantive representation.   'Black  Faces, Black Interests' can be highly relevent to the historically minded,  as the facts of the past shape the future.  In this end, the author can  have the most impact by educating readers, thus possibly touching the  future representatives of African-Americans 
 This is a GREAT book...I will read and re-read and purchase several copies to give to others...especially to people who are wandering or struggling with what do with their lives...when I give them the book I will be telling them that they have to read just the first 2 chapters...then decide.  For those that feel they are already on a good track it's a great refresher and a great way to stay focused - plus lots of good ideas to move you along the path to success 
 Chet Baker is still such a much loved trumpeter from days past for his seamless skillfulness concerning the ballad. This 1959 recording for Riverside comes from Baker's peak years, fresh and backed by all-star sidemen of the day. This is one of the most breathtaking jazz albums I own in my collection, because I can always count on Chet to set the mood. There was something in Chet's delivery that was so lonesome and sad, but at the same time so uplifting and invigorating.   Considering myself a diehard fan, I've always preferred his trumpeting to his singing. On this album you are treated to nothing but the trumpet, which happens to be my favorite instrument, also. Be good to yourself and buy this album as soon as possible! It will immediately become one of a handful of albums in life that finally says something to you, without uttering a single word.     The one and only Bill Evans, the genius jazz pianist / composer, sat in with Baker on the album. Paul Chambers is also present; probably the hardest working bassist in the business of his day, and flutist Herbie Mann plays on these tracks, also. Guitarist Kenny Burrell, baritone saxophonist Pepper Adams, drummers Philly Joe Jones and Connie Kay also back Chet up on these ballads. 
 This series is about a very strange detective.  He had been the big brain in the serial murder squad, when he was shot in the head by a criminal.  He survived the injury, but is not the same guy. It's very dark and terribly fascinating. I love it 
 Embarking upon the "road less traveled by," is a courageous thing.  David McNally has done just that.  Not only does he travel that road himself, but he paves the way and creates a map, as he goes, for those who might follow behind him.  In his book, Even Eagles Need A Push, you'll find the stuff that life is made of; the stuff that helps us to put meanning and purpose to our own lives. I was drowning in storms of confusion and darkness.  Thunder was the only sound my ears could hear, and my eyes were blinded by the flashes of lightening, when McNally's Eagles came out of nowhere.  They taught me how to fly clear of the downdrafts as I steered my way through the storms of my life, riding the high places, and embracing it's challanges.  They taught me about the beauty and the glory that awaits the clearing of the storm when the sun comes out.  For only in the heart of the storm, can one find the sweet smell and the thrill of victory as we master these storms.  ! These events in our lives are initiations into higher levels of awarness and awakenings, as we grow, both personally and professionally. McNally goes on to show that no eagle is born an eagle, not even an eagle.  We must all learn to fly, one day at a time, pushing ourselves on to the greatness and achievements we were meant for.  He shares his own story of success, failure, agony, self distruction, his awakening,and his own self-discovery.  He shows us the eagles runway, and his own flight back to success and the storms he, himself encountered along the way.  But most important, he shows us how he did it, and how, we can do it too. So, if your present journey is is leading you onto the "road less traveled by," your trip will be greatly enhanced with a copy of David McNally's Even Eagles Need a Push, tucked carefully under your wing.....er...a...arm 
 This a brillant book in how it shifts through the various documents in order to make the reader fully aware of what has happened.  Marrus allows for a good mixture of both procecuting and defending testimony from the  Trial and the various confrences during, before and after the Trial.  He  gives a very good documentation of how the Allies came to teh conviction of  19 Nazis.  As a historian of the Trials, I recfonmmend it to all who want  to learn more of the Trials 
 I was first intoduced to Ms. Cline by an old girlfriend, Karen.  She used to love to sing "Crazy."   Although she could do it serious justice, when I heard Patsy embrace that song, I was blown away!   That's why I bought this CD...I needed more.   "Walking After Midnight" is a classic.  You feel like you are there with her as she croons desperately about her guy.  "I Fall To Pieces", "She's Got You", "Back In Baby's Arms"... Heck this entire collection is a must have.     Country fan or not, this CD belongs in any music lover's collection.   Karen died a few years ago of a brain tumor, but I can believe she's up in heaven singing "Crazy" with Patsy 
 This is the first electronic gadget I have bought in years that I was able to figure out in minutes! Out of the box, after a 2 hour charge (gave me a chance to watch the tutorial and scan the manual) I was making movies! I have not used the high quality setting yet but the mid-range is pretty darn good! The  most impressive feature is its "anti jitter" filtering. Any other Camcorder I have ever tried makes my movies look like I am in the middle of an earthquake! Not with this one! (unless you are at max zoom) The optical zoom is far more than needed so I never expect to even use the digital zoom. There is an "easy"  mode that automatically sets the camera to adequate settings. And it actually works. The only thing I am having problems with is getting the camera to connect to the PC. The camera says  "connecting" and just hangs. I have a call in with Sony and will report back. I suspect better editing software will cure that. The software provided is very basic. The workaround for now is to just insert  the DVD directly into the PC then use the software to read and edit it. It would be nice if you could "finalize" the DVD on the PC rather than in the camcorder. Initialy, I purchased the Camcorder alone to see how I like it but I just ordered ALL the options 
 This book gives you a great overview of the very basics of what law students will need to learn quickly and will not be taught.  Get this book to have an understanding of what type of things you will be studying, how to write briefs, and how to outline and study for exams.  Also gives you the basics of citations, what you need to know, and what not to worry about... A must read for new law students who want to ease their anxiety 
 Forget about all the negative reviews about this book!!! They are completely wrong. I can't believe those people didn't get more out of this book. First, it's called "Inside the Postal Bus". Sure it has Lance in the SUB-title, but that doesn't mean this book is "all about Lance". If that's what they wanted, they obviously can't read a title let alone a sub-title, and they should stick to books that have a hugh pictures of Lance on the cover so they don't get so confussed.  For TRUE cycling fans (and NOT the-Lance-bandwagon crew) this is one great cycling book. Michael Barry does give plenty (yes plenty) of accounts of what went on in the US Postal bus. He also gives accounts of stays in hotels, in European cities that are hubs for non-European born cyclist, and plenty of road racing. A real insider's view.  O.k., Barry didn't race in the Tour de France alongside Lance, but the title doesn't say he did. A true fan would know that there is life outside of the Tour de France and the US Postal Team has more than one rider. And such a fan would also want to know about other races and riders.   Barry gives plenty of stories about other riders (George Hincapie, Floyd Landis, Dave Zabriskie, and plenty more) and also US Postal Team staff. Great stories-and well told. This is an easy to read, enjoyable book about life in and out of the US Postal bus, the glory, the pain, and the triumphs of wins both big and small. I'm glad I happened to catch Michael Barry signing copies of his book at the final stage of the inagural Tour of California. 
 I can't get this cd out of my player. I love Austin music and Ray is the best. The swampy, sultry sound can take you away. The lyrics are amazing and certain lines stick in my head. Amazing stuff and a far cry from 'Up Against the Wall Redneck Mothers' although I like that too. 
 This is a must-read, particularly for anyone who has seen - and been captivated by - the BBC film version of Elizabeth Gaskell's very fine novel. Although the film is excellent and largely faithful to Gaskell's story, it cannot fully convey the depth of her characters. The author herself does this masterfully, painting rich word portraits of each figure through skillful use of dialogue and description. Another especially exquisite feature of this book is the way Gaskell weaves the relationship between Margaret Hale and John Thornton into the differences between cotton mill owners in the north of England and their workers. The author creates tension and passion in the coupling of Margaret and Thornton by immersing them in the conflict between labor and management, pitting Margaret's advocacy of the workers against Thornton's interests as a mill owner. In doing so, she offers valuable insights into the needs and concerns of both sides in this labor dispute in a way that speaks to present-day tensions between unions and companies. Gaskell does this by portraying Thornton as a mill owner who ultimately tries to balance his head for business with an expanding heart for his workers and Margaret as someone who comes to understand both sides in the conflict. Readers with a spiritual bent may appreciate, too, Gaskell's tasteful use of religious imagery and language, something the film barely touches on. This is especially apparent in the exchanges between Margaret and her dying friend, Bessy Higgins, who is obsessed with the biblical book of Revelation. Margaret, the daughter of a minister, relates beautifully to Bessy's concerns and Bible quotations, engaging and respecting her religious sensibilities, yet offering a sense of balance that is drawn from her own beliefs. 
 I'm reading about Barsetshire in the order intended.  Doctor Thorne (third in the series) left me satisfied, and I can recommend it.  It contains fewer of the engaging, and for me novel, nuances of 19th century Church of England politics.  Instead it is a rustic tale, somewhat contrived, compensated by a set of plausible characters who held my interest.  Ever since the author in the earlier "The Warden" effectively punctured my elevated opinion of C. Dickens, I've been contrasting the two contemporaries.  Yes, Dickens remains one of my favorites.  But, his caricatures are more exagerated than Trollope's; I can easily envision both the characters and dialogue as of the type that actually would occur, having known analogs in the rural area in which I was raised.  No, it's not Great Expectations; but Doctor Thorne is good, and probably a better picture of 19th century England 
 I bought this because I never understood prayer exactly.  Now I do, completely.  This little book is way better that the new rage 'TheSecret'.  Very life changing.  Negative reviewers, look at your feelings and emotions that you are putting out to the Universe to reflect back to you 
 This is a great read.  It's a very personal account, really well written 
 Wow! An intense read. At time the subject matter can be difficult to handle, but the story is amazing.  The movie does not do the novel justice 
 Raymond Chandler has always been known for his eloquent prose, and the masterful way he creates his settings, but many hard-core mystery fans have not loved the fact that he can sometimes sacrifice the disciplined, mathematical puzzle for creating an experience. Not so in "The Lady in the Lake", which offers a vivid portrayal of Marlowe, gritty depiction of 1940's southern California, and a riveting mystery that buttons up neatly at the climax. This book is a fabulous guide to another reality which will provide hours of entertainment 
 This particular translation of the Analects is wonderful.  The author begins the book by introducing some terms that are difficult to translate or have multiple implications.  In the text itself, these words are frequently left untranslated so that the reader can fully appreciate the diversity of the meaning.  The english text is presented side by side with the classical chinese text, allowing the linguistically inclined one to compare the two.  A great book alltogether 
 i first saw king gordy when i went to the d12 world concert in chicago. he was there with his crew da fat killahz and they rocked the house wild, it was crazy fun. then last christmas my freind picked up his album and burned it 4 me and i really like it. its a really good album gordy is a great lyricist and has really good flowz. he combines alot of his music wit kurt cobain style stuff, which 4 him turns out good. the whole album is average to good with the best trax being: 3, 6, 9 (featuring the fat killahz) and 10,  make sure u pick up his groups album: "guess whos coming to dinner? 
 Stevie Thomas and Susan Carol Anderson got their "fifteen minutes of fame" after helping to unravel the Final Four mystery involving the blackmailing of Minnesota State University's star player, Chip Graber. Remaining good friends, they keep in touch over email and IM all the time. When Susan Carol tells Stevie she'll be covering the U.S. Open for her local sports paper, she convinces Stevie to come along. Stevie contacts Bobby Kelleher, the Washington Herald columnist who mentored them during the Final Four, and sure enough Kelleher has a job for Stevie too. They're off to New York City, but little do they know what they'll have in store for themselves.  Right before her anticipated first game, young Russian phenom Nadia Makarova goes missing and immediately Stevie and Susan Carol find themselves trying to unfold another mystery. And yet again, there are a lot of unanswered questions. Who are Nadia Makarova's kidnappers? Why does Susan Carol's agent uncle, Brendan Gibson, seem like he's right in the middle of this? Plus, what does this mean for up-and-coming new U.S. tennis star Evelyn Rubin, who is smashing her way through games and scheduled to play Makarova?  VANISHING ACT is John Feinstein's follow-up to the New York Times bestseller, LAST SHOT. The author, a political and sports reporter for the Washington Post as well as Sports Illustrated and National Sports Daily, has written many bestselling sports-related books. In his second effort Feinstein continues to succeed, mixing real-life sports personalities like Bud Collins and Andy Roddick into the fictional world. Feinstein also reveals a behind-the-scenes look at sports agents that doesn't portray them in a very good light.  Like his previous effort, VANISHING ACT provides an almost nonfiction-like look into the professional tennis world and the U.S. Open while mixing elements of a fiction mystery novel. Readers will be happy to see the return of Stevie and Susan Carol, who have clearly grown as friends. (And Stevie's constant eating of hamburgers and pizza in an effort to grow taller is pretty humorous too.) VANISHING ACT is a fast-paced story that whizzes by like a powerful serve. It's a fun read for anyone interested in tennis or mysteries, or both.     --- Reviewed by Kristi Olso 
 This book caught my eye since I used to play high school chess competitively. I'm reasonably aware of Fischer's exploits - but this book opened a whole new level of understanding of the times. The political intrigue presented in the book was, to me, more interesting than the issues surrounding the chess match.   Fischer is well known as a brilliant, but troubled, American player who bullied his way to get whatever he wanted. He won the World championship, then essentially disappeared.  I wonder what Fischer's life would have been like had he been born in the Soviet Union with it's emphasis on finding, developing, and celebrating chess prodigies.  
 This is a great text book to be used as a guide for the more experienced knitters who are interested in designing their own unique cardigans and pullovers or vests knitted either in the round using several different steeking methods or knitted flat - various considerations of either method depending on the wool type/thickness and sweater design are discussed.  Many different design options and considerations are discussed and quite a few different traditional models are explained.  These methods can be taken as is or combined in a multitude of ways that is only limited by your imagination! I would not recommend this book for a beginner!  But it is a fabulous addition to my library 
 I have become quite an expert on "The Phantom of the Opera" since being blown away by the awesome beauty of the film version of Lloyd Webber's play. I take the fifth on how many times I've seen the movie which I HIGHLY recommend. This book, and Susan Kay's book PHANTOM,are my favorites!  Andrew Lloyd Webber was consulted about this story continuation of his play and approved of it.  It's a fast read and has some surprises and interesting plot twists that make it fun to read and ponder. I highly recommend it and keep giving copies of it to family and friends 
 En esta era de la tecnología y el gusto por lograr las mejores imágenes y los mejores efectos, esta colección nos lleva a darnos cuenta que las grandes obras de arte se deben edificar a partir de eso, "El Arte". Y esto es precisamente lo que demuestra este box set. El arte de la cinematografía puesta en las manos del genial Hitchcock. Ni que hablar de la producción: Siete discos, cada uno en su propio estuche, excelente sonido, y todo el material subtitulado (includo extras, introducción y trailers), además de que los discos son multizona. Cabe destacar que esto no fue obra de una gran empresa sino de LaserLight Video, pero es algo que los grandes estudios deberían tomar como ejemplo, hartos ya de ver películas con extras sin subtítulos. Si a eso le sumamos el costo del set, nos encontramos con una joya que no podemos desperdiciar. Muy recomendable 
 Great story, reads very well.  Very hard to put down.  It's also a very different concept from most books i've read.  
 This was my *main* source of information to take the CompTIA IT Project+ exam. I took the test in Jan 04 and passed (FYI - the exam changed Dec 03). Even though this book was written to the older exam criteria, it did the trick. In the world of certification, passing is everything and I appreciated the information this book provided (and thus the 5 stars). My other source of help was a study guide from examcram.com, but it too was written for the older exam objectives 
 Scientests may find Wolke's explanations too simple (that's why he has a nitpicker's section), but for those who are not trained in technical or scientific fields, this books is just the thing. Wolke does an excellent job of explaining science conceptually, and he might just raise the curiousity of a few non-scientists that they may want to read more widely. I would highly recommend his two books on kitchen science 
 I found this book to very informative and entertaining.  The author speaks from personal experience, not just theory 
 I pretty much hate reading novels. In an effort to work my way through the classics, I've tried to force myself through Jane Austen and the Brontes and Dickens and all the greats, and to be honest, I just can't really get into them. I make it in a couple of pages, and then hit the wall. I mostly read non-fiction.  But the day I finished reading "Anna Karenina" was one of the saddest days of my life. I'd been totally captivated by the thing since page one, as though I were transported back and was witnessing the whole thing play out, feeling everything. I gave it to my wife afterwards and she pretty much freaked out, too. She said it was one of the most overwhelming books she'd ever read.  I think what is most brilliant about this work is that Tolstoy seems to approach every different shade and nuance of what "love" can mean from every different angle. Platonic love, erotic love, dutiful love, aescetic love, illicit love, etc., everything seems there, and it all seems so...true. And from the focus on love, every facet of human social life is illuminated. That first, elliptical love scene between Anna and Vronsky...the pure, awkward Levin and his attempts at morality...the physiological ravages of guilt...the vanity of Anna's husband...it's all brilliant.  A quick word on translations. I speak no Russian, and so had to make do with spending a few hours comparing a number of translations with each other in various bookstores. I finally decided on the Modern Library edition, which features a thoroughly refurbished Constance Garnett translation (Britishisms erased, prudish Victorian sexual euphemisms replaced with literality, etc.) I did take quite a bit of time looking at the well-advertised Pevear/Larissa V. translation, just as I've done when buying Dostoevsky, and there's just something about the P/V translations that makes me feel kind of ill. I can't really explain it other to say that I loathe translations which make an attempt at "improving" or "beautifying" the text - I want it straight, hardcore, as reflective of the original meaning and tone as possible. Somehow I got the impression that perhaps "improvement" had inspired the P/V translation style. It just seemed to have a smugness to it that I couldn't imagine existing in the original, so I put it back. Maybe I'm wildly wrong, though, and the P/O translation is the most perfectly accurate. I wish I could judge for myself looking at the original text. All I know is that I thought the Modern Library edition I got was great.  Anyway, this book really doesn't need any recommendation from the likes of me. It will be read for centuries by people all over the world, because it is one of the classics of all world literature.  Good luc 
 This book is perfectly written for young children.  My 4 and 6 year old kids were at the edge of their seats as we read chapter by chapter.   As a family we greatly enjoyed reading the story of Prince Siddharta.   
 	Caitlin O' Conner is a senior who has everyday problems like everyone else, from guy problems to what she wants to major in in college.  She often tries to avoid her problems by fixing someone else's problems, or by doing good for others.  Will Caitlin find the solutions to her problems, or find who she's really meant to be?  Will she ever learn to deal with all the problems life has in store for her?  Everyday holds a new challenge for Caitlin, but she always looks to God and to her friends to help her through it.  Only after the loss of a classmate, does Caitlin learn that the only thing constant in her life is God, and he can help her through everything no matter what is going on in her life. 	I absolutely loved this whole book.  Caitlin deals with problems that every teen girl can relate to.  It really helps you to understand what is going on in the book, and it also helps to bring you closer to God.  The one and only thing that I didn't like about this book was what happened to Jewel.  It was really sad, and I really don't think that it should have happened to her. 	I would recommend this book to any teenage girl, or to anyone who likes Melody Carlson's books.    I would also recommend that you read the rest the rest of this series, The Diary of a Teenage Girl.  Overall, this was a great book that any girl can relate to and would like.  I know I liked this book and I hope you'll like it too.  
 Excellent product don't hesitate this big umbrella is the perfect one to protect you and your equipment when rains start 
 Craig Nelson's book is a beautifully written account of the life of Thomas Paine. It is the first biography I've read about the man so am unable to judge it against others, but am quite certain that anyone, familiar with Paine and the revolutionary era or not, would enjoy this story of the life of an American and inevitably World hero.   Through this tale of revolution, struggle, and the rise and decline in the public eye, Nelson's Thomas Paine: Enlightenment, Revolutions, and the Birth of Modern Nations will reveal some of the more subtle, usually unspoken physical, political, and financial costs that were endured by a man that strove to give freedom to the world. However, conveying this personal struggle only provides an even more inspirational picture of the revolutionary. Nelson's book will demonstrate how Paine, by presenting us through the tip of a pen with the then radical, progressive ideas of liberty that would soon drastically alter the nature of human civilization, broke down the barriers of oppression that stood in the way of the enlightenments greatest philosophical revelation: Democracy. However, in doing so, the story of Thomas Paine's life will reveal a barrier still in place today, unbroken, which impeded and continues to restrict the climax of that 18th century ideal. But for attempting to bring it down as well, being the 200 years-ahead-of his time revolutionary he was, lived his last 10 years hated, forgotten, and unwanted. And until recently, has remained so.  "When men yield up the privilege of thinking, the last shadow of liberty quits the horizon." ~Thomas Paine 
 There are so many myths when it comes to the Civil Rights Movement and so often it is reduced to a few holiday's and key speeches. This book not only teaches us about the ordinary, everyday citizens who sacrificed and stood for change, but also invokes critical thinking and connects us to our past so we better understand our role in fighting injustice today. 
 Although this book was written in 1997, it seems current. Makes you think of the present administration! Well written, keeps you reading and comparing the characters with the present cabinet. The story is believable and leaves us with not wanting to put the book down. Other reviewers give you the picture so I won't go into that. Mr. Flynn is fast becoming one of my favorites! I wish I had discovered him years ago 
 Essential reading for those that need a deeper understanding. There are many poetic passages, sad stories and a great reference to what America is like for those who were poor and often at odds with their country. This is a book that holds up so well today and will make you want more. Dylan probably brought you here in the first place. You won't be disappointed. Everybody should read this book. 
 Very good to watch their performances but the show is broken up with Mickey Hart's commentary which is a bit irritatin 
 This is more groove-based, less dissonant off-the-wall than Emphasizer. The songs have more unity, the elements blend together more. It's a mix between dreamy, atmospheric melody and steady solid groove. It's a very smooth balance between the two, so it doesn't sound like some frankenstein assemblage but rather like something natural and focused. In short, it works 
 Jayber Crow was my first Wendell Berry book, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but what a great read this turned out to be! - and on so many levels.  Berry paints beautiful word pictures throughout.  His writing is unpretentious, yet wise:  about friendship, love, loss - about life itself.  At the same time, he's not afraid to use a remarkable regional variation of the word "touchy" from the Kentucky region, as on p. 57 he writes:  "It was a touchous moment."  It's easy to love that kind of thing in good books.  And just about every reader can relate to Jayber's reflective soliloquy on the first page of Chapter 12, where on p. 133 Berry writes:  "Often I have not known where I was going until I was already there.  I have had my share of desires and goals, but my life has come to me or I have gone to it mainly by way of mistakes and surprises.  Often I have received better than I deserved.  Often my fairest hopes have rested on bad mistakes.  I am an ignorant pilgrim, crossing a dark valley.  And for a long time, looking back, I have been unable to shake off the feeling that I have been led - make of that what you will."  The whole of p. 133 in Jayber Crow may be one of the most beautifully written pages I have ever encountered, as Jayber would say, "so far."  All the way through this terrific book, it was difficult for me to remember that it was a novel, not an autobiography - written by Wendell Berry, not Jayber Crow himself.  One thing is sure:  Wendell Berry knows how to tell a great story 
  In 1984 of Orwell, the world had become dominated by a tyranny with combinations of German fascism, but overwhelmingly a deadly exaggeration of Stalin's Russia.  In the 1984 of Orwell, there is not much home, only rumors of an opposition, an opposition which may only exist as an excuse to persecute and victimize.  In the 1984 the technology is use to overwhelm his hero who seeks freedom.     Orwell was a member of a trend that lost hope in the cause of socialist revolution, and believed that the Soviet Union and the Nazi government of Germany were the same thing.  It was the wave of the future, bureaucratic collectivism, James Burnham the former Trotskyist named it as he fled to the anticommunist ranks of the National Review.  It couldn't be stopped, Nazism, the corporate society, and Stalinism would all grow into what Orwell depicts in 1984.     But now, 20 years after 1984, the bureaucratic regimes in Eastern Europe and China and the former Soviet Union have been pushed aside, and great avenues for free political life, the exchange of ideas, and struggles by workers for union rights, by oppressed nationalities for freedom from discrimination, even without the kind of revolutionary leadership that emerged in Hungary in 1956 or in Cuba in 1959.      Technology has proven a weapon for working people and others fighting for their rights, not something by which tyrants can rule through. For Soviet dissidents the first big explosion in the discussion and circulation of ideas came with the advent of the photocopying machine that spread texts and reports against the bureaucracy across the country.  Today web sites for unions fighting the coal bosses in Utah, fighting to organize textile workers in Miami, or fighting to defend coal miners in China, reach out around the globe.      As the world seems to be heading into an economic criss marked by aggresive wars by Washington and resistance by working people we can expect not the bleak sunnless future that Orwell painted, but a festival of freedom for working people fighting the bureaucracies in Eastern Europe, the USSR, and China and the billionaires in North America, Japan, and Europe.      However, what will live forever in this book, what lives more strongly in every other thing Orwell wrote is his ability to picture a real man, not a hero, not a perfect man, living a real life, hoping, fearing, wanting, messing up in little things, searching for bigger things. Read 1984 and regardless of its political pessimism, its author had a clear hold on what is like to be an ordinary man or woman trying to hold onto life even when it all seems too big to conquer.      
 I must comment that when this was first ordered, we had it delivered to a P O Box, but to no avail.  Apparently someone there either stole it, or delivered it to the wrong P O Box, but Amazon was quite nice to us, and sent aonther copy free of charge to our residence 
 If you liked the Motion Picture then you have to add the cd to your collection, you will love it 
 This is a great CD!  I have had it for awhile now and love to listen to it every Christmas.  It has a lot of upbeat songs as well as some traditional ones.  It's a fun holiday CD and I would recommend it to everyone 
 This book is an example of how our lives can be derailed. It is a staggering depiction of a futuristic, post-war urban horror that grips the minds of readers. The sudden twists of chance that the story unravels are a trait of the author that manages to glue the reader to the book 
 A lot of the critique of how anthropologists "make their object" in the 80s and 90s can be traced back to some of the ideas in this book. It is a profoundly important analysis of how time is manipulated in such a way as to create a boundary between "them" and "us." As the other reviewer says, it is not an easy read, but I don't think you can really know the history of recent anthropological theory without giving this book some of your attention 
 This double CD collection captures the very spirit of the Western-film genre.  Words like "bold," "sweeping," and "epic" inevitably come to mind as I listen, over and over, to the themes, familiar ("A Fistful of Dollars," "The Magnificent Seven," "The Sons of Katie Elder") and less so ("Lonesome Dove," "A Distant Trumpet," "Monte Walsh," "Buffalo Girls"), it includes.  From the contemplative ("Dances With Wolves") to the militaristic ("Glory") to the light ("Maverick"), they're all here, delivered with all the brass and percussion you'd expect.  A set I never regret buying 
 This is a good book for people who like charms and such. I'm a big fan of creating charm necklaces so this was a great find for me. 
 That old silent film is of course a classic. It comes from the German school of horror films in the 1920s. It is an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, but it takes liberties with the original. It is situated in Bremen and not in London. His girlfriend or wife is  quite rightly Mina. Rensfield is the boss of the real estate agency. The trip to Dracula's castle is standard. Dracula's voyage to Bremen is also very standard. The real change comes at the end when Mina sacrifices herself by giving herself to Dracula to keep him active up to after the cock crows. Then he dies and everyone is saved. Naive rewriting of the ending into some palatable cathartic compensation of the horror of life : salvation is possible and escape is a real eventuality. But it is also a very Christian ending in a way, or isn't it Jewish after all ? The woman sacrificing herself for the sake of the social group that is menaced by Dracula. And this sacrifice is epiphanic since it brings salvation. This fantastic and horror period in the German cinema seems to be longing for a happy ending, just as if the reality of Germany then was so bleak that happiness could only be a dream and a consolation or a solace the cinema could propose to people. The film though is admirable by the quality of the pictures and the shooting. A black and white film on such a subject could easily become drab, which it never does. The pictures are always innovative in a way or another with a contrast or a composition that makes the poor technique of the days quite able to translate complex situations. The acting of these silent actors is also quite admirable in the body language they use that is never overdone which would make it grotesque. It is just expressive enough to mean what it is supposed to mean without any negative second level reading.

 William Least Heat-Moon's Blue Highways is referred to by many as a "cult classic".  If so, it's a shame this book is not better known.  It is 1978 and William Least Heat-Moon is 38 years old.  Upon the near-simultaneous loss of his college teaching job and his marriage, he needs to get out of town, to leave places of sadness, futility and routine, to clear his mind and renew his soul.  William leaves Missouri driving a '75 Econoline that he also intends to live in for the next several months; the truck has been named "Ghost Dancing".  He has determined that he will drive only the blue highways, the old map color for single-lane rural highways and county roads, the roads that lead to all the small places in America, lost and forgotten by time, faded in economic or historic significance.  He will travel and look around and listen, meet new people and learn new things and new ways of thinking.  Most of all he will think, taking an inward journey as well.  Born of English-Irish and Osage ancestry, William Least Heat-Moon also has an Anglo name.  He writes, "I have other names: Buck, once a slur...also Bill Trogdon."  He explains his Osage identity humbly: "My father calls himself Heat Moon, my elder brother Little Heat-Moon.  I, coming last, am therefore Least.  It has been a long lesson of a name to learn."  With that we begin.  Experts categorize this book as "travel literature".  It is a travel book, for William does travel 13,000 miles across the United States and briefly through Ontario.  He describes places, converses with people, learns or reviews history.  As may be expected, the places are common and strange, mundane and magical.  Some are pleasing and peaceful; others evoke indignance in William, unpleasantness and judgment.  Most of the people are kind, some of them are wise.  Some are alive with vitality and hope, others ghosts or near ghosts.  But they are all human still, and in some way each is a gift.  And that's what makes Blue Highways worthwhile: it is also a philosophy book, filled with the humanity of the author and the people to whom he gives voice.  He is old enough to understand and appreciate the people and places he encounters, young enough to feel wonder and room to grow.  Two special voices live within William Least Heat-Moon's head and heart: Walt Whitman and Black Elk.  Whitman, the poet traveler who has seen it all before, rides along to chuckle occasionally or illuminate an experience or thought.  Black Elk offers gentle guidance and comfort; he is a steady hand.  It is inevitable that William Least Heat-Moon makes his way home.  And it is not surprising that along the way he discovers that he can - that he has - "remade" himself.  Blue Highways is beautiful book

 I read this book perhaps 20 years ago then came across a copy again quite recently. For those interested in an anthropological approach to psychology-as-myth (the chapter on 'Origin of Repressive Civilization' is especially interesting not least because it is so very clearly wrong!) that more or less parallels a similar approach to myth and culture in the (somewhat contested) spirit of Frazer, De Santillana, Graves or even Weston this book will be of interest -- although I must say that anyone familiar with those authors will almost certainly be familiar with this one 
 When I found out what the hook was, while looking at the credits at the end, I had to watch it over again.  I already had an extremely high opinion of EM's acting ability, but this was stunning to me.  Not that i was stunned by the realization, I was starting to wonder, and he had done it before... stunned by his talent.  Oh, and i liked this a lot better that the Jerry Lewis, frantic version 
 It's great! Just like new. It's every bit as beautiful as  the first time I saw during its theatrical release 
 This would definitely be one of 5 albums to have while stranded on a desert island.  "I'll Never Be Lonely", "Black Lace" and "I Havent Got The Time" rank up there on my 4ever play list  and have shown up on numerous compilation cassettes I have created over the  past 2 decades.  Guaranteed heartfelt, great listening...   rootsy and  raw,, will not disappoint 
 I have heard some critics expressed the view that I'm Not Scared (2003) is mainly about the innocence of youth, which I cannot and will not accept. Any individual's character is innate and pre-determined at conception which cannot be altered, an observation which can be and should be tested experimentally in the laboratory. Hence, the innocence referred to here is of the good-natured kind regardless of age, not one of childhood or youth.  One thing I would like to mention first is the brilliant use of the camera throughout, which adds insights and cues for the viewer to provide direction of the underlying currents and their meanings, besides attention. Such thoughtfulness brings light to the possibility of cinematography as an instrument of tremendous power to influence judgment as opposed to being one of linear and monotonic function so often seen in big Hollywood productions.  The main characters of the film are two young boys who share practically nothing in common except their age and religion. One was from the working class and the other of more noble (seemingly) ancestry. Religion played an important role in both of their lives, which became a source of strength for both of them that led to their "union" in the final sequence. The Catholic faith also drove these two characters in ways unexpected by themselves. This approach to religion and the significance of the choices one make in his life naturally gives rise to some serious thinking about the current trend of losing hope in the faith which corrupts the society on many levels, particularly in the Western World. Despite all odds such as the counter-influence of the behavior of the adults surrounding, our chief protagonist never wavered from adhering to principles from the Bible taught at school. On the other hand, our major supporting character sought solace in biblical stories when all previous teaching failed to allow reasoning and madness descended as no comfort of familiarity was spared. These developments led to challenges in one's confidence in self and a solid and firm definition of the role in the wider world played. As the outcome for the protagonist remained uncertain even till the very end, a tinge of sadness and anxiety pervaded the set. In spite of this, the rescued one's release from mental pain when he saw a sacrifice made for his own sake gives hope. The purity of true friendship is rarely so realistically portrayed in the cinema, and this remarkable feat done by the production team is exceptional.  Though some acting performances could be improved, this is a work to be cherished, even in our small ways.  It should be noted that some elements in the film could be quite disturbing due to the oppression felt by the children in their close-knit community 
 for all you Lucio Fulci haters this guy was a director way back in the 1950's. So don't compare Lucio Fulci to the director George Romero. Lucio was most popular for his horror grindhouse movies like The Beyond, House By the Cementary, A Cat in the Brain, A Lizard in a Women's Skin, House of Clocks, the New York Ripper, Don't Torture a Duckling, The Psychic, City of the Living Dead, and Zombie, etc. What people don't know is that he directed well over 50 movies. He directed comedy, Italian westerns, dramas, trillers, giallos, and of course horror movies. So don't even compare Lucio Fulci to George Romero because George is nothing compared to Lucio. George always directs some type of zombie horror movie and hardly anything else. Also, Italian movies back in the day don't rely on plot when directing a movie. Asian movies are like that too. Americans need to go educate themselves before dissing foreign films as this or that. Please know something before you criticize something. It will make the world a much better place. 
 It's unfortunate to me that so far this book hasn't attracted the widespread audience it deserves. It begins in Finland with a boy named Esko Vaananen who becomes obsessed with the skyscraper, or pilvenpiirtaja as he knows it. Shortly after he meets a young girl who entrances him, and his destiny converges in his quest for love, and his desire to be a brilliant architect. Spanning nearly thirty years and crossing from the frozen Finland tundra to The jazz infused gang run clubs of New York City Rayner's intricately researched novel certainly brings to mind comparisons with Ayn Rands, "The Fountainhead". Yet for many this will be a much more accessible novel. The dramatic journey the character goes through makes this book an obvious choice for a feature adaptation. A satisfying and wonderfully woven book 
 And this one did. I always believed in long gym routines: three-four sets of eight-ten repetitions, the more the better, of course to exhaustion and a little more. Doing only couple of sets and not to the point of dying was something new. I tried it and will never go back. After these workouts you recover quickly, and , importantly, you progress really fast. One can argue if two exercises Pavel recommends are enough or not. I think it is the matter of choice. They are probably sufficient to get strong. But they will probably also become very boring after a while. But this principle works well with any number and types of exercises, and one can swap exercises that are similar in principle.  There is also fair bit of theory of training which I enjoyed: breathing, periodization, muscle physiology etc.  Very good book. Pavel overhypes it with "Russky tovarish" stuf a little, which for me (a Russian guy) is a bit irritating. However, his style reminds me of my (very short) time in the Soviet Army, and makes the book fun to read 
 This, like any good book, will cause you to think, and for me it was to question something at the time I agreed with. Grisham tells the story of a man who was put on Death Row, though he was only the driver of the get away car. It shows very well that death row is a very horrible place and almost barbaric.   At the time I read this I was a believer in the Death Penalty, but this, if maybe not making me change my mind altogether, made me at least question it. This was the first thing I had ever read or even heard on how they treat people on Death Row and what they go through, even though they are criminals.  Interesting thought provoking read, though somewhat predictable. 
 I was impressed with the thought process and financial process that Gary Keller's team lays out in this book.  I downloaded the worksheets and will gladly use them to focus on growing my net worth

 Do you have an annoying friend who claims to know everything?  Pick up a copy of this book and I guarantee you'll stump Mr./Ms. Know It All.  It's a fun book that you can read all at once or flip through to sections that interest you.  Either way, you'll probably learn something new.  It even has a section of questions that you want to ask but are afraid to, and no they're not sex related. Eg. Money Laundering: What is it and how it's done.  That's something I've wanted to know about but it's not really a great conversation piece.  *What exactly is Ovaltine? *Can you patent common features of the Internet? *Is there cocain on your money? *What happens to recalled meat? *Does the president need a passport?  This book is full of useful and of course useless trivia.  It would make a great gift for any trivia junkie. 
 The Apostle Paul's responses to doubts and erroneous teaching concerning the resurrection in his letters to believers at Corinth and his disciple Timothy illustrates that what constitutes a proper understanding of the resurrection of the dead has been debated since the earliest days of the Christian church.  Caroline Walker Bynum, a National Endowment for the Humanities Jefferson Lecturer, traces that debate in meticulous detail through the patristic era and High Middle Ages.  In doing so, she demonstrates that "Christians clung to a very literal notion of resurrection despite repeated attempts by theologians and philosophers to spiritualize the idea."  Bynum's review of patristic and scholastic literature shows that a belief that "body is necessary for self" shaped the evolution of eschatological thought from at least the time of Tertullian to the age of Thomas Aquinas.  Her exhaustive exploration of the "images, examples and analogies" of theologians, artists, "mystics, poets, hagiographers, sculptors and tellers of folktales" demonstrates that there was substantial diversity in attempts to explain the mechanics of resurrection in light of the consumption, decay, mutilation, partition and putrefaction suffered by the body before and after death.  As the title indicates, Bynum's monograph focuses on the thought of the western branch of the church, not that of the orthodox east. She also limited her scope to the patristic era and High Middle Ages, omitting the intervening centuries as if she had not imposed that limitation she "would never have finished." As a medieval specialist of impeccable credentials, Bynum is particularly well qualified to explore "virtually every aspect of [the] social, religious, intellectual and political life" of the latter period considered in this work.  Bynum's reconstruction of the evolution of the western view of resurrection is meticulous and thorough. Shifting through the religious, intellectual and social she paints a richly detailed picture that is as persuasive as it is difficult to fault.  If I were to hazard a recommendation for improvement it would be to add an index of primary sources in addition to the index of secondary sources she does provides.  Hopefully an equally qualified scholar will pick up where Bynum leaves off and trace the continued development of resurrection in western thought through the twentieth century 
 First off, let me start by saying this is Alice Cooper's best album. Period. From beginning to end, there is not a weak track on it. It is a classic. That's all I really need to say.  Now, let me talk about this superb remaster job. All tracks sound superb, but not just that but 8 of these tracks are on a second disc live, plus 3 other previous Alice tracks and 3 bonus tracks. This 2nd disc is the real treat of this special edition. To me, I think only the Motorhead remasters compare to this. This is  how remasters should be done and if you have the original, this is more than worth the price. Excellent stuff here 
 To read what is now historical fiction, but was contemporary fiction when written, is wonderful.  She will move you emotionally.  The appendices are a must read 
 I can't believe I've slept on this for so long! I picked up "Emergency Rations" a week before I went and saw the  Perceptionists show, in which I got this for $10 (and had it signed by Lif), and then partook in a dope show by Lif and Akrobatik. At first, I thought "Emergency Rations" was a much better effort (being concise and thanks to the production), but this one is so smart and has so much to communicate to the listener. Yes, it is a story much like that of Prince Paul's "A Prince Among Thieves," but this story is complex and a fresh concept compared to Prince Paul's overtly cliched tale. I'm glad he included a key to figuring out the story and what each song is about. I believe he actually wants people to understand it rather than leaving them in the dark. Most everyone will need the key to follow along with this complex journey. Even though the key is there, one still has to do some thinking of their own to connect it all and make conclusions with what exactly he's trying to convey. Mr. Lif is a superb emcee. His voice may be a tad annoying, but his flow is excellent, as is his vocabulary and the concepts he conveys. I don't wanna give it all away, but the story basically goes from the protaganist dreaming, to waking up and going to work, then quitting, then reveling in his newfound freedom/independence, to needing money and finding a new job and starting a family, to divorce and then a new family, and then the apacalypse of the world occurs and life as we know it ends. I consider Mr. Lif more of a social activist than a political critic, it's just that many of society's ills come from government, so that area gets covered by Lif as well. You may criticize him for not offering enough solutions, but the first step is always making people aware of the deception and the problems of common life and society. With the whole album intertwined, it's hard for tracks to stand out too much. Everyone seems to agree on "Live on the Plantation," which is excellent and relative to every hard worker out there. My favorite is "Success" w/Aesop Rock, because it depicts a broken family situation, and the following skit ("Daddy Dearest") could damn well bring anybody to tears. The last two songs ("Earthcrusher" and "Post Mortem" w/El-P, Jean Grae, and Akrobatik) are great and end the album with a bang, litterally. Although the production for the disc overall was dissappointing (especially compared to "Rations"), the genius of this album is well worth five stars. Some beats were great, most were average. Nonetheless, if someone tells you that Hip Hop hasn't evolved since the mid-90s, toss them this album because works like this are pushing it into the future. Yes, there still is outstanding Hip Hop being made this millenium! Also, this is one of the best story albums that I've ever heard. Any way you put it, this is a must-have 
 This was the second Suzanne Brockmann book I read and since I have purchased every other one I could find.  Out of Control is still my favorite.  Maybe because I was first introduced to Wildcard in this book, I don't share some of the othe opinions about him not living up to character.  He's an intelligent, tough hero with low self esteem because he was abused by his father.  It's part of who he is, no matter what medals he earns.  His inner monologue seemed very honest and realisic and I wish I had a man like him, self depricating and all.  Same goes for Jones.  The more you learn about him, the more you want to know and his banter with Molly is the best! I have read this book about six times and I enjoy it everytime 
 I bought these slippers for my mother, who is 5 years post stroke.  She has difficulty keeping shoes and slippers on because she has no feeling in her left foot since her stroke.  Also she is always cold even when it is 80+ degrees outside.  These slippers have been wonderful.  They fit her well, they stay on and they keep her feet warm. When she wears these out will definitly by another pair 
 Although written well over a century ago, Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a surprisingly modern novel with unmatched poetic beauty.  The author, Thomas Hardy, jabs at the age-old issues of sexism, social class, and morality in this seemingly simple tragic romance.  The heroine is the titular Tess, an elegant but unassuming countryside beauty from a poor farming family.  Her misery begins when the family discovers that they are not the shabby Durbeyfields after all, but rather the descendants of the illustrious and ancient D'Urbervilles.  But Tess' doom goes hand in hand with her heritage.  Introduced to her newfound rich relations, she is forced to become the mistress of her cousin Alec D'Urberville.  Naturally she is blamed for her "defilement" and resulting pregnancy.  Tess of the D'Urbervilles cynically examines the high-strung, sexist Victorian society and the hypocritical Anglican Church, while simultaneously providing a window into the human soul.  Hardy captivates the reader with his luminous heroine, a saintly creature forced to commit terrible deeds against her will.  He questions the very nature of morality, asserting that neither society nor the church has the authority to judge virtue.  Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a masterpiece of literature--tragic and romantic, poetic and critical--a wondrously perceptive literary work.  The reader is captivated from start to finish, from the opening imagery of the lovely English countryside to the fateful, deeply symbolic conclusion set amid the cragged rocks of the Stonehenge. 
 The book makes doing eyebrow shaping look easy...and it not only looks easy- by following a few steps it turns out it IS easy. If you want to learn the basics- buy this book. If you want to do a home makeover- go glamorous, sensual, then fun later on - buy this book. If you want to tune your look a bit- get it! I guess I don't have to go on, but if you are like me and need a bit of instruction and cant afford a makeup artist to be at your beckon call- buy this book. 
 I still own my battered, much-read paperback copy of this sublime little book, which I bought in 1971. To this day it seems to me the single best introduction to Zen available, not as theory or philosophy or even daily practice, but as direct experience. Like most of the previous reviewers, I can return to its pages again & again, finding wisdom & food for thought ... or non-thought, if you will. :)  Here is the paradox of mystery composed of absolute clarity & purity, as expressed through often humorous, even (seemingly) ridiculous stories ... yet they make sense at a very deep level, one that bypasses rational, logical thought or conscious understanding. Behind the sometimes giggling face of the monk is a most rigorous, utterly focused mind, one that cuts preconceptions & ego to ribbons.  For anyone interested in the essence of Zen, for anyone wanting to step outside of the world of ten thousand shallow, mass-produced things, this book is indispensable. Most highly recommended 
 This is a very nice, impressionistic look at railroading, with a bonus:  much of the artwork is of my hometown of Norman, Oklahoma.  I used to wait  for trains at some of these places 
 Havana Dreams scans the 20th century in the unforgettable account of a Cuban family, descended from aristocrats, who live the high life before Fidel, and the heartbreak after.  This is the story of Naty Revuelta, and  four generations of Cuban women.  In 1952, Naty met Fidel Castro, a  young  revolutionary, and although she was married, began a passionate affair with  him that resulted in his unrecognized daughter and his rejection of her  mother. 	Despite the large number of friends and family who fled Cuba,  including Naty's husband, a doctor and their daughter, Nina,  when Fidel  took over, Naty stayed with her mother, Dona Natica and her daughter by  Fidel, Alina, in hopes that she and Fidel would eventually be together.   This is the story of her hopes and dreams, as well as the heartbreak of  lost love and a disentegrating society. 	We trace the lives of Naty's  daughters and their daughters, who all end up in the States, one with an  ordinary confortable life, and the daughter of Fidel who longs for the  acceptance and position she feels she deserves.  This is truly a powerful  story, even moreso because itis true, of passion and what revolution can do  in the light of modern Cuban history 
 Jules Verne's "Around the world in 80 days" is a well-written novel detailing the adventures one man faces as he races the clock to journey around the world.  The main character, Mr. Fogg, is a wealthy Brit who lives a fairly anonymous existence.  People are intrigued by this air of mystery.  As a result of a bet, Mr. Fogg finds himself faced with the incredibly difficult task of this journey and a large sum of money (and his pride) on the line. Set in the 1800's, this journey shows the reader how different life was then.   Now, being so used to instantaneous everything, you might expect the story to feel dated.  Not so.  Verne uses common language so there is not the expected difficulty of translating old english into something you actually understand. The story is exciting, unpredictable, filled with interesting situations and characters.  This is an easy, enjoyable way to spend a few hours of your time 
 I am a medium & psychic and got this and couldnt put it down~!  I was so glad to find another medium who doesnt charge money like me. Thats why I wanted to find out more about him, and was so happy to read his story and insights and find they are comparable to the same teachings experinces etc spirit also taught me working in mediumship. I never threw myself so much into understanding the spirit contact the way he has so he really inspired me to keep going. It really hard to cross over** in this lifetime when you have this calling into a commitment and accept responisblity as he did and make it your lifes work, but with all these new Mediums writing books like this and the attention lately and intrest of people it makes it alot eaiser to claim the *gift and *come out*. Theres so much junk out there about mediumship, not so much in books but in circles and groups kinda rewriting things and misleading people so this book helps alot setting a standard of Reality concerning mediumship I am so grateful for. One thing for me though is that I find people open and facinated with mediumship often have Mediumship ablities and experinces, anyone has this from birth I dont agree with it being some kinda special "extra" thing only some people get to experince. I have seen far too many people wake up one day with this ablity to belive that. We need to have books like this to read when something magical happens to us though so I am happy to know its out there for people asking questions, after sensing things dreams, vistations etc. I am a aura reader, it just happened to me one day, but it took many years to see why and what it was for and what to do with it and I struggle all the time with acceptance and sharing this gift with people who want to lable me crazy and unstable intead of allowing me to simply just pass what I hear and see to them. I also like how Gorden helps us understand hes just a reg guy. we all struggle with being readers or messengers of the spirit world, and are normal people who sometimes dont know what to do with the attention good and bad we get from working with this gift. one of my big lessons as a spirit translator is trying to communicate to people not to give me as messenger attention for spirit trasnlation but when people are affected by spirit messages to remeber the information actually comes from you, it is the williness that you have to even hear those life helping messages that is special not the messenger. a real medium doesnt want you to focus on them as a Icon of Truth but yourself, your own gut feelings, and leave you with a sense of not needing a medium to connect to your own spirits messages. Thats why I enjoyed Gordens book he sets a great example in humlity in a time when some Psychics ( we know who) are creating religions around there mediumship practices and charging insane unafforable fees. I think if you read this book you'll see Gorden gets out of the way and lets spirit really get the attention which is what this wonderous earth journey is really all about us simply being able to see really we all can connect. anyone at anytime in Humility and Trust. Also I should suggest you read " april Crawfords book. Just fantastic~! check it out : 
 This version of UNO changes the rules a bit but the game is basically the same. Instead of automatically having to draw cards from the deck when a "pickup" card is laid the player pushes the "attack" button the designated number of times. Sometimes you end up with a pile of cards being shot out at you and sometimes not. It adds a little suspense to the standard game and the kids seem to really enjoy the surprise. The unit itself is well constructed and easy to use 
 This is not a typical book being read by the author tape, but rather a presentation/discussion by the author of the content of the book DOING NOTHING. For those who liked the book, the tape is an interesting  compliment-- and like the book, fairly challenging to our spiritual  concepts. The publisher, Sounds True, specializes in spoken wisdom and this  tape is just that 
 The stories that the authors of Monkey Business tell in their book have the ring of truth, but no caricature can be entertaining if there is no truth to it.  Thus, while Monkey Business offers insights into the life of a junior banker, I take those insights with a grain of salt.      I was surprised by the language used in writing the book.  I would fully expect coarseness of speech when the authors reported statements made by investment bankers working in an all-male (or almost all-male) environment, but the authors themselves wrote the narrative portion with language just as coarse.  The result is that the book reads more like a couple of guys in a bar telling you their life story, or at least the story of their lives in banking, than a book.  Schadenfreude is defined as a malicious satisfaction obtained from the misfortunes of others.  Here the authors seem to derive a malicious satisfaction from relating their own misfortunes.  Read, laugh, and don't feel guilty about enjoying their misfortunes 
 It's still hard to read this book without tears of joy about our adoption.  This book tells the sweetest story ever about how much a mother wanted a baby.  I hope my daughters will see how much I love them as we share this wonderful story. 
 A book that has helped me so far in critically thinking about conceptual frameworks and theories! I highly recommend 
 Farewell To Salonica: City At The Crossroads is the autobiography of Leon Sciaky and tells of his having grown up in Salonica (now called Thessaloniki), in Greece. A remarkable view of a place where Sephardic Jews, Greeks, Turks, Macedonians, Albanians, and Bulgarians all met, traded, and went about their daily lives. A superbly written memoir, Farewell to Salonica is a heartfelt, highly recommended testimony to a memorable city and a cultural mecca 
               I totally agree with the other reviewers that the music carries the movie.  However, this movie was also outstanding in choreography, acting, writing, and dancing.  I always dreamed about becoming a writer and the movie came out just as I started learning my craft at Saint Leo College so the timing was perfect. As an aside I made my dream come true last month.  How about you 
 As a man who has met and spoken at length to Mary Daly, I can definitively say that she does not hate men (as this seems to be the topic of discussion in these reviews).  Her anger in this book is valid and purposeful.  The anger is present to energize people for change.      The statement that this book is racist seems incredible to me.  The cultural realativist "trump card" of tradition cannot be extended to practices that directly harm people.  Condemming genital mutilation and footbinding on the same grounds as the American medical establisment (the grounds that they cripple, kill and disable women) seems less racist than assuming these practices are "primitive" and thereby sacred.  Daly is not an imperialist, she speaks for the unification of women (and those men willing) across all superficial borders to break the bonds of patriarchy.      This is an angry book, but is enjoyable and, at times astounding, nonetheless.  Daly is disgusted by the patriarchal world that has been created by men and with the complicity of women, but you should be too.  Things don't seem so bad here in the US (if you are happy with $.75 to the dollar), but the picture overseas is entirely different.  Across all cultures (yes even our own) rape and spousal abuse are incredibly prevelant, affecting up to 85% of women in some countries.  Feminism is as needed now as it ever was, and the assumption that it only applies to "developed" cultures allows governments to block and qualify international legislation such as the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women.  This book is a direct challenge to this cultural realativism 
  This is a delightful collection of folktales of Botswana and Zimbabwe re-told by that extraordinary Scottish author, Alexander McCall Smith. Smith was born in Zimbabwe and spent many years on the African continent and even taught law at the University of Botswana. (Botswana is the home of that wise and traditionally-built lady detective, Mme Precious Ramotswe. Mme Ramotswe was kind enough to write a letter about the book that is included at the beginning of this set of tales.)  Smith states that he has taken certain liberties in the telling of these tales to make them more appealing to a broader readership. Animals and people are somewhat interchangeable in African lore and that is apparent in these stories. Examples of the titles are: Guinea Fowl Child; Sister of Bones; Children of Wax; The Girl Who Married a Lion; Two Bad Friends. Most of the stories have a lesson, although some are a little obtuse. Some of the stories bear some similarities to folktales of other lands; universal truths, as it were.  One of my favorites is Sister of Bones; another is Why Elephant and Hyena Live Far From People; another, Two Friends Who Met for Dinner (love this one!). This book is a good one to leave close at hand for a quick read or re-read of a favorite story. The stories range in number of pages from three or four to eight or nine, and are very easy to read. Some might be a little scary for youngsters, but, then, so are the Brothers Grimm, and Bambi.   Carolyn Rowe Hill 
 After reading Embraced by the Light and The Awakening Heart, I was  inspired and intrigued by Betty Eadie's near death experience and her  journey to the other side. However, I still had many questions.  The Ripple  Effect has answered most of them and is a definite 'must have' whether  you're a follower of Betty's writings or just curious. Not only does it  provide the answers but also gives insight as to why we're here and what we  can do to spread the love and goodness that our earthly world so  desperately needs. I highly recommend this truly wonderful book.  The world  would indeed be a better place if everyone read it and abided by 'the  ripple effect' 
 Willis Barstone, the compiler of the paralell text 'The Gnostic Bible', has here collated a wide range of diverse ancient religious literature.    In his introduction, Barstone concludes 'We have recieved a highly distorted and censored version of ancient religious literature...and now we can see these traditions free of their doctrinal strictures.'  The historical evidence does support this thesis, though authors like Dan Brown tend to greatly exaggerate a 'conspiracy' to hide certain ancient documents.  What is true was that during the first few centuries after the ministry and teaching of Jesus, there was not one canonical Bible like the one we had today, but instead a very wide range of Christian movements, from Gnostics to Marcionites to the Proto-Orthodox, who all claimed to faithfully represent Jesus and his teachings.  During this time all these movements produced countless Gospels, Acts, accounts of the creation of the universe, Infancy Stories and legends about Jesus and the Apostles, as well as bizarre myths about the fall of the female wisdom, Sophia, from the heights of the pleorama and the tragic creation of the God of the Old Testament, the 'Demiurge.'    With the victory of the Proto-Orthodox and the laying down of a fixed Biblical canon, the Church authorities were keen to bring the Christian religion under tight ecclesiastical control, and many works disagreeing with official doctrine were burned or destroyed, and movements deemed 'heretical' persecuted.  A lot of 'Gospels' and other works of literature, as well as the literature of the Gnostics, was lost, until discoveries in the 19th and 20th centuries by scholars unearthed much material, such as the Nag Hammadi Library and the Dead Sea Scrolls.  What these discoveries have shown is that Christianity was far more diverse and less unified in its beliefs than was originally thought.  In truth, the works used in the other Bible are well known to scholars of mysticism, ancient literature, philosophy, and theology, so they do not necessarily present a danger to your faith, though to the unprepared the notions in much of the literature can seem odd.  In our 21st century age, we are used to finding truth in logic and science, whereas the writers of these ancient works found it in inner visions, mystical experience, and processes somewhat like the creation of art, music or poetry.  As Barnstone says, there is a lot of very beautiful material material here, from the Gnostic Gospel of Thomas which emphasizes finding the divine within rather than hell and judgement, to the remarkable visions of the Books of Enoch which later were a source of imagery for the writers of Christian apocalyptic works, to the hauntingly beautiful poetry in the Odes of Solomon.    Somewhat less attractive are the rambling stories of the Aggadah, the confused and frenzied visions of the Gnostics, and their bizarre and pathological hatred of the universe, the world and the human body, the violent visions of doom and hell in the Apocalypse of Peter, and the overly long legends of the travels of the Apostles and their tedious focus on fantastic miracles.  Still, there is much of religious worth and beauty in this collection, and Barnstone appropriately ends the book with quotes from the mystical Neo-Platonic Philosopher Plotinus and the shadowy Pseudo-Dionysius the Aeropagite, who would later found the mystical tradition in Christianity itself.    This book is well worth owning if you are interested in how we got the Bible, what got into it, and what didn't.  In the end my view is that a lot of the material excluded is just as beautiful in a literary and religious sense as what was in the Bible (i.e. The books of Enoch, Gospel of Thomas, Odes of Solomon) and one wonders how our religious history would have unfolded had we had a different bible, or bibles, handed down to us by history 
 I am so glad to have found Geneen's wonderful and sensible books.  After going through anorexia and then being very overwieght and binge eating, I have found healing.  I am now my natural weight.  One of the best parts of the whole deal is that now I can have my favorite foods in the house and actually forget about them.  I WANT healthy foods not because some diet "expert" told me I had to eat them, but because I truly want them.  Geneen Roth has written a classic.  Anyone who has suffered from any type of eating disoder will find help here.  Geneen has done groundbreaking work.  Highly, highly recommended reading 
 In this brilliantly conceived study the author tried to parse through Sikh history, memory and identity especially in relation to space and homeland.  The view is towards examining the Sikh diaspora and its connection and use of pictures and imagined identitites to create the need for 'Khalistan' and the representation of Sikhs, from the last Sikh rulers to the tortured bodies fo Sikhs who were victims of the Indian police during the troubles in Punjab leading up to Operation Blue Star and desecration of the Golden Temple.  This is a very interesting and original book and that is why it deserves not only to be read but to be praised.  However it lacks many things that although not pertinent to the subject could have been finally brought out here.  THere does not exist one book in all the world in English that deals witht he millions of refugees caused by Pakistani ethnic cleansing in 1948, not one book on their fate and what that means to the Sikh nation, which was torn in half and had all its people cleansed and depopulated from Pakistan.    This is an understudied phenomenon, and becuase the Sikhs are not considered 'white' by the western-european world they get no attention the way the Palestinians do.  However this book could have delved deeper into this important issue.  Seth J. Frantzman 
 Eisenhower, contrary to many beliefs, was one of the greatest conquerors of all time. He was a warrior and a national leader. Books about him, like the Ambrose ones, are very interesting and present a good view of the war, yet I have always believed that seeing the war through the eyes of the warrior is the best way. Personally, I don't believe that Ike wanted this book to show emotion, it was meant as a book on the broad picture of the war in Europe. He did a fabulous job of presenting it from the perspective, as he did a fabulous job making decisions during the course of the war. This book is as good, if not better, than Ambrose's works 
 This item is very excellent. I was suprise it does not comes with 2 screen protector only, but also a squeegeem, cloth and cleaning instructions. This shield fits very nicely over my phone screen 
 Cold's debut album is something very different from their more recent material.  They did not gain mainstream success until their sophomore release, "13 Ways to Bleed Onstage" (which is a fantastic album), and as such, many may have forgotten about this album.  And, while it is certainly not for the faint of heart, it deserves to be heard.  Listening to this album is sort of like a steady wave of human emotion washing over you.  The music is uniformly dark, sludgy, distorted, and sometimes kind of noisy.  Everything sort of runs together into a dense haze, and it's almost overwhelming.  It sort of gives you the feeling of sitting in a dark alley on a cold rainy night, and each note is like an icy raindrop pounding down on you, chilling you to the bone.    The album begins with the crunchy, visceral "Go Away", with pounding riffs, and vocals dripping with vitriol (and don't worry, it doesn't sound like Godsmack).  "Give" and "Everything Dies" are a bit more fast-paced, and sort of catchy, but still just as oppressively dark.  "Ugly" is a calm acoustic ballad, rife with anguish.  The song starts off with sort of a quiet, echoic sound, finally building up toward the end.  It's a powerful effect, symbolizing one's inner torment rising up and enveloping him.  "Strip Her Down" is the longest track, again featuring acoustic guitar, and some electric.  This song moves through different bizarre atmospheric soundscapes, and feels like a heavy fog settling around you.  "Insane", my favorite of the album, is a powerful dirge, with a hypnotic sludgy riff, and painfully tormented vocals.  "Serial Killer" begins dark and sinister, finally erupting into a crashing wall of guitar noise, and Scooter's frightening screams.  This song is downright creepy.  While the dense, noisy feel of the music, and the brutal rawness of emotional earnesty makes for an interesting listen, it can also make it almost offputting.  The album can be kind of difficult to sit through from start to finish, unless you're in just the right mood.  The band has come a long way since this.  While many may equate their more accessible recent sound with selling out, I think they've developed their songwriting quite nicely.  On "13 Ways..." in particular, the music is more well-rounded and diverse, while still emotionally powerful.  Also, Scooter's vocals and lyrics have improved greatly as well.  While his vocals here are incredibly raw and powerful, his timbre sometimes resembles Eddie Vedder much too closely (he still kinda sounds a bit like him, but much moreso here).  And the lyrics, while brutally honest and heartfelt, are sometimes a bit too blunt and crude, and almost lose their impact as a result.  Also, the phrase "Everyone around you suffocates" appears in three different songs, for no apparent reason.  I don't know what the deal is there.  So anyway, while this isn't Cold's best release, it's an excellent showcase of the dark side of the human psyche, and makes for an interesting and disturbing listen.  Put it in on a cold rainy day, and let it consume your soul.    
 I find Rousseau especially creative in the way he describes how inequality  progressed from the time the first humans made contact. He makes a good  case for the solitary life. I think Rousseau believes it is destructive  whenever humans come together in groups.  Governments were formed to  protect the weaker from the stronger or as Rousseau thinks to actually  protect the rich from the poor.  This is an outstanding book. It will haunt  you 
 Instructions were clear and easy to follow.  I had it on the wall in 30 minutes with the Plasma attached.  One tip:  if you want to hide the wires go ahead and cut the hole in the wall before you mount it 
 Not a big box office success this is really a very good movie.  Great performances from Michelle Pfeiffer, Colin Firth, Jessica Lange and Jason Robards. 
 Pearl is a lot smarter than some of the other VC Andrew's characters, but I found some things to be odd. I couldn't figure out why she called her parents "mommy and daddy" when she is 17 years old. She was very strong when she tried to find her mother, but I felt like when she found Jack, she fell for him a little quickly. He could have easily just turned out to be some jerk. This story line is a little different than the other novels, there are not as many twists and turns. Basically the biggest part of the novel was finding her mother Ruby. I give it 4 stars because I didn't find it as interesting or unique as the other novels, but it is good 
 This was a gift for 3 1/2 year old nephew.  He wanted the patato head with the tongue sticking out!  He loves it 
 I was a little disappointed with Franken's last book, Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them (A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right). I thought it was too jokey, too silly. There was plenty of important stuff in there, but it was wrapped in a marshmallow coating of humor that prevented some people from taking it seriously, and allowed others to dismiss it outright. Not this time.  The jokes in The Truth (with jokes) are actually few and far between, and are generally told through gritted teeth. The book is incredibly information-dense and has twenty pages of references at the end, enough for considerable follow-up and self-study. He covers many important political topics with a remarkable thoroughness.  Every person in America should read this book - it's that good, it's that thorough, it's that important. Depending on which side of the political divide you're on, you'll either find much fuel for your cause, or many questions that you must address before you carry on. Franken so thoroughly deconstructs the hypocrisy of the Bush Administration and its fellow travelers that supporters will find themselves realizing that they are in an ethically, morally, and logically untenable position.  This is not an easy book to read. Every few minutes I found myself flinging it across the room in anger. But because my anger was directed not at Franken, but at the political criminals who he exposes on every page, I was compelled to pick it back up and continue reading. I hope that many people do the same before the November elections.  Read this book. Get angry. Do something about it 
 This book contains a remarkable array of spiritual Truths, all dealt with  in depth. It is a great work; invaluable for the true seeker of spiritual  Wisdom. Each page and chapter contains priceless gems to meditate on and  ponder. It deepened my own committment to God & the Path. Leadbeater  writes eloquently yet understandably of the Spiritual Realms and the Higher  Planes of existence,as well as of well-known Spiritual Masters and  Teachers. It is inspiring and uplifting; giving hope to a troubled World of  perfection to come. I recommend this book to all who seek to Know and  Understand the Divine 
 This short book, which was a 1980 Caldecott Honor book (i.e., a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustrations in a children's book, is about a young boy who plays jazz on an imaginary trumpet. The book is filled with  beautiful black-and-white drawings. Ben's life is changed when a jazz  musician notices him 
 This is another of them -- they keep you reading (I read this one in a couple of days) and you enjoy them while you're reading them.  And yet...  They are not all that memorable and sometimes I find her "detective" characters (Brady and Beaumont) indefinably irritating -- they're just too good to be true, just too competent, and not vulnerable enough. Quite frankly, them and their near-perfect lives are intimidating. I'll bet Joanna Brady's house is never a mess -- she's got the perfect husband staying home taking care of everything for her.  I guess that's every working woman's dream...  Aside from that...this is a well-constructed and well-written mystery.  Although one reviewer said he/she knew all along who did it, I didn't, although in retrospect it all made sense, which makes for a good mystery in my opinion.  The plot involves a woman murdered in her trailer -- for some reason she has 17 dogs in the trailer with her and they die of the heat before her body is discovered.  With all those dogs, there's a subplot about animal welfare issues (although personally I think the word "hoarder" gets thrown around too much and the issue ought to be not the number of animals but whether they're adequately cared for).  Another subplot involves polygamous communities in the Arizona area (where the Joanna Brady series is set).  Then there are two other bodies that may connect to the woman in the trailer, and a coyote driving an SUV full of undocumented aliens trying to slip across the border -- all in all, there are a lot of subplots being juggled in this story, and the plot moves back and forth among all of these subplots.  All in all, Jance is an excellent craftsman, and I like the Joanna Brady series, but there are days when I wish that Sheriff Brady was less intimidating.  I can recommend this book as being at least equal to others in the series (and maybe better) for those already familiar with the Joanna Brady series.  
 A delightful retelling of the old story of the Three Billy Goats Gruff.  This particular book stands out from all the others because of the illustrations, which are priceless!  E.g., for the trip across the bridge, the bigger goats dress up the littlest one in a diaper; the biggest goat suits up in a black leather motorcycle jacket and dark glasses!  The book is as much fun for grownups as it is for children! 
         Lectori Salutem,  In the Beauty of young human beings, lies the hope of the world. Those photographs are like classical music.

 If you are an afficianado of westerns then clearly you should see this  classic story of greed and remorse with two important actors - James Stewart and Robert Ryan who both play their parts to perfection. Shot in an excellent setting , this film should not be missed 
 My son loves this instrument, but I think he likes another saxophone that plays tunes when you press buttons better. This one relies on the child to blow and press the keys, like a real instrument, but doesn't sound like a saxophone 
 I was fortunate enough to see the Waifs' dynamic set at the Newport Folk Festival in 2001, and since then, this little gem of an album is never far from my stereo.  Musically, it has that jangly guitar and harmonica sound of the indigo girls first album "Strange Fire" - bright, acoustic, and harmony-driven. And I sometimes hear a hint of early Michelle Shocked in their vocal inflections, but these are comments more on style: the Waifs are in no way derivative.  See them live if you can; their energetic stage presence is refreshing in the face of so many artists who seem to have forgotten why they got into the business in the first place.  They're doing a lot more U.S. shows these days, and increased exposure means this great band won't be a secret here for long 
 As often happens, Amazon's practice of cross-posting reviews and information specific to _one_ edition of a book on all the webpages for _all_ of that book's editions causes confusion. There are in fact significant differences between the 2004 paperback edition of this superb poet's collected work and the earlier edition of 1989/1993 (hardcover/paperback). Each edition has its merits.  The earlier edition was more comprehensive, including many poems unpublished during Larkin's life. Some of those unpublished poems were inferior to Larkin's previously published work; perhaps half of them were not. (Many of the unpublished poems' states of completion are difficult to determine, a fact acknowledged by the editor.) The poems in the earlier edition are sequenced chronologically in two sections, a primary section of poems written after Larkin began publishing, followed by a smaller section of early poems.  The newer edition eliminates many of the less satisfying of the poems unpublished by Larkin. Strikingly, the newer edition also has been rearranged to reflect the orderings Larkin chose for his few collections. (Notes in the back of the older edition listed by title the order of poems in each prior collection.) These changes make the newer volume better for the casual reader of Larkin, but less useful for the student 
 I rated this book four star because some parts lost me,but over all it wasa great book.It was about a boysailing to America on the Mayflower.Many people died of illness.The boy whose name is Jonhathan,wrote in his journal on his trip.Read this book to findout if he makes it.    Also read other My Name is America books.I hope you enjoy reading this book,because I sure did!! 
 This is a work of fiction that is based on people in our history and their lives though they did not interact as written.  Though the book is written very simply and it's not difficult to guess where the story is leading it was very entertaining and much better than the movie 
 Tim O'Brien creates a masterpiece in this novel.  This is an amazingly clear look into the lives of those thrust into violent, challenging situations where the penalty for a moments distraction can very well be death.  This is story about young men in Vietnam who must survive with the few things that can be carried with them, both physically, mentally and spiritually.  This is human nature condensed into it's most minimalist form.  Each moment, each experience is a vivid image and the reactions from the soldiers carry a sharp clarity that envelopes you like a thick, humid day. This is definitely an intense story that will enter your mind and  remain indefinitely. While Mr. O'Brien has written a fictional novel, it reads more like a memoir in it's precision and  penetrating raw emotion. Realizing that his background is what gives this novel its' authenticity, you know that  fact and fiction must  separate but  only feel the keen blending of the two, leaving you with an inability to discern one from the other. This is a finely crafted novel 
 This book feels authentic and does not burden the reader with dogma or moral code.  It is a simple look at a simple life practice, the art of zen.  Suzuki is easy to understand without being overly simplistic.  A good introduction to Zen.  
 In this delicious wafer of a book, Hirschman describes the process by which a Renaissance-era desire to discount the classical "heroic ideal" in order to account for man "as he really is" in formulating an original and, ... "Machiavellian" statecraft (to be promulgated without respect for a new *spiritual* ethic for the individual) gave rise to a re-examination of the role and motive force of the mortal Passions. Considering the works of such as Vico, Mandeville, and Smith, Hirschman excitedly argues the case for this novel "state" project: the idea that the act of "harnessing" the Passions (e.g., avarice and "cupidity") would serve to parlay the sins of envy, resentment, and petty spite into a value-neutral drive (i.e., "interest") to acquire great *personal* material wealth, which (and this is the rub) would serve not only to break the monopoly of the church over the affairs of men, but to bring about a residual and necessary *collective* prosperity. Behold the Invisible Hand! (Then read your Tocqueville and Marx for 19th-century perspectives on the United States and Britain, respectively. 
 A fantastic text based on an epic journey.  The history of Shackleton's ill-fated expedition is a sharp contrast to the modern view which epitomizes personal liberty as the highest virtue.  This book features vignettes from an expedition faced with nearly insurmountable odds that highlight the difficult choices faced by Shackleton and his men.  In the face of adversity, they managed to endure, though not without cost.  Perhaps the most moving part of the narrative is knowing that, after he and a few of his men made it (barely) to the safety of a remote whaling, he insisted on mounting numerous rescue attempts for his other stranded crew-mates until they were successfully extracted.  I highly recommend this book to anyone, whether or not you are involved in business management.  As a father, I found many of the examples and stories inspirational, and I have shared them with my children to teach them the virtues of perseverence and the responsibilities of leadership 
 The book is full of great photos. I especially liked the one of Jordan and Dr. J! It also has great statistics from Michael Jordan's career. The layout is very different. I did not like it all that much. I was also a little disappointed that we did not really get to see more of the real Jordan. For a brief moment, we saw his humanity when he wrote about his father. Briefly, he mentioned his family. But mostly, he wrote about himself on the court. I guess I was hoping for more humility from this superstar. I believe he has it in him but the book doesn't show it. He certainly has much to brag about, but I thought he always let his bragging be seen through his play on the court 
 This book is not for beginning writers, but it deserves a place on an advanced writer's shelf.  Advice is mingled with the author's musings and probably needs a writer who's developed a finely tuned ear.  Her chapter on the two Englishes is must-know advice for any writer who wants to write with subtlty, making their word choices do the heavy lifting for them.  Not of the caliber of Stein On Writing (but what is? 
 Outstanding book....a real page turner.  You will not want to or be able to put the book down.  A very enjoyable read.  Highly recommended!  
 If you really want to learn and understand mechanical design, Mr. Norton is generous, he teachs everything there is to know. The chapters introduction it's something beyond you can expect from an engineering book. You must have it.. 
 I just ordered several copies of this book for my organization since we are implementing a metrics program. I like the book very much because it is written in plain language and is an easy read. It does not overwhelm the reader but gives lots of good, basic ideas on where to begin a task such as measuring performance. This was a new area for us and this book helped - I have gotten rave reviews about it from my co-workers...it is definitely great for those people/organizations that need help getting started 
 The book Princess Academy by Shannon Hale is about a fourteen year old            girl Miri and a bunch of other girls who have to go to an academy. They have to learn poise, the principles of conversation, and diplomatic negotiation. Miri and Katar are the only girls who pass these test's. Katar thinks she'll win to be princess, but does she? 	I think the theme at the beginning is having to deal with  letting go of your family members. I felt bad for Miri when her mother died when she was little. The theme at the end of the book is not being afraid to do what's right. If I were Miri at this point I would be scared to death. I mean she has to roll off a cliff and grab on one of the rocks sticking out of the cliff and she does this for her family and friends. 	My favorite part of the book is when all the girls confused the bandits for who was the princess and who wasn't. First Frid said she was princess. Then Miri said she was. Then all the rest of the girls said they were. The bandits got mad so they took Miri and Dan, the head bandit, said he would kill her the next day. The part that I disliked was when Dogface ,a bandit, hung Gerti, the youngest girl. The book was very interesting and a great book to spend you time on reading. I loved this book and hopefully you do to 
 I need to say I am the author's aunt-in-law but had only heard 3rd hand about her new book. I'd just gotten back from a week's meditation retreat and Fruitflesh was a great re-entry guide. Reading it helped prolong that delicious blend of body awarenesses and trusting each moment. Just as Anne Lamott's Bird by Bird brings you more deeply into your every day life, Fruitflesh brings you, fruit by fruit, back to your every day body and your every moment senses. A meditative eater's best friend 
 Ned's burst into the "alternative rock" scene with God Fodder, a brilliant debut effort, and one of the best in 1991.  "Grey Cell Green" and "Happy" were picked up by the local radio station, but the entire CD spills over with raw power.  A few of the songs on the CD (ex. "Kill Your Television") were taken from their earlier independent label issue, re-mixed here and blended to match the theme of the CD.  The energy of God Fodder is similar to Linkin Park's "Hybrid Theory" - in fact, if you have never listened to Ned's, I would suggest this CD is like a mix between Nirvana and Linkin Park.  Unfortunately, Ned's Atomic Dustbin's later CDs never reach the level of intensity this album does, and have the feeling of overproduction, though they did manage a minor hit with "Been Sleeping Around".  
 I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  It covers what Miller calls "Poisonous Pedagogy" that stems from parents and religious teaching.  If you truly want to free yourself from a toxic and traumatic past buy this book - your mind will undoubtedly be opened to the horrors of accepted childcare and religious teaching practices 
      This book is a fantastic book. It has soooooooo much suspense and is very easy reading. Easy reading in this case means you don't even have to think about reading it, your eyes just glide across the page. It is really interesting. It is fun for most kids because almost ALL of Andrew Clements's books are about school 
 Unlike tarot, palms are hard to lose, for you have to literally be mutilated for this divination not to work.  Unfortunately, palms are much harder to read than tarot cards, for the sheer number of lines and wrinkles in a person's hand.  This book therefore, is a valuable ally in one's search for the truth 
 There's a kindly looking, grandfatherly doctor on the cover of this book and inside he confides to you 167 up-to-the-minute medical discoveries, treatments and cures that can save your life. Who wouldn't want to read this book?   Have you ever wanted to corner a doctor at a party and pick their brain about your newest symptom or self-diagnosis, but social graces prevented you? Well this informative book is the closest you can get to that banter.   Breakthrough Heath is a medical reference book that you can refer to many times. It's written in a simple direct approach and broken down into alphabetized chapters on illnesses from alcoholism to wrinkles. Within each chapter, Dr. Rosenfeld writes about "the latest news" in current studies on subjects in the area of medication, treatments and the "bottom line," which incorporates his personal suggestions.   Some other subject's covered are: breast cancer, cold and flu, depression, diabetes, reflux disease, lupus, menopause, Parkinson's disease, sinusitis and stroke. If every time you read or re-read this book you discover one new thing to try or one more question to raise with your personal physician, it will certainly be worth the price.  
 Well... i read the Alexandrea Quartet many years ago and i was completely amazed by the way Durrell could recreate the real and external world of a group of friends who lives in Alexandria while their internal peregrination. In my personal opinion the best characters are Justine and Clea. And not because i am a woman but because they are sharp and also round and full of shades. Eventhough you can read each book separeted it is much better if you read the whole quartet. 
 People - some of us are born with it and some of us nurture and grow it, imagine if you had the ability to do both?   Kenny Werner is the Tony Robbins for musicians.  This book is more of a spiritual guide to become the musician YOU think you are capable of becoming.  If you believe that the only thing stopping you from achieving success, is you, then you are ready for this book.  The accompanying CD is great to listen to for meditating.  I have discussed this book with many musicians and overall it is agreed that this book is easy to read, in fact easy to apply too!  
 I call this one "Frank Peretti Lite."  It was very entertaining but not a deep as his previous books.  Instead of focusing on sin and spiritual warfare, this one had a creationist angle.  I really enjoyed it, just not the same as his other books.  Also, you have to remember that this is fiction.  Of course the scenario is highly unlikely if not impossible.  But the central point about mutations comes through.  Great summer read 
 this is an amazing piece of work. i truly love all the instrumental bands out there. godspeed, explosions, album leaf, mogwai. etc etc etc... this is oft comapred to those above, but it is definitely its own thing. if you are a fan of their earlier works, then this is a bit of a departure, or rather a progression. they still have the jazzy dynamic tension, build ups, and rhythmic noodling they are best known for, but on this release they take the lows even lower and the highs even higher, that goes for the instruments and the moods. unlike past albums which conitinued building but never fully released, this album is full of the desired release. and yes, at some points the music is so perfect as to make your toes curl. real heavenly moments. dont be afraid to get lost in your music, start here. i also recommend picking up all their earlier stuff too. you wont be disappointed. peace.. 
 Finally someone tries to offer hymns that are new to CD. Unfortunately, it suffers the tragic flaw of only having a small collection. This album is worth the buy for two reasons. Many of these songs are not located on the Gaither Collection. Secondly, the liner notes are written by the same man who wrote them Ernie's last album for Capitol, For the 83rd time. The notes provide a useful insight into the life and times, as well as the man itself 
 You know the author is good when he can make you tear up for a former KKK member on Death Row. While the book was a little slow at times, I couldn't wait to turn the page and find out what happens next. If you like John Grisham, you'll like this book. 
 Anthropology should be so insightful. Gutmann, wife Michelle McKenzie and daughter spent a year in the colonia Santo Domingo from 1992-1993. The publisher calls this the "first detailed ethnography of machismo in Mexico." With  vignettes and theory in hand, Gutmann carefully reviews the stereotype of  "macho" with the finesse of a classical novelist. Again, the University of  California Press demonstrates that academic work doesn't need to be boring 
 Turn down your intelligence and enjoy the slapstick sophmoric humor. Hot babes and suggestive jokes. Mini-me makes it. Great deal 
 Without question, Mr. Mander's book is powerful. There is little doubt that Euro-American culture and many "modern" societies are the victims of an artificial reality swallowed up in a "Megatechnocracy." If you wonder why, other cultures, in particular Iraq, Iran and many Moslem countries, don't want America's value system, read this book. Clearly, this country, America, is a destroyer of cultures, especially in the hands of the modern conservatives in Washington. The coming cultural/social conflicts of the future will largely center around a war of cultural values and it is going to be a global tragedy in the end. America respresents only a fraction of a world population; the world does have some other ideas about the humanity of the future without American technology and technical arrogance. Look out George W. Bush. You ain't seen nothing yet 
 this is one of the most gripping, involving books I've ever read...Sebastian Junger writes with the details and accuracy of an investigative journalist and the excitement and anticipation of a great mystery writer..highly recommmended..one of my favorite books of all-time 
 A great story!  Although written in the 1960's, the mixing of technological devices with basic human traits in a government agent works just as well today.  If you make a few substitutions (such as cell phones for radio aerial in a mast), this novel would be a best seller in the 21st century.  In any era, the man pulling the trigger must still justify his actions.  
 As a newcomer to enterprise architecture this book educated me on possibilities for decisions to be made in designing an enterprise architect.  It will also give you a language for describing existing characteristics of an existing enterprise application which may use some combination of the patterns describe in this book.  The discussion of where to keep session state for a webapp was particularly helpful to me 
 "Paws to Consider" is an invaluable reference for the average pet dog owner who's looking to expand the family. The breed descriptions are concise and direct, and for my money, right on point most of the time. As a professional dog trainer and canine rescue volunteer, I see far too many dogs selected for their looks, or perhaps what a similar dog appeared to be on television or the movies. In the past, most folks only had the "breed books" to use as a reference when trying to make a selection; unfortunately, most breed books are not going to be too forthcoming about a breed's drawbacks as a family pet (when most of those characteristics were specifically put there as the breed was developed, for a specific purpose!) Thanks to Brian and Sarah for putting the real deal out there and providing a road map for the average family pet owner when navigating the windy road of breed selection!

 This play was pretty entertaining all the way through. There's a bit of anti-woman propaganda in there, but everyone knows August Strindberg wasn't a big fan of women. Looking past that, the dialogue is great and the story is pretty interesting. These characters are actually three-dimensional and have a depth of feelings that would be great to see on stage. A good actor could really create an awesome piece with this play. Definitely recommend it as a quick read and there's a few monologues in there. A 20-25 year old woman could do a Miss Julie monologue, and a 25-35 year old man could do a Jean monologue. Check it out 
 As all of his books, this was a very suspenseful novel.  The characters seemed so real of course I have every Stanford novel he has written and waiting for a new one.  Hope it is soo 
  Hoot by Carl Hiaasen is a fun read for all ages.  The story is about Roy, the new kid at school, who is subjected to bullying by Dana, a notoriously mean, bad to the bone lout. That bullying leads Roy on an adventure he never anticipated where he finds an unlikely ally in a no nonsense girl named Beatrice, who is one tough cookie and more than a match for the dreadful Dana! Enjoy the satisfaction when the the tables are turned and Dana finally is on the receiving end and gets what's coming to him! Humor is a staple throughout Carl Hiassen's books and Hoot is no exception. Sometimes you just have to laugh out loud! Given as a Christmas gift along with Hiaasen's 'Flush' to our oldest granddaughter, she has told us she enjoyed both books enormously. It is going to make it hard this Christmas to find books this entertaining to give her! She is an avid reader. You know you did good when a fourteen year old says, 'you always give me the best gifts' and includes these books in her list! 
 I first read this book and this series some 52 years ago...I recently dug them out and had another go.  They are as fun now as they were then.  Burroughs' style is absolutely great and needs to be savored.  The books are action packed and certainly reflet a time in our society long past.  I feel to understand current SiFi and S&S, you really need to start during this time period.  We certainly have come along way, in may ways, but it is very evident that this writer and his contemporaries certainly had a profound influence on what we are getting today.  This are books for little boys and girls and thank goodness I have enough of that little boy in me to still enjoy them 
 I will admit to viewing this movie solely for the purpose of seeing John Barrowman. As a fan of his most recent works in Doctor Who and Torchwood, I knew going into this movie on what to expect.   All of the negative reviews for this movie are exactly true, it's class A cheese, the scientific facts are dubious at best, the shark is more laughable than anything scary and the green screen work is pure hilarity.  But come on, you don't watch a movie like this for it's cinematic aspect, you watch it because of how bad it is. I haven't laughed so hard during a movie then when I did in watching this. So, 4 stars on keeping me entertained and here's to every really cheesy B movie out there 
 I don't really know what I can say about this book, but I'm sure I'll find the words... Nevermind, I have them. If you pick it up and expect the Disney movie, you're in for one of the biggest surprises of your life. At the beginning it seems to start out slowly because some of the characters introduced weren't in the Disney movie at all, so you're like... "oookay, who are these people?" However, this book was so great. It was very sad and depressing, but it had it's happy moments, which is always nice.   It was amazing, and one of the best books I have ever read. Disney is a butcher of good stories!!! Arg! (This, however, is just my opinion. If you're a fan of Disney and I have offended you, I do apologize.)  I loved his writing style, with how descriptive he is with the setting and the characters. Victor Hugo does it so well that you feel like you are actually in Paris in the 15th century, and that you actually know the characters. They were portrayed so much differently in the book. My favorite character was Dom Claude Frollo, and I thought that I would have hated him, especially since he causes virtually all of the horrible suffering in the story. Weird, huh? I also liked Quasimodo for his kindness despite how unfortunate he is. He's constantly ill-treated, but he still keeps his good-natured soul.  I'm sure I'll be picking up copies of some of Victor Hugo's other books soon as well. The ending of this book brought me to tears, but I don't know about anybody else, since nobody I've talked to has read it.   I'm the sort of person who cries easily, and I became very attached to the characters. This book is filled with death, but some of it made me smile. I loved the ending even though it was tragic, but I won't spoil it. Go read it yourself. Not all stories can end happily 
 An excellent product for cleaning your glasses or other lenses. They are small enough to carry around in your pocket. They lift off dirt, fingerprints, etc. I recommend washing your cloths weekly in hot water to keep them completely clean. The cloths will not scratch, but debris left in the cloth can scratch 
      This book got our attention for earning the Caldecott Award.  Overall, it is a fun and enjoyable book.  The illustrations are bold, simple, and eye catching all at once.  It is a very short read, which is sometimes a good thing with little children's attention span!        It is a tad sad, and funny all at the same time.  It made both my son and myself say.."Awww...." for the poor rabbit.  A very cute book on friendship and unconditional love though 
 Primitive Streak is the last studio recording made by the Subdudes. This band just kept getting better and on Primitive Streak they deliver a solid 5 star CD. The songwriting is excellent and they are joined by a number of guest musicians. This CD features the Subdudes with horns and Bonnie Riatt singing and playing guitar on the haunting "Too Soon to Tell". There is some wonderful slide guitar on this CD and I am not sure if it is Tommy Malone or Willie Williams as the liner notes do not say. This CD reminds me of the Eagles before Hotel California. Great harmonies distinguish every song on this CD. The percussive sound of the Subdudes is very haunting and features a variety of percussive instruments including tambourine and snare drum. When listening, try "All the Time in the World (tr#1), "Too Soon to Tell" (tr#8), and "Why do you Hurt Me So" (tr#4) 
 Unsurprisingly, reviews by men on pregnancy books are few.  However, I did read this book, so thought I would share my thoughts with any other male readers out there!  This book is very comprehensive in that it covers all aspects of the baby-making process, from conception through to the first weeks at home with the baby.  It also doesn't sugar-coat the process, which is useful for the un-pregnant partner to know!  There is ample space given to potential health problems and what to do about them.  Likewise, warning signs that things are not proceeding properly and lists of risk factors for certain conditions (e.g. pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, etc.).  The author has written books on the subject of coping with miscarriage and other pregnancy-related traumas, and so includes some of the unfortunate possibilities as well as the good stuff.  The topics are broad and comprehensive.  However, there's really very little detail on any given section - the author has chosen to give a good general overview of the whole process, and includes many useful tips like how much you're likely to spend on baby clothes in the first year.  There is also a lot of information on changes to the mother's body and what she should expect (e.g. how much her breasts will swell, what aches and pains are likely to be related with a normal pregnancy, etc.).  However, there is no "developmental biology" - no pictures of the size of the fetus at certain ages, no chronology of the development of organs, etc.  As a scientist, I found the book to be a little vague and/or "touchy-feely" at times.  Overall, though, it's a good introduction about what to expect and what potential problems to watch out for.  It's written entirely to the mother - she is refered to as "you" throughout the book, whereas the father is always "he".  That's not to say that the father won't find the book useful - it'll certainly help in understanding the process of pregnancy 
 Buy the book because there is far too much useful information to take in at even two listenings. Although it starts as typical `heard it all before' the last two sides are remarkable in their depth and panorama. There is  advice and guidance for everyone here. We need to ask questions of our  customers and competitors. How would our customers redesign our company?  Three steps: vision - picture of what we need to become to better serve  existing customers, prepare - what is the shortest path from where we are  to where we need to be, deliver - change organisation to match vision.  Customer facing people need to be empowered to solve problems on the spot,  not refer to their managers. Your organisation is evaluated by how quickly  it can respond to customer needs and problems. The person they care about  is are the ones they talk to and they want top service from these people.  Making all your people your business partners is a way of raising financial  awareness and therefor cutting costs (story of 5c margin in restaurant).  Divide into cost centres and profit centres. What is the strategic reason  for performing the function of the cost centres? Should the work be  outcourced? Should be spending more time managing profits not costs. Profit  results from keeping needs of customers and employees paramount. 4 key  managerial roles: producing - technical skills in field, make things  happen, implementing - planners and administrators, maintain order and  control, innovating - entrepreneurs, future looking and integrating -  motivators, good at teamwork. Also 4 mismanagement styles: lone rangers -  producers who cannot delegate, bureaucrats - implementers who focus on  administration, process and rules, arsonists - innovators who never follow  through or implement the ideas of others, super followers who cannot  provide direction. In times of change are leaders willing to: relinquish  `parental control; look at both long and short term; supply resources and  support; communicate and remove obstacles; help others overcome uncertainty  and fear; admit that they do not have all the answers. Control kills  learning, invention and commitment. Bossidy - burning platform principle,  people `jump' only when they see flames themselves. Leaders need to help  people see the flames. Long term provides focus not on survival but the  future. When in doubt communicate more, not less. Nelson Mandela - "Our  deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are  powerful beyond measure. It is our light not our darkness that most  frightens us." In order to help people manage change we need to keep  everyone informed so they know what is in it for them. Change means that  people feel awkward about needing to act differently, they focus on what  they will lose, (what you resist, persists), they feel alone, they feel  overwhelmed if there is too much change so they need to experience some  successes before taking on more change. Readiness for change varies.  Although people feel that they need more resources to do more - we have to  do more with less. Need to keep everyone encouraged by catching people  doing something right, but leaders need sufficient self-esteem to help  others feel good about themselves. Discipline required managing perpetual  churn (whitewater). Catch yourself doing something right - managing your  self-talk. What do you want to be doing? Our problem is not what we see,  but what we see with. At the brink of the 21st Century we cannot see the  future with 20th Century spectacles 
 Thank God for Heather Mac Donald. This is a reporter's reporter. Most reporters fancy that they don't follow the herd, but they do anyway because it never occurs to them their assumptions and premises fit it in with the group-think of the Intellectual Elites: the herd of independent minds.  Mac Donald, on the other hand, goes out into the street and does not use what she sees to force fit into a liberal worldview. A reporter who is a healthy skeptic and does not erase her inner doubts when they offend the gatekeepers of sensitivity: what a novel concept!  Each chapter in this book will make your blood boil. You want to keep turning the page, but you get mentally exhausted from realizing how out of touch with reality the liberal intellectual elites are. And how relatively easy they seem to brainwash urban crowds.  But then, Mac Donald shrewdly observes, social programs that the elites put into place start to fall apart. The ultimate victims are the very people the elites claim to help. It is the upside-down world aspect of what Mac Donald has found on the ground in America that will leave your head spinning.   
 This (unfortunately) timeless work is a scathing indictment of US Indian policy from independence until the 1880s. It includes a general treatment of bad-faith attitudes and policies, and a series of more detailed case studies of exceptionally egregious violations of legal treaties & human rights. It is timeless because of ongoing popular and official ignorance or lack of concern for American Indian rights, economic problems and indigenous culture---witness, for just one chilling example, the continuing imprisonment of Oglala/Anishinaabe activist Leonard Peltier, for murders he did not commit.  Jackson was a pioneer activist for Indian rights, and commitment shines through on nearly every page. While it is true that her writing style may seem dated to some contemporary undergraduates, her subject's intrinsic interest holds the attention of any reader with more than a marginal interest in the topic. It is still useful for research purposes, though it is perhaps most valuable for history and/or anthropology courses on changing attitudes & policy toward Indians.   In teaching about American Indian history, a main reservation about assigning it is the need to present what Indians themselves have said and/or written about their encounters with Euro-Americans. For a fine variety of views on these issues, see P. Nabokov ed, "Native American Testimony," and (among many other sources) memorable works by two premier Indigenous scholar-activists: Ward Churchill, "From A Native Son," and Vine Deloria Jr., "Custer Died For Your Sins. 
 I think this may be his best full-length novel.  It has the jewelled sculptured quality of his best short stories.  It is full of symbolistic harmonies.  The only fault is the death of the colonel at the end which looks clumsy and detracts from the art of it 
 We've had this chair for about 6 months now and love it!  Our older son had a Graco one but when we stored it we lost the straps, so we had to find a new chair for the baby.  I was looking for an inexpensive chair but when I saw this one with all the features I loved it immediately and decided to splurg. So glad that I did!  The chair is very easy to clean and folds up small enough to fit between my frig and wall.  While the trays are too big for the dishwasher, they clean up really easily with a wet wipe so that doesn't bother me. 
 The Address label is wrong for proper delivery.  Has street address instead of Post Office Box 
 I enjoyed this wonderful book immensely, and would recommend it enthusiastically to all my British family and friends -- except that all my British friends have already read it! My only hesitation in an American context is that people who have not grown up in postwar Britain as Kate Atkinson (and I) did might not get her dense texture of forgotten brand-names and vanished social customs. In this, she is pitch-perfect, recalling not only the lost era of her own chilhood but also the England of her grandparents and parents. I can see why there is a Reader's Guide on the market, for Atkinson's museum contains an almost archaeological treasure that, though sometimes needing annotation, is always authentic.  But her factual authenticity is nothing compared to her authenticity as a person. For the story of the growth of her narrator-heroine Ruby Lennox from conception into young womanhood is that of a life not so much described as LIVED. I assume that the book is largely autobiographical, but it does not read as that either, since Ruby (who always speaks in a voice older than her years, and can be marvelously funny) is so much alive that she leaps off the page as an independent creation, clearly informed by the author's love-hate relationship with the other members of her extended family, but by no means following her footsteps. It is almost a pity at the end when she comes of age, and the provocative double focus of adult/child merges into one.  The various chapters of Ruby's story, told chronologically, are interspersed with long "footnotes" investigating different episodes in the lives of her mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother (this is a feminist book without making a fetish of it), their siblings, and the various men who affect their lives. These stretch back into the late 19th century, spanning two world wars, and show (as other readers have pointed out) how much the lives of women have changed in the past century. I found that many of the most moving parts of the book, some of which brought tears to my eyes, were contained in these sections. But they are told out of chronological order and feature a large cast of characters; I wish I had thought to jot down a timeline and family tree as I was reading.  Various reviews quoted in the paperback edition compare Atkinson to Dickens. Although her voice is quite different, there are certain similarities: both authors enjoy mystery and belated revelations, both have a fondness for highly colored characters, both share a comic vision, and both tend towards the melodramatic. There is more than the average amount of tragedy in this book, and few of their lives follow predictable paths. But Atkinson's characters do not lose reality because of this but seem more vigorously alive. Given Atkinson's infectious voice and grasp on life, the overall effect of this book is wonderfully exhilarating.  [For another magnificently authentic account of life in Britain in the years around WW2, I recommend Andrea Levy's recent SMALL ISLAND. And for a book that attempts a somewhat similar family saga to Atkinson's, but in an American context, I suggest Carol Shields' modern classic THE STONE DIARIES. Both these books are among the best I have read in 2006; BEHIND THE SCENES will make a third. 
 Have you ever come in from the garden on one of those balmy days when the sun is "just right" neither too hot nor too cold, but warm enough to draw the aroma from your flowers, and thought to yourself, "I would love to preserve that smell for a rainy day." Well, you can by  bottling tonics, elixirs, hydrosols, syrups and other concoctions that upon opening in the middle of winter, have the power to transport back to summer days, and perhaps even cure the nasty cold or flu affecting you, or even better, help prevent your becoming sick in the first place.  James Green is the most transparent of human beings, an admiral characteristic in someone who is a healer. Green lives what he writes about, and has for a number of years.  He is witty, wise, and compassionate.  His methods are clearly described and discussed. You too can make many of his products using standard kitchen equipment in your own home.What you make will have your own imprimatur as you will have control over the process and can modify the steps as need be.   Green makes medicine.  Some herbalists disagree with the idea of focusing on herbal products as part of a medical model, preferring instead to practice only the holistic healing which concentrates on prevention by focusing on the context within which the individual lives. Sometimes, however, no matter what you do, you get sick.  Green not only shows you how to create products to deal with these lapses, he suggests ways to address them. Recipes as well as clear instructions for making tinctures, syrups, and other concoctions are included. You will probably get well just because they generally smell so good.  
 Rating 4/5 stars   SEE JANE DATE by Melissa Senate was pretty funny and very fast moving. Jane Gregg works in publishing for POSH PUBLISHING. She is frustrated - she has worked her butt off but has yet to get a promotion. She is aspiring to become an Assistant Editor, especially now since she has taken over her boss's projects. Her boss, Gwen, is off work on maternity leave, and has given Jane the project of all projects: she is to oversee the book by semi-famous actress Natasha Nuteley, whom Jane refers to as "Gnatasha" instead (the G is silent). Jane and Natasha went to school together, and while Natasha was the most popular girl in school, Jane hated her with a passion. Now, Natasha has come back to ruin Jane's life, but if Jane can get this book edited and published, it may mean a promotion and the recognition she deserves.   In the mean time, Jane has been invited to her cousin Dana's wedding. (Jane does not care for Dana either). Dana's claim to fame is that Natasha once babysat her, and so it is quite a coup that Jane is working on Natasha's book, a tell-all almost-porno memoir of an affair she had with a very famous actor, and so Natasha is invited to the wedding. Jane does not want to have to attend the wedding without a boyfriend and so she gets her friends to help her get set up on a number of blind dates, hoping that one of these men will become that date to the wedding. This in itself was pretty funny and would have been enough to keep this book going.  I found SEE JANE DATE a little bit heavier (in spots) than the average chick lit. There were some moments where it was very serious in tone, especially when it came to Jane remembering her deceased parents, and some of the bonding scenes she had with Natasha. For this type of book, however, this was a good read, had a good plot, and I hope to read more by Melissa Senate.  Very funny and recommended for those who love chick lit 
 I'm an avid White Wolf player, going on 5 years now.  By far, Changeling is my favorite.  The others are good, yes, but they're not as free as changeling.  Freedom to experiment is ALWAYS a big plus for us GMs.  One of the the parts of this game most used by my groups (I have several groups who come to me to be the GM) is the Chimera Companion.  I've had players who've had a blue dragon afraid of mice, a living feather duster, a piece of tofu fluent in English, Spanish, French, Latin, Portugese, Chinese, and German, and even someone who used the Brooklyn-accented, trod-guide owl example in the book.  I require them to balance their merits and flaws, but most of them did that on their own before I told them.  The Cantrips are a hoot (I had one innovative player hopscotch a group of 3 redcaps through the ceiling to knock 'em out), and the system is easy to adjust to from Werewolf and all the others. Check it out 
 These are great little binoculars that I use quite often.  They are so compact and lightweight that I grab them whenever I leave the house - whether it be for a boat ride around the lake or just a quick ride.  I don't see quite as well when I leave my eyeglasses on and it does take a little bit more adjusting to get the focus right with eyeglasses, but they are a great pair of binoculars for the price.  I am very impressed with the quality of them. 
 This is an excellent book for all ages.  I love that both the perspective of the ant and the boy is given.  The best part of the book is the last page, when it is up to the "reader" on whether the boy should or  should not squish the ant.  This books allows for so much discussion  because of it's open-ended ending!  More books should be written with this  type of ending 
 A hillarious spoof on "War of the Worlds," "Mars Attacks" is a great political parable for the 21st century.  In a time when terrorists and rogue regimes season their speach with "peace" and "love" while they practice hatred, murder and plot destruction, this movie perfectly reflects the stupid crop of politicians who believe their rhetoric and blind their eyes to what's happening right in front of them.  Uproariously funny in its own right, this movie should be required viewing for every poli. sci. major, or those aspiring to political office or public policy positions 
 Carl Hiaasen is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors.  His books are filled with some really unusual characters.  Some of them are creepy, some are pathetic and others are just funny.  The lobbyist in this book has so many problems.  He has to deal with crooked politicians who are almost as disgusting as he is.  He also has to deal with a wife who has decided she made a horrible mistake when she married him, and an environmentalist with anger issues.  When he gets too greedy, he finds himself being pushed around by a hit man.  The developer he's working with is obsessed with Barbie Dolls and is trying to turn a pair of bimbos into real-life Barbies.  When they start to revolt, he turns to the lobbyist to help him get them back.  On top of all this, his black lab is taken by a deranged dognapper.  If he weren't such a pig, you'd almost feel sorry for him.  The book is filled with some really strange characters, and made me laugh out loud several times.  It's the funniest book I've read in a long time 
 There are many, many SQL books in the market. Very few good ones. And even fewer excellent ones. This is one of those few outstanding books which not only teach you some of the basic concepts but also to think. Readers of  common trade books may get disappointed by its style, because it is simple  but deeper and these readers expect the ABC of the other books. But please  do persist and it will eventually change the way you think about databases  and consequently the way you work and think about what you do and how you  do what you do 
 If you are truly a seeker of the truth, this is a book that must be in your library.  Have you ever wanted to know why the Seventh Day Adevtise Church is the way it is? Or have you wanted to always know how Islam, Mormons or Jehovah Witnesses got their start?  Everything in Walter Martin's book is based upon hard facts found in magazines, court cases and documented sources.  This book will open your eyes and make you realize the fabrications that many cults and religions have painstaikingly gone through to create the illusion of what is the truth.  Walter Martin's Kingdom of the Cults opens these falsehoods to the light of day and it gives Christians the tools to have intelligent and rational discussions with a person who believes one of these ruses.  It is a tantamount book, resourceful, direct and above all it is the truth. 
 Professor Francione's philosophy has never been more concisely or urgently articulated than in this book. Paring the discussion of our treatment of animals down to basic elements and building his arguments with rigorous logic, Francione makes an overwhelming case that may even convince the casual reader to adopt a change in lifestyle. What makes this book so powerful is that rather than convince us that we should believe what he believes about justice and/or morality in human/animal relations, Francione shows that we already DO belive it - it's just that most of us are too confused or too lazy to act on such beliefs. The criticism(s?) of his "all or nothing" stance miss the point - Francione's abolitionist stance provokes all readers to examine the very foundation of their own opinions, and assists animal activists in making coherent arguments for the cause. A cup of very strong, if occasionally bitter, coffee that should wake up every American 
 This is the second Phillips digital frame I have purchased.  They are great and when someone walks into my house that is the first thing they notice. The quality of the pictures are clear and the options the frame allows you makes it very user friendly.  A great buy 
 If you're wondering which to get, this one of the original book (ISBN:0811839575), I'd say go for this one. The original only has pictures and names for each position, but this one also gives an estimate of calories burned (kind of a joke, really), a rating system you can give each after you've tried them, as well as comments fields which you can fill in.  The positions aren't exactly the same as the original, however, at least not in the same order. Doing a quick flip through of both, they may be the same 365 or so, but they don't appear on the same dates as in the original (except for the holiday specific ones). In other words, there may be some in one book that aren't in the other, or they may just be rearranged, I'm not sure.   The only other difference between the two is the size. While both are the same thickness, the original is a bit smaller than this one since it lacks the additions I mentioned above.  Overall, if you're interested in keeping track of which ones you do and such, go for this one. If not, then it doesn't really matter. If you can still get this one at the bargain price of $4.99, then you should get it for sure!  And remember, this book was intended to be humorous, not totally serious. Many of the positions are not even humanly possible (although I'm sure many have tried) and that is mentioned in the introduction. It's still fun to experiment and just have fun with it. For examples, check out the original site these were published on 
 In my opinion the book Little House on Rocky Ridge by Roger Lea MacBride is a great book.Based on the life of Rose Wilder and her family this book is as good as the ones abouther mother, Laura Ingalls Wilder. Rose and her parents are moving from South Dakota to find a better life. They had to move becausethe drought wouldn't let anithing grow. So in a covered wagon they headed to to Kansas in hope of a better life.On the way to Kansas Rose has fun looking at all the new things she hadn't seen before. During the trip Rose's mother shows her the money that will help buy the new farm, it's one hundred dollars.Rose promises that she won't tell anyone about it. But at the end of the trip when they are ready to buy the farm the money can not be found. The whole family gets very woried and dosn't know what to do.Rose and her family learn to be strong on hard times and go on with life 
 I love this book!  The pictures are beautiful and the ideas are inspiring.  The projects in the book are fantastic.  They also work as a springboard for coming up with great latin themed projects of your ow 
 I was given a book of Edgar A. Guest's poetry as a birthday present when I was a kid . . . it doesn't seem like it could be that long ago, but it is.  He has remained my favorite poet.  He's not fancy, doesn't use free verse, or symbolism --- which is exactly why, forty years after first being introduced to this poet, I still sit down from time to time just to browse through a book of poems by Edgar A. Guest just for the sheer joy of reading his poetry 
   This DVD is not only visually pleasant but it is more informative than most of the other DVDs out there concerning the area of Rennes le Chateau.  It is given from a French perspective by French historians and writers from southern France.  It is a departure from Henry Lincolns hypothisis (which still has merit) and it dwells on the main character, Father Sauniere and a strange murder of Father Gelis a priest who lived only three miles from Sauniere and of course, a secret.  Taken with Henry Lincolns video, it gives one a much broader picture of the mystery....and more questions.  Which for me, is wonderful.  I love a good mystery and this one is one of the biggest mysteries in human history.  I loved it.  I watch it often.  There always seems to be some snipets of information that I missed.  I recomend it to anyone with an open mind about Christianity and perhaps, human origins 
 In the late Victorian period, eighteen-year old Lady Eden has spent the last 6 years in a convent since the death of her parents. Although she wishes to take vows to become a nun, her uncle/guardian refuses her request until she has" lived a little" by having a season.    In steps her flamboyant cousin Reggie, who still lives at home (driving his father crazy) and who convinces her that the best way to see real life is through the tutelage of the ton's "devil", Lord Damien Sinclair.    "Devil" agrees to the plan and with Reggie's hysterical help, takes Eden to various unsavory locations (brothel, gaming hell), dressed variously as a boy and a member of the demimonde.   Meanwhile, Eden is being courted by Devil's archnemesis, Lord Hugh Myddleton, whose father had a long-standing affair with Devil's mother.  Hugh appears angelic, but is in fact a sexual predator of young innocents, while Devil, who appears to be an immoral rake, is both less and more than he seems.     Devil is not only fighting his attraction to Eden, he is still dealing with grief over his father's death, his mother's inexplicable dislike of her children, and the nearly-bankrupt estate he inherited.  Meanwhile, through his emotional connection to Eden, he is able to learn the true motivations for her desire to become a nun.  Although there are some curious and unresolved loose ends (as in how Devil's younger brothers appear to have more than enough money when the estate is bankrupt and no mention is made of any enterprises of their own), the book is an engrossing read, greatly enlivened by Cousin Reggie.   In fact, my only major caveat is that I wish Ms. George had not "resolved" Reggie by book's end.  He was one of the best secondary characters in a romance novel I have read in recent years.  How often do we see a flamboyantly homosexual character who is not riven with angst and self-contempt?  He was something like Jack in Will and Grace, but with a twist  I won't spoil the surprise for you! I would have enjoyed seeing him and his romantic troubles in the subsequent books in the series, perhaps ending with a fourth book just about him. Well, maybe Ms. George can kill off Reggie's love and start the cycle again!  We live in hope 
 Wai-Lim Yip sets the standard for the study of Chinese poetry by printing the original text side by side with both a word-for-word translation and an extended interpretation of the same for over 150 poems spanning all genres of Chinese poetry. By far, this book provides the most accessible versions of each poem. What it may lack in comprehensive representation, it more than makes up for in quality and packaging. While its translations do not fully become English poems, as critics have often said, the author does provide the reader with a most direct access to the binary data of the originals. As such, he expects the reader to work a little to put the poem to use. This book will interest a writer, especially one interested in translation and sources for new work, more than a scholar expecting brilliant English renditions of these classic poems.  Bottom line, there should be more books of Eastern poetry in "translation" in this form: original text in original characters, a word-for-word bare bones rendition, and then the translator's extrapolation of those bones. A fantastic learning tool for any writer 
 This book is filled with useful information about reading gestures and body- language.  It also contains diagrams showing various postures and how to read them.  Among the wise words on the subject it collects are:  "Watch out for the man whose stomach doesn't move when he laughs." Cantonese proverb "The eyes of men converse as much as their tongues,with the advantage that the ocular diet needs no dictionary,but is understood the world over. Ralph Waldo Emerson.  It does at time evidence  banality." A husband slamming a door and turning his back on his wife is heralding a significant message"  But to be fair I will cite a typically instructive  passage from the book. " With few exceptions, most of us dislike having anyone point his finger at us. We dislike it even more when we are jabbed  like a dummy in bayonet practice,and asked " You get what I mean?" In heated arguments it is very common to see people using their fingers against each other almost as epees in a fencing match.Some people use their eyeglasses as an extension of their index-finger, pointing them in a gesture of reprimand or admonishment ,or for emphasis. Since people in a quandary do not cooperate as those who are relaxed and comfortable,it behooves us not to point our index finger at anyone lest he become hostile at us or "turn off"...You can communicate effectively and not use this gesture which antagonizes others"  Ideally , then a reading of this book may help us improve our communication with and cooperative action with others.  
 This book is a great read. The authors have clearly taken their own advice in writing the Hamster Revolution. They have packed their story full of great practical tips and advice and presented it in an entertaining, engaging and very efficient narrative.   Take this book with you on your next commute or plane trip - it will be the most productive ride you have had in a long time 
 Just commenting on the sun-salute --   Sara Ivanhoe does a great job. She does more of a modified sun-salutation, but fine. I think she enriches it.  She models it for you, and you follow her. My only pet-peeve, is that she doesn't explain, at all, what it is. If it were more clear, perhaps it would be more meaningful.   The book, Yoga for Dummies, by the way, is great. They explain, that the sun-salutation is a 'dynamic posture,' meaning, as I understand it, a series of moving stretches, like, a flowing stretch routine.   Flowing stretch routines are really good if you want to build strength and flexibility. The Sun Salutation really helps me with that. This workout is really good for your spine and lungs.   Back to the yoga book, (bear with me here) we benefit from the sun's life-giving powers. (Like, no sun, no life) Feuerstein and Payne say remember that your body is condensed sunlight! So, from a spiritual viewpoint, the light in you (your spirit) salutes its own provider, the sun itself.   As far as the ''workout'' goes, it is 5 min. of warm-up, that she flows into the sun-salute. She presents the sun salute, adding the components, piece by piece. It is about 15 min of more strenuous reps. She does about 10 minutes of cool-down, including spine-twist seated-stretches (you have to see it).   Great video. I do use it all the time. It is applicable to all levels. For a beginner, this is a total workout. For the expert, it is an interesting variation of a very established set of postures. 
 I bought 4 pounds of this jerky about 2 weeks age. I took 1 bag to a friends house and left it there. He is a real picky eater. When I came back the next day the bag was almost gone! He ate about the whole thing. I love the taste as well. The meat is from grass fed beef so there is very little fat content.My friend aasked me to order him some more. I will 
 Tuesdays with Morrie was a fantastic account of an elderly man and his views on different parts of life.  It made me think of things I hadn't thought of before and it really inspired me to rethink how I spend my time and who I do or do not spend it with.  It made me grateful of my family and of my closest friends and it greatly taught me how important it is to be at peace with everyone and love every chance I get.  Morrie made death seem less scary and made it seem like a natural process, not sad and devastating.  
 I bought this cd because I heard the song If You Leave on the radio. And guess what? The cds surprised me because its so good. I love 80's music, especially new wave 80's songs, so this cd was definatly worth it. The music is amusing at times, and you can definatly tell that its from the 80's. The instruments are very beautiful, and its more outdone with the instruments and doesn't just focus on the song mostly, like a lot of music does now. Either way, I really liked the cd. -^_________^- I hope my random rambling review is helpful to some people. If not, sorry, I'm not good at this. -_- 
 I'm working on an evangelism project at work, so I've started making a dent in the stack of books I have on my desk.  Out of the Salt Shaker was a refreshing read - well written and engaging.  The stories are, by far, the most influential part of the book.  I agree with another review that said Pippert makes it sound so easy, with people just pouring out their hearts to her.  However, it is encouraging that there are situations when that happens.  I'm sure she has a multitude of stories about her attempts at evangelism not working.  She does include a few of these throughout the book, which gives a more complete perspective.  My only complaint about the book was that sometimes it was a bit redundant.  I might have only noticed that because I'm outlining it for my project, and would find myself typing some of the same things over and over again.  For those just reading the book as a tool to help them with evangelism, it is probably good to have that repetitive nature to burn the ideas into your brain.  I think Pippert's ideas for evangelism are easy to understand and encouraging.  The book made me want to seek answers to questions I have with my own faith, in order to better equip myself to spread the gospel.  Best evangelism book I've read as of yet. 
 I found this book to be an eye opener as to what gets the insulin up.  My family has a history of Diabeities, so it's a looming concern for me.  And talk about a surprise, when here I thought I was eatting good foods like  Tuna, to find out that if it says Broth for the ingredients and not water  to beware.  It made my shopping trip a little longer, but more aware of how  little our foods are regulated.  A good book to have around even if your  not interested in losing weight, but just want to eat healthy 
 Carl Richard writes that the college-educated colonists received a heavy dose of the Greek and Roman classics.  This classical education would make it easy for them to assimilate into their own character the virtues embodied in Cato the Younger.  Many of these men, such as Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Patrick Henry, Nathan Hale, and others, would quote from the play in many of their writings and speeches.  Richard asserts that in the years leading up to the American Revolution, and especially after the Stamp Act crisis in 1765, the play "Cato" served as the epitome of resistance to tyrannical British rule for many colonists.    It is indicative of the Age of Enlightenment, which educated leaders such as America's Founding Fathers, to select their models of heroic virtue from Greco-Roman history instead of from the Bible.  Plays, such as Addison's "Cato" social and philosophical message was clear to any Enlightenment audience because it was Roman moral virtues and not Christian morality that Enlightenment audiences most embraced.  Cato's self-reliance caused his actions; not his reliance on God.  This notion of men acting outside the sphere of religious bonds was an important lesson that was certainly not lost on our Founders, especially since many of them were such devoted disciples to Enlightenment ideals.  In fact, one could stipulate that "Cato" is part of a genre of plays that replaced the Christian morality plays that had been so popular for centuries in Europe.   	The revolutionary generation immersed themselves in the classics, which enabled them to be on the look out for examples of distant tyrannical rule.  The Founding Fathers believed that in order for a new nation to survive as a republic, they would need to remake men in the mold of Cato as portrayed in Addison's play, and as other heroic men found in "Plutarch's Lives."  Cato was first and foremost a patriot.  He would not have sullied himself by becoming embroiled in party politics.  Thus, the Founders learned from his example and understood that they too had to be especially diligent in guarding against men forming political factions and the misuse of political power for their own self-interest.  This is why Founders, such as Thomas Jefferson, placed such high hopes for raising a virtuous body of citizens through education, which became one of his motivating factors for founding the University of Virginia.  Aside from Addison's flowery prose and powerful imagery on stage, "Cato's" most important and enduring role in the American colonies was its political message; fighting to the death, if necessary, for freedom from tyranny.     I read this book for a graduate Humanities class.  Recommended for people interested in literature, history, philosophy, and the founding of America. 
 Kristine has provided an outstanding review of the BUSINESS issues being  faced by large & small AEC firms, and has given readers a road map for  using technology to achieve business success. This book will be invaluable  for any company owner, engineering manager, or IT manager, struggling with  WHAT, WHY, and HOW to use technology to not only stay alive as a business,  but as a competitive edge. Kristine has organized her book in 3 sections:  Chapters 1-4 answer the question "WHY implement technology in my  company." These chapters cover how the information revolution is  affecting AEC globally, how the power of technology is more in its  COMMUNICATION value than its computational value, and a GREAT section  called the AUTOMATING BENEFITS CONTINUUM. Chapters 5-10 provide guidelines  on WHAT and HOW to implement technology along a sliding scale....from  "cost containment" to "competitive positioning". These  chapters provide the core benefit. Chapters 9 and 10 are an easy read  regarding the history & future outlook of technology in AEC. In  summary, a great guidebook for anybody running any part of an AEC business 
 I haven't read this cover to cover yet, but it did arrive in perfect condition.  What I have started to read is definately Dr. Phil's no nonsence approach to weight issues and anything else in life 
 As someone with no background in this type of material, I was curious surrounding some of hype of the "Da Vinci code" so I picked up this tome. After a difficult start due to my lack of knowledge in this field of studies. I read slowly then avidly and gained so much from this very learned man. It is a balanced book it that does not have any agenda only that it speaks the truth. Now as for the level of writing these types of books do go beyond the college-lite education that is so common today. The style is lucid and clear and with an excellent usage of vocabulary.  
 My 3 year old son loves this book!  It is the perfect book for winding down when he is not quite ready to settle in.  It's soft, soothing tone makes it a perfect book to end our day 
 I am writing this review because I am very disturbed by the review from the reader called "0000 teecee0000" and his/her serious lack of basic history knowledge.   First, Iris Chang is a Chinese American who was born and educated in the U.S. This book was written and published only in U.S. So it's ridiculous to call her as "a victim of forced censorship and a pawn of the Communist propaganda machine". Is U.S. a communist country?   Second, communist government had not come to power when Nanking massacre happened. The Chinese government at that time fought and failed to defend Nanking, which was how the massacre happened. Many European countries fought and failed to stop Nazi Germany's invasion during WWII. Was that because the government "allowed this to happen"?  If "0000 teecee0000' had a bit knowledge about what happened in the "pearl harbor" (which I highly doubt), he/she would understand this book and history better.   After the publishing of this book, Iris Chang received numerous death threats and harassments from right-wing Japanese who still worship Japanese war criminals and regard them as "national heroes". As a result, she committed suicide in her car. (Google for details).   I am not saying Iris Chang is 100% accurate. But denying Nanking massacre would like denying Hitler's atrocities.  Like it or not, history is history. 
 Another of Sidney Sheldon's fast paced books with a beautiful heroine that exacts revenge on her enemies, travels the world, becomes a jewel thiefs, gets in/out of tight spots and falls in love!  He's a master at this the type of writing and undoubtedly the best the 80's had to offer in the genre of the ever tough Romance/Heroine/Racy/Revenge Formula Novel.  A great read 
 As an educator with more than 15 years experience in the field and I have found this book to be one of the most effective and comprehensive tools for not only educators but for parents as well! The authors share their first hand knowledge, they have been there for the challenges and have sought out ways to help each child reach their potential. They then present what they have learned and guide us, the reader, through the difficulties in identifying and understanding a child with challenging behaviors. The clear day to day strategies will greatly help you and your child create and environment where success is possible! 
 In 1984, just as Hair Metal finally overtook the New Wave of British Heavy Metal as the most popular form of Metal music in the U.S., Slayer finally decided to put their NWOBHM roots to rest and put out a three-song EP demonstrating the band that they finally became: an extreme thrash metal band. It was with this EP that they finally found their own identity as a band and found fans that didn't just see them to hold off seeing the next big British metal band come through.   This EP is very short, but sweet. Both Chemical Warfare and Captor of Sin are still live staples and amazing thrash material in their own right, and Haunting the Chapel is among Slayer's most underrated tunes, even though it doesn't hold up as well as the previous two tracks. The extra song on here, Aggressive Perfector (taken from Metal Massacre Vol.3) is Slayer's very first song, and is reason alone to grab this EP (even though it sounds like it's ripping off Metallica's Hit The Lights).  This EP is kind of hard to find; you may have to look in a second hand CD-shop or buy it online. Nevertheless, this is highly recommended for all Slayer fans! 
 I finished Kaplan's Ends of the Earth today.  I liked the book.  Kaplan has consistently been one of my favorite authors (Atlantic Monthly) His theme is consistent: many nation states are not really nation states.  I felt that his comments about Iran were especially poignant, given how some view Iran as part of the "Axis of Evil".  I get the sense that when this book was written, Kaplan had great hope for the future  of Iran as they struggle with theocracy.  Ecocide, or the killing of natural resources is a new topic for me that Kaplan introduces.  According to Kaplan, many developing nations have traded immediate benefits for the long term health of their natural resources.  His observations are very very interesting, especially his observations from the  post-Soviet nations like Uzbekistan.  Kaplan is a bold, imaginative and thoughtful writer, he is not merely another journalist or another travel writer. His message, right or wrong, is sincere and based on his own personal observations. I highly recommend this work for anyone interested on new perspectives in current affairs.  
 For a true Christian Spirit that glows through Ms. Winans, you'll always find her music sung straight from the heart. A Precious Pearl in the Gospel community, "Purified" continues in the CeCe tradition, of lifting our souls to a higher plain 
 Bowman presents good information which is not easily found in the Brethren History Books.  However, when charting the demise of the Brethren Movement, he identifies the loss of peculiarness as the reason the group lost its influence.  While he documents the increase of bureaucratic baggage to the denomination and the abandonment of the original simplicity of the group, he does not see this as causal in the group loosing its original impact.  He does not hedge or create heros as other Brethren history works tend to do, which is a definite value to this work 
 This book from 1977 begins the saga of Henrietta, the 6-foot-tall, 266 lb. chicken, a story that continues in ~Looking for Bobowicz~ (2004) and ~The Artsy-Smartsy Club~ (2005).  This is a funny story about a boy and his amiable chicken, though the part about Anthony DePalma, the shady chicken hunter, goes on too long, in my opinion.  As usual, the dialogue is a highlight.  Threats, misunderstandings, mad scientists and town parades -- just what you expect from Daniel Pinkwater.  
 I will be writing a review on the legendary album entitled "KEEP THE FAITH" by one of Rock's greatest bands and one of America's most favorite sons. I give you one of New Jersey's pride and joy's, the one and only, BON JOVI. "KEEP THE FAITH" was originally released in 1992 on Compact Disc on the Mercury Records label in association with PolyGram Records. As always, if I hear any new additional information concerning this legendary album or the artist, I will edit this review immediately so that you the consumer will get the best informative and most accurate review possible.  Going into the new decade of the 1990's, BON JOVI would still be enjoying the fruits and excesses to its fullest that the good life has to offer as a result of their increasing popularity which would now be compared with another legendary fellow New Jersey native icon, The Boss himself, MR. BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN. BON JOVI would now be taken seriously as a legitimate Rock n' Roll force to be reckened with which elevated the legend of this band further on top of the world. With all of this in mind, BON JOVI were better than ever which continued burning on fire with every album they recorded and were now a big concert draw attraction everywhere they went. Their fan base just kept growing while more women continued flocking to their concerts more than ever from everywhere around the globe just to get a glipse of them. With the huge and enormous success of their legendary party albums "SLIPPERY WHEN WET" from 1986 and the album which bares the name of the band's own home state "NEW JERSEY" from 1988, everything BON JOVI touched turned into gold. But despite all of the huge successes of their albums and their escalating fame and fortune, BON JOVI still would not rest on their fame and fortune alone or their laurels. At the same time, BON JOVI was going through some changes called life. BON JOVI were now showing starting signs of maturity with age and were now gradually growing out of their party stage. These new changes in the band would forever change and affect their music as musicians and songwriters in a more positive way. It was now time for BON JOVI, or should I say lead singer and frontman Jon Bon Jovi, lead and rhythm guitarist Richie Sambora, bassist Alec John Such, keyboardist David Bryan and drummer Tico "The Hit Man" Torres to head back into the recording studio and record the new follow-up album to the extremely successful "NEW JERSEY" album. Again, the usual questions would now arise on everyone's mind, can BON JOVI do it again and top the "NEW JERSEY" album? The whole world would soon get their answer. BON JOVI would record, complete and hand in to Mercury Records, a new album that would describe the band's new personality and begin a whole new era for BON JOVI, "KEEP THE FAITH." In my opinion, "KEEP THE FAITH" ranks with their best albums to date. "KEEP THE FAITH" is also a more serious down to earth album with powerful lyrics not heard before on their prior albums.  "KEEP THE FAITH" has a far better mature Rock n' Roll sound which is being supported with superior lyrics. In my opinion, "KEEP THE FAITH" is a message for the whole world which is easy to figure out. BON JOVI still has their own special blend sound fully in tact and it shows when you hear the Rockers such as the powerful "I Believe," the realistic "Keep The Faith," the anthem of the 90's "I'll Sleep When I'm Dead," "In These Arms," the rockin' "If I Was Your Mother," the ten minute ballad turned Rocker "Dry County," the vintage BON JOVI Rocker "Woman In Love," the haunting Rocker "Fear," the passionate soulful Rocker "Blame It On The Love Of Rock & Roll" and the heartfelt Rocker "Little Bit Of Soul." Believe me when I say that Richie Sambora just tears these Rockers up with his masterful well skilled guitar playing. Richie really kicks a*s in more ways than one.  BON JOVI would also record two slow beautiful Rock ballads which would show a more humbler side of the band. In my opinion, the legendary "Bed Of Roses" and "I Want You" are among the band's best ever slow ballads. Jon Bon Jovi sings all of these Rockers with a more mature polished sound never heard or felt on the previous albums. On top of that, the powerful lyrics just adds more life to their songs which solidifies the power and energy of the whole album.  I would like to highly recommend buying this legendary album for everyone to own as a valuable and important part of their own personal music collection. This incredible album will definitely stand the test of time and will always be around to be enjoyed, appreciated and cherished for many years to come, NOW AND FOREVER.  In closing, despite the huge success of "KEEP THE FAITH," the BON JOVI legend still does not even come close to ending here. In reality, it is still only the beginning. BON JOVI'S place in Rock n' Roll history is now well secured and will never be forgotten. Now considered legitimate icons, BON JOVI would move on to better green pastures and record more great albums than ever before. With this in mind, there would still be more tales and stories in the BON JOVI legend that would still need to be conquered, told and written in new pages and chapters in their storied career. But that, my fellow readers and reviewers, you will have to stay tuned and read about at a later date. So here's to you Jon, Richie, David, Tico and Alec. I hope this review did you more justice and added more to your legend. And as the saying goes, "AND THE REST IS ROCK N' ROLL HISTORY," am I wrong? Thanks for reading my review and I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it for your reading pleasure. I also hope that you will read all of my other reviews in the near future when time permits. BON JOVI RULES. Long Live Rock n' Roll. Rock out always and take it easy. Forever In Rock, John L.  
 I have to confess: this version of 10th Ave. Freeze-Out brought tears to my eyes. And for one simple reason. I never saw a concert of The Boss and his E-Street Band. They never came to Brazil to play. "Oh, they are too americans" people say here. Oh, what a shame. Music is an universal language and, listening to Bruce's live albums (I have all the four) and watching his dance with The Big Man Clarence Clemmons, the raising of hands of all the little preeties from coastline to the city, I was really able to understand the meaning of lots of things like companionship, musicianship, harmony, communion. Well, I wish I was a Jersey native to walk down the 10th Ave just to see Scooter and Big Man singing and dancing in the streets. Rock and roll are made of these moments. 
 I will not recount the story; the other reviewers do it, and for my money, the story is marvelous.  Like so many, I did not want this book to end, and rationed reading it for that reason.  I cannot think of any other writer I have ever read who can capture in concrete, substantial, palpable images abstractions like jazz, or pain, or love, or wistfulness.  The visuals her words sculpt are staggering. Hardly essential to an appreciation of this magnificent work, if you have lived in Hawaii, ever had an appreciation of either or both of its indigenous and diverse cultures, been entranced by music, felt the power and mystery of natural things, it will resonate with you on innumerable levels.  You will learn a fair amount of Hawaiian along the way if you care to, and you should, as it is a beautiful and evocative and incredibly musical language.  The book is more than poetry--it is, in many ways, a great mele.  It speaks of essences, of life's value, its challenges, its losses, its pain.  There are parts as profound and compact in that as any philosophy one could want (the small chapterlet recounting Malia's last visit with Pono may be the best piece of writing in that regard I have ever read).  The political material through the book is, if you read closely, not polemical, but balanced if with a clear but hardly simplistic preference.  And on a societal level, it is a magnificent paean to the power of women, especially their power over men, wanted or not, and the consequences, marvelous and horrific, of that power.  If you are a woman, or you truly love them as I do, you will hold this book fiercely to your heart. Those who say Ms. Davenport embraced too much in too complex a way--with which I totally disagree--would probably say the same of Thomas Wolfe, whose prose at times hers resembles, several of whose works I number among my favorites in the language.  I would rate this book higher than any I have reviewed on Amazon to date, and among the best novels I have ever read--and I have read thousands 
 This is a must read. Can't wait to get a copy of the new edition. Yes, some books are hard to come by. Walter Bowart knows how to write. You don't know anything until you read this book 
 This book is a fascinating account of the relationships between the European liberal movement and Islam and how this is changing and affecting the political life of England and also Western Europe. As an american it help us to understand why our views and position about Middle East problems are often so different with Europe. It also help us to understand the fragility of the State of Israel and many of the powerful forces aim at destroying it.  The book as the title suggest is mainly related to England but touches also into other European countries. The author has done a very extensive research and she has done a good work in problem analysis of the major dilemma that we will face in this century.  Independent of our own political position this book describes a reality that we can not ignored and we are gradually start to see it in the USA 
 If you are browsing the reviews you are probably asking yourself if you should buy this book.  Yes. Immediately. Just click on that "Add To Shopping Cart" button before you even continue with this review.  I have heard many people mention this as their favorite of King book, and having read all of his work I would have to add my vote. No small thing, considering all of the great books he has penned.  The chilling second tale, APT PUPIL is well-worth the price of admission, but you also get the sentimental favorite, RITA HAYWORTH AND THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, and the book's centerpiece, THE BODY.  THE BODY is a beautiful evocation of that moment in late childhood when you finally realize the stakes of life. In the intro to the story, King laments that important secret moments lose their sentimental power when shared. I couldn't disagree more. He relates them so perfectly 
 One of my family members is narcissist. This book explained why I sufferred so much from this person. 
 When Dawn baby sits for the Baretts', Dawn thinks baby sitting there is easy. First, The Barett House was dirty so they had to clean it. Second, Kristy hates Dawn of being a BSC Member. Kristy is jealous of Dawn because Mary Anne spends more time with her old friend, Kristy than her new friend, Dawn 
 First, I should say that Jeremiah Eck is my favorite architect.  If I ever build a house (which is hard, because I live in Boston where there are essentially no lots), I'll probably use him as an architect. So I should love this book, and I mostly do. Ideally, I'd like an architecture book to:  1) have lots of great pictures and floor plans of wonderful houses 2) have interesting ideas to convey 3) have good prose to read  I'd say this book scores very well on the first two points, and less so on the third.  The photography is excellent, with lots of great houses.  Mr. Eck is trying to convey some important ideas about the exterior of a house. Ideally, he things the exterior of a house should have a style that follows from other elements of the design, rather than being superficial decoration.  So on the strength of those reasons alone, you should buy it.  But for some reason I find his prose hard going. I can't quite put my finger on what bothers me, but it doesn't pull you forward.  I found this to be true of his first book, "The Distinctive Home" as well.  I'm very pleased I read it anyway 
   The Lost World is probably, no the best sequal I have ever read.  It's not as good as the first dinosaur-eat-human adventure Jurassic Park, but nevertheless, this is a great book.  The movie as I said in my Jurassic Park reveiw is a cheap imatation.  I mean really cheap.  In the book there are different dinosaurs, Eddie Carr was young, Sarah Harding's no paleontologist, there's no big team that goes to Isla Sorna, there's no Nick Van Owen (Thank God!) in stead there is Doc Thorne(He's cool), there's no Peter Ludlow, instead there is Lewis Dodgeson, and the T-Rex never goes to the mainland.  Don't waist two hours of your life watching the movie.  Waist fifteen hours of your life reading the book 
 Hello all, today i went out and i put my book 'The coming collapse of the dollar: How to profit from it' by John Rubino and James Turk, in top of my car, i went out and i lost that book.  So i went to the bookstore right away, because investing in GOLD is a *must* !! Here are the bad news folks: The dollar and most money substitutes out there will collapse.  Only gold and other hard assets will survive and grow.  So if you want to have some food in the coming crisis, buy this book !! It's a question of life or death ! 
 james Quinn has written the Bible of race conditions.  Quinn de-mystifies race conditions and melds conditions into class considerations.  He has a separate section for each condtion: Maiden Special Weights, Maiden Claimers, Alw NW1X, NW2X, etc, claiming races -- Stakes etc.  Quinn devotes an entire section on 3-year old races.  After reading and absorbing this book, the handicapper is able to "throw out" non-contenders at nearly a glance -- leaving only the horses that can win today.  Quinn has made me a knowledgable handicapper who knows exactly why the horse I am betting on today should win.        I refer to Quinn's Condition Book often -- I recommend it to all handicappers who want to improve their win percentage, make more money, and of course, have more fun   10 stars for this one 
 I ordered this book last week and I read it in one sitting.  I have a dozen other home management books and I was very pleased to find some new ideas in this book.  I'm not an overly religious person so I had some  doubts about how much I'd get out of the book but I was very pleased with  the suggestions.  Some of the organizational strategies for meal planning  are excellent and I'm using them now.  They're very helpful.  This book is  the second most useful book on home mangement I've read.  I do prefer Kathy  Peel's Home Manager based on the sheer number of valuable management tips,  like the hit list.  Overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to  be more organized.  It's an easy read and it's saved me a few hours  already 
 I was surprised at how much I liked this book. Most language books cover the basic, standard vocabulary in a set format. This one covers colloquial vocabulary that children learn, so you hear the endearments that parents use with their children and how roosters crow and the words for 'see-saw' and common phrases like 'Time to wake up!'. I can see myself using some of these phrases as ice-breakers in informal chats in my travels. Delightful!  I'll be looking for other works by these authors as they become available 
 I will go out on a limb here and declare this movie the most heartbreakingly beautiful film I ever saw. I went to see it when it came out, and it continued to haunt me until I obtained my first VCR, whereupon it was one of the first movies I purchased. The story is told pretty much visually, and it is such an old story that the viewer doesn't need any more dialog than there is. One reviewer addressed the issue of Linda Manz's New York accent when the trio of protagonists is supposed to be from Chicago; but after multiple viewings, it became clear to me that these guys have been nomads since day one, so it's quite plausible to me that they, in fact, did come from New York originally (Richard Gere also has a decided Noo Yawk sound) and in the way of migrant workers, had only recently called Chicago home. The opening of the movie - old turn-of-the-century stills - is rife with the melting-pot faces that, mostly, started out in New York and went where the work was.  When I need an example of absolute perfection - my opinion - in cinematography, this is the film I would always choose. So many isolated shots come to mind - a wine glass sitting on a riverbed underwater with a fish swimming by; five guys, conversing quietly in another language as they walk, bundled against winter; the panic of animals in a brushfire, a burning tractor coming out of a fire at night like a machine from hell - as well as spooky, ghostly sights of people around a campfire at night on a rivershore; faces that you would not normally consider beautiful taking on a luminous quality because of the talent of the filming. The story almost takes a back seat to the filmwork, although it is nearly a Greek tragedy; Bill, Linda, and Abby, migrant workers scraping to survive and stay together (Bill and Linda are sister and brother; Abby is Bill's lover) escape a situation in Chicago (Bill has inadvertently killed a bullheaded boss) by jumping a train loaded down with immigrants and ride to the wheatfields of the Texas Panhandle, where they become just three more harvesters until the owner, played with a sweet vulnerability by Sam Shepard, catches sight of Abby in the field and falls in love with her. Bill sees this in his unfocused mind as a way for his little group to advance, after he overhears a conversation between Shepard and a doctor which suggests that the young landowner is dying. Bill persuades Abby to accept the owner's offer of marriage - which, to her credit, she seems initially reluctant to do - reasoning that she can make the guy happy for the little time he has left and then the fortune he has will be all theirs. His plan hits a snag over three things; a suspicious foreman, who loves the landowner like a son and distrusts the trio of migrants right now; the landowner seems to hit his second wind after marrying Abby; and, the biggest bad thing, Abby falls in love with her new husband. Left out frustrated in the cold, suffering unending animosity from the foreman, Bill does the only intelligent thing he can think of and leaves, only to return some time later. From there things go very badly.  This movie gives a real flavour of what the early 1900s must have been like - the serendipity of a travelling circus, apparently out of gas, who land on the owner's property and give performances in exchange for room and board (and probably gas)- these things happened then, impromptu little entertainments that seemed to have little relevance to the surroundings but which were eagerly looked for - diversions were few and far between, folks - and at one point, the newformed family group runs to meet and wave at Woodrow Wilson's passing train. The ordinary people doing the harvesting, though only touched on, are clear and real; you've seen these people in town, working, playing, fighting. And the pathos of the underclass comes out in something Linda Manz's character says halfway through in a voiceover: "You're only here once, and you should have it nice."  This movie is tragic and beautiful, with good performances, especially from Linda Manz as the hapless younger sister who is at the mercy of circumstances she is powerless to control, and who learns the cruel lesson so many like her had to learn in those days; how to survive on your own. Ms. Manz pretty much disappeared from film after that and returned to private life. Too bad - she was a breath of fresh air in a lot of ways. In fact, the only people who really advanced filmwise after this were Richard Gere and Sam Shepard - although Gere isn't as good yet as he could be (again, my opinion) and Sam Shepard is underused or too preoccupied with his writing. I highly recommend this movie to cinematography aficianados and to anyone who likes a good period piece told with great sensitivity and minimal dialog.   
 This book begins with a colorful and exoticized portrayal of a family living in Salud, a small town in Puerto Rico.  The story is a telenovela, filled with bright colors, beautiful people, undying love between the wrong people.  However, we find out that the narrator is, in fact, a niece to the first main character, Guzman.  Her story is far less interesting and motivating than hers and the second half of the novel- her coming of age- is so similar to Nicholasa Mohr's Nilda and Esmeralda Santiago's When I Was Puerto Rican, that it is a disappointing denoument to the novel 
 Personally, I can't stand this CD. But my five year old loves it.  He absolutely adores it and wants it on all the time.  It really calms him down.  the narrator's voice is very calm and soothing and the songs are simple, quiet and peaceful.  If you have a kid with ADD, or who gets too worked up with other music or television programming, then I recommend this CD. Your child will be more relaxed, focused and in a generally better disposition.  Try it before you resort to something more drastic, like Ritalin 
 This is a great book that takes us from Representative Brown's first election victory in 1992 that also gave us the first Dem. Prez in 12 years. After the Republicans Contract with America takeover of Congress, Brown  gives a detailed account of Speaker Newt's agenda and the many mistakes he  made. Brown does all of this in a very short 300 or so pages and I couldn't  put the book down. I read the whole thing in just a few nights of before  bed reading 
 This book is fantastic. Just enough fantasy. Best thing is, the story of these kids' lives would be just as great without the fantasy, but adding it in just made it better. Absolutely one of the best S.K. books i've ever read, and i've read them all. The movie just doesn't do the book justice at all. 
 I really can't add any more than what has already been written about the classic 400 Degreez. My children love it dearly, along with several other Juvenile albums and videos. So let me just add this information I learned about Juvenile's music. By the way, his excellent earlier albums and first video should have received more awards but had not reached full popularity yet like his later albums:   CANADIAN RECORDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION (CRIA) -Triple Platinum Award for Singable Songs For the Very Young  -Double Platinum Award for More Singable Songs  -Double Platinum Award for Baby Beluga  -Platinum Award for The Corner Grocery Store  -Platinum Award for Rise and Shine  -Platinum Award for Juvenile's Christmas Album  -Gold Award for One Light, One Sun  -Gold Award for Everything Grows   RECORDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA (RIAA) -Platinum Award for Baby Beluga  -Gold Award for Singable Songs For the Very Young  -Gold Award for More Singable Songs  -Gold Award for Juvenile's Christmas Album  -Gold Award for Rise and Shine -Gold Award for Everything Grows  RECORDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA (RIAA) CERTIFIED QUINTUPLE PLATINUM AWARDS -A Young Children's Concert With Juvenile video, 1990  -Juvenile In Concert With The Rise And Shine Band video, 1990  SPECIAL AWARDS -The Order of Canada, 1983  -The Order of British Columbia, 2001  -Early Childhood News, Directors' Choice Award (The Singable Songs Collection), 1998  -Global 500 Award, U.N.E.P.,1994  -Earth Communications Office, 1993 United Nations Environmental Achievement Award, 1992  -Bowling Proprietors Association of America, 1989  -Canadian Institute of the Arts for Young Audiences (AYA Award), 1988  -Numerous Parent's Choice and American Library Association Notable Recording Awards  NOTABLE NOMINATIONS -Juno Nomination, Best Children's Album (Juvenile Radio), 1995  -Grammy Nomination, Best Recording for Children (Bananaphone), 1994  -Nominated for Environmental Media Award (Evergreen Everblue music video), 1991  -Grammy Nomination, Best Recording for Children (Juvenile In Concert With The Rise And Shine Band), 1988  -Grammy Nomination, Best Recording for Children (Everything Grows), 1987  VIDEO AWARDS -American Lung Association, Blue Sky Award (Evergreen Everblue), 1992  -Gemini Award, Best Children's Program or Series (Juvenile In Concert With The Rise And Shine Band), 1990  -Action for Children's Television (ACT) Award for Excellence in Children's Programming (Juvenile In Concert With The Rise And Shine Band), 1989  RECORD INDUSTRY AWARDS -SOCAN, Special Achievement Award for contribution to Canada's Musical Heritage, 2000  -Juno Award, Best Children's Album (Bananaphone), 1994  -National Association of Record Merchandisers (NARM) Best Seller Awards, 1986 and 1987  -The Walt Grealis Special Achievement Award presented by the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (CARAS), 1990   BOOK AWARDS -ABA-CBC Joint Committee/Children's Books Mean Business (The Juvenile Singable Songbook and Shake My Sillies Out)  -American Bookseller/"Pick of the Lists" Award (Down By The Bay, The Juvenile Singable Songbook, The Second Juvenile Songbook, and Shake My Sillies Out)  -Child Study Association/Books of the Year (The Juvenile Singable Songbook, The Second Juvenile Songbook, and Shake My Sillies Out)  -International Reading Association, Children's Book Council, "Children's Choice" (Five Little Ducks)  -Reading Rainbow Review Book (Shake My Sillies Out)  -National Conference of Christians and Jews/The Human Family Understanding Other People (Shake My Sillies Out)  -Book Of The Month Club (The Juvenile Christmas Treasury and Juvenile's Top Ten Songs to Read)   
 Few military "picture books" have given me as much unexpected pleasure as this one.  Having bought it by mail on the basis of its subject matter alone, I was very pleasantly surprised when it not only met - but exceeded - my expectations.  Lavishly (dare I say beautifully) illustrated by abundant carefully selected and wonderfully reproduced photos and charts, it exhaustively covers almost all aspects of the Canadian soldier in Northwest Europe in the final year of World War II.  The succinct text (written in homage by French authors, but adequately transcribed into English) provides a good outline against which to appreciate this visual material.  While the treatment of any individual subject may not be as deep as that found in books dediciated to a specific topic, I can confidently say that no one single volume provides as much useful information as this one does 
 I have purchased Lentek Bite Shield because it is the only product  I was able to find, that works on the same principle as european mosquito repellents I am used to. I needed it for my daughter's bedroom so I couldn't use any type of candles for the safety reasons and I didn't want to use anything that rubbs directly on the skin since she has extremely sensitive skin. Lentek Bite Shild seems to work pretty well, she got bitten only once - the night I forgot to turn it on. Now I plan to buy the adapter to plug it in the outlet. That way I would be sure that the batteries wouldn't die in the middle of the night.  
 If you asked me whether I thought I could solve my baby's poor sleep habits without using the cry-it-out method, I would have said, "Impossible!" But I followed Dr Tobin's suggestions and within three nights my eleven month old was sleeping through the night. I wish I read this book when my baby was born! I've already bought this book for all of my friends 
 This was one of those spur-of-the-moment purchases at Borders (you know, the book you buy practically unseen because your library is in need of new blood).  I really didn't know what to expect from it, since flipping through it was somewhat confusing.  I ended up buying the book on a Friday, and finishing it the following Tuesday.  It went from being a book I never heard of by an author I'm vaguely familiar with, to a book that is my "go to" book for ideas, formulas, inspiration and everything in between, and Ann Moura has earned a spot as one of my favorite metaphysical authors out there.  I, honestly, couldn't put this book down.    This book is a Grimoire in the truest sense of the word.  It contains a little bit of everything, from various rituals and spell casting techniques, to pages and pages of charts and spell associations, some of it surprisingly advanced, and a lot of it something I've never seen in any other Wiccan/Witch related book on magic.  While you don't have to read the book cover to cover, those who do are rewarded with a plethora of fascinating traditions, rituals, spells, and ideals related to green magic.  This is one of those rare books which is perfect for the beginner, but still perfect for the intermediate or advanced practitioner.  The beginner will find the first chapter, which contains information on everything from the Creed of the Green Witch, to the Sabbats, Basic Tools, and Altar Arraignment to be an invaluable tool to help them transition into working magic.  Those who've been on the path for awhile will positively wear out their chapter related to spell crafting and correspondences.  I particularly found the sections on Geomantic Characters, Planetary Squares, Planetary Seals, and Planetary Hours to be of spectacular value.    The Quick Spell Chart in Chapter 8 is positively genius...  The quick spell chart has the most common basic goals of spell crafting (Blessing, Cleansing, Fertility, Abundance, Success, Warding Evil, Releasing Negativity, etc), accompanied with categories to help you quickly set up and design a spell so as to encourage the best results.  For example, if I wanted to do a spell to increase my psychic awareness, I'd go to the Quick Spell Chart, look up "Psychic Power," and read down the columns to see what the best Moon, color, elements, days of the week, Planetary influences, numbers, Ogham, Runes, Herbs, Incense, and Stones are for the spellwork.    The spells and rituals given in this book are not your standard, run-of-the-mill spells and rituals, so this book won't be yet another book that tells you how to do the same 6 spells.  While the author is quite clear that these spells can be done "as is written," she also is quite clear that the best way to use the spells is to change and adapt them to your own needs.  And it's hard not to be inspired by what she writes.  The rituals she shared that I thought were especially beautiful were the Companion Quest and the Passing the Midhes rituals.  I can't really explain them in any way that does them justice, but both rituals utilize the use of black mirrors to contact spiritual companions and/or resolve persona conflicts and/or gain insight into past, present, and future situations.  They are unlike any other spell I've ever seen, really, and I think this book is worth it for those two spells alone.  The section that I found surprisingly wonderful were the meditations section.  I'm not a big meditator, but I really connected with the suggested meditations that the author shared.  I thought they were creative, interesting, easy to apply, and I have found that the results are beyond my wildest dreams...  Or should I say meditations?  I think some people may find the layout of this book confusing (especially people who are new to the craft), which means that you're probably better off buying this book along with another of the books by this same author if you're new to the path.   Though, it should be said I haven't received any other books by this author yet, but I did get the definite impression she was building upon ideas, principles, and concepts she worked with and introduced in other books, which would have probably prevented some of my confusion.  I'd imagine this book along with her other series would be an unbeatable reference.  It should be said that this is certainly not a Wicca 101 book (it should be said this isn't even a book about Wicca, it's a book about Witchcraft that can be used Pagans, Witches, and Wiccans), so if you're unclear of any aspect on magic practice, this should not be the first or only book you get.  My only problems with the book was that I was a little disappointed with the oils section, as I was kind of hoping for more in the way of oil recipes, though I bet that if I got any of her other books I'd find what I was looking for.  I also could have wished she'd included a section on ritual recipes and foodstuffs.  There were a couple of recipes, but you know that a woman who's been in the craft for 30 years, who learned from her family, has got to have some *spectacular* ritual recipes.  Again, she could have shared it in other books and I wouldn't know, but I think that this book could have used a ritual food section.  As far as I'm concerned, this book is a "must-have," if you have any of her other books or not, simply for inspirational value.  If this book doesn't make you want to run out and do ritual, nothing will! 
 This is a great story of a marriage. It's more than that though, Steel worked in their lives & careers in perfectly. It all fit. This is one of her books that also has a bit of suspense to it, which adds to its greatness. If you're looking to read a classic D. Steel book- this is a perfect one to pick up 
 Coaching Into Greatness is a must read for any coach, manager, or business owner that wants to bring out the best their clients or employees have to offer.  Kim George has redefined "abundance mentality" in a whole new way.  It is not just about a paradigm of there being enough to go around.  Rather, it is about showing up in business and in life authentically.  Through her 4-step process, we are able to recognize the behaviors and beliefs that no longer serve us so that we can make a conscious decision to show up differently and more authentically.  What I love most about this groundbreaking book is how Kim lives what she preaches.  She illustrates her own personal struggles as they relate to the illusions that held her back from living into her own greatness.  Her stories are inspirational, and her methods are practical.  Absolutely a must read for anyone who wants to improve their life 
 This is one of those great gifts to get all your cat loving friends or ones that are considering adopting a feline friend. I love when Bash suggests to ask your cat to do something rather than to tell them. It really works! An enjoyable and educational read. 
 This is an excellent book for those of us who want to go into the ministry.It truly describes the hardships that this young woman had and have to face; in Spiritual and emotional as well as the physical areas of her life. The most compelling aspect of this novel is the simplicity it is written. Joshua 1:9 comes to life in this book 
 Killers! What more can I say about this album that hasn't already been said? Nothing really, so I will just emphasize on the importance that the album had on the band and the rest of their career.   This is the first album that sparked a long lasting relationship with producer Martin Birch and the band until he retired in 1992. Who is Martin Birch you ask? Well search on the internet for him, but if you want to know how GOOD is Martin Birch, just look at the credits of all your favorite heavy metal albums, and you will see his name on the majority of them. Why? Because he is so F***ING GOOD! Now, onto the album.  Killers is certainly an evolution in Maiden's career. Long gong are the punky riffs and we can see the band emerging into what it truly is, heavy metal. Thanks to Martin Birch, the production is no longer raw, but clean. Many people may not like this, and there are still some that say that Maiden should have kept to their raw way of playing, but Maiden was becoming the band that Steve Harris wanted it to become, and therefore he needed to prove to the unbelievers that this is not just some one-hit-wonder-stay-forever-cult-band, this is METAL! And thanks to Martin, he made sure the album sounded magnificent. Unfortunately, the album did not go as high as they expected, and this is due to the fact of the previous statement that the fans had a resentment for the change in sound. On a sadder note, this is DiAnno's last time with the band, as he was forced to leave due to his "partying" attitude that the band was no longer able to cope with. On a bright note, this was the first album with Adrian Smith, who replaced Dennis Stratton due to "Musical Differences".   Although it may sound like a concept album, it is not. Sure, the main theme of "Kill(ing)" is there, but the band has stated time and time again that it isn't. But because all the songs are strangely interrelated to each other, it is hard to believe them. With that in mind, on to the songs:  1. Ides of March- Maiden's second instrumental song, this one is shorter than Transylvania. But of course, that does not mean that it is terrible. This is a very faced paced song that really gets you in the mood for the album. Sort of like an appetizer, if you will. 4/5  2. Wrathchild- Right after the last note is struck on Ides of March, Wrathchild "...comes to get you...", and that is not a bad thing. Being about a child who is searching for his lost father, Wrathchild was destined to become a classic even before it came out on this album (another previous album it came out on was a compilation album called "Metal for Muthas"). But not because of its story, but also because of fantastic wailing vocals by DiAnno and a mean bass Steve. Mix in Clive's drumming and Adrian's first solo on a Maiden recording, and you got an instant classic. 5/5  3. Murders in the Rue Morgue- Don't be fooled by the calm, acoustic beginning, because if you do, the fast paced action will swallow you whole! This track has some of the best drumming by Clive, and I think that it may be the best song on the album (although it isn't my favorite on the album). A story about a schizophrenic who is witness to his own murder, he tells us the story of running from the law. He says that he is framed for the murder, but if you examine the lyrics, he says he has "...blood on his hands..." (how did they get there?) and that his doctor says "...he's done it before...", so he could be, in fact, a schizo, not knowing of crimes his other self does. A nice little instrumental make this song easy to listen to and easy to like. 5/5  4. Another Life- WAIT! Did i just say the previous track had Clive's best drumming, now I think i have to hypocrise myself and say that this is the true song for Clive's best drumming, as he shows us what you can really do a double-bass pedal. This could be another schizoprenic song, as "...their is something inside him waiting to get away...". Plus, this is where the duo of Adrian and Davey first show us what they can really do when put together. And what do you get? An amazing instrumental passage! Plus, the ending of the song makes it made for live play. Truly a classic. 5/5  5. Genghis Khan- AH! Some more of Clive's drumming brilliantly starting off this song. This is yet another instrumental song, and it may be as good, if not better than, Transylvania. Really, just showing us, the fans, how much of an asset Adrian came to be. Truly, very, very good. 5/5  6. Innocent Exile- Once again pursuing the Killers/Schizophrenia theme, this one is about another man who is framed for murder (or is he?), and is doing time because of it. Very good bass intro by Steve, and when DiAnno comes in with his raw power, it really jumps on you. The only problem would be that (lyrically) it is too repetetive. But thankfully, the music is not. Very nice dual gutaring by Adrian and Davey. Once it gets to the musical passage, that is when it really gets heavy. Very nice solos, drumming, bass, everything! Unfortunately, DiAnno is not up to par on this one for some reason, and therefore it is not as good as the others. But thankfully for this song, the playing saves it. 4/5  7. Killers- YA! Heavy bass playing at its finest! One of the best intros in Iron Maiden's repetoire, and DiAnno's wails just make it better. I know he is not as good as a wailer as Bruce is, but i think DiAnno's voice is made for this song, and that is why this is so great. This one is about the mind of a killer, and the sick pleasure he gets when he kills his victims. What could be better than this? Why the Three Amigo's of course. Steves bass and the harmonies of Adrian and Davey make this song truly outstanding. My favorite song, and seriously, the reason you want to get this album. 5/5  8. Prodigal Son- Ah, the nice old days of listening to nice melodic tunes. This song is amazing, mostly because it shows us the other side of Maiden, the side not seen since the making of Strange World. But truly, I feel this one is better than Strange World. Some people may have questionable remarks about this one, but those people are morons. This is a beautiful song, and these kind of songs can only be written by Mr. Harris himself, and can only be played by Iron Maiden themselves. Another significant fact, this is also the turning point of the album. Gone is the sick pleasure of killing, and now it is the sake of atonement. The character here is praying to "Lamia" and wants her to forgive him and release him of all that insane things he goes through. (*To my understanding, Lamia is an African tale about a monster who eats children.* Why is the protagonist praying to this monster, I do not know.) Like I said, very beautiful music, save this one for the kids (*on second thought, don't*). 5/5  9. Purgatory- Ah Mr. Steve Harris, where do you come up with your magnificent bass playing? If you like to hear bass, listen to this song. It has some very good playing, and it may one of Steve's best (next to another song which will be discussed on The X Factor album). But hey, we also got Davey pulling off a magnificent solo here too, and we can't forget about Clive's drumming. Adrian does a very good job on the harmonies, and DiAnno is as magnificent as ever. Truly, all these elements together make for a wonderful song. Why this song got a low chart position, I do not know. 5/5  10. Twilight Zone- Hmm, I think this is perhaps the worst song of the album. No offense to those who do enjoy it, but I feel this one should have been a B-Side instead. Sure the playing is excellent, but I think DiAnno killed it so much that the musical interludes could not save it. I don' know about anyone else, but I think this one is a bit too punky. Sure, the other songs on the previous album were too, but this one is about evolution and change. After having some great metal tracks before, I think this one kills the mood. 2/5  11. Drifter- Ah, to be that ever so wandering person looking for a home. Not good huh? Well that is what this song is about. But not so much as drifting, but forgeting the past and moving towards the future (see, don't you see some connection leading up from the killing and atoning). Truly, another great song. You might not like it at first, but still, this is a very good song, with very nice and tempo changes here and there. If you can, try to find some bootlegs of this song live, because it is truly a spectacle to hear this song live. Plus, Davey is truly a spectacle to see on guitar when playing this song. 5/5  Songs to listen to: 1-3, 5-9, 11 Songs to avoid: Twilight Zone Closing Comments: Well, unfortunately Twilight Zone really brought down the rating of this album, but don't be fooled, this another must have for an Iron Maiden fan or someone just becoming one 
 I read the post-1914 material first as this is what interests me but the book was pretty easy to read, very short, thought-provoking, well-written, not journalistic or dumbed down or written with American undergraduates in mind. But I still didn't really understand the reasons for the decline of the Islamic world.   What a shame the Ottoman Empire  no longer exists. Be aware that of course Mr Lewis's ideas have been influential in forming recent US policy. He demolishes the idea that we should feel guilt about the Crusades in a few words and puts them in their not very significant place 
 Others below describe this record better than I can, leaving me simply to endorse what I believe to be the great album of the 1980s.  Indeed, Side One of "Steeltown" approaches the  masterpiece level of Who's "Quadrophenia" in its vision, musicianship, and power.  Sadly, it also has as much to say about our world today as it did the Reagan-Thatcher Era that produced it, maybe more. I never tire of it, which is how I scratched my LP, which in turn is what brought me here today 
 This book is absolutely the best I've ever read on time management. Many books on time management claim to have a method that is different than any other time management book every written, but this book is right on target. As as result of reading this book my concepts of time have been altered permanently for the better.  Incredibly effective.  I highly recommend it 
  If you are used to Levi's or the regular Wrangler jeans, here's some help in choosing a the right fit for this. This jean is the "slim" version of classic Cowboy Cut jean that Wrangler has been making since 1947. Among the Levi's jeans, the fit of this jeans is most similar to that of the Levi's 512,but it is cut slimmer in the seat. It doesn't have as much orange stitching as a Levi's, the back pockets sit higher. It has a zipper fly. The so-called "rigid denim" looks a lot like the "shrink to fit" rigid denim of the Levi's button fly 501 when new and will lose a lot of indigo dye on the first wash, but that's where the resemblance ends. The 501 shrinks about 10%, but the Wrangler shrinks less than 3%, because it is Sanforized. So, you should buy your correct size, erring on the side of slightly larger if you are right on the border.    Compared to the regular the Wrangler Cowboy Cut, the this slim Fit is quite a bit skimpier. The slim fit seat is smaller and the legs are pretty trim--it's more of a boy's cut. If you are really on the thin side, it may work for you, but many men will find it too constricting in the waist and seat.   Wranglers stonewash finishes are pretty mainstream compared to some of the more exotic things Levi's is doing now. These definitely are not so-called "destructed" jeans. You won't find whiskering or abrasion the way you will on the stonewash Levi's.   Overall, these are very solid well-made jeans that offer a nice alternative to the more popular Levi's models. Like Levi's, they are well made and indestructible.   
 My husband gave me this book for Christmas before we went to Venice and it was a great help planning our trip.  I read it at least 4 times and used it to plan our walks through the city.  If you are interested in art and architecture (why go to Venice if you are not?) this is the book to plan your days in Venice.  My husband particularly liked the fact that Mr. Links understood the importance of stopping in a cafe to savor the city on each walk 
 I was impressed with this film. I have always been a great fan of Clint Eastwood. It is true that he is getting up there in years and it saddens me. This mystery thriller keeps you guessing till the end. I pegged the murderer right off but the twists and turns made me second guess myself constantly. In the end, Clint Eastwood proves that no one can outdo him 
 I have both the original CD release and this new remixed/remastered disc.  I must say, the new mixes are absolutely fantastic. The separation/definition of the instruments and the outstanding treatment of the vocals kick this album's excitement up a notch from the original.  No, make that 3 notches. I recommend getting this release even if you already have the first run CD or the vinyl LP as these new mixes make for a far more enjoyable listing experience. 
 I always liked to draw using colored pencil. Nevertheless, I never found any interesting book that would deal with several approaches to the colored pencil medium. After reading about Mrs. Borgeson work, I decided to try and never got disapointed. Her books (all of them) give you several different  points of view about the colored pencil and teaches you (step by step) how  to apply the techiniques to solve apparently simple problems. Layering,  lifting, color interactions, error corrections, light and much more. A nice  book to have and enjoy 
 Rips' father was there for his upbringing, and yet somehow he wasn't. So when Rips discovers a dark secret behind a bureau, he begins to ask if he ever knew his father at all. I don't know if anyone else has thought to blend magical realism with memoir before, (even Garcia Marquez's bio was pretty down to earth), but that seems to be Rips' objective. Part philosophical meditation, he transform Omaha into a place where people fly, millionaires haunt abandoned buildings, and even the everyday seems strange. Definitely worth your time 
 This book is exactly what I needed to separate the good/excellent films from the bad and the ugly.  I don't watch films (primarily those on TV) without consulting it.  It has enabled me to find popular as well as little-known films that are well-made, well-acted, and well-directed.  It has saved me hours of watching films that I wish I'd never seen and reading film guides that include most of the films ever made 
 If you like metal (I'm not talking this Nu Metal I talking real metal this is a really good album if you are into Shadows Fall you will like this album.  These guys have been playing is sucessfull metal bands for years in 2000 they released a demo which was heavely distrubuted through the undergound.  This lead to this band being courted by many lables and this is the result it was definatly worth the wait 
 Seriously, listen to how good they sound & how bad the previously released reworked version is in comparison. The reviewer below me brings up a valid point about the length of the album overall compared to the price, however you would not benefit to search for a bargain priced version of the previously released aka watered down version. You have to get the originals and not even listen to the reworked version because it's not even close to how good the real album truly is. And that goes for a lot of Marley material, which is why the bootleg & rare albums are so good, as well as these original Jamican mixes 
 Absolutely fabulous family film with a heartwarming story and suprisingly good acting. Leslie Nielson was wonderful as Santa. My family loved this great Christmas movie 
 I have only known of Barbara for the last ten years and so this dvd was a revelation! How I wish I had been lucky enough to see her then - but still I am glad that the five times I have seen her on stage in London were such treasured experiences. A dvd that is a must for Barbara Cook fans 
 This is a great carry case for the Sony TX series.  I just wish it wasn't that expensive...but this is a must if have you this laptop...for protection purposes that is 
 How much for happy? hmm... about 15 dollars. Which i guess nowadays is pretty cheap for a CD. Not what youd expect from a degrassi star. Surprisingly good 
 This book is an invaluable resource for any university career services library or for any young person looking to break into the film, TV or publishing industries.  It also has a substantial section on the "business side" of the entertainment industry--the strategic planning groups and suits that orchestrate the behind-the-scenes mergers and multibillion dollar deals.  There are day-in-the-life accounts, detailed descriptions and best of all, pages and pages of resources to contact for people looking for leads.  The copy in our school career service's office was so thumbed through we had to buy more copies 
 When picking up the latest by Trevanian, a reader must bear in mind that Trevanian is a versatile author and that his latest may resemble nothing he has written before. Yet he is one of those rare authors who succeeds, no matter what genre he tries. If you read The Crazyladies of Pearl Street expecting a spy novel like Shibumi, you will be disappointed. If you are a curious reader, expecting to be stimulated and entertained, and to appreciate a good prose, then you will find what you are looking for here.  The Crazyladies of Pearl Street is an autobiographical book (sort of), which is narrated by the young Jean-Luke. The story beings with Jean-Luke, his mother and his sister Anne-Marie arriving at Pearl Street, basically a slum. His health-wise fragile, mood-wise fickle mother has received a mail from her husband asking them to join him in Albany. But we never meet the man. We learn that he is a conman, appearing for brief periods of time, enough to charm the mother and get her pregnant, then disappearing, never to be heard from again for many years. So begins the life of this small family on Pearl Street. It is actually the story of an impoverished family on welfare, hardly affording anything, feeding on what the government can spare them. But for a story of such destituteness, it is not a depressing one. Quite the contrary it is filled with nostalgia for a whole different time, when radio and going to the movies supplied the sole entertainment, when America learned to grow up with World War II, when even the soon to be criminal boys of ghetto did not swear. It is a real story that takes you to the 30s and 40s America. Yet I think the trick here isn't that those were the good old days, but that these are the childhood memories of our author. Like every other childhood memory, this one has a longing you can associate with, even though you have never listened to a radio show that did not include pop music in your life. I can only imagine that such childhood memoirs can be very boring as the subject of a novel, but this one's written by Trevanian and not even for one sentence does it lag. From the first page to the last, it is captivating. I love it when a novel can transport me to a time and place I have never been, and does it so successfully that I do not feel like a stranger for one minute, and Crazyladies of Pearl Street does just that.  For Trevanian fans, this novel is double fulfilling because it gives you an insight into the mind of this mysterious author. I thoroughly enjoyed reading his takes on radio versus television, IQ tests, religion, contemporary American politics... Some of which are in his cybernotes, not in the novel.  Highly recommended to Trevanian fans and non-fans alike 
  The Chronicles of Narnia Box Set was given both to our daughter and to our granddaughter. The review from them: FABULOUS! Enough said 
 My introduction to The Dresden Dolls came in the form of Yes, Virginia... That CD blew me away and I expected nothing less from this, their self titled release. This CD doesn't pack as hard of a punch as Virginia does but it's there, and it's as swift as can be. The lyrics aren't as controversial and comical as they are on Virginia, yet there's still room for controversy with Missed Me and Coin-Operated Boy. The one thing that is completely the same as Virginia is the fact that Amanda and Brian sound amazing playing off of each other, and Amanda's vocal adventures from song to song are fascinating to listen to.  Beginning this CD with Good Day was by far the best choice. After a slow and quiet intro Amanda churns out the eery sounding lyric "So, you don't wanna hear about my good song?" From then on this CD is just one big rollercoaster ride. Driving piano/drum combos, soft piano laced songs, mid tempo sing alongs, everything is here. But that doesn't mean everyone will love this release, and The Dresden Dolls for that matter. This band is over the top a lot of the time, and I think that's what they go for. So if you can't deal with that then don't even bother.  The Dresden Dolls (CD, not the band) is an achievement upon itself. In this age, when I thought everything has been done musically, a CD like this comes along and just takes you for a trip. It's not traditional, you don't know what to expect, and that's the way music is supposed to be. Bands don't create music that breathes new life into you often enough nowadays. The Dresden Dolls do just that, breathe new life into you musically. Through and through, this is one of the most solid CDs I've heard recently. Every song is completely different from the last, and the creativity is outright.  My Favorite songs are Good Day, Half Jack, Gravity, The Perfect Fit, and Slide. The Dresden Dolls have proven to be in a league by themselves. No one puts out this kind of music nowadays and it's unlikely that anyone will. Basically, as far as debuts go (I think this is a debut at least), it's near perfection. I love every second and enjoy myself thoroughly everytime I hear it. So if you haven't heard The Dresden Dolls yet, the band and the album, you should be ashamed of yourself 
 The Eye of Danvers: A History of Danvers State Hospital  by Michael Ramseur, is a chilling look at a recent past history that some would rather forget. This book brings to the forefront images that should not be forgotten, but learned from and studied. Mr. Ramseur, has taken ghost like images as if from a tortured mind and captured them in a way to give a glimpse of another world that some of our earthly inhabitants must and do surely edure. His paintings do more than give an interpretation of horrors and mind numbing insights of humans that some say are strange. They give a look at a way of life and thinking that is unique to many of the souls that have been cast aside by the more "normal" of our civilization. Let it be said that this book is a capsule that is as timeless as the institution that was and is, Danvers State Hospital.  
 Cormac McCarthy has a style as unique as Hemingway's was in his day. His sparse dialogue and down-home punctuations only distract for the first few pages of any of his writings...and then draws you in. No Country For Old Men has the same trademark prose as The Road, and leaves you with a solid grip on every character.  "It starts when you begin to overlook bad manners. Any time you quit hearin Sir and Mam the end is pretty much in sight."  So does the character of Sheriff Bell think in this absolutely tense novel, and anyone who has ever felt the dischordant strum of disrespect against their eardrums would nod their heads in understanding of what he sees ahead. And although this book is not deliberately a prelude to The Road, you sense that the Sheriff glimpses the destruction of that path.  I read The Road first...and wish I'd read it after reading No Country For Old Men, because the events in this book made me see, perhaps, what could have lead up to the dispair of The Road. In No Country For Old Men, Mr. McCarthy paints as fine a detail about what is evil in our world, and what is good--and what makes one's own character mean something.  Set in our present time along the badland border between the U.S. and Mexico, it is a tale of more than just criminals. Drug smuggling, brutal and violent deaths, apparant (good) fortune and the flip of a coin play out in this novel of the harsh reality of our nation's afflicted collective consciousness. One man, hunting, comes across carnage in a desolate place, and finds a fortune in cash. Llewelyn Moss does what perhaps many of us would do--and starts a chain of events that spirals out of control so quickly that it just might change your mind about what you might do, given the same circumstances.  Sheriff Ed Tom Bell is a character who "rings true", representing the moral fibre of men and women as we remember them to be, knowing pretty much the difference between right and wrong, black and white, no matter how weak we perceive ourselves to be in that department.  This is no ordinary cops-and-robbers book...No Country For Old Men, like The Road, is about carrying the torch of Truth in your heart. Where The Road is bleak and nearly hopeless, No Country For Old Men is about real life, real death, and the decisions that we make along the path of our lives.  We realize that even Evil might be flipping a coin out there 
 This is by far one of the best Black Lace books that I have ever read. It is true that I found myself wincing at some parts for Beth as she took on the unspeakable. And yes, every working woman in the dawn of the millenium may find it offensive and if not, horrifying. But, let your feminist guard down a little just for the book and explore.  With every chapter, you look for more. I admire the character for her bravery. The little wild child in us all.  This book basically allows us readers to experience what we all deep down inside fantasize about. Those dark fantasies that you never tell our mother about. Thank you, Kristina Lloyd for this journey 
 I have been receiving Cooking Light for about 10 years now.  I love this magazine.  Frankly, it is about the only place I go for recipies.  The first thing I do each month is go to the back of the magazine and right to the Index page and check out the "Greatest Hits" for that issue.  That is where I start.  I would love to make more from CL, but just don't have the time.  I do love the web site and use it extensively for recipe searches.  Even tho CL offers the yearly recipe index, it is easier for me to find it on line, print it, then put it in my 3 ring binder.    Thanks CL for such a great magazine 
 Dirk Pitt wanders through an epic journey involving nerve gas, political kidnapping, mind control, and not one, but two evil powers.  Key to the plot is the takeover of the US government.  As a retired USAF officer, I was dismayed to see the military fall in line with dictatorial control (they are sworn to uphold the Constitution, rather than the President).  The rescue involving the Lousiana "good ole boys" was particularly fun to read.  Overall, the Washington leaders were portrayed with somewhat juvenile characters, but nevertheless, the story is fun 
 If you run, competitively or not, you'll enjoy this book.  It shows the level of effort and the perseverance required to attain a goal.  I recommend it 
 Extremely insightful, informative and all written with a wry sense of humor without being condescending or preachy. I pored over the very timely chapter on car sales last month and had an infinitely more positive experience with my negotiation and purchase because of it! The chapter on teachers came in handy, as well. All are quite interesting and useful, really!  Great book!! 
 The story is about  Lucia and her affair with a man who she fell for after reading his book. They move in together, and are in love. the film centers around the affairs of the people who have entered her life, and how it ends up in one ultimate climax.Very philisohical, and moving.I love this movie 
 This album has followed me over the past 6 years, I've lived and breathed this album, I've always kept it close to my heart. Mineral is the only band that I have a kind of religious relationship with and Chris is the only person who has been able to describe what I feel better than I could ever do myself. Their music has been with me during my struggles, during my long deep depressions and during my happy times. It has become a part of me, something that I will always have there, no matter what happends in life. I've listened to EndSerenading and Power of Failing hundreds of times by now, yet they never get old, I never get tired of them.  This is not the best album ever made from a musical point of view. But as a poetic emotional artwork it touches my heart in every way and that's the reason it is my favourite album of all times. This is pure soul 
 This book is wonderful.  I'm a firm believer in allowing the yarn I choose to decorate the project I'm knitting and not fancy stitches.  This book hit the nail on the head.  The projects are very versatile, useful and best of all quick to knit up 
 After reading this book, I decided I hate travel guides but love travel writing.  Travel guides tell you where to go so that you'll run into more pasty, spoiled americans like yourself; travel writing gives you a sense of the land and the people.  I loved this collection of essays because it took me to other places and educated me about their history and inhabitants.  I learned about the yuppification of Nantucket, the bloody past of Zanzibar, ethnic conflicts in western China, a brutal kidnapping in Uganda, the environmental efforts in Bhutan.  Some pieces are frightening; some are humorous.  All are enlightening.  My only complaint is that I wish more pieces by women had been included -- I would have liked to hear more about the experiences of women in exotic lands.  All in all, a fine collection of essays 
 I didn't expect this book to be so huge...in size and also in the amount of info.  i just received this book today and have skimmed over most of the info in it. i have already found several pages that i will photocopy and give to my child's teacher. the way that the information is presented is easy to follow, easy to locate, and easy to understand. well worth the money and time spent reading it from cover to cover. 
 The last time I bought this was the Second Edition.  Boy, a lot has changed since then!  I've mostly avoided Javascript because of platform compatibility issues.  These aren't entirely gone now, but it certainly has gotten bette, and this book shows how to get around what remains.  I liked the "no-fluff" writing.  David Flanagan covers everything concisely - some reviewers here have complained about lack of examples, but I felt that those given were sufficient.  The basic structure is as it was before (language overview in part I, client side use in browsers in part II) but many subjects have been expanded and there are entire new chapters.  Definitely definitive :- 
 If you want to know where "out there" is, this is it . A compelling mixture of funk, voodoo and chemicals . The fact that this is still available is scary . A 23 year old friend of mine, upon hearing Gris-Gris and Guilded Splinters, told me that I "need Jesus" ! If you want a real dose of the 60's, buy this . There is nothing else quite like it . Just do NOT play this in public , they will throw a net over you  
 I love this book!  It got me through some really tough times.  Because the authors have been through major surgery and one had bilateral TKR's, they know from where they speak.  I bet I read the book 10 times while I was rehabing.  My only criticism, and it's minor, is the timelines for rehab seem a bit overambitious.  I'm "only" 57 and some of the rehab was tough for me.  I found myself questioning if I was really coming along as well as I thought at times.  Just remember, regardless of age, everybody heals differently.    Anyway, I highly recommend this book to anyone undergoing TKR.  Buy it BEFORE surgery. 
 This is the best series of travel books about New England that  I have found.  It is easy to read with information I haven't found in other travel books. The New Hampshire book didn't disappoint.  It is up to the standard I expect from this series 
 I was a smoker for 20 years. I tried to quit a number of times but always fell off the wagon. A friend got me the book. It worked for him and it worked for me. I will never smoke again.The book basically brainwashes you out of being a smoker and into A NON SMOKER.Just dont stop smoking while you read.Good Luck.Its The greatest feeling in the world to be FREEEEEEEEE 
 Books on writing (novels, poetry, fiction, nonfiction, plays, memoirs) are a dime a dozen, and should be offered for sale for precisely that amount.  "To Be A Playwright" is a book that captures and makes specific what has been, until now, seemingly without explication; ephemeral.  It is, apart from being an engaging memoir by a successful, award winning playwright, very grounded in the ways-to convert the dream into producible,saleable marks on the page.  Forget the title and buy it for reasons and ways to write 
 Rain Fall is just as good as Hard Rain. The character, John Rain, is a clever judo expert who has a talent for killing and making it look like an accident. There are plenty of reviews about the story line, so I won't rehash that. What I would warn the reader about is that the Rain books aren't very good at standing alone... there always seems to be important strings left dangling, and that leaves the reader a bit empty. Also, in my opinion, the series really starts to go astray after book Rain Fall. The protagonist sort of loses his uniqueness (is that a word?). He starts to become something much more mainstream and unfortunatley that sort of ruins the whole experience. If you don't believe me, go and read some of the reviews for the latest book, The Last Assassin. My suspicion is that this series will end at 5 books, and that's probably a good thing. I think Eisler needs to start on something fresh again.  Final assessment: Hard Rain is good. Rain Fall is good. Rain Storm is ok. Killing Rain is so-so. And The Last Assassin is quite boring.  Recommendations: If you like martial arts thrillers, try the following: Art Bradley's Process of Elimination or Donohue's Sensei and Deshi books. Can't recommend Te Waza, as it is very poorly crafted 
 I found myself desperately trying to grab five minutes here and there to read more of this book whenever I could.  I hated to put it down.  Loved Annie's voice.  The mystery was interesting enough, but the love triangle was what grabbed me.  I can't wait for the next Annie Seymour book 
 I think System Modeling should ship this book with their software (I don't know, just use Arena in school and never bought it yet). This book is self-explaination.  Tutorial is great.  Easy to walk-through or jump to  each chapter if you want to. If you are "or" will be using Arena,  get this book.  You won't regret it.  Don't forget to check another book of  Kelton.  That book will take you to more detail of what simulation is 
 The Northern Rock of the late 1970's and early 1980's couldn't have better representation than the Buzzcocks. They came from the same vintage as Joy Division, Magazine, Cabaret Voltaire as well as many other hot bands. Great music, even better lyrics and "MOOD" is what fueled the Manchester scene. This album is "SOLID". Every song is worth checking out. The addition of the bonus tracks only enhances a great album. My favorite tracks are Hollow Inside and of course my own personal anthem, I Believe! This disc is a welcome addition to any party and showcases Pete Shelleys awesome writing talent with Mr. Diggle's cranking guitar work. Steve Garvey is also on this album. (Check out Rema Rema as well for more interesting variations on this theme). YOU SERIOUSLY NEED TO BUY THIS 
 Culled largely from Engelbert's fabulous collaboration with arranger/conductor Bebu Silvetti, the 1995 "Love Unchained" album, which has a gorgeous, lush orchestral backing for Engelbert's timeless, extraordinary voice, this is a marvelous collection of mostly classic songs, with choice picks for me being two of my all-time favorite melodies, the beautiful "Love is a Many Splendored Thing", and "Unchained Melody", both sung to perfection by Engelbert. He is 59 here, and there is a world weariness and a mature huskiness added to the glorious sound of his voice, when compared to his hits of the late '60s and '70s, and a depth of heartfelt emotion that goes straight to the heart.  Bebu Silvetti is well known in the world of Latin music, where he creates his instrumental magic for superstars like Luis Miguel and Rocio Durcal. His arrangements are a fantastic blend for Engelbert's style, who with good reason has earned the title of "The King of Romance". This CD has 9 of the most tender and loving of the 12 songs found on the "Love Unchained" CD (missing from the CD are "Answer Me", "(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay", and the upbeat "Such a Night"), and the final track, "There's No Song Like a Slow Song" is from Engelbert's 1996 CD, "After Dark", and is a lilting number with a contemporary country feel, and a spoken verse that is a reminder of that other King of music, Elvis. This compilation is a winner...perfect for lovers, candlelight dinners, and those ever young at heart. Total playing time for this nicely priced CD is approximately 37 minutes. 
 I was directed to this cd from a friend who simply gushed about it.  She had given me good musical advice in the past, so the next time I was in a music shop I just took a chance and bought it without listening to it - and hated it!  Angry that I had just wasted my money, I tossed the cd in the back of my car and forgot about it until about a month later when my brother popped it back in the cd player, despite my insistence that it was crap.    I don't know what changed from the first listening to the second, but it was like the sun broke from behind the clouds and, hallelujah, I got it (whatever "it" is)!  I got the genius of the Decemberist's unusual sound and theatrical melodies, and obscure vocabulary, and and and... well, so many things that can be said about the Decemberists that come together to make them the fantastic band they are.  If you like quirky, *weird* folk, try them out.  You won't regret it!  (and please do give them a chance if you don't initially like it)  
 I really have the feeling that I am not knowledgable enough about the period in question in the Thucydides to provide any kind of reasonable context for the work. Instead, this review will focus on some reading tips and reactions aimed at the more generalist reader who may be attempting to get through the text.  First, the text is daunting. Be patient with it, and put it down if you need to. It pays off. I'm not someone who reads battle scenes with absorption, and still I found that if I absorbed the text in small enough doses, then I was able to follow with interest.  Second, use the appendices at the back. The explanations about the Spartan and Athenian Leagues, the Greek monetary system, and the Melian dialogues were actually quite helpful in places for reading the text. These appendices are provided in the Penguin edition of the Thucydides.  Third, take notes. There are a lot of big thoughts, and I found that I absorbed them better by writing them down for myself to think about later.  It is time-consuming to attempt the History of the Peloponnesian War. It is also worth it, to my mind. I got a lot out of reading it even without being a historian with expertise in the time and region. Give it a try, and give it the space that it deserves.  "So it is now reasonable for us to hope that the gods will be kinder to us, since by now we deserve their pity rather than their jealousy. 
 A year earlier, when I was going through my Buffy obsession, I picked up as many books as I could with my birthday money - The Harvest being one of them.  I read it, but since I had already rented the first episode, I put it down.  Then I lost interest in Buffy but came back to it again a couple months ago.  I picked up The Harvest and was surprised at how much I had missed in the episode, but I found myself knowing what witty remark the characters were going to say next.  It was great to follow along and read the book again - especially since I had seen Welcome to the Hellmouth and The Harvest - because I could see the episode happening in my head.  (It didn't help that I was listening to my Buffy soundtrack at the time.  :) )  Anyway, this book earned its rating 
 is how I would describe Book One in the Stephanie Plum series titled ONE FOR THE MONEY.  Stephanie is the unlikeliest bounty hunter you can imagine.  Impulsive, Stephanie leaps first, then wonders how she'll deal with wherever it is she's found herself. Set in New Jersey, we see her interact with her sometimes overbearing family, laugh at her Grandmother's antics, and wonder about her feelings for her childhood nemesis/friend/and later, lover Joe Morelli -- who happens to now be armed (a cop) and a hunk. I am SO going to read the entire series! It's a fun ride!! 
 If you are a beginner or someone returning to fitness after a long absence, this is a great book that really does a good job of emphasizing the importance of doing anything other than sit around. If you are someone who is familiar with working out or who is already fairly healthy this may provide you with some few hints, but I would stick with Getting Stronger for the strength training and Stretching for flexibility. I'm a half-way in shape 35 year old that exercises somewhat regularly and this book was just a little too rudimentary for me. I was looking for more involvement with the Lifelong Fitness portion of the title, but found it to be more towards getting people started 
 Washington 'Insider' thrillers with a sense of humor are in short supply.  Luckily, Mike Lawson's debut novel fills the hole perfectly.  The Inside Ring is a fast-paced book that pits the Department of Homeland Security, Secret Service, FBI, and Congress against one another in an effort to uncover the truth behind an attempted assassination of the President.  The narrator, Joe DeMarco, is cut from the same vein as Sean Drummond from Brian Haig's novels.  He has an acerbic wit and the ability to piss off anyone that's in a position of authority.  One of the featured supporting players, Emma, is worthy of her own series if Lawson finds the time.    This book was one of the best thrillers in a long time.  
 Definitely the hissy fits of all hissy fits! Keeley is a great character. She is the perfect amount of strong, funny, witty and smart. I loved this book. The story line was very strong and easy to follow. One of the funniest chick lit books I have ever read. I would recommend it to anyone 
 This chronicle is a rich tapestry of war time action woven against a background of a boy's transformation into manhood through duty, love, and acceptance of personal limitations. Norman Berg brings his combat missions alive with gripping vividness of detail.  But it is the comparatively economical passges on his subjective experiences that give this book its poignancy.  Staying the course in war and sixty years of reflection have added the tincture of a profound sense of fate to this writer's ink.  It makes this memoir shine 
 In his many theoretical books, Albert Camus tries to answer a question that has bothered him: Whether a human life is worth taking?  In this particular book, he tries to answer the question for a special case - that of suicide.  'The Absrud dictates suicide' is one sentence that echoes throughout the book in various forms. Camus believes that it is the absurdity and meaninglessness of our lives that drives us to suicide.   He compares the absurdity to the myth of the greek hero Sisyphus who was condemned to roll a huge rock uphill for eternity. Camus proceeds to uncover the entire existential psychology of The Absurd, but concludes that one's own life is not worth taking.   He then proceed to demonstrate through a collection of anecdotal essays, how human beings can construct meaning from life. His other essays in the book do give a hint about how to find meaning in life, but may not be persuasive enough for someone too much in the dumps.  The logical connection between his analysis and conclusion is weak, but the analysis is brilliant. And for that reason alone, it is really worth reading 
 Anyone contemplating purchasing this book (or reading some of the other reviews) should know precisely what it is about and for whom it was conceived.  Ms. Mentor's column is a regular feature in the Chronicle of Higher Education, which is a state-of-the-field publication for academics, staff, and administrators of all varieties of colleges and universities.  It contains news, events, essays, articles, and advice for those whose careers are or will be in academia.  While some of the advice columns certainly do contain sarcasm or humor, Ms. Mentor's articles are by no means geared exclusively towards amusement, nor are they exclusively woman-oriented (in fact, most of the time they are not).  Rather, in the guise of advising on particular problems, they analyze snapshots of the intellectual, social, and emotional experiences of academic life.  As a very new academic myself, I find many of Ms. Mentor's columns to be witty, insightful, and even occasionally comforting.  The ideal readership for this book, however, probably consists of those who are, for whatever personal or professional reasons, interested in the minutiae of the internal workings of higher education 
 I read this book, the 1991 version, years ago. Around 1980 my own attempts to crack share prices statistically convinced me that all share prices behaved like a Gaussian random walk meaning that all speculation was comparable with playing roulette and  I am not one of those guys who usually wins when gambling. This view was strengthened when the option pricing model came up, meaning that even the  real pro's in the field assume that share prices are nothing but a random walk. This book has opened my eyes to the fact that there is much more to randomness than just the Gaussian curve. Share prices are not fully random. Impressive is the demonstration that an RS analysis on the real data is different when applying the same RS analysis on scrambled data. So there is information hidden in these time series, somewhere. Since then I have picked up the subject of cracking time series again with great pleasure. I think this book is exceptionally well written and without it I doubt if I would have been able to follow Mandelbrot's book "scaling and fractals in finance" that I bought later. The book is about understanding a subject, not about learning a simple formula to apply on a time series 
    I give Black Beauty a really good review because this book is a really good book of courage, will to live, and horses. Anna Sewell is a really great author in my opinion and really makes Ginger, Black Beauty, Jerry Barker, and many other of the charectors likable.Grownups and children alike will enjoy this book, so don't think just because it's a kid's book you will not like it, because you will 
 I have made several  afghans and baby afghans from this book and the instructions are excellent.  I really love the look of the completed afghans.  Of all crochet project books I own, this one is the one I turn to the most.  I bought this book at full price, so the 14.95 price is a steal.   
 I was a fan of the movie, but can't tell you how much better the book is compared to the movie.  If you like the movie, and have never read the book, you are truly missing a gem 
 Sad Isn't Bad answers the questions children have when dealing with death in the immediate family. These questions were asked in some form by a three year old at the death of her Nana. I would recommend this book for parents who are dealing with the death of a loved one 
  I am a new fan of Mr. Prine.  I am completely taken by this CD and listen to it every chance I get. There is not one song on the whole CD that you feel like "skipping over"..they're all great.        Simple music, and absolutely enjoyable!! 
 My home office benefits from two of these bookcases, and I use them for a range of items.  They're well built, nice looking and don't dominate the room like some standard bookcases.  A great solution for me at a nice price 
 There is only one glaring flaw with this book--that the editors did not bring it out years ago!  African American Fraternities and Sororities: The Legacy and the Vision is what every member or aspiring member of a black Greek-letter organization has been waiting for. FINALLY, a book on these groups with substance, depth, and that covers a wide range of issues. For the first time, a book places the history of these groups in context--tying them to organizations that predated them, the racial climate of the time, and movements that came later. The other two sections provide an incredible amount of insight into their culture and those issues with which they struggle. The scholarship in this book is groundbreaking yet at the same time provides a pleasant read for non-academics.  If you are interested in fluff or a mere primer on these groups, African American Fraternities and Sororities is not the book for you. For those who want a deeper understanding of black Greek-letter organizations, this is THE book for you!!! 
 Wonderful, it is simply the best book on the subject. An account that carefully balances scientific contents and personal issues of the scientists from the early times of molecular biology and conveys the the  thrill of professional research 
 Edward Eager's books provide the imaginative spark lacking in many heavily promoted children's books published in recent times.  In each of his "magic" stories, unusual things happen to ordinary children, and in this story, it is the discovery of a magical coin that leads four children to the best summer of their lives.  As the title implies, the coin grants wishes, but only half of what you wish comes true.  The children discover this the hard way, and learn how to make the most of their find through trial and error. This chronicle of their adventures will spark the imagination of young readers, and for adult readers, there are many literary allusions and humorous situations.  This may have been written in the 1950's, but it remains fresh and imaginative today.  Amanda Richards, March 21, 2006 
 The Oliver Stone Collection (Redux) is the second time out that Warner has trundled this great director's wares on DVD. The first collection was limited to titles that Warner held the rights to. This time we get a comprehensive collection of the master's work; 14 films in all, representing Stone's brilliant work from virtually every studio in Hollywood - save Paramount. The set contains Stone's most prolific masterpieces (Platoon, Natural Born Killers, Born On The Fourth of July, Any Given Sunday), his most ridiculed and underrated set pieces (JFK, Nixon, Wall Street, The Doors) and his largely forgotten precursors to greatness (Salvador, Talk Radio) which, in hindsight, are great masterworks in their own right.   Synopses in brief: Talk Radio: A hard-edged journey into the spiraling out of control life of a radio shock jock who is on the verge of a crying gag. Salvador: A burned out freelance photographer's interest in journalism is rekindled amidst the civil unrest in war ravaged El Salvador.  Platoon: A troupe of soldiers enter the hellish nightmare that was Vietnam and lose their souls to the inner struggle that has no heroes or winners. Wall Street: Martin and Charlie Sheen butt heads after the latter goes to work for unscrupulous corporate raider, Gordon Gecco (Michael Douglas). Heavily dated in its oh, so 80s subject matter.  Born On The Fourth Of July: A no-holds-barred, bare knuckled account of the folly and shame of an ungrateful country that befell returning Vietnam vets.  Natural Born Killers: A seething, scathing attack on the legal justice system and media hype that transforms the terrorizing debauchery of a couple of reprobates - Mickey and Mallory into `Robin Hood-like' vigilantes.   The Doors: The calamitous highs and debilitating lows of rock legend Jim Morrison get the robust treatment in this high octane rock-u-mentory that puts "Rock Star" to shame. JFK: The stunning conspiracy theory saga that attempts to offer up alternative theories to the Warren Commission's report on President Kennedy's assassination. An eclectic, thrilling roller coaster of a movie with a slam bang finish! Nixon: A rather straight-forward retelling of Nixon's highs and lows with Sir Anthony Hopkins doing his best to hide the fact that no one is quite like Tricky Dick but the man himself. Paul Sorvino is hauntingly on point as Henry Kissenger and Joan Allen gives a most intelligent read of first lady, Pat.   Any Given Sunday: A hard-edged look at the world of professional sports and how corruption, greed and the competitive spirit collide. Cameron Diaz and Al Pacino stage some rough-house politics to will a ferocious team out of its losing streak. Hot stuff!  This collection gives you a solid batch of transfers; the one disappointment remaining "Born On The Fourth of July" which still has not been anamorphically enhanced for widescreen televisions. Otherwise, picture quality throughout is superb. Colors are rich and vibrant. "Wall Street" exhibits the most dated picture quality of the lot. Some pixelization is evident on both "Nixon" and "Talk Radio." "Platoon" and "JFK" exhibit a flawless and impeccably balanced transfer quality with very clean, reference quality whites and deep, rich solid blacks. The audio on most films is pristine. Again, the earlier films in the collection (from Salvador to Wall Street) have a more tinny treble and hollow sounding bass, but this is to be expected. Special features vary according to each disc. All come with at least an audio commentary provided by Stone. There's also a host of extra features on Stone himself, his life and life's work, as well as a preview of his latest project, "Alexander." For the price this box set is an absolute must for any collector!  
 Like many ideas, the desire to set up a structure such as the UN was probably well-motivated and a legitimate concept at the time. But a strong argument can be made that the UN no longer serves its original purpose, and may in fact be acting against its founding ideals.  That is certainly the case being made by Jed Babbin, a leading American national security analyst. He argues that the UN has become a moribund, corrupt, biased and bloated bureaucracy which does little to promote the good of the world, but much to support tyrants, dictators and leftwing causes, as well as its own longevity.  When the UN was formed in 1945, it had some laudable aims. But also built into the original UN charter were some glaring defects, argues Babbin. The first error was to apply the doctrine of the equality of all men to nations. But not all nations are equal. Dictatorships, terrorist states, and Communist states are simply not on a par with free, democratic states.  Another problem is that "any nation, pseudo-nation, or thugocracy such as Iran under the mullahs" can be a member of the UN. This makes the whole exercise of peacekeeping and the promotion of human rights become counterproductive.  And the lack of accountability and a system of checks and balances makes the UN answerable to no one. Thus the opportunities for mismanagement and corruption are many.  Indeed, the Oil-for-Food scandal is a classic case in point. This debacle has yet to fully see the light of day, but we do know that the UN was implicitly involved in this. Indeed, UN officials provided Saddam Hussein with the means to "bribe politicians, to deprive his people of needed food and medicine, and to literally steal billions of dollars".  Not only was this the biggest financial scandal of the UN, much of the money siphoned off ended up lining the pockets of UN bureaucrats, along with various politicians.  The UN has been especially impotent to deal with terrorism. But worse than that, it has tended to side with the terrorists and tyrants over-against he US and much of the West. The democratic members of the UN seek to abide by its resolutions, but rogue states regularly flaunt them. By routinely cooperating with terrorists, the UN is not making the world a safer and more peaceful place, says Babbin.  He argues that reform of the UN is probably impossible, and the wisest course for the US may be to simply pull out altogether. Indeed, given that is directly and indirectly pumps around $7 billion a year into the UN (being its largest benefactor), and gets nothing but grief and hostility in return, that may not be a bad option.  Babbin says a coalition of like minded states could seek to do what the UN was meant to do, but has been unable or unwilling to do. Such a proposal may or may not be workable. But to stay in a system that has proven to be a failure is certainly not the way to proceed.  Other books have been recently written making a similar case to Babbin's. But if just one volume is to be consulted, this would be a good starting place indeed 
 Wow.  This book was really, really, really useful.  I'm one of those people who, until recently, never gave a second thought to savings or investment because I was always living paycheck to paycheck.  Now that we have a little gbreathing room, my husband and I have been reading up on financial things of interest.  I HIGHLY recommend this book for your first one if you're absolutely clueless about personal finance.  It takes a bunch of terms that many people find terrifying (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.) and not only explains them and many others in amusing detail, but also makes the process of investing a lot more accessible to the average person.  It's realistic, though--for one thing, the authors explain why everything from lottery tickets to penny stocks are a bad idea.  It also bursts other bad habits, such as not buying Stock A because Stock B is cheaper per share--but not returning as much interest to the owner.  Additionally, there's a lot of really good advice for newbies to investment.  
 The 3 stories were all connected in some way. But they are also very diferent,too The author puts a twist at the end 
 this is movie not every one will like. it is loosley based on the book by gail carson levine. the movie is about a girl named ella who at birth got the gift of obedenice. ella has to do everything she is told, when she gets fedup she runsaway home to find the fairy who gave her this gift. along the way she meets a elf and prince. this movie is like the wizard of oz meets cinderella 
 I actually purchased this locker gym bag for my husband for a Xmas present.  We had looked at several stores in our area and no one carried them, so I ordered this one.  The colors are great - very bright and vibrant, and the size is great for doing what it says - fitting into a gym locker.  Matter of fact, another guy at the gym commented to my husband that he was looking for a bag like that and asked where he got it 
 This book isn't as typical as her others.  I like how she uses WWII almost as a character in the novel.  Although the second generation isn't as savvy as the first, a typical Steel book it is not 
 I have used the coffee maker for the past couple of weeks, and it seems to make decent coffer using the Folgers Pods.  The coffee is better then what I make in the normal 10Cup maker.  I like it since for the single cup that I need it is quick and easy.  Also really not cleanup required like when you use the traditional pot to make coffee 
 My 5 1/2 year old daughter loves this book. She loves to laugh at the kids who will only eat a specific food and the mother who lovingly makes each from scratch. It's beautifully written and nicely illustrated. I read it to her preschool class and it was so well received, I was amazed. I even had phone calls from a couple moms asking what boook I read because their kid loved it. I highly recommend this book 
 I picked this movie up based on the DTS soundtrack, which I enjoyed. But, what was even better was the realism of the rafting. I thought I was there, through my home theater - 50 inch Panny LCD and 6.1 Yamaha 1400. Kevin Bacon, plays a great role and keeps you guessing....  
 This was Deborah (or Debbie) Harry's first comeback attempt, and one that deserved more attention than it got (in the U.S., at least). From the synth-seduction of "French Kissin'" to the superb "Free to Fall," this is a far superior to her first solo effort, the uneven "KooKoo." Though the lyrics (she had a hand in writing almost all of the tracks) are not as strong as those in her Blondie offerings or in later solo work, there are still some pretty clever turns of phrase. Other songs of note are the hypnotic "In Love with Love" and the funk-infused "Beyond the Limit" (sounding suspiciously like a reworked--and much better--cast-off from "KooKoo"). Sadly, when this was released in 1986 it did not get the airplay it deserved. If you're a Blondie/Deborah Harry fan, don't make the same mistake American radio made; get this CD and hear it for yourself 
 Most serious fans can roll off satistics about their favorite player but few realize that the numbers they cite have little to do with wins and losses. Baseball is a team sport that captures the American Spirit in ways that no other sport has been able to comprehend. Even a solid home run hitter may contribute less to putting his team in the win column than the player who can tease a base hit out of any pitcher and is able to steal his way home game after game. Likewise, a team that makes a lot of errors can still come out ahead in the win/loss talley. In Moneyball, Michael Lewis takes the reader beyond the strike zone to observe a side of baseball that few fans have noticed about this unique game. Like real life, this game is really won or lost by contributions that are not displayed on the scoreboard or written about on the Sports Page. Every member of the team contributes in ways that can only be seen by collection and analysis of statstistics. There is the so-so pitcher who can tease a base hit in every game, or the injured outfieldler who can play third base with an uncanny sense of where the ball is going to track. Lewis blends good story telling with evidence from the actual business case of the LA Angles to make this a book that avid baseball fans and hard-nosed business managers can profit from and enjoy.  
 It is one of the best books I have read in my lif 
 A few months ago, I started dating a very successful, attractive, and intelligent girl who revealed very early on our relationship that she was the victim of sexual abuse. Although she didn't provide details and I didn't pressure her for details, I had no idea the impact this could have on someone and as I got to know her better and see her more often, we actually started getting farther apart emotionally. This really confused and upset me because I was in love with her and I really wanted to be close to her. As a result, I began to push her to be closer emotionally and to share her feelings with me more often.  Within a few weeks, she broke-up with me because I think of the pressure I applied to be close, among many other things that only now make so much sense. We remain, however, today as friends.  After we broke up, I came across "Invisible Girls" and read it cover to cover twice. As I read the book, so many things that happened in our relationship and some of my friend's characteristics were now so understandable. I wish that I had read this book as soon as she told me her story as I could have been so much more understanding and more supportive toward her than I was.  For example, each time that she pushed me away, I would try to talk to her about it and try to get her to share her feelings with me, but in reality I was actually just pushing her away. After I read this book, I learned that such people really don't want to push people away but that is what they have done for years to protect themselves and it shouldn't be taken personally. I should have been more patient and understanding to my friend during these times.   I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to understand the affects that sexual abuse has on people, and to hear what steps individuals can take to recover, overcome and move forward confidently in their lives as independent people. It has given me the perspective and understanding to be unconditionally supportive, kind, loving, gentle and understanding toward my friend, which is the very least that my awesome friend should expect from anyone in her life.  This really is a great book.    
 The question marks is because I'm wondering why others think so little of it?  Is it their best album, no, is it their worst... no way.  Is Mother Lode their best... likely, and this one comes in a close second (for me any ways) (Full Sail is up there as well, mostly Mother Lode stuff, but a fine alblum none the less.)  I might have to confess... I'm a real big fan of Loggins & Messina, and have all of their album's as a group as well as solo stuff.  I think they are much better then most folks got to hear. I'm not a big fan of "Your mama don't dance (except "Outside- from the Redwoods version" and feel folks need to listen to more of their music. Once they do, they too will be big fans, of this and the other albums they recorded.  In any case, Native Son is much more then a 2 1/2 star rating, buy it, listen to it, enjoy it 
 An excellent overview of this country's energy history and energy options and a good starting point from which to learn more.  Not a left wing political rant nor an argument for biodiesel as an energy panacea.  Tickell emphasizes the economic costs of our energy dependence and the benefits of energy self-sufficiency from a practical perspective - certainly a highly relevant subject in light of the turmoil in the Middle East 
 This book is a combination stitch dictionary for textured, cable stitches and a pattern book.  The patterns include a very nice fringed skirt, where the cables end in fringe around the hem. There are standard men's and women's and kids' pullovers and a beautiful Aran afghan, by far my favorite of the designs. There is also a bag, pillow, hat, scarf, vest, poncho and afghan made of squares. I saw no jackets nor cardigans. The patterns are fairly basic, though a pillow in an all-over two-color cable was rather intricate-looking, but probably not terribly hard to knit.  You could adapt any of the patterns to use the other stitch designs in the stitch dictionary.   There is a front section of HOW-TO, for the newbie who has never cabled or done twisted stitches before. So I'd say this is a great book for new knitters who love cables and would like to know where to start. As you learn, you won't outgrow this book 
 This was a challenging and effective lower body toning workout lead by a good instructor. I liked the variety of exercises and the yoga component at the end. This is a good 40 minute lower body routine to put in a monthly rotation. I would consider it to be intermediate leve 
 and who would think that Tom Hanks was that young just 10 years or so ago.  Good family fun 
 This toy is so much fun, travels well, and boys and girls will like it.  The best toy received this Christmas 
 This is hands down one of the best Rock and Roll albums of all time. This is Tesla's masterpeice. Song and Emotion is Tesla's stairway. If you are a fan of Tesla or of pure no frills Rock-n-Roll buy this album now. 
 I held off buying this CD for awhile, thinking Jill Sobule was just another one of the blonde bimbo ala Jewel types.  Boy, was I wrong!  She's musically talented, lyrically witty, and socially pithy.  She's a songwriter that can give Elvis Costello (brillant as he is) a run for his money.  You'll never get tired of listening to this one 
 Thes little candies have big flavor. They are different from the usual candies found in the U.S., a fun and interesting Japanese treat. The assortment comes with a variety of flavors. The flavor seems more intense, and even though the packages are small, you feel satisfied with just a little of the candy at a time. I really liked the strawberry and coffee flavors. 
 This book blew me away. Tolstoy explains the cause of conflicts between divergent theories of life, the intrinsic hypocrisy of life in modern society, the futility of force-based solutions, and the nature of man's search for personal truth. He proposes a radical change in social order based on Christ's Sermon on the Mount.  Most people recommend you read the last chapter first, but I plowed right through the tedious beginning and found it relevant to my thoughts at the time.  Perhaps I discovered this book at exactly the right time in my life, but my life will never be the same. I recommend this book to anyone who is seeking higher truth outside of organized religion or trying to reconcile science and religion. 
 Nice to see Mellencamp back in the mix and this is as nice a recap of his storied musical career as you are going to find.  The two CDs span his prodigious career offering a nice mix of his music, roughly divided into activist songs on volume 1, and romantic yearnings on volume 2, which capture the full range of his work.  The set is very nicely packaged and includes a bonus DVD that includes 5 videos. That's 3 discs in all!  Mellencamp always had a message, a bit simplistic at times, but on the money at other times with such wonderful parodies of Small Town America as Pink Houses and Small Town.  Many of his early songs were about the devastating agricultural crisis of the 80s, and how bureaucrats and banking institutions had sold out farmers.  Mellencamp also sang of more simplistic yearnings such as Jack & Diane and Authority Song, about teenage love and bucking authority.  All in all this is a great collection of music, sure to please Mellencamp fans, and at an irresistable price 
        Talk about a plum job!  Gael Greene has enjoyed the finest cuisine the world has to offer for some three decades, and all she has to do is write about it.  Jealous?  Not in the least bit - that is until she shared the names of her bevy of lovers which includes Burt Reynolds, Clint Eastwood and, yes, The King himself, Elvis.  According to Greene all Elvis did was saunter in, lie down on the bed and wait.  Best advice for you is not to wait a moment longer before listening to Insatiable, Greene's  funny, frank, frolic of a bio.  	As most know, Greene is New York's vaunted food critic, eating her way through the city's toniest establishments and dining in France - on her employer's money.  Seems it was 1968 when Clay Felker of New York Magazine discovered her in the Motor City and brought her to the Big Apple.  It wasn't long before Felker dubbed her "the insatiable critic."  Wonder if he knew just how accurate that was.  	Freely admitting to a "certain compulsive bedability," she gleefully blended lovers and Lutece, all of which makes for spicy listening.  Narrator Nancy Travis does a superb turn with the slightly quirky Greene's tale of her pursuit of life's pleasures.          And, yes, recipes are included.  	5 star restaurants, 5 star swains, and most certainly 5 star listening.          - Gail Cook 
 Origin in Death J. D. Robb/Nora Roberts G.P. Putnam's Sons Penguin Group (USA) Inc. 375 Hudson Street, New York, NY, 10014, USA ISBN: 039915289X, $24.95, 339 pp, 2005  In July 1995 J.D. Robb, aka Nora Roberts, published her first "in death" book, Naked in Death. Since then she has written twenty-two novels and two novellas in this continuing series about Lieutenant Eve Dallas, a futuristic NYPD homicide detective; Roarke, her gorgeous, wealthy husband, and Eve's crime-fighting team. These novels are quintessential police procedural mysteries, with a twist of humor, pyschodrama, sex and sensitivity.  Prior to reading this entire series, I had a fear of reading books about the terrible things people do to each other, how we use our wonderful imagination to create pain and terror. I actually used this series to confront my fears and to get past them, for within this series you will find every possible, imaginable form of evil.  Each novel certainly can stand alone; however, I read the series in chronological order, which I highly recommend for maximum enjoyment. You will quickly grow to know and love all her characters-Peabody, her partner; McNab, Peabody's tall, skinny loveman; Mavis, her radically-clad, extroverted, singer friend; Summerset, Roarke's majordomo and thorn in Eve's side-to name a few.  After reading this series, I can now read anything gruesome or frightening-stalking, dismemberment, blood everywhere, revenge, torture, whatever-and find it prosaic compared to these novels. Now, back to Origin In Death.  It is year 2059 in New York City and someone has murdered reconstructive and cosmetic surgeon, Dr. Wilfred Icove. The victim was found in his office with one clean stab wound to his heart and no evidence of a struggle. The case turns bizarre when Wilfred's son dies in the same manner. In both cases they seem to have trusted their killer. Eve's instincts tell her that the father and son had a hidden dark secret and that the motive for the murders . . . had its origin in death.  J.D. Robb/Nora Roberts's writing is consistently excellent. She is a consummate artist in any genre-romance, mystery, thrillers, fantasy, science fiction-you name it, she can write it. Since her first book, Irish Thoroughbred, published in 1981, she has written over 300 novels. You won't be disappointed.  Reviewer: Kaye Trout - March 16, 2006 - Copyright  
 I wrote it once and I will write it again: the perfect novel is one that combines literary aspirations with an engaging plot, thus mixing the high-brow (the tone) with the low-brow (the cheap thrills of a great best-seller). Arturo Perez Reverte has by now carved a career out of this thin balance, being the master of the so-called literary best-seller. "The Queen of the South" is a brilliant tale about a memorable character, a narco's morra (girlfriend) who is forced to escape her native Mexico and then turns into a drug-lord of her own. She's a complex, intriguing character, obviously not free from many ambiguous facets. The tale is gripping, believable and, as one has come to expect from APR, very well written. Highly recommende 
 Alright, these recipes are not nutritionally-correct.  Many are high on fats and sugars.  But when you want a special dish to really "wow" your guests, or to celebrate a special occasion, this is  the book you'll turn to!  Not only are the recipes great, but the sidebars  have lots of useful tips for serving and entertaining.  This is one of the  two or three most used cookbooks in my collection 
 Mr. Anderberg obviously doesn't realize that the single focus of this album is the love and adoration of Krishna, not the prattling of "subjects in any way related to eastern religion" that he seems to think it is about.  If he wants to call adoration of God "drivel, pure and simple", well, that's his business.  I think he totally missed the point.  The whole record is devotional--pure, loving, and sexy 
 "I just love great songs, things that move me, and they could be about anything, so there's a wide variety of subjects. The music should make me feel something, make you want to cry or get up and dance. Thematically, we explored more adult subjects, and that might be the big thing people notice. I was 16 when I did some of the songs on the last album, and a lot has happened since then."  Blaine Larsen talks about his new CD at the ripe old age of 20.  The magic of Blaine Larsen is his rich baritone voice. It is the voice of a much older man, much like his hero George Strait. The songs that Blaine sings are a reflection of his country roots, straight-ahead, traditionalist country. Blaine Larsen is from Washington State, and he developed his country flare from his step-dad. He began singing at an early age and at the age of 16 had his first country CD.  This is the second CD for Blaine Larsen and with his rich voice he finds himself opening for Gretchen Wilson on her "Redneck Redemption Tour"    He also sings with Gretchen Wilson on the song, "Lips of a Bottle". Blaine wrote this song with  a friend form Washington state. This duet brings back the feeling of George Jones/ Tammy Wynette.     The first song, is a witty, ditty "I Don't Know What She Said," a song about language differences in Mexico, and it has become a Top Forty on the Country Music Charts.  My favorite song is Mac Davis's 1972 pop hit "Baby Don't Get Hooked on Me". It seems fresh and new sung by Blaine Larsen.   "I'm In Love With A Married Woman" gives us a fresh look at love and sung with some sensitivity. He has surprise for us with this one.   He has a  somber commentary of "Someone Is Me" and the delivery is sweet.    "At the Gate" is an inspirational tune that talks about his family and friends who have died and he remembers fondly.  This is a CD of note, and one I have listened to several times.  He's delivered a terrific album, one that qualifies as a totally unexpected and wholly enjoyable surprise. Blaine Larsen projects heart, humor, and excellence. Highly Recommended. prisrob 06-18-06 
 After reading "Guilty Pleasures", I was definately interested in the series.  After reading "The Laughing Corpse" I am hooked.  This book, the second in the series, is so much better than the first.  Not that the first book was bad, this one is just that much better.  It has more to do with her powers as an animator, than with the vampires nickname for her, The Executioner.  Anita is a great character, and she has you laughing, and feeling her pain through the whole book.  Definately a great read 
 This book, a collection of essays by some of the world's leading historians and political scientists gives a reader a glimpse into both the theroetical structure and real life examples of military structure. This is  not a textbook on military strategy however, and the examples may not  always directly illustrate every given aspect of the theory. But if you  want a taste for strategy - it is highly recommended 
 "Classic Indian Cooking" is by far the best of the various Indian cookbooks I've owned. This book taught me the basics of cooking Indian food. The first few chapters alone were worth the full price of the book. The organization of the book is superb as well as the explanations of the fundamental techniques.  Julie Sahni ranks with Julia Child in her ability to teach, inspire and help you understand techniques and ingredients. The recipes are meticulous and so convincingly put forth that the reader wouldn't even think about taking a short-cut or substituting an ingredient -- you know that Julie knows best. The results, in every recipe I've tried, are spectacular. (Particularly the splendid recipes for chicken braised with spices and saffron pilaf with peaches.) The complex flavors and heady aromas delight the senses long after the guests have left and the dishes are washed.   Without question this is my favorite Indian cookbook and I highly recommend it. 
 To the person who wrote "don't confuse AA with religion,"  I think it is you who should reread the book.  The book would never call someone "ignorant" who thinks AA is religion.  It goes on and on about how DIFFICULT IT IS to accept that you are powerless over alcohol and that only by giving yourself over to a "higher power" will you get better.  It's hardly "ignorant" to feel that way, such people simply are not "ready" for the AA "message."  And by the way, the whole system is "religious" in the extreme.  I'm not saying that is a bad thing; AA really might be the _only_ way for an alcoholic to get better.  But quibbling over the word "spiritual" vs. "religious" doesn't change the fact that the book is entirely about the "path to salvation" through "accepting this 'higher power' into your life."  The logic of AA is indisputable.  That's why the first step is, look, YOU can't do it.  You are powerless over alcohol.  If you can't, then who?  It has to be some higher power, whatever that means to you 
 This is a great book for someone who has read the original series and wants some extra background... I've also used it to get friends interested in the original series.  Check it out 
 I am home recovering from surgery and I have purchased 30 of James Patterson's books after reading Mary Mary on the airplane.  I have the DVD's of Kiss The Girls and Along Came a Spider and I had not read any of his books.  I am hooked.  His short expense filled chapters are wonderful.  I encourage everyone to read this author's works, they will not regret it.  This book was awesome, I have not been disappointed yet.  All 30 are great.  I am waiting for Judge and Jury and then I have them all.  The Angel series, the Alex Cross and the Women's Club series are just awesome.  Get them and read them, you wont be disappointed 
 A excellent and serious book about self initiation in the Golden Dawn magic system. But it's very complex too. This big book will teach you a lot of details about magical things and cosmogony, through a one or two year's "evening class".  But it doesn't explain you the spirit of this magic and the GD philosophy.  It's not a easy understanding book, and definitly not a fast magick grimoire :) 
 i looked at this book everyday for about two years. the material seems to be thorough and complete and shows a wide range of his work. the works included will keep your appetite full. two crowns up 
 I bought this book yesterday morning and began reading it on my subway ride home.  The people around me probably thought I was crazy because I could not stop laughing.  It was so good that all I did the whole day was read it (even though it's the size of a college text book).  The book is funny, filled with great ideas, and definitely worth the money.  A great gift for anyone who likes to throw parties or cook 
 Despite some unfortunate copyediting issues, this slim book has enough meat and asks enough important questions to make it worth reading. I like the way Morville meanders, and the book is valuable for the chapter on the socio-economic web alone. Just the same, somebody else might get as much out of a different chapter. Will keep this on my shelf and revisit in a couple years to see how things have turned out 
 The answer to the question sophisticatedly raised by this little anthology, is given in the essay which opens the collection.The basic reason lies in forming a personal scale of values that help you individualize the real artistic elements in new works. The second one is that reading increases the quality of living in usual and unusual situations, as well. But the quality of school anthologies and their presentations is still an open problem 
 My friend and I adore this movie! She recorded it off television awhile ago and we watch it at least once a week! Keri Russell is perfect in this movie. Her mannerisms are so perfectly suited to the character of Livvy that you almost forget Keri is playing the part - truly a sign of great acting. Skeet Ulrich is very handsome and endearing as lonely and lovely Ray. Ray's love for Livvy and desire for her happiness is almost tangible. Again, you lose yourself so completely in Ray that you forget it's Skeet Ulrich.  It's so great to watch a love story that is wholesome and devoid of inappropriateness. This movie will pull you into the characters and have you rooting for their success. I'd give it 10 stars if I could! 
 Laurence Hull Stookey has a wonderful trinity of books in this text and the companion volumes 'Baptism: Christ's Act in the Church' and 'Calendar: Christ's Time for the Church'.  These books address key aspects of Christian church practice in ecumenical and historical tones.  'Eucharist' is no different - it is a one volume survey of historical, theological and practical issues surrounding the central facet of Eucharist / Lord's Supper / Communion.  Stookey himself is a Methodist, but writes intentionally as an ecumenical writer; this particular text was completed while he was on sabbatical near a joint Anglican-Methodist seminary.    Stookey's preface begins with a comparison of Babette's Feast and Christ's meal with the church - there is something hidden, something disarming, something inviting about the meal; we may not all approach it exactly the same way and with the same expectations, but those who feast do find it a nurturing banquet.  As Stookey points out, eating and drinking are central to life and community.  Food is a common motif in the gospels; gathering together for meals is frequently cited from the time of the apostles forward as primary , and indeed the first ordained members of the church were those appointed to help serve the food.    Stookey gives a brief summary of New Testament images and writings about communion.  He begins with Paul's instructions to the Corinthians, the text upon which many churches base the liturgies or prayers at Eucharist, given that they are the closest in time to the original Last Supper.  He discusses terms such as 'anamnesis' and 'prolepsis' without becoming too bogged down in theology or exegetical analysis.  Stookey highlights a few aspects of Paul's verses - that they are actions (more than concepts) central to the importance; they are corporate, not private, actions; they bind past, present and future together; and, they have evangelistic and soteriological (dealing with salvation) relevance.    Stookey also explores the images of the Last Supper in the synoptic gospels (Matthew, Mark and Luke), and quoting from Dom Gregory Dix, he states that the Last Supper is not something radically new, but rather a reinterpretation and deepening of already-existing practices, not least of whom the group of twelve themselves.  While John's gospel does not include the Last Supper in the same way, Stookey argues that the whole of the gospel is in a way a commentary on the importance of the Eucharist - chapters like the water-into-wine at the wedding in Cana, the 'bread of life' chapter, and more all point to this.  Theologically, Stookey explores Platonic and Aristotelian ideas with regard to the Eucharist (as these are the two dominant philosophical schools underpinning Christian theology).  These address issues of real presence and real substantive changes, and how those might be understood.  Stookey also explores Nominalism, Lutheran, Zwinglian, Calvinist and later ideas regarding communion.    After this theological discussion, Stookey examines the way in which the eucharist practice has been carried out over time - quoting the Lutheran hymn ('from age to age the same'), he points out that how communion is done changes dramatically over time.  Early Eucharistic feasts could be elaborate, full congregational and full day meal.  Stookey highlights liturgical practices of Justin Martyr and Hippolytus and the pre-Constantinian church, as well as shifts after this key official date.  Stookey describes the practices of some Eucharistic traditions (the 'dry masses', the remoteness of the public, etc.) as well as reformer and modern innovations that sometimes restore the Eucharist back to its original formulations, at least somewhat.    Stookey puts forward a renewed Eucharist platform that takes into account contemporary and ancient principles and practices, recovering sacramental ideas, the presence of Christ, the work of the Holy Spirit, and the work of the people.  He includes a good length discussion of practices, elements and settings for communion services, some things to avoid, and ideas to incorporate into the denominational and local adaptations that natural occur in such practices anyway.  Stookey addresses the issue of ecumenical actions, highlighting some divergences that make the one-service-fits-all approach unlikely to succeed.    He concludes with two appendices - one looking at issues around communion taken to the sick and otherwise-unable-to-attend, and one looking at particular issues in the Wesleyan/Methodist traditions.  There will be points of divergence to be sure; he points out some historic ironies along the way (such as the closer familiarity of Eucharist practices between Roman Catholics and Lutherans than the Lutherans and Presbyterians, both Protestant churches), and cautions that not all of his ideas and analysis will be fitting or welcome in all denominational settings.  Nevertheless, the issues addressed are important ones, and Stookey's writing is clear, concise, accessible and worthwhile. 
 This is a good translation of St Augustine's 'Confessions', one of the most important works of Christian and also world religious and philosophical thought.  St Augustine's genius needs no advertisment.  His brilliant intellect is more or less the founder of Western Christianity as we know it.  Between St Paul and Aquinas, he is the most brilliant theological and philosophical mind the medieval period managed to produce.  If Western philosphy is a cathedral, then Augustine is one of its capstones.  The Confessions is a personal narrative of Augustine's life, which describes his spiritual and intellectual journey from childhood to adulthood.  Augustine is such a brilliant writer he manages to capture countless facets of experience in a book which itself is only about 340 pages long (thirteen books in total) and this work also has immense range and depth, from the strange nature of free will and sin to the inner quest for the indwelling image of the Trinity, to Augustine's mystical experiences, to his dramatic conversion, to his allegorical commentary on Genesis to his ceaseless praise of God's goodness and the beauty of creation.    Augustine is clearly influenced by several sources, especially Neo-Platonic Philosophy.  Augustine read the Enneads of Plotinus in translation into Latin (thanks to Marcus Victorius, a Christian convert from Neo-Platonism) and found its concepts of God made more sense to him than that of the sect he was a member of, the Manicheans.  The Manicheans, a syncretic sect who blended Buddhism, elements of Christianity, Zorastrianism and Gnosticism, and Platonism captivated Augustine for several years, seeming to provide a satisfying explanation for the baffling problem of evil.  Yet Augustine, after reading Plotinus, thought the explanation of evil in terms of non-being made more sense than God making an evil world, or being ruled by an evil principle.  In this sense Augustine made a crucial breakthrough in theology, not only by finding God 'within' the depths of his own soul, but also in associating God with the Platonic Good.    Yet Augustine's strongest influence is the Bible.  References to the Bible abound far more than references to Plotinus, and for Augustine, pagan thought is mostly useful for articulating truths already main plain by the Word of God.  However, Augustine is always too brilliant and original thinker to merely fall into a rigid pattern of dogma he never leaves (in contrast to many more mediocre minds in the Christian tradition) and reworks his theology consistently and constantly in a creative manner.    However the Confessions is too brilliant and profound a work to summarise in one review, and it is best if readers avail themselves to a copy of this work as soon as they can 
 My son was thrilled to receive this book. He immediately began to see himself described in every chapter. He has always felt different and out of sync with his peers. This book helped him to understand himself and feel good about his "gift" 
 This is an extremely well written book, but if you're looking for it after seeing the movie, you might find it a bit different and unpalatable. The book has a cold and desolate feel which is apropriate for the way Rule goes with the story, and the writing is amazing, but it is not such a sweet love story as the movie, and Freud would have a ball with these two! There is much talk of the two women and a mother/daughter relationship which may offended some readers. Incidentally, the movie is actually "Desert Hearts" not "Desert of the heart" as the other reviewer mentioned, and they are both very different 
 This book is so much fun. Say goodbye to boring cupcakes. The ideas are SO cute that you'll want to try your hand at almost all of them. I need to make more friends so I have more birthdays to bake cupcakes for. Warning, though, the decorations aren't always easy and some prior cake decorating experience is a help. She offers her own cupcake and frosting recipes, but you can also do it the lazy way with a box mix if you're going for presentation over taste, or use your own recipe for special dietary needs. My wife and I made the sushi cupcakes for a friend's birthday (shreded coconut for the rice, green Fruit Roll Ups for seaweed, and Sweedish fish candies, etc) and presented them to her on Japanese dishes we'd bought. It was a big hit and made her very happy. These creative cupcakes are a great gift - and one from the heart - for that person who is hard to buy for. Make them for someone you love or get the book for a person who loves to bake 
 The late Edmond O'Brien's steely, measured lead performance, solidified his career as one of Hollywood's top actors. Don't miss this one, and avoid the remake. An ingenious, engrossing thriller for the ages, expertly shot on location in San Francisco and Los Angeles 
 This book is great for showing kids how math constantly appears in real life! Lots of math story problems on each page that kids can work out. Cool artwork. Reading the whole book to an elementary class in one sitting would most likely be too much, though 
 This book contains a veritable encyclopedia of information concerning the various forms of Hepatitis.  The book is written in language that non-medical people can readily understand.  The book answered many questions that I had, as well as teaching me to live with chronic Hepatitis with a minimum of life disruption.    This book is a real find.  I give it five stars.  This book is a must for any person suffering from Hepatitis in any of its forms.  It should be the first book a person includes in any library or repository of information on Hepatitis 
 This book presents Bob's many innovations clearly with excellent photos to help readers follow directions. Many of the flies shown accurately represent a particular baitfish, shrimp, squid, etc. known to catch a varity of fish in saltwater. Both Ed and Bob are well known around the saltwater fly fishing circuit,- each extremely active in their field. Readers of this book are treated to the expertise of both, presented in a simple ,concise way that enhances tying skills. Complete information on tying materials, techniques, and tools complete the picture.  This book is a definite plus for any serious tier 
 The entire Cd is great and can be listened to repeatly. 
 i really enjoyed this video.  his playing with the backing music is really awesome,          but don't look to this as much of a drum lesson video. he doesn't teach that much if you already know what you are doing.  he has a basic idea of learning double bass and some stick twirling kind of like a beginners guide to heavy metal.       but overall .. watching this dude play is pretty craz 
 I cannot fathom a guess as to how many times the books in this series have saved my in project work over the years.  The only drawback with this series is that some publisher should endeavor to keep them up to date.  Serious Unix system programmers must have copies of the complete series 
 Ginger Rogers was very popular, both within the Hollywood community, and with the moviegoing public. With two strong performances in 1940, she took home the Oscar despite strong competition. Rogers perfectly captured the dilema of every American girl who worked for a living. Her portrayel of a young woman having to decide between a young woman's daydream of what love would be like and the real thing is flawless. Sam Wood directed this very entertaining film based on Christopher Morley's popular book.   Ginger is Kitty Foyle, a career girl from Philadelphia who falls for her boss, Wyn Strafford (Dennis Morgan), in what she thinks is everything she's dreamed about all her life. Wood used a snowglobe as a transitional device to Kitty's flashbacks of their romance, just as George Stevens had used a phonograph in Penny Serenade the previous year. Kitty and Wyn are no longer together, their brief marriage ending in divorce when it finally becomes clear to Kitty that her Irish American moxie can not overcome Wyn's old-money family in their Darby Mill--Griscom Street romance.   Kitty has moved on and has a chance for something real with a young but poor doctor portrayed by James Craig. But it is a down to earth and more practical love, and when Wyn suddenly appears to take her away once more, but not as his wife, she must decide which path to choose. As she packs to run away with Wyn, she argues with her conscience and remembers.   Ernest Cossart is very good as Kitty's pop, trying to steer her in the right direction. He may have been born four drinks below par, as Kitty affectionately teases him, but he is wise enough to see Wyn's weak character, which will never allow him to break from his society family and make a real life with his daughter. Kitty will face two tragedies simultaneously in this warm and sentimental story of an American working girl trying to have it all.   Rogers did deserve the Oscar because she is everything in this film. She may have been the only actress around who could have so readily been accepted to represent an entire generation of young women during the 1940's. They viewed her as one of their own, even though the glamour of Hollywood was part of her story as well. She was the American girl made good, and her performance here is flawless.   A fine ending showed not only Kitty's Irish American moxie, but her growth and maturity as well. This is a fine film with a terrific performance from Ginger Rogers that is very much a product of the era it was made. A fine score from Roy Webb adds to this gentle story of letting the dream of love go in favor of the real thing. A must own for Ginger's fans and a good one for film buffs to add to their collection 
 Although I don't have children, I taught children of all ages for over twenty years. When I came across this book/cd I was delighted! Most children's cds make my gums bleed but this one is smart and funny, lyrical and informative. Finally! A cd for children that parents (or child-like adults like me) can listen to over and over again. Songs about bones, passing gas, hair, the heart and others are all inventive and after the first listening, get into your head and heart. The song writing team of Jane and Steven Schoenberg is one I will definitely keep an eye on. I am looking forward to hearing more and more of their music!

 Gnocchis were delivered promptly and are very good. Would buy them again 
 Rudy Baylor is a law student in his last year of law school. As one of his projects, he is required to offer free legal advice to senior citizens at the local nursing home. Little did he realize that he would meet Dot and Buddy Black who would present to him the lawsuit of all times, one that would make him a "Rainmaker". Rudy jumped right in and fought for the Black's son Donny Ray who was diagnosed with Leukemia and then later denied medical treatment by a large insurance company for no apparent reason. Rudy is thorough and compassionate in his work and never gives up the case. He fights for his client even though he has little courtroom experience.  An exciting novel 
 I have tried the program for three weeks now and have lost five pounds and gone from three pound weights to eight pounds without feeling overstressed.  The program is very well written and can easily be done by anyone 
 This is one of the more intriguing spy novels in recent memory, and a rather good satire in addition. John Le Carre is a very talented writer who has his weaknesses (more about them below) but also has his strengths, and they frankly are legion, and outweigh anything else. This isn't Le Carre's best novel (The Little Drummer Girl? Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy?) but it's not his worst either. It's a very interesting book.  At its heart is Harry Pendel, the Tailor of the title, who's half-blackmailed half-bribed into spying for Britain. Pendel's a voluntary exile from a rather sordid lower-class existence in Britain, who's remade himself (and promoted himself socially) in the exile and wanna-be Brit community of Panama. He lies to everyone about his background, so when he becomes a British spy, it should come as no surprise that he immediately begins to fabricate information there, too.  Pendel's controller is Andy Osnard, a shady character with hidden agendas of his own, and behind him there's a rogue's gallery of crooked embassy officials, government functionaries, American soldiers, espionage service supervisors, and even a Murdoch-like media baron who tries to create the news in order to better report it ala William Randolf Hearst. While most of the characters are well-drawn, Pendel's wife sounds suspiciously British for an American. In one scene she refers to the children eating "crisps" which I believe is Brit for potato chips...though I'm not sure. No American would talk like that.  This all leads to several very funny passages where the heads of two governments decide to invade a country on the basis of the fabrications of this silly tailor who's trying to recoup his wife's inheritance, which he lost in a bad investment. The book winds up reading like the book version of the movie It's a Mad Mad Mad World, with everyone trying to steal more than their fair share of the pie.  I enjoyed this book a great deal. John Le Carre doesn't do satire much, or comedy (though some of the Smiley stuff was fun) and so this was a welcome change of pace. It's an interesting book, and I would recommend it to most anyone 
 Raistlin is one of my favorite literary characters ever, and this is a good prequel into his young life.   I suggest reading this after you have read the Chronicles, as not to spoil some character development, but before the Legends series. If you enjoy learning about Wizards and thier trials, you will definately enjoy this book 
 Swaims translation of Fus incredibly detailed description of Yang Style Tai Chi is both clear and interesting. The text itself covers details of the form, descriptions of push hands, and discussions of the Tai Chi classics and theory. Fus text contains much more detail than most of the classic texts, and he goes to great lengths to explain his points. Anyone who practices Tai Chi will find some point in the text which would help their practice. My only complaint is that the historical line-drawings which illustrate the moves are limited in the detail they can convey 
 Kenny Wheeler brings to Jazz the best of each rich component we admire in the music.  To me, its as if Miles Davies said to Mr Wheeler carry the batton and push the way the trumpet contributes to jazz music.  Mr Wheeler  also surrounds himself with brilliance for accompanyment and his  compositions are highly original.  Overall this CD as well as Deer Wan are  two of my all time favourites 
 The Call of the Wild   	The book called The Call of the Wild is a book that takes place in the north Yukon where Buck (the dog) and John live at that time. After a while when Buck and John matured they started entering the dog sledding races and winning them all. Then Buck got in a fight with the leader of the dog pack. While Sprits went for help, Buck started defending him self from this. The leader couldn't last any more so he ran away. After that they got back to the race. The story is written in first person point of view. When I was starting to read this book it felt strange and boring, because it is a book about a dog and not a person. I disliked the book at the beginning because it is boring to me, but then towards the ending the book started to be more fun and exciting for me. If you love animals or book with dogs you will totally love this book. I rate this book 4 out of 5 stars just because it is written and revolves around a dog instead a person.  
 Although not what I expected this was a nice short read. Very interesting story 
 "The Last Command" is the concluding volume of Timothy Zhan's "Thrawn" trilogy.  The conclusion of volume two ("Dark Force Rising") left the Grand Admiral Thrawn in command of most of the legendary Katana Fleet which had been missing since before the Clone Wars.  Thrawn, working with the mad Jedi Clone Joruus C'Baoth, has also reclaimed a stockpile of the Emperor's cloning technology and Thrawn can now command the Katana fleet manned with a clone army.  In short, this is by far the biggest threat that the fledgling New Republic has faced since Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader deposed the Emperor.  The Dark Jedi C'baoth seeks to turn Luke and Leia to the Dark Side and also to raise Leia's soon to be born children has his apprentices.  The threat to the entire galaxy is very real and could touch every planetary system.    The good guys will not let this happen so easily, of course.  Luke has an idea what C'baoth is up to and will not stray from the Light.  He will not betray what he believes to be right.  Leia is preparing for the birth of her children and also seeks to protect herself and her children from the constant attacks.  With Han, Lando, and the Droids, they are all working to keep the New Republic together, even with attacks from within.    "The Last Command" spans the galaxy and features grand space battles,  light saber duels, various alien creatures and some political intrigue.  In short, it is everything that a Star Wars novel should be.  Timothy Zahn really set up the Post-Return of the Jedi novels to have quite a storyline and showed the other authors just how to tell a Star Wars story.  By no means is this a perfect novel, and there are parts that drag far more than it should considering that this is Star Wars, but the good far outweighs the bad and the continued development of Mara Jade is a big plus.  The Thrawn Trilogy is perhaps the perfect place to begin reading the Star Wars novels.  -Joe Sherr 
 Great movie about golf. Just wish the language would have been cleaner 
 A.N. Wilson is a prolific author who specializes in religious and literary biographies. Three years ago, Mr. Wilson took up the recounting of historical eras with "The Victorians" which covered the history of England from 1834 to 1901. Appropriately, he has researched the sequel called "After the Victorians" for all the upheavals that took place between 1901-1953 (The Great Depression, World War I and II, et al).  Both books are a cultural and political sampling of those five decades and are NOT a comprehensive history of England. How could they be definitive, when the books cover the hundred year zenith and fall of the British Empire in 1,000+ pages. As an introduction to the major events of those 100 years, they perform that task nicely.  "After the Victorians" covers the tales that Mr. Wilson chooses to tell and he is a good storyteller. The only caveat for the reader is in his conclusion about America intentionally dismantling the British Empire. He is so paranoid about the evil "American Plot" of destroying England as a rival that those sections are actually hilarious for any reader familiar with American foreign policy of the 1940's. It is an interesting book to read, especially if the reader goes on to read other English histories covering the first half of the 20th century 
 I got this for my 9 month old daughter, and she loves the photographs.  I want to expose her to "real" nature; not just drawings or silly sketches of animals.  The book is endearing and we both just love it.  I am going to order the other books by the same photographic team as well as the DVD's, and I'm sure we will love those, too 
 this wa a great movie and held my intrest the whole time. ending was awsem 
 Well, I suppose I might be biased, since my father actually *wrote* 'When You Close Your Eyes'. yes, that's right. Look at who the lyrics are by, it's says Jeff Smith, and I, am his daughter, Kendall Smith.  Anyhoo, aside from my little brag-fest (MY DAD WROTE IT!) this is a great album. All of the songs are catchy and fun, it's not the best 80's rock, but still really cool and AWESOME! I give it 4/5, plus one star because I love my Daddy. ^_ 
 THE SHORT: An interesting collection of cases - some famous, some not, some just craft sightings and some going all the way to alien abductions. A good mix of UFO entertainment.  THE LONG: This was my first of three sets that I purchased from this series, and I was initially apprehensive- is it really more than 6 hours of segments cut straight from the Unsolved Mysteries show? Fortunately it's very correct advertising- 4 discs, each an hour and a half long, composed entirely of complete segments of the show introduced and narrated by Robert Stack. No filler, just segment after segment as if you made your own collection tape.  As stated, it's a mixed bag of segments. For the UFO buff, it's all good. There are stories that feature convincing camera footage of UFOs, segments that discuss crash sites such as Roswell, and episodes that chronicle supposed alien sightings and abductions. Some, like Roswell, have been discussed to death and may not do much (though in fairness it wasn't nearly as common when the show first aired the episode, but it could've been left behind on this set). Basically though, the set gives a good mix of stories that are in various places on the charts of fame and believability. Rather than focus on close encounters of any one kind, the package recounts stories of various types as well as tales on the periphery of UFO lore such as crop circles and the Nazca lines. It's sort of a UFO gift bag that covers all grounds of the subject.  Most of the stories, even the ones I already knew well, were presented in the serious, fairly objective manner typical to the show and were therefore interesting to watch. A couple segment commentaries per disc are included as well for updates here and there. In all, for just 20 bucks this was a solid investment 
 Rabbi Steinsaltz is one of the great Jewish teachers of this generation. His translation first to Hebrew and now in English of the Talmud have given many access to the Jewish traditional sources that they otherwise would not have had. In this book he essentially outlines the principles of the Jewish faith. The word 'Teshuvah' means ' to return ' and this process in Judaism is taken to be a lifelong and continual one. The Jewish person no matter how advanced in learning , or not is continually required to be striving to come closer to G-d. Rabbi Steinsaltz outlines here in a clear and effective way some of the ways by which this can be done. This book can be a great help to anyone who wishes to deepen in their practice of Judaism. 
 We are five parrots known as the Feathered Zoo. Four of us prefer veggies and one of us prefers fruit. After awhile though, we would get tired of eating the same thing. We would just pick at it or in our big brothers case, it would become a flying menu when he'd throw it out of his dish onto the floor.  The recipes in this book however, have gotten us to eat again by giving us more variety and textures.  Mom says the recipes are simple and easy.  She didn't really change our diet, she just added to it and learned to present our favorite foods in new ways.  We here at the Feathered Zoo are not only eating more but we are eating more healthy. Even the big guy doesn't throw his food like before which is good because we were getting tired of being hit it the head with flying broccoli and mango.  Thanks for such a wonderful book -- The Feathered Zoo -- SD Rentzel's Sweeties Telula, SD Rentzel's Chief White Eagle, SD Rentzel's Wolfgang's Lady Mozart, SD Rentzel's KSA's Wayward Angel and SD Rentzel's Rio Sambu's Lakes Evening Prelude 
 I had forgotten how hilarious Sophie Kinsella is, since it's been months since I read Confessions of a Shopoholic. She has the ability to create terrible mortifying situations and make it seem like something that happens every day. Like sharing your entire life story and everything about you to a stranger who happens to be your boss.  This was great. Hilarious. And so sweet 
    The reason I love this cd so much is that Euge Groove didn't clutter it up with unnecessary vocals. I listen to jazz for the music. To me when a vocal type of song comes on a cd that is primarily instrumental, it is subpar. I end up usually hitting the skip button. It's a waste! This cd is pure instrumental- and Euge Groove's saxaphone playing is so sweet and smooth, it's pure enjoyment! Not a bad or subpar song on the entire cd.    The previous cd  he made, "Livin Large", had that rap song "thankuforlettinme...ect ect" twice on it, and that is the kind of stuff I don't care for- I'm glad he didn't do that on this cd.   I read the intro Euge wrote about how he was inspired to make this cd based on what the 70's were like musically, and instrument wise. He made a great cd, good job 
  I always enjoy her books and this one was as good as the others 
 An excellent work by a late medieval Jewish theologian/metaphysicist  (a contemporary of Aquinas) who presents and breaks down the metaphysical arguments of the day for the existence of God, a God-created universe, and the interpretation of the Torah in regard to these topics. He examines the Aristotelian arguments supporting the eternal existence of the Universe and determines whether or not they are supported by Scripture and logical analysis. Our contemporary physicists could use his methods to uncover logical flaws in their theories about the ultimate origins of the Universe. He finishes the text with a treatise on Scripture and the perfection of Man. A must read along with the works of Augustine and Aquinas, and for that matter, any modern work on the ultimate nature of Nature.   rac 
 LOST is most noteable for an outstanding unexpectedly so performance from Dean Cain.  While Cain has had some good roles in movies like MAN ON FIRE and BEST MEN, nothing has challenged him as much as this role.  He plays Jeremy, a young executive who has just pulled off a major heist (6 million), and finds himself lost somewhere in Nevada, being followed by the robbers he betrayed and his only ally a voice from the Road Map customer service department.  Cain pretty much has a solo act in this unusual thriller, well written and directed.  He displays a range of emotion he has rarely had to call on before, and he pulls through with a stunning performance.  Credit also to Danny Trejo, who we only hear as well as Ashley Scott, who is Judy, the voice on the other end of the line.  Tense and disturbing, with much religious allegory and symbolism, LOST is a film that deserves a bigger audience 
 The shoes are extremely comfortable and light weight.  I definitely got my money's worth.   
 With the notable exception of Karl Edward Wagner's The Road Of Kings, there is no finer Conan pastiche than this. This novel is flawlessly executed fantasy fun from start to finish. You'll never want it to end; it's a compulsive page-turner that puts lesser Conan pastiche writers to shame. Other reviewers have gone into their reviews in far more depth than I have time for at the moment, so I'll just say they are right! Buy this novel now. You won't regret it 
 Alan Banks is still recovering from the fire that destroyed his home and possessions.  He is on holiday, when he receives a telephone call from his brother, wanting Alan to contact him urgently.  While he is off to London trying to contact his brother, who seems to have disappeared, a young woman is murdered near his home.  He and Annie play telephone tag as the two cases come together.  The novel seems to start out a bit slow, but is hard to put down by the time you get to the halfway point and events start coming together.  It deals with sordid issues, like white slavery and worse.  Investigation into one case provides leads on another case.  There is a question as to whether Banks will revert to Law West of the Pecos (frontier justice based on community standards).  What do you do if there is a particularly heinous crime, and the guilty party may walk away from it?  Banks comes out of it whole, but without a woman.  Perhaps he has burned too many bridges.  The novel is set in the UK, so be prepared to deal with the King's English.  They use different terms for some things (compared to American English).  
 This is a very fine collection of so many talented artists.  It is really very enjoyable!  I must say, though, that there is one track in particular that I can't help but to listen to over and over again, and that is "The Glen" by Bradley Joseph!  It is a very moving piece to say he least!  He is a fantastic composer!  More of his CDs I'll definately have in the near future 
 This watch was a great bargain and prettier than the picture. More than what I expected. Very Happy with purchase and price. 
     "From China to San Francisco Lalu is a constant source of hope and inspiration."       A biography of a young girl growing up during the Chinese famine of the 1870's who is sold into slavery by her father (even though she was his "thousand pieces of gold"), for a mere two bags of grain, becomes a ping pong being pushed on one owner after another until she is transported on a slave trading ship to the Americas. When she finally gets to the United States Polly is auctioned off to a saloonkeeper, and eventually traded because of a gambling loss. All along the way however, Polly describes her strife to be independent and make her mark on this new land.       "Black man came to saloon tonight. He tell me his people come from Africa. Like me, stolen from village and bring here, but man named Lincoln make war and they free. He free, I free," she said her English deteriorating under the strain. "The civil war was fought to free Negroes." "You mean law for China people not the same?"(pg.139) This is a direct quote from the novel through the characters Polly and Charlie involving the topic of civil rights. Polly does not understand why everyone just cannot be free; she even relates her situation to that of the African Americans, but she cannot achieve freedom when the law is already in her favor and individuals like Hong King (saloonkeeper) still take advantage of loopholes in the system. She continues to have hope for the future however, because if one group of people can be freed she can be freed someday too. It is this hope and determination that she has for her and her people's freedom that make this character a source strength, and belief throughout the piece even when times are so oppressive, and there seems to be "no light at the end of the tunnel".        This piece of literature was lacking at times, but it made up for it through the story of the main character; resulting in one of the best historical, inspirational, adventure novels I have read in a long time. Taking the reader back in time through a non-fictitious individual is a tough obstacle to succumb and it is my belief that Ruthann Lum McCunn did a fabulous job of it. I would recommend this work to anyone who has an interest in novels with romance, drama, suspense, or the survival and struggle of women throughout history. 
 Jean Renoir's masterpiece about the decay of the French bourgoisie. The heart of the movie takes place at a country chateau; first the guests shoot down rabbits and pheasants and then later at a party the guests are shot at themselves. Behind it all are the various love affairs going on between members of this party: although love is declared between some and passions even run wild, all is kept in check by the stultifying "rules of society" that say, for instance, that a man can't run away with another man's wife unless he first talks to the offended husband, or that even after a killing has taken place one must keep up appearances and declare it "an accident." The scene at the party where the gameskeeper is running through the chateau chasing the servant who has made advances toward his wife, shooting at him, while two other men are having a fist fight for the love of Christine - and the guests are oblivious to what's going on because they think it's all part of a masquerade, is a highlight in film history. Many rate this among the greatest movies ever made. It was hated by the French when it first came out and banned by Vichy and the Nazis; later it was destroyed during a WW II bombing raid, though it was restored in 1959 from old stock. The film has been extremely influential and endlessly copied. 
 Great product fits like a glove. I was getting fustrated with my laptop getting scrached up so I decided on this case. Neopren material is my favorite. Would be nice if item was offered in Red or Blue. Some padded protection,Very Good for the price! I can now travel with my laptop comfortably in my backpack 
 Like George Smiley, who is gifted far beyond his peers, John LeCarre's Smiley trilogy is far and away the most literate of the entire genre of cold war espionage thrillers.  In fact, these aren't thrillers at all, but finely crafted tales to read for the language, the nuance, and a sensibility largely gone from the world.  Particularly fine are the dialog and characters.  Perhaps the only other author with as good an ear is cyberpunk author William Gibson 
 This is a selection of orchestral music, including some beautiful, grand and moving pieces, from all across China. It is played by a (communist) Chinese orchestra using traditional instruments, organised along modern (European) lines, and the resulting synthesis is one of enchanted magnificence and awe which truly reaches within the soul. It also conveys the mystery and potential of Chinese creativity and its powerful yet delicate beauty 
 In the world of development, you will hardly find a writer more witty, engaging and entertaining than William Easterly.  His depth of knowledge of economics is matched only by his first-hand experience in development and his sharp wit.  You will thoroughly enjoy reading Easterly's adventures in the developing world, and learn a lot about the countries he mentions, the institutions responsible for development and the theory behind development.  Yet the author's misadventures make him too pessimism about the prospects of achieving development and the intentions of the people working on it.  Admittedly, development has had many failures in the past, and Easterly himself is one of the best critics of the reasons for many of these failures, yet his conclusion seems to point towards a defeatist "let's just give up and hope for the best" attitude instead of learning from the lessons of the past.  The prime example of this is Easterly's views on international development assistance, which he has come to view very skeptically, blaming it for causing several incentive and institutional problems among recipient countries; even going as far as to lecture against debt cancellation, placing the lion's share of the blame for failure on recipient governments.    Yet, it is Easterly himself who has, in his more serious academic work, exposed some of the major failings of donor countries, and how their institutions have been responsible for the failure of aid to bring about development.  In particular, in one of Easterly's academic papers, he says: "The problem with international development aid is not that it did not succeed; it has never been tried."  Such a sober analysis should lead one to call on a better institutional framework for disseminating aid and assuring its effectiveness.  Yet, in his book and media appearances, Easterly goes for the more populist and catchy: "aid is bad for poor countries."  Nonetheless, the book remains one of the most significant contributions to the debate surrounding international development over the last few years, and is also an easy read for those with no economics expertise. 
 At last not only a "workbook" for the early childhood professional but one that parents can share with their children. Great learning tools with everyday items found around the house. I saw Dr. Folds on the Health Network several years ago and it is about time she shared her endless well of ideas with early childhood pros and parents 
 I purchased this shoe to replace the Columbia's I had before and am very pleased.  Good comfort fit for my feet.  All feet are different but you tend to find certain manufacturer's seem to consistently work for you.  If you've had Columbia's shoes before, you probably know what it will feel like on your foot.  Good experience purchasing and wearing the shoe.  Nice to avoid having to go to the store 
 One poem here, "No Grounding In The Classics," makes it worth the price of admission all on its own. Puts genius in the proper perspective in the funniest, most searing, self-deflating few lines I've ever read.  Among the ten best little narratives the man ever wrote 
 Of all the books on spirituality that I have read, this one became the most personal.  A long time ago I decided to explore what I really believed.  I spent many years studying & contemplating, then many, many more years feeling that I was alone in my beliefs.  Oh, the excitement when I finally met others like me.  Well that is exactly how it feel to read this book 
 There is something about the ability to take a lot of information and ideas and disseminate it all into a digestible "road map" that is so amazingly powerful.. This book does that well. As well, the information that is brought together is pretty darn good. Spread out over many scribbled notebooks, emails, sticky notes and books half read, the information Mr. Wolter chooses to bring together would be valuable as such. But it's presented here very sensibly, bringing you through the process that you're not just reading valuable information, you're experience the value behind it first hand. I only wish the author would write a book about getting out from under your parent's questionable upbringing 
 This a dark, very hard cd. If you like Mystic Styles and old triple 6 Mafia style you'll enjoy this. It is also just as hard at the tear the club up thugs. This is not pop [...]rap. This is pure evil agressive crunk down south [...]. I don't even like southern rap. But, the triple 6 are quality and I can appreciate that.One of there best albums pick this up. Also check out Three 666 Mafia THE END, and Chpt.2 WORLD DOMINATION for some really good 666 mafia cd's you'll be hooked. Peace 
 I am a Sucker for Zombie Fiction. I have just about read all the genre has to offer. I had seen all the rave reviews The Undead was getting, and even few saying that it was the best Zombie Anthology since Book of the Dead. I LOVED Book of the Dead so I got me a copy to see for myself. I wasn't disappointed. The Undead has some of the most original and entertaining Zombie Fiction ever written.   There wasn't a story in The Undead I didn't love, but Home by David Moody, Death Row by James Reilly, and Hotline by Russell Calhoun has to be my favorites. I had to go back and read them again once I was finished. They were true pleasures to read.  The Undead is destined to become a classic in the Zombie Genre. Zombie Fans can't afford to miss this one. You should definitely believe the Hype and grab yourself a copy. You wont be disappointed.  The Undead is the best Zombie Anthology since Book of the Dead no question about it.  Five Star 
 This is one of the most admirable and fresh films of any age. A true tour de force that invites us to enjoy and delight with the joy of living. Renoir the son, paid a more than deserved to his father with this post card movie, plenty of smart situations with a wonderful Jean Gabin and the most beautiful woman in the world in those ages: Maria Felix.  The film is a glorious homage to Paris, depicting minuciously through every little frame every angle of this lovely city through anorigibal stage: since I got it in 1990, I have to watch it at least once every year. A colossal and superb artistic film that finds in Renoir the perfect director in the peak of his creative powers. This is the artistic answer given by France to "An american in Paris", and John Huston's"Le Moulin Rouge". Versatile imaginative, sumptuos and ravishing fil 
 My son absolutely loves all of the Bone series books, simply devours them. Since he's read all of the ones at our local bookstore I have ordered those online that we can't find elsewhere. We are still waiting after six weeks to receive this one. Most of our amazon orders have been timely, but this is ridiculous! Especially for a child who is eagerly anticipating his order 
 The Optoma Movie Time Projector is awesome. The calrity and size of the image is simply amazing, no distortion at all. I hooked this up through composite video cable to one of my digital cable the HD feed (1080i) is as clear as any of our HD-LCDs.   We display the projector output image on a wall an the picture is perfect. I installed the 106" screen out on my porch and can enjoy movies out there for 3 seasons, or simply use the wall in my family room (about 15' wide) either is great. Since the built-in DVD player is pure digitial and the HD feed from the cable box is digital... they are both beautiful!    My kids play their PS2 using the projector on the wall 15' wide and it is simply awesome. At first my wife gave me a hard time about spending the $$$'s, but even she was impressed with how clear and crisp images are and that when she looked at the cost of a large DLP projection box, she realizes that we paid less than half and can take it with us...   If you are looking to create a home theater then definitely consider buying this unit 
 A pity the talented group does'nt exist anymore. Surely a must have for any serious 'Flame' fan or 'The Flames' as we know them in the country of their birth, South Africa. Not so sure that the quality of the sound recording does the group proud. I've been fortunate in seeing the group perform live in South Africa on more than one occasion and they sure reigned supreme in their heyday. I bought the LP with the same title years ago and was struck by the group's resemblance to the now exctinct 'Fab Four' at the time. Blondie Chaplin, most successful member of the group is still performing with the 'Stones' on their recent tour. Need I say more??? Go buy the cd you won't be sorry 
  As an American living in Europe, I read with great interest Alexis de Tocqueville's book about a European experiencing America.   Like most people, Mr. de Tocqueville started out with a characterization of the United States, believing that the country's early 19th century prosperity was a function of its distance from rivals in Europe. But after his famous trip, he concludes that the real difference comes from each side's view of risk taking. It's an insight as relevant today as it was when it was written.  Mr. de Tocqueville predicted that the growing issue of state's rights would lead to bloodshed (it led to the Civil War -- though he wrongly predicted it would eventually lead to a breakup of the union, he was very nearly right on that point as well); he predicts the fledgling country's industrial rise and its emergence as a true world power; he recognized the symbiotic role between industry and democracy at a time when they were believed to be unrelated. His insights into the American psyche, optimism, and ambition at times seem timelier than most op-ed pieces.  More than a century and a half after it was written, I am hard pressed to conjure the name of a better commentary about America and Americans. It is an astonishing feat considering the brevity of Mr. de Tocqueville's four-month visit, his youth (he was in his early 20s), and early stage of development the country was in. But the result is something that shouldn't be skipped by any serious student of the political and social essence of the United States 
 I have read The Gunslinger four times now.  Every time that I read it, I tell myself, "It's time to read the entire series."  But for some reason I always quit after this, the first novel in the series.  I'm still not sure why I have never continued on with the other books, but I am currently on another mission to read the entire Dark Tower saga.  After finishing The Gunslinger (again) I think that I finally realized why I haven't gone on to finish the series.  I think that I am afraid to find out the answers to all the questions posed in this amazing novel.  I'm just afraid that I'll be disappointed with the ultimate answers.  The conversation at the end of this novel is totally amazing and completely invigorating on an intellectual level.  So how can Stephen King possibly follow it all up?  I hope that he does in a grand fashion.  Because this time, I intend to find out those answers 
 This is truly an amazing piece of writing. Truly a must read for anyone who enjoys good books, it contains not only a rich variety of tales but a perspective on the human condition which reveals the similarities in all generations. Without a doubt buy this, read it, and treasure it 
 I bought this book to start free weight training at home.  It is wonderful for home use.  The author describes the benefits of weight training and how to lift weights properly(which I found very useful as a first time weight lifter).  I love the descriptions that the author gives for each exercise.  The author also color codes which exercises to do for each level of training.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is first starting out with free weights.  
 This is a great gift set.  It has all five Rocky movies on DVD. It was a perfect Christmas present that everyone could enjoy 
 This movie was a weird one but fun.  The acting was not that good but the movie had a meaning to it.  Once you start looking at it you will want to finish it out til the end.  That fight at the end, that was a good one.  That's what one gets when they try to PLAY someone! GREAT CLASSICAL B-FILM 
 This is a great printer to have around the home.  The only thing that I didn't like about this printer is that you cannot print documents directly from a flash/thumb drive.  In the description, it says that you don't need a pc to print...not true.  On a positive note, it is a great printer 
 A CD-ROM; I do not know why someone did not think of this before. It is great. I spent hours digesting hundreds of hints on everything from technique, to training and playing the fun and informative Quicktime videos. It is not often that you can look into a decade worth of training diary entries and training notes of a World Cup Gold medalist 
 OMG, a bad horror movie.  Boo-Hoo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Instead of watching this movie like a clueless movie critic, try watching it just for entertainment purposes, and you will like it.  Yes, it wasn't shot with a huge budget, and top-notch actors weren't hired, but they did do good with what they had.  I feel this movie was fairly good, and should be given a chance.  So, if you're anal about movies, take a "chill pill" and relax and enjoy the movie.  You will like it............ 
 I love the BSC, and the earliest books in the series are my favorites.  Ann Martin is one heck of a writer, and this third book in the BSC series tackles some serious issues - Stacey's struggles with diabetes, moving to a new town and fitting in, the loss and re-gain of old friends.  A subplot in this book is the girls dealing with a copycat club called the Baby-Sitters Agency that threatens to put them out of business.   Ann, I wish you had written every single book in the series and not used ghostwriters for so many of them!  
 Well 2005 was truly the year of King Kong with Peter Jackson's wonderful remake of the classic 1933 epic.  In King Kong is Back, part of Benbella Books' Smart Pop series, a score of luminaries share their thoughts on Kong in a wildly diverse array of essays spanning from the 1933 original, right up to Jackson's remake, and everything in between, including the Japanese Kong films.  While perhaps a bit uneven in their tone and scope, these essays are at worst passionate and at best, often brilliantly considered.  Nick Mamatas and Paul Levinson share similar memories on growing up in New York in the 1970's when the running of King Kong on WOR was as much a tradition on Thanksgiving Day as the Macy's parade or Detroit Lions football. Don DeBrandt's piece tries to make the argument that the 1976 remake is actually better written and acted than the original, almost dismissing it as an airy fantasy.  He makes the point that the remake was more socially conscious and more complex, pointing out that the search for Skull Island wasn't about making a film but rather finding oil.  That may be, but people don't go to see Kong for social relevance, they go to be entertained.  Rick Klaw's essay "Thirty Three" delves in the colorful history of the two men who brought King Kong to the screen, Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack.  These two have a backround that you'd think had to be written by Hollywood.  Both served during WWII and both aided Poland in their fight for independence with Russia.  Cooper was a pilot for the Polish Air Force and was made a squadron commander in 1920.  He was shot down and captured by the Russians and held in a prison camp until he escaped along with two Polish prisoners and traversed 500 miles to freedom into Lativa.  A remarkable history.  Another great essay is from Bob Eggleton who discusses the making of the 1933 film, focusing on stop-motion animation whiz Willis O' Brien, and a man whose name has been nearly lost to the sands of time, Marcel Delgado, who actually made the various Kong models used in the animation process, not to mention the various dinosaurs and other beasties.  Robert A. Metzger's "Dragons Teeth and Hobbits" supposes a true history to Skull Island, King Kong, dinosaurs, and a long lost forgotten race of little people thousands of years old.  Metzger hypothesizes about not only Kong's origin, but the origin of the great wall.  Seeing as how Kong easily climbed the Empire State Building, this wall would have posed little problem to him...so just who built it and why?  Fascinating stuff!  Some of the essays are a little on the dry side but all in all its wonderfully done and a great book for any King Kong fan.  Reviewed by Tim Janson 
 It went together fairly easily and so far we are pleased with the product 
 Warning: This book requires a strong foundation of physics knowledge. The author refers to relativity and skims over quantum mechanics pretty quickly in applying his thoughts.  As for the material itself, the book is great. Deutsch gives us a tour of leading theoretical physics and their applications to our understanding to the physical universe. For anyone interested in physics, epistemology, or philosophy, the narrative is engrossing as Deutsch meticulously develops ideas that really work your brain over.   My only issue with this book is the author's idea of the "four strands." Granted, Deutsch only claims that the future model of reality will include these four strands (evolution, computing, quantum mechanics, Popperian theory) in some way. Yet, I don't find his strands to intertwine with one another. His discourse on quantum mechanics is fascinating, but doesn't significantly tie-in to his overall philosophy. Deutsch does show wonderful similarities between Popperian epistemology, Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, and the Turing Principle. But again, he doesn't develop an overall encompassing philosophical model.  Regardless, the book is informative, a pleasure to read, and well-written. Definitely recommened 
 Flying Colors has continuity with de Burgh's previous album, Into the Light. His commercial breakthrough had come in a huge way with "Lady in Red" and Chris was obviously comfortable writing radio-friendly songs that were in this vein. This album boasted at least three hit singles, "Sailing Away", "Missing You" and "Tender Hands." "Sailing Away" is especially catchy. They are all good pop songs, but they are not the only good songs on this album. "Carry Me" is also a lovely song and I like the ballad "Just a Word Away." "A Night on the River" reminds me of Dire Straits and "The Last Time I Cried" is a nice song to end the album. Chris also revisits Christian themes on this album, something I last recall he did on Crusader, but more so on Spanish Train and Other Stories. "The Simple Truth (A Child is Born)" and "The Risen Lord" are quite explicit in their references. I appreciate this about Chris - he was not shy about his faith even though he expressed the Christ story in allegory: "Just Another Poor Boy," and "A Spaceman Came Travelling." 
 I haven't been able to put this book down 
 A man comes to terms with his life's decisions and puts them into perspective during his lone bike trip from East Hampton, NY, to Sturgis, South Dakota.  Honest and without pretention, it will make you want to take a break from daily routine to prioritize and appreciate what we all take for granted. You do not need to be into motorcycles to enjoy this gem of a book 
 The smells are as powerful as the emotions in this book written by a daughter of Presbyterian ministers and America's first female Nobel Laureate.One can almost get the smell of warm blood in the nostrils of Wang Lung , the main character, as he ruminates on the ill omen of the birth of his first daughter and third child or the 'slave' as girl children were known. Bestseller in 1931/32 it gives a glimpe of China on the verge of change. Buck's characters pulsate with life as they tell a Chinese, yet a universal tale of man's ever increasing estrangement from the land. The fortunes of peasant farmer Wang Lung ebb and flow alongside those of the inhabitants of the Great House of Hwang in the rural Anwhei province and later in the rich rural South. Human emotions leap out from the page as Wang Lung oscillates between destitution and self indulgence, while Olan , his wife remains servile in extremis. It offers a compelling close up of Chinese mores and culture through the broad lens of a western born, oriental raised author 
 Originally released in 1971,as I'm not exactly sure if this was their second or fourth album.Tracks here that had me playing this CD over several times were "Shine On" (didn't this cut later become a Peter Frampton song?),the fantastic soul rocker "Sour Grain","Stone Cold Forever",the ballad "A Song For Jenny" and "Red Neck Jump".Basically,good damn GOOD heavy blues-rock.Recommemded 
 Sparse but evocative text provides the perfect complement to the gorgeous leaf pictures. Truly a delight for the eyes 
 Jamie Oliver aka "The Naked Chef" is my favorite celebrity chef and former Food TV cooking show host.  I learned to cook watching his shows. This cookbook is chock full of recipes for parties and family events.  There are 120 recipes beautifully illustrated with color photos and simple instructions.  Jamie Oliver makes cooking fun, fast and easy.  You don't need to be a pro to have a hearty, healthy meal in minutes.  Buy this book!  You'll love it.   
 This book takes place in the 1780s and is about a boy named Nat Bowditch. Nat is great at figures and he has great perseverance. Nat has just been taken out of school to help his dad make barrels for ships. But he wasn't good at it at all. So his dad got him indentured for 9 years at Ropes and Hodges. Afterwards he went on a ship and found out a new way to work lunars. After his first ship ride he went on several others and found over 2,000 mistakes in a book written by scientist. But don't get to atached to the characters 
 I bought this DVD for my girlfriend and she was very happy with it. Very good picture clarity and sound quality 
 RATM (the album) is quite possibly the greatest rock album of all time.  Blending a unique combination of tempo, bass, anger, and beats, the debut album Rage Against the Machine is a masterpiece.  Like a great cup of coffee this album combines rich, thick flavors that mix bitter and sweet for a fabulous buzz and lasting after taste.  "Two thumbs up - way up" and all of the stars that Amazon allows 
 This comic is one of the best out there. Not only is the art amazing, but the story is well written and meaningful. Unlike many traditional super hero comics, this is a book that makes you question humanity and the reactions of people to new situations. As unlikely as it is for super people to ever appear in our world, this TPB really makes you think about what would happen if people with special powers came into our world 
 A real GOOD feel and entertaining movie that has everything in it.  Mind you the acting isn't all that great but the music and dancing sure does make up for it.  You get to see how the "Lambada" should actually be danced.....no wonder they call it the forbidden dance!  Get a copy of the movie and check it out yourself.  You will not be disappointed.  I had the VHS version which was getting worn out and was keeping my fingers crossed waiting for DVD version to be released.....WoW and it has been.....so do what I did...just BUY it.  AAA for value 
 There's nothing more to say! He is amazing! This album brings a smile to my face every time I listen to it! MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!!! ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 It answers a lot of questions about how everything is the way it is.  Like: Why are the doors in the wall the size of Kong?  Where did Kong come from? Who build the wall.  What will happen to the island? It also gives a nice account after the fall of Kong.  
 the movie was very clear and the colors very bright. we were very pleased with our purchase and will continue to order from amazon,the shippment was there right when it was suppose to be, and no damage to product 
 I'm not going into the plot of The Lake House.  Other reviewers have already done a much better job on that than I can.  What I will say is that I've watched this movie on DVD at least eight times since I bought it, and the story line and acting still hold up magnificently for me.  What shifts this film from being a good love story to a great love story is the ending.  I didn't see it coming, though friends of mine said that they did.  The first time that I saw the ending, it hit me with a powerful emotional punch that left me breathless and my eyes full of tears.  That made this movie a winner in my opinion.  Like many of the other reviewers, I feel that Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock have the right chemistry with each other, and it was wonderful seeing them together again.  I would highly recommned this film to any individual who enjoyed The Notebook, Message In a Bottle, The Horse Whisperer, and The Bridges of Madison County.  Though the writers of the film used a two-year span of time between the main characters and their relationship with each other, it's still a movie about finding that one person you can love with all of your heart.  Good stuff!!!   
 If you are an Earth-goer that enjoys nature, this is a must have. This book will tell you everything from rehydrating wetlands to sprouting wild seeds, like acorns and pine cones. It will also inform of some of the DOs and DON'Ts of nature. In one segment the author, Margolin, states that you shouldn't bother making a dam for nature will always do her best to overcome obsticles. Also, keep in mind the small praire animals. There are sections in there for making homes, while not harming the land they all live on. If you don't believe me, you must get it. Now, don't just get the book, USE it, and encourage other to use it as well. It is one of the best natural guide books to keep around your home 
 Being the Holiday Season, I wanted to pick up a book that would be in spirit.  This is the book I chose and I do not regret.  The story is captivating and addicting, making it a real page turner.  One aspect I really like is the 'history of the world' feel of the text.  Not only is it a story, but we have a nice elementary education of our world since 300 AD. Get this book, borrow it, rent it... makes for a great read by yourself or two the family as well 
 If you want to gain insight into the life of F. Scott Fitzgerald then seek no further. This amazing compilation of Fitzgerald's correspondences to family, friends, business associates and acquaintances portrays the man and  the writer in a way no biographer could imagine. In his letters can be  clearly seen Fitzgerald the literary genius, Fitzgerald the loving husband  and father as well as Fitzgerald the sycophant and Fitzgerald the tortured  and insecure neurotic.The genesis and the demise of one of the most  fascinating men of his time eloquently presented in his own words 
 Einstein's theory seeks to unite time, space and impliedly distance and light phenomena into a rational set of equations which are congruent to the Euclidian geometry. In essence, the concept of time is meaningless except in relation to light . Without light, there would be no reference point for measuring distance in space because the whole area would be dark and unidentifiable for scientific measurement and comparison purposes. The use of the volumetric triple integral seeks to make a measurement on 3-planes.  i.e. x,y and z Later in the work, Einstein explains that the laws of configuration of rigid bodies with respect to K' do not agree with the laws of configuration of rigid bodies that are in accordance with Euclidean geometry. He provides an example wherein two similar clocks rotate simultaneously on the periphery and the center of a circle, then judged from K- the clock on the periphery will go slower than the clock at the center. He explains this difference as the result of the gravitational field influence as determinants in the metric laws of the space and time continuum. What happens when the clocks are in a perfect vacuum? In addition, time travel is a function of how light travels. Finite differences in the radii of the clocks (periphery and center) imply distances with slight changes in respect to the time light takes to travel from one end of the radii (periphery or center) to the other. In the Riemann Tensor, Einstein depicts an amorphous masse dependent upon the path of displacement. The outline of the masse approximates a square so that the area or volume is determinate by approximation to the closest geometric form to the amorphous masse  i.e.  a square  On page 92, Einstein states that the rate of a clock is slower the greater is the masse of the ponderable matter in the neighborhood. This comports with the theory and computation of inertia. As the base and height increases, the inertial computation is geometrically greater in accordance with the formulas of inertia [ ((b x h^3)/12)  ]. In the discussion of Mach, Einstein states that the inertia of a body must increase when ponderable masses are piled in the neighborhood. This is proven by computing inertia utilizing more massive bases and heights. As the base and height increases, the inertial computation is geometrically greater thereby proving that the inertia of a body must increase when ponderable masses are piled up in the neighborhood.  Einstein discusses the theory of Mach in relation to inertia and the mutual action of bodies. The actual measurement of Mach has at least 3 different levels; namely, subsonic, sonic and supersonic measurements  Einstein argues that the hypothesis that the universe is infinite and Euclidean at infinity is complicated from the relativistic point of view. The universe expands and contracts . Accordingly, the nature tends to approximate non-Euclidean or quasi-Euclidean objects in the evolution toward the expansive and infinite state which Einstein postulates as potentially Euclidean in order.  Einstein argues against an infinite space by stating:  " 1. From the standpoint of the theory of relativity , to postulate a closed universe is very much simpler than to postulate the corresponding boundary condition at infinity of the quasi-Euclidian structure of the universe.   2. The idea that Mach expressed, that inertia depends upon the mutual action of bodies, is contained, to a first approximation, in the equations of the theory of relativity; it follows from these equations that inertia depends, at least in part upon mutual actions between masses.  3. An infinite universe is possible only if the mean density of matter in the universe vanishes. Although such an assumption is logically possible, it is less probable than the assumption that there is a finite mean density of matter in the universe."  Critique:  The idea of a closed universe is simpler. It comports with experience. For instance, why does Haley's Comet return every 75 years. The idea of an infinite universe would imply the existence of a less dense outer-superstructure. As objects hurled in space, they would be drawn into the less dense regions. The idea of a bounded universe implies a boundary to ricochet speeding objects. Otherwise, every speeding object would continue into an infinite universe with a denseless path of space.  To prove the third postulate, scientists must have better information on the mean density at the outer edges of the universe. Does density remain constant or does it evaporate with greater distances toward the universe boundary regions? If a boundary exists as postulated in the finite universe, what is the boundary? Is the boundary a wall in space? If so, what exists beyond the wall? At the corners of the universe, what structures exist to modulate areas of higher density and less density or infinitestimal density? In addition, there is a theory of an expanding universe. How does the universe expand and what outer region accomodates this expansion. The idea of an expanding universe admits to an expanding boundary. Again, this poses the earlier question. i.e. There must be free space to accomodate an expanding universe. Is this free space dense or denseless.  This concept is similar to a computer gigobyte superstructure. Users can define different regions on the computer disc. These regions consist of utilized space and free space. Conceptually, the universe may be seen in the same way. It consists of both bounded and unbounded space 
 Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle ...It's a long cheesy title on a movie with an equally cheesy premise. That's what makes this movie so much fun to watch. I have a soft spot for B-movies. The strong effort by the actors often makes them superior to the "A" movies Hollywood produces.  Cannibal Women Features Shannon Tweed as a professor of feminist studies enlisted by the government to go into the "Avocado Jungle" to deal with the Cannibal women so the United States can have a steady supply of Avocados. It seems the army has sent in soldiers and all was left of them were their dog tags. The women with tore the men into strips and ate them with guacamole dip! Accompanying the professor on this dangerous mission is valley girl Bunny and a sexist guide who can't read a map played by Bill Maher Before he became a talk show host on "Politically Incorrect". On their journey in the Avocado jungle the professor debates feminist theory with the sexist guide. These arguments are hilarious! In the jungle they run into some sensitive guys who Maher tries to "man up" with disastrous results. Afterward they're captured by the Cannibal women who have had their tribe taken over by a radical feminist. Adrienne Barbeau is a hoot as the Feminist professor who takes over the tribe and puts our group of explorers in peril. I won't give the rest away the climax of this movie is TOO good to be spoiled. The plot is ridiculous, and the actors know it. They play it straight anyway and their excellent performances make this movie so good. In the face of a cheesy script poor production values, a low budget and skimpy costumes they make it work. I highly recommend you get this movie and a bowl of popcorn on Saturday night. Cannibal Women is a B-movie that scores all A's with me. 
 Once in a while, movie gem reaches out and touches your soul.  I have added this film to my collection of favorites, and those I will savor when I need a gut wrenching cry.  I was literally emotionally drained after watching it.  The story is set in Hell's Kitchen, among the despair of poverty and addictions.  A young Irish couple with their two daughters move to the neighborhood to try to establish a new life....overshadowed by the loss of their son at five years old.  I find myself drawn in the family, deeply sharing their anguish and triumphs.  One scene had me on the edge of my seat....at a street fair when the father is trying to win an ET doll for his youngest daughter.  I won't tell you the outcome.  The youngest daughter, Ariel, has a spirit about her, a curiosity and charisma which brings caring people into the fold of the family.  She is bold and unafraid, yet she yearns for the love of her father, who is emotionally distant following the death of his son.  The oldest daughter, Kristine, is wise beyond her years.  She successfully camptures life on her camcorder, which she uses constantly, almost a video diary if you will.    The mother is strong and loves her husband with all her heart.  Her husband has shut her out of his emotionbal life, also, and she struggles to deal with that.  She is the glue which binds her family together.  Their neighbor, the "screaming man" of the building, is a tormented young artist.  The words on his door say it all "KEEP AWAY".  I won't give away the plot with his role.  A MUST SEE.....I cried, I stopped for a bit, I cried again.  I couldn't stop crying.  Okay, so I cried at Lion King, too...but that's beside the point.  I loaned this movie to my neighbor immediately after, with red puffy eyes.  She understands.  
 From the first page, this book gets you hooked. This series has a mixture of everything - happiness, sorrow, romance, family problems, and so much more. I am not really a "horse-person", but i LOVE these books. I completely recommend this series to anyone of any age. They are really worth it!! Lauren Brooke really knows how to get into your "heartland". :- 
 A year ago, I happen to catch a segment of 48 Hours News Show on CBS, where they had a test of two identical twins oversize female models.  One was to do the Power of 10 and the other the areobics workout in a gym.    In addition to this, it show two famous TV news reporter/host doing the Power Of 10 - Barbara Walters and Lesley Stahl.  I known watching them workout that this was for real!  I been doing the Power Of 10 for the past 8 months and it is as advertised.  You will gain muscle mass and be toned.  You do it only once a week for 20-30 minutes.  That all!  Nothing else is needed.  I look forward to doing the Power Of 10 now and it is a very uplifting experience!  It is a painful and exhausting workout but it only last for 30 minutes or less.  Alot of people who have not workout hard before; may not like it and quit.  But if you were an athlete in school and did weight training for football or wrestling or similar training routine; it will be easy for you to get with the mind set of the burn and experience the pain all over again! After all; if Barbara Walter and Lesley Stahl can take it; you must be quite a "sissy" to not be able to stand it!  The nutrition section of the book tells you what to eat for healthy eating and weight loss.  It is roughly 1/3 of the book!  You must follow this step fairly closely to go along with the workout if you wish to loose weight.  After all; if you eat alot of sugar in your diet; you have to change your habit!  The book explains this in detail.  So if you would like to start eating right, getting stronger and loose the weight, and workout only 20-30 minutes a week; get the Power Of 10! It fast and you will love it because it will make you happy!    
 Full disclaimer ... I reviewed this book a decade ago. Back then I thought Furtwangler had written a smart, unpretentious book. I still think that. If you're looking for insight without the same-old-same-old on this tired subject, check out Acts of Discovery. Also check out the collection of essays edited by Kris Fresonke and Mark Spence. Very worthwhile 
 Pyramid Quest is an excellent inquiry into ancient wisdom, truth, and the mysteries, not only of The Great Pyramid, but of life itself. It is an amazingly well written measurement of man's quest for meaning. Dr. Schoch powerfully outlines, describes, and captures the heart of the mystery that is The Great Pyramid.  
 I have read all of Robert Ludlums books, they are all great reading. It's a shame we will have no more of his writings 
 I asked Martin if he was ever going to write more and he said, then, that he was too busy with Wild Cards.  Well, George, Wild Cards are OVER, we want more TUF!!!!!  And cats, some how, even with fixing all my cats I'm following Tuf in numbers 
 This is just a great comedy for everyone..although those of us old enough to have watched the original TV show will surely appreciate it more.  Dan Aykroyd was a huge fan of the show and his homage to the show is evident throughout.  Tom Hanks is great, too!  He's such a good comic actor and this role was perfect for him.  Their chemistry as actors is outstanding 
 This book is not only very informative and well written but also manages to be reasonably impartial on some of the hottest issues in international relations. The tone chances slightly when Pelham takes over from Mansfield but this is also when we approach the present time. I appreciated the fact that criticism is not one-sided as undoubtedly the Israel-vs-Palestinians problem cannot be summarized by placing all blame on any one side. In fact, I found the exposition more balanced and less negative against Israel than I was expecting from somebody who studied arabic in Damascus and is currently living in Jordan. Perhaps the Pelham portion would deserve only 4 stars but the rest of the book would be 5+. I would have appreciated a few more and more informative maps but an overall 5 is well deserved. 
 I've now read this book at least ten times, and every time I do it seems to get better. Butler is a bridge between the Victorian and 20th century novelist--although the book has some of the heavily stylized writing of the 19th century, the thinking is pure 20th. I read it first as a teenager, and was pleased to see that the hero's parents were depicted as well-meaning but foolish, and ultimately harmful, people. (This was in the late 1960s, and I thought, "Wow, just like mine!") Likewise, other 1960s thinking peered out from behind its Victorian curtains: organized religion is scorned, as is too much conformity and too little curiosity.   Yet when I read it again last year, it seemed like the perfect antidote the Bush years, with its high degree of common sense and empathy--just as it seemed like a warning to the excesses of the 1980 Reagan years. Like most classics, this book works for every era, and for every reader.  It's also funny, smart, and psychologically years ahead of its time. If I had only one book to take to a desert island, this would be it. You can read it over and over and always enjoy it.  
 This is another good story in the line of alphabet mysteries by Sue Grafton. Her few "detours" from great writing in previous "letters" seem to have been a minor bump in the road and she now returns to a good plot and strong characters.  I have to admit that one of my favorite characters in this series is Henry Pitt, Kinsey Millhone's landlord and friend. I enjoyed the Henry who wrote crossword puzzles and tried them out on Kinsey before he sent them in for publication. I enjoyed the Henry who always had something baking in his kitchen. And many times I have wondered why some sexy senior citizen hasn't snagged this wonderful catch of a man!  This story gives us a little more insight into Henry than we've seen in the past. Henry convinces Kinsey to help a friend of his on a simple matter - she needs to show that Henry's friend served in the military during World War II so he can be buried as a veteran. Such a simple request and it should have a simple solution, but as we've seen with Kinsey in the past, nothing is an easy task, so the plot thickens...   The family of the deceased is too busy fighting among themselves to be much help to Kinsey. Then an old friend shows up and gets attacked at the dead guy's apartment.  Once again we're on a race to see what's around the next corner for Kinsey and to find out why the government has no record of this veteran serving his country.   There's a little bit of mystery, but more suspense in this book. And more laughs than we've seen in the past with Grafton's other books. I'd recommend this easy read to anyone wanting a few hours of enjoyment as it's definitely one of Sue Grafton's better books in this series. I only hope she will continue with this quality and not hit any more bumps that throw her off to only mediocre writing! 
 I found this book by far the most helpful of all six or seven books I bought on the subject.  It gives good, non-intuitive guidance, and even includes what to do *after* you are accepted so you can hit the ground running once you start your MBA program. I'm glad I had this book 
 I just received this book and have read only the introductory matierial and chapter one as yet, but this is a book I will keep in my home library.  Each line(s) of the Tanya is explained by Rabbi Steinsaltz in language that even allows one not trained in Kabbalah and Hassidism to understand.  As a Christian who is studying Kabbalah, this book has opened a new and deeper understanding for me of many of the teachings in Kabbalah by tying them to verses in the Torah, Talmud, and other writings which would otherwise be inaccessible to me.  Rabbi Steinsaltz has helped me wade into the waters of Rabbi Ashlag's writings as well.  A book for seekers after Wisdom 
 A great, emotional, refreshing album.  Holly is an accomplished instrumentalist (piano, dulcimer, guitar) and singer-songwriter.  My only criticism of this album is that it sounds as if Tori Amos, Sarah McLachlan and Joni Mitchell got thrown in a music-blender, but not quite blended enough, because one song will sound like Sarah McLachlan and the next one like Tori Amos and so on.  It's noticeable that the most derivative songs are written by Holly herself and that the ones that come closest to having a unique sound are ones that she co-writes.  Having said that, it is a great album, it just hasn't got enough of her own sound, despite showing real emotional and musical maturity.  Giving It Up For You - 4 Stars.   This song is clearly radio-bound and it's a great song, despite obvious influences (Tori Amos).  It's a strange choice to begin the album because the beginning of it sounds just like 'Live To Tell' by Madonna.  This song doesn't display the same emotional maturity as the rest of the album and this is shown in over dramatic lyrics like "I take a lot of medicine I don't really need".  But it's a great song and I'd give it 5 stars if it didn't have such a Tori Amos feel to it.  Wanted - 5 Stars.  This one should be all over your radio anytime soon.  Great song!  What I Wouldn't Give - 5 Stars.  Far and away the best song on the album.  The song begins with the most beautiful piano and voice and builds into a gorgeous refrain:  What I wouldn't give just to forget So I can remember how to live again  This song has such great words.  How can you not love the poetry of describing herself feeling "dissonant and distracted"?  Like Blood Like Honey - 4 Stars.  A beautiful, simple song that highlights Hollys voice and guitar playing.  One of my favorite songs on the album.  Curious - 4.5 Stars.  This one was written solely by Holly and it is fantastic.  Flawed, yes, but for that fantastic hook you can forgive anything.  It starts out sounding very much like Sarah McLachlan's 'Do What You Have To Do' from the album Surfacing but once the hook kicks in...  Wow.  She is definitely earning her label of 'the new Sarah McLachlan' here.  There are some points in the song where the melody seems to lose the plot.  A flawed jewel, ending with the emotive line "there are too many unanswered questions that I hold on to...  like You".  Saturdays - 4 Stars.  This is one of the 'Tori Amos' sounding songs.  It starts with a mischievous, jumping rhythm with Holly indulging her slightly drama queen tendencies ("time to kill, take a pill...").  Again, you have to forgive it because of the melodies that come later for "Stop pushing all your tragedies away".  It has a beautiful melody in the middle that I wish was repeated in the song.  Again And Again - 4 Stars.  If 'Curious' is the most Sarah McLachlan styled song on the album, this one is the most obvious Tori Amos sounding song, but a great song nonetheless.  Heavy - 2 Stars.  This song is very much like Sarah McLachlan given a slightly jazzy makeover but with a shot of Tori Amos thrown in for good measure.  Still Love - 2 Stars.  This song is very much like Sarah McLachlan given a slightly jazzy makeover - but hold the shot of Tori Amos this time.  All Will Be Forgotten - 3 Stars.  This song is moody, reflective and melodic and also has some of the best 'no expense spared' production that makes this album stand out.  Holly doesn't yet seem to realize her musical maturity and this is shown through lyrics like "little things like these are good to keep my silly mind from wandering".  Cellar Door - 3 Stars.  This song draws heavily on the chords and melodies of Joni Mitchell, starting with smoky, threatening jazz-influenced piano and vocals and building up to a more mainstream rock ending 
 A nifty widget of the highest order. It projects on the ceiling automatically corrected time and outdoor temperature. In addition it tells indoor temperature and weather predictions at least as good as the local weatherman. Most alarms enrage when awakening, this one is very pleasant but persistent if necessary. The instruction manual seems like it was written by someone that had a taxi waiting but you can stumble through to the correct setting in time. I am very happy with this item 
 This book is about the transformations that can occur thru the practice of yoga.  It is an easy read, but has true depth and soul that true practitioners can relate to.  I enjoyed this book even more than Stephen Cope's previous book which is also a good read.  I recommend this book to anyone who is dedicated and wishes to achieve a deeper understanding of how to use their body and mind to evolve spiritually 
 Secret Survivors is to me a milestone in the understanding of incest. Reading it amounted to a few years of therapy: it was a revelation to realize what I'd been through is known to others. Secret Survivors contains texts I had believed were unique to my experience. Now I know other victims heard them too!  The book helped me formulate thoughts and ideas and made me more aware.  It is now very precious to me! I think everyone should read it, survivors, those who love them and want to help, therapists, and anyone who cares about people.  
 This book is inspiring, moving, thought-provoking, and smart. Not only did I love it...it loved me back. It challenged me to think more sincerely about what I could be doing, and to continue my daily work to align with my Higher Purpose. And it confirmed my impressions of Ms. Huffington -- highly intelligent, conscious, purposeful, compassionate, tenacious, loving, and of course fearless -- a woman who wants all people to practice self-love and to experience dignity and a good life and who will show up to do her part in making that a reality. 
 I enjoyed this book.  It was a good read and faithful to the shows.  I have also enjoyed the rest in this series 
 this took me a while to figure out but now that i know how to use it i like i 
 My wife and I have been following MONK for years.  When I received this as a Christmas gift I was elated, although the next few nights were filled with MONK and his antics as a phobia-ridden, ousted detective, solving case after case, yet never quite able to get back into the police department.  It's more than a commedy.  It has action for you guys who, like me, need their dose of adrenaline.  It has touching romantic sequences about him and his wife, the one murder Monk has been unable to solve.  It is, however, filled with comedy.  Sometimes this comedy takes you to the edge.  One scene has Monk filling in for an English teacher.  No problem, right?  Wrong.  He believes he must write his name on the blackboard so that the class knows who he is.  What follows is excrutiating.  Every letter, every line in every letter must be perfect.  Tony Shaloub has made his mark upon the world with this character.  Although he's played many other parts, this part is taylor made for him and he portrays it to perfection.  I can hardly wait to get the next season 
 An Excellent collection of true Hawaiian Music. This is the CD most hotels use when your wondering around their properties Excellent :) Aloha  
 Dictionary of English Surnames is a very complete book that lists many many English Surnames, and it tells of certain ancestors of the name and where they came from, and what the surname means.  It is a very helpful resource for amateur geneologists, or just someone fascinated by the Last Name.  THe beginning of the books tells about Surnames and how they came to be etc etc.  It is very fascinating and the authors do a very good job at explaining things.  Great source...get it 
 The breadth and depth of this documentary is nothing short of amazing.  It's an extraordinary achievement as a film and this DVD is the optimal way to experience it, with a wealth of bonus msterial and a commentary track from Lee that is nearly as worthwhile as the feature itself 
 In a competitive, capitalist economy, nothing is more prized than the whiz-bang invention, the why-didn't-I-think-of-that product or service that defines a market, delights consumers and gushes profits. Yet for all the ink spilled over innovation, remarkably few businesspeople understand exactly how to mint revolutionary new products. Innovation expert Geoffrey A. Moore delves under the hood of the new economy to create this roadmap to creative thinking. Although the text at times bogs down in jargon and a dizzying degree of detail, he cites plenty of sharp real-world examples, including an inside view of Cisco Systems. We recommend this user's manual to innovation to anyone who thinks that survival is not an end goal, but just a place to get started. 
 This book probably should not be treated as "capitalist manifesto" a la Marx but more like an attempt to present a position opposite to famous Galbraith "The Affluent Society" (1958). Reading the book without reading Galbraith first creates an impression of cheap advocacy of capitalism and unrestricted market almost in best libertarian (anarcho-capitalist) style. But as a polemic with Galbraith vision of post-capitalism (post-industrial society) the book looks like an interesting historical document.   In his book Galbraith stressed that to become successful, post-WWII America should invest heavily in infrastructure (highways, phone infrastructure, etc) as well as education using funds from general taxation and government intervention. At the same time he felt that the government power should be balanced against the power of capitalists using some countervailing forces (he mistakenly assumed that unions can play such a role). He also noted that large companies are actually exempted from competition on a national level because they are closely linked with the state and competition is limited to small companies (and most of their profits are expropriated by banks, landlords and state). In essence he argued that the USA society is no longer a capitalist society but some different dualistic social organization that combines elements of socialism (planning) for the largest firms and government (macroeconomics) with limited "free market" capitalism for small fish (microeconomics). Many argues that GM troubles proved that Galbraith was wrong. But if you look at GM problems it's clear that it was not national competitors who squeezed Detroit.   Friedman definitly was the most intellectually astute opponent of Galbraith post-industrial society vision. He pointed out that the great virtue of the market is that it enables people who hate each other to cooperate economically. But most of the content of the book is detached from reality and looks like a draft of yet another utopia. Sometimes the level of radicalism of this advocate of "free market" suggests that he is closer to socialists (especially Trotskyites) then conservatives and from defender of "status quo" turned into promoter of a new and dangerous social utopia, a new economic messiah who preached that free market + fiat money used with a specific rule of money stock expansion (3-5% per year ) will save mankind. Freidman's libertarian-style absolutization of the market ("In Goldman Sacks we trust" using Galbraith catch phase) as well as advocacy of fiat money (he played a role in the USA unilateral withdrawal from gold standard) in a way makes Friedman's views very similar to Marxists (extremes meet), although his utopia proved to be definitly less costly for mankind. It's funny that the latest administration that proclaims "market, markets" and praise Friedman actually behaves more like "Military Keynesians" then "free market" advocates. The same was true for Reagan. Still it was during Reagan's years when conservatism had grown into more and more dangerously utopian social vision ready for dangerous experiments with society.   Freidman's arguments that planning is unnecessary and that market forces have built-in checks and balances and can do wonders if they are freed from any and all government intervention can be understood seriously only in context of polemics with the representative of the opposite extreme views (statists). For readers in 2006 and especially European readers it's clear that Friedman's views of the market are anti-historic and "free market" described in the book never existed and probably will never exist in human history. Market never exists in vacuum and always is intrinsically connected and always experience significant level of control by the government (level greater then roles of an arbiter of disputes and the provider of the currency presuppose). The opposite is also true and market tend to influence government in many ways, especially dangerous if there are large national firms which depends by-and-large on government contracts (military industrial complex). Some proposed in his book "solutions" like eliminating medical profession licensing in the name of free market are pretty bizarre.   It looks like the main problem with Friedman's book is that unlike Galbraith he did not understand the importance of balancing government power with the freedom for market forces. Extreme positions that proclaim advantage of a single social force always look extremely dangerous. For example if everything is just a "free market" why buying politicians should be prohibited ? Is not this a discrimination against free market? (the same question is applicable to judiciary). What about the danger of natural creation of heredary elite by market forces and resulting "natural" conversion of parliamentary democracy into oligarchy (like "Iron law of oligarchy" presuppose) ?   Failing to address those problems makes his book mostly irrelevant for the reader in 2006, but still important as a historical document that criticized Galbraith views (it was Galbraith who coined the term "countervailing power".) Today we face the fundamental question: at which point "laissez-faire" capitalism/"unrestricted market" and associated with it corruption of government should be stopped (and some too hot and/or crooked practitioners probably jailed) and where and when unchecked state powers expansion should be stopped (preferably with similar type of punishment) to prevent sliding of society into also stagnant and completely corrupt version of "well developed socialism, Brezhnev's style."  Society probably needs to deal with the market the way tennis players deal with tennis racket: if player holds it too tightly his game suffer, but is he/she holds it too loose he cannot play well either. In this respect "former socialist countries" were not so much socialist (the famous joke in the USSR was that any "capitalist" European country contains more communists then the whole USSR) but countries with too powerful and unbalanced by any other forces government. And it was probably the internally grown oligarchy and not initiated by Reagan arm race (" military keysianism") that eventually defeated communist party control of the state, the oligarchy the was naturally created by the state after WWII and consisted to a large extent of party members in high positions. They were direct beneficiaries of the system collapse that happened with blessing (and probably financial help) of those oligarchs under the weight of economic problems and siege of nationalist forces. In a way we can believe in the "theory of convergence": both unrestricted "free market forces" and unrestricted government control eventually lead to the rule of oligarchy.   I am not an economist but it looks very strange that an avid advocate of "free market" is at the same time a proponent of demonetarization of gold and usage of fiat currencies. In this sense his Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (often incorrectly called Nobel Prize in Economics) looks somewhat strange. With fiat currencies  all businesses are hostages of the government.  And the ability to switch money printing press to full speed any time the government finds convenient (usually to cover war expenses) provides an easy way of confiscation of wealth of people by government without any communist coup d'ï¿½tat. How stable is the world of fiat currencies remain to be seen.   It should be noted that lately Freeman himself abandoned his "monetarist views" (and that makes chapter III, one of the central chapters of the book just a historical curiosity). But unfortunately Britain already serves as a guinea pig for his utopia. As for implementing his and other economic utopias I like the quote attributed to German Iron Canceller Otto von Bismarck about suggestion of one of German parliamentarians to implement socialism; I do not remember exact wording but it sounded like this: "OK let's do it, but let's first choose for this experiment a country, that we do not care about". 
 Awesome Book!  But you will never want to enter a public place again, the scariest thing about this book is the fact that it is true 
 I first got a whiff of Blue in a magazine advertisement, when it came out and, it was love from that moment. I went out and purchased it and, this is all I wear now. It is all I want to wear. Nothing else compares to this, for me. I get so many compliments! I had one coworker once, who would walk by me just so he could smell it. He told me what he was doing, of course, he just loved the smell. People want to know what I am wearing and where they can purchase it. I feel great when I'm wearing it and, I will keep using it as long as they will make it 
 If you read and were deeply moved by Dr. Pierre Barbet's book on the crucifixion you absoulutley will want to read Dr. Zugibe's masterful work. He very gently but firmly shows some of the mistakes Barbet made but doesn't  hesitate to give him credit for the things he was right about.   Zugibe is a curious man and he investigated and discects every possible theory about Christ's death on the cross. The book is not for the faint of heart, as the earlier reivewer notes but it is an amazing scientific and yet mystical look into the horrifying suffering that a crucified man would have suffered. The chapters on the scourging and the crowing with thorns are particularly moving. I actually cried and there were times when I had to put the book down becuase it is incredibly touching. I expected the book to be cold and dry but Zugibe is a pretty good writer. He's produced a masterwork. There is not a finer book on the physical aspects of the crucifixion in print.   
 Roger Shattuck has written on Marcel Proust and his "In Search of Lost Time" for over forty years, and in PROUST'S WAY: A Field Guide he describes the book for the current generation of readers, who now have many choices for how to approach the work. The book contains portions both for those who haven't made their way through even the first volume yet, as well as chapters for those champion readers who want to look back and reflect on the whole seven-volume work.  Material for those who haven't--or have barely--begun includes a biography of Proust, some discussion of his general aesthetics, and "How to Read a Roman-Fleuve". This last part is useful as it gives several charts to understand how characters relate to each other. There are some "spoilers" here, although it's hardly more than you'd learn from the dust covers of the Modern Library editions, and Proust isn't just about plot anyway. There's also a very helpful graph here of how in the course of the novel the protagonist ends up a failure, while at the same time the narrator becomes a success.  For the reader who has made it through the entire Recherche, there are several chapters providing a critical view of Proust's literary technique and themes. Shattuck identifies four scenes at the heart of the Recherche as encapsulating a distincting comic vision, which many readers miss because of its very obviousness. Shattuck writes on Proust's notions of memory and recognition, as well as art and idolatry. Very fascinating is Shattuck's venture on what the structure of the Recherche is, what holds it together during seven volumes and four thousand pages, as well as what it might have become had its author only lived long enough to tie up loose ends.  For me the most interesting chapter was "Continuing Disputes", suitable for all readers, even those who don't know if they want to embark on the Recherche. The author writes a passionate, though not entirely convincing, polemic against the 1987 Gallimard "Pleiade" text, where there's almost as much cut text and critical material present as there is the final novel. He also talks about English translations, explaining exactly how Kilmartin and then Enright revised the old Moncrieff version. It is a pity that this was written a bit too early to cover the new Penguin version, with each book done by a different translator. Film adaptations are also mentioned. Shattuck admires the Pinter screenplay, and I agree that Proust fans should check it out. The last two portions of this chapter are on philosophical notions in Proust, which I found overly academic for a book marketed to the layman.  You don't *have* to read this or any other guide before starting on the Recherche (as Proust's masterwork is often called, from the abbreviation of its French title). Proust's work is massive in its proportions, but fairly easy to follow; you just have to stick with it. Still, for those interested in the general subject of his novel, guides like this provide something entertaining to read 
 C.W. Nichol's recounting of his experiences learning the Martial Ways in Japan is a must for any serious practioner.  This is a book I purchase for each of my students to give them an idea of what they should aspire to 
 I was going to take a look at this to see if I wanted to read it.  I've always admired Vonnegut's work, especially Slaughter-House-Five (1966).  I looked up an hour later and realized I had read it!  Vonnegut has gotten a little curmudgeony in his old age, and cynical.  But who can blame him?  He grew up in the depression and then witnessed the fire-bombing of Dresden as a POW.  He saw the footage about the Holocaust.  He lived through Vietnam and the Cold War, and especially through the decline of America that has become exponential since George W. took office.  In other words, as a world class writer in his 83rd year, he makes a fine spokesman for our times.  Let me quote a bit from this very readable, delightful, and (as usual with Vonnegut) wryly amusing little tome:  "By saying that our leaders are power-drunk chimpanzees, am I in danger of wrecking the morale of our soldiers fighting and dying in the Middle East?  Their morale, like so many lifeless bodies, is already shot to pieces.  They are being treated, as I never was, like toys a rich kid got for Christmas." (p. 72)   That "rich kid" would be  (a) Bush  (b) Cheney  ï¿½) Rumsfeld  (d) all of the above.  "War is now a form of TV entertainment." (p. 88)  "Shrapnel was invented by an Englishman of the same name.  Don't you wish you could have something named after you?" (p. 88)  "I was once asked if I had any ideas for a really scary reality TV show.  I have one reality show that would really make your hair stand on end: 'C-Students from Yale.'" (p. 99)  "Only nut cases want to be president.  This was true even in high school.  Only clearly disturbed people ran for class president." (p. 102)  "Our daily news sources, newspapers and TV, are now so craven, so unvigilant on behalf of the American people, so uninformative, that only in books do we learn what's really going on." (p. 103)  Part of the book consists of artwork by Vonnegut, a self-sketch, some plot graphs (for novels or stories), and some pithy sayings from him hand-lettered and autographed.  Vonnegut comes from an artistic family, so he feels licensed, I suppose.  The text contains some blue titles and stars throughout that are agreeable.  There is just enough of this so as not to distract from what Vonnegut does best, that is write ironically amusing prose that is light and weighty at the same time.  In an "Author's Note" he asks if the artwork is any good, and then wonders how one might tell a good picture from a bad one.  Good question.  He recalls asking a painter named Syd Solomon, who "gave me the most satisfactory answer I ever expect to hear.  He said, 'Look at a million pictures, and you can never be mistaken.'" (p. 145)  I haven't read a million books, but I've read a few thousand, and I can tell you that this book, which looks to be Vonnegut's last, is a great read from a wise old man who never forgets the reader 
  About one month before my book hit the bookstores and amazon, I read John Kremer's book.  I was so mad at myself for not reading it earlier.  While reading John's book, I put a start next to all the ideas that I thought would work for me.  By the time I finished the book, I had a book marketing plan.  The biggest problem with the plan is that I was late on steps that I should have started months before publication date that are clearly outlined in John's book. Now I have an orderly plan with ideas and contacts that I would have never considered before reading John's book.    His new edition also does a great job covering internet marketing which today is extremely important.    John has so many excellent ideas and so many contacts to implement the ideas that it is inconceivable that every author would not derive enormous benefits from buying and reading this book. His table of contents and index are so detailed, you can easily find whatever you are looking for.     I have also found that lots of clients entertain dreams about writing a book.  I tell people thinking about writing a book to think about the marketing of the book before they even write it.  I actually bought a case of John's books and have been passing them out to people that mention they are thinking about writing a book.  People LOVE getting this book as a gift.  It is the best business gift for less than $30 that I know.      James Lange, CPA/Attorney, Author, Retire Secure 
 This book was a great resource for my child's application to the Academy. It provided insight and helpful tips on how to maximize your chances of getting that coveted 'letter of assurance'. AND, it talks to the parents about what things will be like and what you can AND shouldn't do to help. Definitely a must have for anyone even thinking about a service academy or their parents 
 I throughly enjoyed this book. I just wish it had been longer. It was written well and had a real feel to it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes books on personal hauntings. 
 In her book Teaching Outside the Box: How to Grab Your Students by Their Brains, LouAnne Johnson gives a lot of helpful tips to new teachers and gives some ideas to more seasoned teachers that might help improve their style. 	As great as this book is it dose have its flaws.  Through out much of the book it seems to be aimed at primary education as apposed to secondary education.  Some of the ideas about lessons and seating aren't practical in high school. The language is easy to understand and to read through.  This book might be a little under some more seasoned teachers.  This book is perfect for the college student looking to become a primary educator but it is also good for anyone wondering if teaching is for them. 
 I loved this movie, however, I'm not sure how people outside of Texas will like it.  Filled with talented young actors (3 of the 4 leads were in "Can't Hardly Wait" oddly enough), this movie is subtle in its approach to 4 friends who have recently graduated high school and are looking to set out on their own.  A coming of age tale I highly recommend 
 Inspiring, encouraging, compelling. This book is a must have for those who know they possess leadership traits. I had to read this book for a class and was truly impressed. In addition, I was able to implement the certain aspects of the book while holding an office of VP in a student orgainzation. Wow! it really works and is not over abrasive like JW book. Get it, Read it, Use it, Repeat it. 
 Excellent reading for anyone trying to start or get a business going 
 This Spiderman blew me away.  There are NO flaws about it at all.  It's just perfect.  It's much better than the one made in the 90's (although that one was great, would love to see it on DVD sometime but it won't happen because Marvel is too greedy) and it has unique animation.  It's 3D but it still looks and feels like a cartoon. Each episode is extremely well written and directed.  All the animated shots of Spiderman are superb.  He actually moves like a spider, much more so than other animated versions of this series.   All the action sequences were more exciting than any other Spiderman movie or series ever made.  I don't know why Marvel would only make ONE season of the best work they've ever done and leave us with such a cliffhanger season finale.  For diehard fans, that's a pretty nasty thing to do.  They probably won't make season 2.  Good thing it was released on DVD, at least we can appreciate the greatness Marvel once had before they decided to trash everything good thing they made 
 Sweeney St. George has been working on an exhibit for almost three years.  Now, she's just putting the finishing touches on "Still as Death," an exhibit on the art of mourning over the centuries.  The exhibit is being held at the Hapner on the Cambridge campus where she teaches.  While trying to put the perfect finishing touches on it, she learns of an Egyptian funerary collar in the museum's collection that would be perfect.  But no one seems to be able to find it.  The last person to have it was a student who was around when the museum was robbed 25 years ago.  Not too long after, she committed suicide.  Are these events connected?  Meanwhile, Sweeney's exhibit opening is going fine, until the museum's housekeeper is found murdered down in the basement.  It looks like a botched robbery attempt.  Is history repeating itself or is this a new attempt?  This book continues to inform while it entertains with the fascinating look at the art of mourning over the years.  The focus this time is on Egyptian mourning rituals, and the information presented is interesting.  Of course, the main focus is still entertainment.  The mystery here is the strongest of the series, with several twists I should have seen coming but didn't.  Meanwhile, Sweeney's personal life takes some interested turns.  The main characters are here and as strong as ever.  Even police office Tim Quinn didn't bother me this time around.  The secondary characters seemed a bit weak this time, but that is a minor complaint.  This book left me hungry for more.  Fans of the series will be glad to see Sweeney's return and the book should win her and her author new fans 
 Treasure Island has that magical touch to it Walt Disney was famous for. Treasure Island teachers one at a young age not everone is who they seem. Lots of good guys and bad guys and Pirate Treasure leads to a wild ride! This film should be required for all youngsters! There is a special place in my heart for this film. This was Robert Newton's finest hour playing Long John Silver 
 I bought this for my son's 2nd birthday.  I had already read the other reviews so I already had the drill ready for assembly.  It really wasn't that bad and only took about 30 minutes for us to put together.  The parts aren't numbered but it was really easy to tell what went where because the shapes are pretty unique for each step.  My son started climbing up it before we could even get the first part together and played on it for as long as we would let him afterwards.  I would probably get something bigger for say a 5 year old but for toddlers this is perfect.  One side is open but really, who lets their toddler play outside alone 
 This book is full of wonderful theorems and other facts about geometry.  But don't miss an equally wonderful book of his - The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Numbers.  When I semi-retired several years ago, I  gave away many of my math books, but I would not part with these two 
 I've decided in this review, to do all 3 books in the Tawny Man trilogy, (that being Fool's Errand, Golden Fool and Fool's Fate), as they are intricately connected (as you might expect) in the main characters, story line and writing quality.  I enjoyed this series but with some minor reservations... let me explain  The pros:  The prose and story telling is of the highest quality with detailed description of persons, places and things. There is great character development throughout the entire trilogy; people you really like (or dislike) with a passion, and as with most fantasy novels, there is some magic and characters or creatures with special talents. The plot, although slow to develop, is interesting and intriguing; it grips you, making you eager to get back to these novels whenever you can. The writing itself has a nice, easy to read flow to it and follows in a logical sequence.  The cons: Two niggling concerns: (and loss of ½ star)  1.)The main character; ( Fitz) is best described as a reluctant hero with an overwhelming sense of guilt and continual self depreciation. In Fitz's opinion, everything that has ever gone wrong in this story can be traced back to the way he handled a situation in the past; and he is FOREVER agonizing about these thoughts (what he might have done different... etc.) Needless to say, three novels of this, and this character trait starts to wear a little thin.  2.)Lack of action; I realize a great novel does not have to have "action", however having said that, I've always liked my fantasy novels to have a fair amount of "action" with some battles or combat (large scale or small). That is not to say this series has no action, because it does, but somehow I wanted more. The few skirmishes seemed so far apart, and I must admit this was somewhat disappointing.  Although it may appear that my "concerns" mentioned above appear huge, such is not the case. This is a deep, rich fantasy series of epic proportions; well written and detailed, but just misses the mark of true greatness because of the shortcomings mentioned above. 4 ½ stars 
 This book is gorgeous in its color, close-ups, and perspectives on Mr. Johns, but perhaps "Mr. Johns's temper" would flair when he realizes throughout the book he'd find "Mr. Johns' temper." Perhaps a global spell-check changed everything reflecting Mr. Johns's last name, but gee-wiz what a horrible annoyance. I was stunned this would happen through the auspices of the National Gallery in Washington. Perhaps President Bush had a night job editing this text while reading his 60 books a year 
 This book is truly the most enjoyable sociology related text that I have read to date.  The information found in both the graphs and the text are indespinsible, at least for those of us that want to live a full and knowledgeable life.  The text is also extremely well written.  Whereas most academic books of this caliber bore the reader with terms and concepts that cannot be understood, this book does no such thing.  It consistently interesting and never confusing.  I have never read a better sociological book.  I would also like to strongly disagree with a previous review that said that this book should not be called a book.  Clearly, it is a book, as it has pages with words on them.  Clearly, whoever wrote that review should not be allowed to write reviews because The First Measured Century is definitely one of the best books ever 
 Jim Dale has the ability to bring Harry Potter and characters to life.  It is captivating.  He is the best storyteller I've ever listened to and of course, he had such great material to read!  I've got the whole set now 
 The author is not a professional historian. He does not know how to read the sources critically and is unable to select and reject the secondary literature, but he has a beautiful style, and if you're not too concerned with historical accuracy, it is a pleasing introduction to a fascinating subject. DOWN WITH GIBBON 
 Truly every recipe I've made from this cookbook is wonderful!  Having moved away from the Pacific Northwest, I also find the author's notes by each recipe make me especially nostalgic!  That aside...the food is delicious, and there are recipes for every taste 
 I have got the chance to meet the author myself as for my uncle helped Mike train his dogs and guided bird hunts in Northern Idaho and Colorado. I have got to read all of Mikes books and they are outstanding and can be seen in his view of life and nature. I have worked with a few of Mikes pups and own one today, Spring. All of these dogs are outstanding in attitude and loving passion. Mikes views on training are very humane and done in a loving manner. Mike has profected the use of love to train. I will never train any other way or buy anyone elses pups 
 This is worth reading,and if you pick up a few tricks, your all the better off.I find this to be appropriate for the young adult reader who has the attention span of a fly.Interesting enough to keep them reading 
 What ChasDaDragon forgot to mention was that "Dead Or Alive" is OVERDUBBED!  Johnny went back to the studio and re-recorded music for DOA, which was a completely unnecessary and stupid idea!!  You'll see JT walk away from the mic and he'll still be singing, for cryin' out loud!  There are some small parts of DOA where the original music is left intact, but the VAST MAJORITY of JT's vocals and guitar are studio overdubs.  It's a shame because it completely ruins the DVD.  Maybe when a bootleg audio recording of the actual DOA show makes it out there someone will do a little editing.  Anyways, "You Cant Put Your Arms Around A Memory" is a great DVD.  Johnny was in excellent form, as was Nolan.  We barely see Kane, but put the subwoofer on in 5.1 mode and he sounds great.  As for Barry Jones, former member of The London Cowboys, he does an admirable job.  He is completely in the zone during "Cant Keep My Eyes On You."  And how can anyone be criticized for not being able to harmonize with JT?  JT can't even harmonize with his own guitar most of the time!  This is a great DVD for you to see JT in action.  It didnt get much better than this, especially after 1987.  Yeah, there is only 1 camera angle, but he is in camera-shot the whole time, giving us plenty of moments to cheer at.  The best CD release of this show is "In The Flesh," which edits out between song filler 
 If you're a fan of Guaraldi's amazing songwriting and melodies, don't pass this up!  Certainly don't hesitate because there's some orchestration on a few songs.  Once you've listened a few times, the orchestration seems to belong.  This includes wonderful versions of rare gems like "Peppermint Patty" and "Red Baron" (and these are better than studio versions found elsewhere).  Also here is a terrific slow-jazz version of "Happiness Is" where Vince seems to improvise with the perfect choice of notes.  An added bonus is a (somewhat) jammed out version of the ever-popular "Cast Your Fate To the Wind" that closes out the album -- worth the price of the disc by itself.  But perhaps the best part of this is "Rain Rain Go Away".  Why this song isn't a jazz standard, I don't know.  It's one of the most beautiful, almost tear-jerking, numbers I've ever heard.  This is a real treat to have access to these versions of these songs.  I give it 5 stars because of the beautiful melodies here and the opportunity to hear a rare-well-performed/arranged set of Guaraldi's songs.  If you like his music, definitely do not pass on this one...  
 If you are unaware that most of what is broadcast as fact is really only Theoretic because even when a scientific study has been done but not repilicated it is still only someone's theory, this book will be an eye opener. As another author has said, "There are statistics, statistic and damned lies." On the other hand if you are not "up" for having your pet theory debunked as junk science better not read this book. 
 What a wonderful book! Being a newlywed, there are many things about cooking that I didn't know, but now I do thanks to this book! I love the detailed instructions, the pictures, and the breakdown of the recipes! I'm going to save this book to pass on to my future daughters 
 Loved the Arthur's Court Punch Bowl.  Shipping was great.  Couldn't have been easier. j 
 Their mysterious, spicy fragrances work their magic on the townfolk, and soon business is booming. This infectious novel of magic realism enchanted me with characters like the headstrong hairdresser Fiona Athey; Fr. Fergal Mahoney, the stand-up-comedian turned priest; the gentle, lonely widow Estelle Delmonico; and, of course, the three sisters themselves, whose lives they left behind in revolution-era Iran affect their present in Ireland.Mehran's book is creative and memorable. Its  rich In imagery and characters and if you like good food, and the scent of fresh herbs and spices, you'll want to walk into the Babylon Cafe and the pages of POMEGRANATE SOUP straight away. Well Don 
 I've always been interested in this subject, but could never find enough information on the evolution of the English language. Thank god for this book, it is full, and has writing samples from different time periods and places, as well as back stories that tell when the language changed 
 Scott Carrier runs to the edge of a high, dry place and observes: "Here it is, Reality; but the reality of what?" The answer comes back as the echo of laughter in the hills. Haunting and wonderful 
 If you are tired of the cookie cutter, assembly line garbage that passes  for country music these days, then pick up this CD for a refreshing change.   if you are looking for a singer who makes you sit up and pay attention to  the lyrics, then this album is a must have.  The songs run the gamut  emotionally.  From tear jerkers such as Blue Wing and Veteran's Day, to  foot stomping tunes like Gallo del Cielo this album covers all the bases 
 This set was for my 10 year old grandson who has been asking for it for months. What can I say, with lego you can't go wrong. The price was right and shipping was free. I didn't even have to leave home. These sets are easy to put together and they always have directions if you need them. They are age appropriate for the 7+ group. A nice set for parents and or grandparents to work on with the children for some together time.   
 This book has proved enormously helpful in considering becoming self-employed. Brian writes with wit and compassion, covering all aspects of what to consider before taking the big plunge. Reading through the book step-by-step, and consciously taking part in all the exercises, I feel much more confident and aware of all of the risks and joys involved in becoming self-employed. Thanks, Brian 
 This book is very excellent for those who are interested in Urban Studies. The author argued that instead of looking at the city as a product of agriculture community, rather, the city should be concerned as a catalyst for those agricultural activities. Without the city, the agriculture wouldn't exist! Interesting argument. Such a paradigm shift in understanding the city 
 The water filter is inexpensive and pretty good.. Serves the purpose and light on your pocket.. 
 I really enjoyed this book. I was interested to see how all of the characters fit together - though I will admit that Ross's heart broken melodrama bothered me somewhat. Maybe I just couldn't relate but the volume of self pity she deposits in this character produces nausea. I also didn't understand why the Sheriff dreamed and hallucinated the mother of the albino boy (please forgive me as it was at least four books ago and I don't remember all of the names). With all the ghost sightings was he supposed to be seeing the specter of his future wife? His soul mate? Not clear.  Okay, the question here: We are supposed to be shocked and appalled by the eugenics project, right? We are supposed to see that it's all a load of crap and we couldn't believe that they thought this way not so long ago. But isn't Cecelia a tad insane? Instable and out of touch with reality. Isn't every one confused about her inability to cope and frequent suicide attempts. And then we discover that she is part Indian... wouldn't a eugenics supporter see that as proof that race and genes do matter?? Someone write me and tell me what I am missing... Maybe her insanity has nothing to do with her race but rather the oppression and lies that she has lived under...she's just that sensitive. But it seems to me that the one crazy lady - amidst a flock of eugenics scholars - only reinforces eugenics thinking by being of mixed genetic heritage.   P.S. No court room scenes. Yay! 
 Jinichi Tokeshi provides a succinct albeit comprehensive guide to Kendo and all that is entails. It begins with a short history of Kendo in an effort to familiarize the reader with the origins of the "sport". Tokeshi then spends some time on the necessities such as equipment and the correct manner in which to wear the kendogi and bogu! He also pays strict attention to appropriate etiquette and behaviour. The book deals with the movements, strikes, general philosophy, rules, regulations and ends with short biographies on historically significant samurai/Kendo masters! All in all the book amicably demonstrates the "elements, rules, and philosophy" of Kendo and as a new student to the Japanese art of fencing it has proved indispensable 
 I love this cd!  The music is wonderful and reminds me of particular parts of the movie.  Great movie, great soundtrack 
 Vertical Horizon finally achieved mainstream airplay with their third release "Everything You Want."  The smash hit single of the same name won massive airplay throughout the United States in 1999 and finally got Vertical Horizon on the map.  As a fan of many different genres of music this album appealed very much to me.  I enjoyed the diverse electric and acoustic sound of Vertical Horizon and loved every single song on the record.  While the singles from the album were all very strong ("Everything You Want", "Send It Up", "Grey Sky Morning", and "You're A God") the sleeper hit single is without a doubt "Shackled."  From a guitarist's perspective this song is incredible.  From a casual listener's standpoint the song is unique and worth a listen.  Other noteworthy tracks include "All Of You", "Give You Back", and "We Are".  If you are into bands such as 3 Doors Down, the Wallflowers, the Goo Goo Dolls, Live, and Fuel, then I can almost guarantee that you will love this cd.  It is one of the highpoints of my collection 
 Julia plays a struggling mother trying to make ends meet and then she gets a job and takes on a Giant Corporation in a Court Of Law.Julia manages to extract a lot of information fom people mainly through her mammary glands and the benefits of a Wonderbra but that is just about all that this movie has going for it. I give this film 5 stars because Julia does look pretty attractive in it at most times 
 We used this work among others in my Masters of Religious Education.  This was a fascinating look at a Christian considering psychology as a help in explaning stages of faith that all people go through to a certain level or other.  I found it quite enlightening and helpful in better comprehending and understanding where people are in their faith journey as I teach.  I would definately recommend this as a valuable part of understanding what could be understood as stages of faith, especially when attempting to improve understanding and value of working with people, especially in areas of religion 
 If you're interested in surfing at all, you need this one 
 I have been suffering from depression since I was 15 years old. My mother bought this bracelet for me at the age of 21 as a surprise (after some hinting; I was patiently waiting to buy it on my own!) I must say it is one of the most beautiful and meaningful gifts anyone has ever given to me. I don't believe I have taken it off for a single day in the several months I've owned it; it fits perfectly, matches everything and its beautiful message keeps me more centered and hopeful. It also keeps me feeling close to my mother while I'm away at college. She doesn't know it yet, but I hope to buy her the same bracelet for Christmas. It's a simply amazing gift for yourself or someone else 
 The professional edition has so much more for the coder and biller: anatomical illistrations, color coding and references to the CPT assistant for further clarifications. I have used the standard edition in the past, but the professional is so much better for my purposes.  A must have for physicians and for coders!  
 For the past decade, Belle and Sebastian has been one of the greatest bands in the world, and while well known to a dedicated core of fans, they remain alarmingly unknown to the populace as a whole.  Knowing about Belle and Sebastian is one of those musical badges that marks you as belonging to the more discerning of musical fans and can be used in movies and television as a quick way of validating someone as being especially savvy about great music.  For instance, in an episode of THE GILMORE GIRLS, Rory's best friend Lane, who is a music junkie despite more or less being imprisoned in her house by her overbearing Korean Seventh Day Adventist mother, yells from her window asking Rory to pick up for her the latest Belle and Sebastian album.  Though we've had numerous hints before that Lane really knows her music, this stands as further proof.  Many music consumers possess an album-only mentality.  EPs are considered too short, too inconsequential, too, well, odd, to be desirable.  With most bands, this is probably a valid attitude, since many use EPs to hold leftover numbers from album sessions (for instance, although Sam Beam is one of my favorite performers, Iron and Wine's THE SEA AND THE RHYTHM merely collects cuts left off THE CREEK DRANK THE CRADLE, though his subsequent EPs are gems) or as a place to collect what in an earlier period would have been B-sides.  Not so with Belle and Sebastian.  The songs on their EPs are not merely good, but frequently among the very best songs that they ever wrote.  Some of the songs were later rerecorded for albums, but even factoring that in the quality of these songs is absolutely amazing.  One could even ask the question:  Is Belle and Sebastian the premiere EP band in rock history?  The evidence here suggests that they are indeed.  PUSH BARMAN TO OPEN OLD WOUNDS collects all of the EPs that they have released from 1997's DOG ON WHEELS to 2004's BOOKS.  So far from being of a lower quality than their album work, the EPs have probably been more consistently excellent.  The songs are so good that if someone asked me what single album by Belle and Sebastian they should get, if they could only get one, I would recommend this one.  IF YOU'RE FEELING SINISTER is widely regarded as the band's finest album, but this collection is, I believe even better.  At the very least, it contains more outstanding songs.  This collection also serves as further confirmation of the genius of Stuart Murdoch, the band's songwriter/guitarist/singer.  Murdoch has relentlessly pushed the idea that Belle and Sebastian is a genuine group and has been hesitant to take upon himself the mantle of resident superstar.  But the fact is that what drives Belle and Sebastian is the plethora of marvelously melodic songs.  Murdoch joins the ranks of the great melodists in the history of rock.  This is not hyperbole.  Murdoch has written literally dozens of songs with melodies that can only be described as irresistibly beautifully.  He is also a fine lyricist, but the melodies are what one thinks of with a great B&S song.  So, if Belle and Sebastian is a great band-and it is-most of the credit has to go to Stuart Murdoch.  Without Murdoch, this is a band no one would ever have heard of.  He is as central to the success of the band as Billy Corgan in Smashing Pumpkins or Lou Reed in Velvet Underground or Paul Westerberg in the Replacements.  Newcomers to the band are going to be amazed by the quality of the songs.  The songs are arranged chronologically, but the great songs kick in almost immediately.  "Dog on Wheels" is a strong song to open the album, but the second is the glorious "The State I Am In," one of their great early songs, instantly shows what a superb writer Murdoch is, how strong his melodies are, and how funny his lyrics can be ("I gave myself to God/There was a pregnant pause before he said `OK').  This gives way to the irresistible "String Bean Jean."  All the way through the 25 songs on the two discs we get a relentless barrage of great songs.  "Lazy Line Painter Jane" with its rollicking organ, the wonderful "A Century of Fakers" (which shares the same intro as "A Century of Elvis" but not the same lyrics), the wistful "Beautiful," and so on through "Put the Book Back on the Shelf" and "This is Just a Modern Rock Song" and "Jonathan David" and "I'm Waking Up to Us" and "I Love My Car."  These guys are relentless!  There are greatest hits albums by very good bands with fewer great songs than this.  This album is, in short, a must-own album.  It represents some of the finest work by one of the greatest bands in the world.  If you have their albums but are not familiar with their EPs, this will delight you beyond measure.  If you don't know the band at all and are looking for a great entry place, you won't find a better place than here.  For a host of reasons, this is an album you absolutely must own.  Now if I can only find a ticket to their sold out show here in Chicago next month . . . 
 All That Remains was a hard book to put down. Patricia Cornwell writes so well that it's difficult to find a place to take a break when reading her novels. She is an expert at striking a balance between detail and the flow of the story. As a reader (and a writer), I believe I can learn much from her. The fact that she was a crime reporter for some years and a medical examiner, as well, adds authenticity to her stories. I'm looking forward to her next book, Predator, due out on October 25, 2005.  When the daughter of powerful Washington politician, National Drug Policy Director, Pat Harvey, and boyfriend turn up missing, the services of Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Chief Medical Examiner of Richmond, New Jersey, are called upon once again. Four other couples have disappeared in similar fashion and have eventually been found murdered, all within a fifty-five mile radius of Williamsburg (Virginia). Scarpetta is called to a local rest area where Ms. Harvey's daughter, Deborah's, jeep has been found. When last seen, the couple was headed to the Harvey beach home in said jeep. A new investigation begins. Investigators, powerful politicians, and covert operations agents speculate as to whether or not this case is associated with Harvey's job or is it, perhaps, the fifth in a series of couple murders. As is often the case in Cornwell's stories, it becomes a question of who knows what and what is the real truth behind events and motives.  The murders have been particularly gruesome, and when found, all that remains of the young people are some bones and clothing, along with a jack of hearts playing card. Also, in each case, the victims' shoes and socks cannot be found. Scarpetta and Richmond homicide detective, Pete Marino, follow various leads, spend considerable time speculating on the who and why of the murders, while investigative reporter, Abby Turnbull, seems to be terrified about something (Marino doesn't trust her). Ex-lover, Mark James, makes an appearance and temporarily heats up the personal side of Scarpetta's life again. In the end the killer is found and the murders solved, but at tremendous cost to the Harvey family and to others. An excellent read.   Carolyn Rowe Hill 
 This is a lovely blend of late 70's styles like disco (Hot Chocolate), big ballads (Rex Smith), wistful pop (John Paul Young, Robert John), power pop (The Knack), atmospheric rock (Nick Gilder), catchy singalong pop (Quattro & Norman) plus a couple of lesser known but still great tracks by Ian Gomm, Nicolette Larson, etc. I remember 1978 as a great year for good music in which singles sales reached a record high, in a decade that I consider the golden age of pop music. Even dance music had personality then and wasn't just mass-produced 4 beats to the bar anonymous variations on a theme. My favorites here include the tense, erotic "Hot Child", the dreamy, hypnotic "Love Is In The Air", the poppy disco of "Everyone's A Winner" and the sensitive "Sad Eyes." Vol. 22 makes a valuable contribution to an excellent series 
 this is a very interesting book on the 1918 influenza epidemic.  This is very topical, especially given the bird flu concerns of late.  Many do not realize that many of the deaths associated with influenza in the 1918 epidemic occurred in young and healthy individuals (in contrast to "normal" influenza years, in which the deaths occur in the elderly and infirm), and this text explains very nicely the reasons why this was the case (and why it may well be the case during the next pandemic).  As a cardiologist, I am often struggling with my patients to get them to go for their "flu shot."  If this book had been edited so that it was 100 pages shorter it would have been perfect.  However, it drags at the end due to  repetition, and I found myself flipping to see how many pages still remained.  I've given this book as a gift to several friends who are historically based and they have enjoyed this book tremendously, but readers should be forewarned (as other reviewers at Amazon have done) that this book is longer than it should have been 
 Pat Sweeney writes the best overall book for the firearms industry. His attention to detail and articulation is some of the best work when it comes to general firearms knowledge. The only other book that covers the Glock this well is the Ptooma Guide to the Glock. This book in comparison to the Ptooma book, well that is kind of hard. Sweeney writes as a general knowledge book, while the Ptooma book was written by guys that LOVE Glocks. Sweeney is a 1911 and revolver man, But who wouldn't trust the word of someone that took 3rd place in World Shoot XIV in Standard Revolver? I think he knows what he is talking about. You need a Glock book? Look no further. You found it 
 The narrator lives with her parents in a small mining town.  Her father is a miner and her mother is a quilter.  The girl wants to go to school, but doesn't have a coat to wear.  Her father would like her to go to school, but dies of black lung disease before she can start.  After her father dies, the family becomes even poorer.  The women in her mother's quilting group hear about the girl's dream of going to school and that she needs a coat to make the dream come true, so they make her one out of each family's rags.  When the girl arrives at school in her rag coat, the other students tease her, but then she starts telling them the stories that go with each rag in her coat.  As a result, the children come to respect her.  The story is great for older children, and particularly engaging for girls.  It has about 2000 words 
 I rate this album just a bit better from '3 Feet High and Rising'....What an album this is...  First off, I think there's a big misconception about this album...Every critic and writer claims that this album was 'dark' and a sharp contrast from '3 Feet High and Rising'...Personally, I didn't think it was that much of a different album....Yeah, its unique and stands out on its own...But the same goes with all De La Soul albums: they all take on their own personality....I just don't think the music on here is either dark or a sharp contrast from '3 Feet High and Rising'...  Now back to the album...Just like 3 Feet High, this album is filled with skits and bit of satire...But it's done in a very fun and enjoyable way...It gives De La a personality and takes you into their world for an hour....Again, the production is flawless on here....My favorite tracks include the unforgettable "Roller Skating Jam named Saturdays", "Pass the Peas" "Millie pulled a Pistol on Santa" and "My brother's a basehead"....This album is jam packed w/ classic hip hop material tho...  Definately worth the purchase...Highly recommended.. 
 I cannot speak highly enough of this short-lived (and sadly so) television series. It ranges from extremely funny, poignantly emotional, enraging, endearing, to even heartwarming. Lisa Kudrow is a GENIUS. Her acting is TOP-NOTCH here. (She should have won the Emmy.)  The basic premise: A has-been sitcom starlet, Valerie Cherish, tries to make a comeback through a new sitcom (which she is cast as an aunt in) and a reality show that follows her success in her comeback through the sitcom (the actual show gets its name from the reality show). The show itself is "raw footage" from the reality show.   Valerie Cherish is an obviously slanted character who will do ANYTHING to be loved (or at least liked) by the masses. She simply wants fame, and it doesn't really matter to her what it costs to get it. The first two episodes are a bit slow, and you do have to push through them before you get to the real gems. We as the audience go through disapproving of Valerie, to admiring her courage, to disapproving of her again, to eventually loving her and applauding her in the finale "Valerie Gets Another Classic Leno." As director/co-creator/co-writer Michael Patrick King said, by the last episode, you are "in Valerie's camp," rooting for her. This show centers around life in general, with all its mortifying humiliation (scenes which make you squirm) to the glorious highs of happiness (scenes which make you beam) and everything in between (scenes which make you laugh).   It's really too bad HBO cancelled this show. It certainly wasn't a ratings giant, but I think if they would have given this show one more season, people would have caught on to it. (There were only 13 episodes.) It's true that you'll either love this show or hate it, but I think if you're an intelligent person who can appreciate humor (namely satire), you'll fall in love with Valerie and THE COMEBACK.  I REALLY can't speak highly enough of this show.. 
 Being a Jerry Lee Lewis fan means that I own 99% of everything he recorded. So, I may be a little too close to the subject to be helpful about a Greatest Hits disc.  Any serious listener simply needs, at the least, everything The Hawk recorded for Sun Records. But, back to these 25 choices. Most are wonderful, so, why are "Baby Baby Bye Bye" and "Love on Broadway" here? I could name hundreds of superior cuts by Mr. Lewis. A few nominations would be; the single version of "It'll Be Me"..."That Lucky Old Sun" (just Jerry and his piano) "Deep Elem Blues" or "I'm On Fire." Just over a month ago The Ferriday Fireball turned 70. Criminally, this was widely ignored. Do yourself a favor and get some Jery Lee Lewis music in your life 
 I used the equations in the "Cars" chapter of this book to write a sweet street racing game for my senior project. I'm not real good at math or physics but I could easily follow the explanations. It was the only game physics book I could find that gave the equations for acceleration based on engine torque. Great book 
 I loved this book and thought it was a book about women, not black women.  It was filled with all the emotions that we feel but don't share; loss, disappointment, rejection, love, fear of attachment, fear of letting go of our children, a need to contribute to out community, misplaced trust and the one that never seems to leave,how are we going to pay for all of this.  I learned that most of the people in my life were not giving nearly enough, so thank you Pearl Cleage 
 Medium is a show about a "True" psychic detective; Allison Dubois. The show is pretty good drama, with a mostly excellent cast.   The amazing performance of Patricia Arquette is completely believable, as the self doubting psychic, coming to terms with her abilities, dealing with a dolt of a rocket scientist husband, (who's skepticism is the most unbelievable aspect of the series), three precocious daughters who are beginning to show their mother's talents, a boss with ambivalent belief/dependency on her abilities, a wise cracking detective, and a host of evil doers, and annoying ghost.  The whole point of her job is to help the DA catch some very, evil baddies, and most of the crimes are not appropriate for pre-teenagers, (which is why the show is on so late at night), so view the discs before watching with younger kids.  The disc set has interesting extras such as meet the real Allison Dubois, to let you kind of make up your mind how much of the show to take seriously.. If you like crime dramas, this should be a good show for you. If you like supernatural shows, this should be a good show for you. 
 This is probably one of the best cook books for new home makers (just married) or beginning hobbyist cookers (men or women). It is well written and properly indexed 
 In the near future, an alien spacecraft enters orbit around the Earth's moon, where they build a spaceport. Among the humans who visit the chirpsithra aliens and profit from the meeting is Rick Schumann, who garners their assistance in building the Draco Tavern near the spaceport, equipped to provide food and drink for dozens of species of sentient, unique and engaging aliens.   The Draco Tavern is story-telling at its best. The 26 stories involve  incidents and conversations at Schumann's eating and drinking establishment.   "The Schumann Computer" is about Rick's initial interaction with the chirps. He obtains technology to build a supercomputer, a project that succeeds temporarily until he finds why the chirps consider the technology of little value. (The chirpsithra are skinny 11-foot arthropods. They've  colonized worlds around red-dwarf stars and convey other intelligent species to visit alien civilizations throughout the galaxy, providing them translators to talk with locals and each other.)  "Assimilating our Culture, That's What They're Doing," introduces the gligstith(click)optok. They're small, and masters of biotechnology.   "Green Marauder" is the story of an ancient chirp. He tells of observing the first native civilization on Earth a billion years earlier destroyed by environmental collapse.   "The Real Thing" is a ride of alien virtual reality equipment.   In "Limits," Rick hears an alien conversation about the ability to make humans immorta, but he's unable to identify who, in the many aliens in his tavern, was speaking.  You get the idea. Each is a gem. Larry Niven has been creating Draco Tavern stories for more than 25 years.   These 26 stories contain enough science-fiction ideas to spin off dozens of novels and movies.   Fertile imagination and impeccable technique 
 If you want to read the Tanakh, read BHS 
 'Moral Dilemmas' presents you with a first hand account of contemporary ethical views. I am especially impressed with the arguments and conflicts as portrayed by Ruth Marcus et all. If you want a candid and clear account  of 'Moral Dilemmas' this is the place to start. Please note that there is a  basic history of Ethics as a common thread run through out the book. Don't  let this fact discourage you. The material is first rate doing justice to  the field Philosophy 
 This is a great book. The mathematical exposition is excellent and the historical footnotes are extremely interesting

 The CD arrived in a timely manner and was in excellent condition. It was just as advertised.  The cost was very reasonable. The music is very good.  
 Woodward is a knowledgeable and, by the standards of these things, folksy in his presentation of the twists and turns in the debates between evolution and intelligent design (ID) over the past ten years, more or less taking off from where he left matters in his last, and equally informative book, `Doubts about Darwin'. Woodward is upfront about his theism, but he is also someone who reads widely and tries to deal with the key events and people himself in person. It's too bad that evolutionists don't have anyone comparable to him. Perhaps it means that evolutionists simply believe that the theory can sell itself.   And maybe it can. As Woodward observes, there are two burdens that ID must shift in the US context. (I stress US because things are different elsewhere in the world.) First, of course, is the dominance of the belief in Darwinian evolution by the majority of scientists considered relevant to an explanation of life on earth. But, equally important is the legal burden that in the US it is possible to disqualify a theory as unscientific, regardless of the credentials of the people or the research done, simply if you can demonstrate religious motivation for its promotion. This is the bigger problem, as I see it, as someone who testified for ID at the recent Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District. (I believe it radically distorts the constitutional `separation of church and state', but that's for another time.)  The upside of the story, which Woodward documents, is that ID can be discussed completely and explicitly without making legally proscribed religious appeals.  For readers who are relatively new to the evo-ID debates, one feature of the rhetoric of this book is worth noting. Woodward periodically pauses in his narrative to decry the misrepresentation of ID by various defenders of the evolutionary faith, and even includes an appendix to this effect. It's worth pointing out that misrepresentation, or at least strategic characterization, is common to both sides of this debate. Here Woodward is simply fighting fire with fire. It is inevitable that in a debate as serious as this one both sides will portray each other in the least favourable light. But does this mutual misrepresentation really matter in the long term?  Frankly, I don't think so.   The sanest way to deal with the issue is not by the mind-numbing repetition of who said what about whom, which you can find on various blogs endlessly trotted out like pre-programmed chess moves, sometimes (especially in the case of evolutionists) graced with a peanut gallery that would not be out of place in `Beavis and Butthead'. (I guess that's what you get when you take 'self-organization' a little too seriously...) Rather, savvy readers should look at subtle shifts in position over time, both substantive and rhetorical, that both sides make. And both sides have indeed made quite significant shifts in how they argue their case over the last quarter century. If ID has done nothing else, it has helped evolutionists to smarten up their act and curb their terminal smugness. And ID, to its credit, does not introduce the Bible as evidence. `Darwin Strikes Back' and Woodward's earlier book, `Doubts about Darwin' give a pretty fair record from a participant-observer standpoint of the various twists and turns in the debate.  Readers of Woodward's book should pick up a copy of the DVD, `Unlocking the Mystery of Life', whose making he describes. It is probably the most sophisticated filmic treatment of ID yet, and would make for challenging viewing in a high school biology class. While some of the people involved in this film may have religious motives, they're never given expression. We are reaching a point where the merits (or not) of ID can be discussed without reference to politically controversial motives, just as we can do likewise for evolution without introducing sensitive matters like racial hygiene and eugenics, which were very much part of the history of Darwinism, independently of its actual scientific validity.  
 This is the  latest edition of the updated classic by the people who invented RISC. Clear and up to date, it take you from a virtual beginner to a situation where you can follow understand current comp arch research  ( and if you are a masochist, the discussions on the comp.arch newsgroup ! :-) )  Note the laudatory review that appears on this web page written by the legendary John Mashey, the founder of MIPS. A recommendation from John Mashey, who helped design the MIPS RISC architecture, as well recently contributing to the design of SGI's NUMAflex modular computer architecture  is indeed high praise.  Run, do not walk to your local library to reserve that copy ! Or if you are feeling generous, treat yourself and buy this great book. 
 I read this book like a journey starting at 'A' and reading subsequent cross-references. It's clear & simple. Having read the Icon picture book on "Jung - For Beginners" (Hyde & McGuinness), this volume added the icing on the cake at introductory level. Enjoy 
 Terrific writing and story line.  You wont be able to stop thinking about it all day long till you finish it!  Excellent twists through out the whole thing too.  The story just keeps getting deeper and more twisted.  I'm looking forward to reading the rest of Tess' books.    Definately pick up this book! 
 My friends and I have game nights very regularly and together we all own about 25 different games. Taboo is HANDS DOWN the favorite game!! You can guarantee that you will laugh hysterically and get your blood pumping. The only downside is that since we have played it so much, we know all of the cards already. Unfortunately there isn't a Taboo expansion pack with new cards. THIS IS THE BEST PARTY GAME!!! 
 Hands down, a 5 star, two thumbs up, classic joint.  After it dropped, Puba reigned supreeeme.  Disregard the Amazon reviewer, there are no "gaffes" in this one, period...  These guys were true to their beliefs.  They weren't packaging a product for "pop" consumption, they were telling a generation what THEY THOUGHT.  Check it out and the music will speak for itself.  The best track in my opinion was "Wake UP", but the whole album was great.  As someone else mentioned, fast tracks put it in the 90's but most of the tracks are relevant sound as good as ever.  
 I bought the book because the topic of girls sleeping together came up at my watering hole. The other guys were of the unanimous position that if they liked it, they were bisexual.  We're all somewhat sexually versatile and Jen's attitude is exactly the argument I was putting forth - that female same-sex experiences are not repugnant to females and are exciting to men and there is not an equivalence with perceptions of male same-sex activity. Whether that is cultural, I don't know, but I certainly have a double standard: I can't imagine being sexually attracted to a man and I can't imagine women not being attracted to other women. They look so yummy!  Now the book is making the rounds of the waitresses and female bartenders of my pub - and I suspect that experimentation has increased as a result 
 The book under review was published by LibertyClassics.  Smith's "Theory of Moral Sentiments" (TMS) is both an excellent work of psychology and an eloquent exposition of philosophy. It was written about the same time as David Hume's and Francis Hutchinson's theories of moral sentiments (theory of benevolence) in the 18th century, departing from the ancient ethical paradigms of a priori ethics and reaching instead toward an empirical, a posteriori ethics for modernity. Rather than deducing first principles from the philosopher's armchair, Smith's account begins with experience, habit, and custom based on nature's disposition of mankind's moral constitution. Therefore, it is a wholly modern theory, and in many ways anticipates Darwinism and evolutionary biology (EB).  Smith's ethical account is grounded entirely in observation. Nature, custom, habit, and experience teach us its principles, which comports with both our internal judgments and our external evaluations. By our imagination, we place ourselves as if we are the other person, conceiving ourselves as if we were that person. Our emotions well up with an "analogous emotion" of the other, vicariously experiencing the other's pleasures and pain, his gratitude and resentment, becoming sympathetic to the other's plight as though it were our own. Love and gratitude are agreeable sensations, while hatred and resentment are disagreeable passions. Our sympathy for the other is measured like that of "an impartial spectator" who we become by viewing another's motives and actions by our own in accordance with our own sense of propriety, moral sense (duty), and benevolence, by "bringing the case home to ourselves."   "Every faculty in one man is the measure by which he judges of the like faculty in another. I judge of your sight by my sight, of your ear by my ear, of your reason by my reason, of your resentment by my resentment, of your love by my love" (I.i.3.10). "We approve of another mans judgment, not as something useful, but as right, as accurate, as agreeable to truth and reality" (I,i.4.4). Conscious of another person's situation generates sympathy in ourselves, and the correspondence with one another, is "sufficient for the harmony of society" (I.i.4.6). "To feel much for others and little for ourselves, that to restrain our selfish, and to indulge our benevolent affections, constitutes the perfection of human nature . . . .as to love our neighbor as we love ourselves is the great law of Christianity . . . . as our neighbor is capable of loving us" (I.i.5.5).  Based upon these primary motives of gratitude and resentment (foreshadowing Trivers' and Hamilton's reciprocal altruism in EB) leads to an analysis of grief and joy, anger and love, suffering and enjoyments, distress and relief, envy and magnanimity, and all the other binary emotional relations. To each emotion we attach a "proportionable recompense" for merit and demerit, reward and punishment. A sympathetic imagination or indignation naturally boils up in the breast of the impartial spectator.   While beneficence is always a free act, we do have duties given us by nature in order to be just. Justice, writes Smith, is a negative virtue and only hinders us from harming our neighbor through retaliation or punishment "to safeguard of justice and the security of innocence." Even though we are primarily motivated by self-love, we imagine an impartial spectator to humble the arrogance of self-love to avoid hurting one's neighbor.  Smith makes clear that "man, who subsist only in society, was fitted by nature to that situation for which he was made," and that is to act reciprocally. For ill inflicted unjustly on another, we naturally seek retaliation; for the good afforded from love, we reciprocate the affection. After all, "society cannot subsist among those who are at all times ready to hurt and injure one another" (II.ii.3.3). This occurs "for the purpose of advancing the two great purposes of nature, the support of the individual, and the propagation of the species" (II.ii.3.5). When it comes to society, justice is more important than beneficence, because, while society can live without beneficence, it cannot survive without justice. Nature, and society through habit and custom, implant conscience in the human breast, and every injustice, therefore, alarms man. Conversely, Smith observes, "mercy to the guilty is cruelty to the innocent" (II.ii.3.7).  Like Hume before him, Smith locates the causes of pain and pleasure as being behind the primary motivations of the two chief emotions: For Hume they are love and hatred, for Smith they are gratitude and resentment. To measure the propriety and duty of one's own actions, "we must become the impartial spectators of our character and conduct" (III.2.2). Man is naturally endowed to live in society with a desire to please others and avoid offending others, and it is our duty to impartially evaluate ourselves at least as stringently, if not more, than we evaluate others. Nature has made man the immediate Judge of mankind, ever making proper comparisons between our own interests and those of other people. We judge ourselves best when act as if we stand in a place with eyes of a third person. "It is reason, principle, conscience, the inhabitant of the breast, the man within, the great judge and arbiter of our conduct" (III.3.5). Of course, our own disciplined, self-command, coupled with constancy and firmness, makes our interior and exterior comparisons and resemblances fair and equitable.  Smith's TMS covers much territory also covered by Hume, but from a different angle, and with a different regard for "utility" in a theory of benevolence. Both theories are thoroughly modern, and readers familiar with EB will find that Smith better anticipates many of EB's themes, i.e., reciprocal altruism, kin selection, etc. Smith's perception of man as he will become described by Darwin is uncanny. Although Hume's account begins with first principles of observation, and heuristically builds upon empirical foundations, Smith's observation begins with the more mundane and ordinary and refines toward first principles. Even though they are in agreement on most matters, it's intellectually interesting to take note of their differences (e.g., utility). Regrettably, the ethical theory of moral sentiments gets little attention in ethics courses, despite the ease of reading and relevance to today's modern synthesis. Both deserve a wider audience. This handsome text is well introduced, annotated, and documented.. Recommended 
 Even though Robert Hiltzik's original "SLEEPAWAY CAMP" is a slice of classic 80's stinky green cheese with a great ending,Michael A. Simpson's "SLEEPAWAY CAMP 2(unhappy campers) is light years better than the original! Unhappy campers is right up there with "MY BLOODY VALENTINE" & "SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE" as some of the most over-looked & underrated slasher films of the 80's! This film has alot of substance,gutts & bolts & inside jokes! Its one of my personal favorite slasher flicks! In a masked slasher era Pamela Springsteen still holds her own as the mostly unmasked & very devilish ANGELA"the angel of death"BAKER!  
    I have owned this book for many years now and I find that even after I have learned a topic in Lang or elsewhere, I still find that yet another careful reading of Lang will rearrange my thinking.  I hear and read a lot of people complaining about this book, and I think most criticisms come from not having enough patience or energy to climb the book.  (Yes, reading this is more like climbing!)  There are few better things that you can do for yourself than hanging out with Lang.      The book does deserve some criticisms.  His chapter on groups is just too small and insubstantial.  Go elsewhere for that, like Rotman.  The real purpose of that chapter is to introduce Category Theory, and it takes the wrong tack a few times there, I feel.  So learn category theory somewhere else too.  And all algebra books fail to explain what the algebra is good for.  This one is no different.  It is a shame because too many people think that Algebra is mostly for algebraists.  But the truth is you can't do anything great without algebra.       The chapters on Homology theory are good in places, and the places where they are not so good, try the book by Weibel.     So, yeah, he is often a bit terse and leaves steps out.  That's just an invitation to think things over.  And it keeps the text clean.  He is respecting you, honoring you, inviting you to the real party.  He's not cheating you.  He's giving you the real goo!  You want the real goo, don't you?   
 I am an proficient writer, but I had never written a business plan before, so I had trouble getting started. Of the three books I purchased on writing business plans, this one was the most helpful because it provides "lead ins" to get me started, with suggestions for elaborating on details. For example, "Our key competitive advantage is..." The lead-ins are tailored for varying business sizes--from small start-ups to large establishments.  Over a few days, I was able to assemble a skeleton of a business plan. After researching my industry for marketing and competition, I was able to fill in the sections I had outlined with the use of the book. My business plan was well-received by bankers and business people. It gave me confidence from having done thorough research on operating the business.   I had bought a used paperback version (without software) on Amazon for $6.00. In hindsight, the software may have saved typing time. I couldn't have written my business plan without this book! 
 137 billion tax dollars were spent last year alone eradicating, controlling, and managing exotic species of plants which included trees such as The Chinese Tallow, Tree Of Heaven, Autumn Olive, and Buckthorn. It is time the public be made aware that native tree alternatives are out there and they are the responsible choice. Release of a book so well written and sensitive to the complex and diverse issues posed by the existence of invasives is long over due. Kudos to Sternberg and Wilson for endeavoring to write such an informative book. Native Trees for North American Landscapes addresses these issues and many more. This is a must have book for anyone in the forestry, nursery, or landscape industry as well as the home hobbyist 
 If you are expecting a straight adaptation of the novel 'Naked lunch' you've come to the wrong place.. If you are looking for two styles converging into a twisted bizarre sci-fi arthouse extravaganza - step right up.. David Cronenberg (the fly, scanners, eXistenZ, etc.) has a unique attatchment to surreal sci-fi investigations of the nature of reality and transformation (I think I am miserably failing to describe his cinema) - Burroughs also has a style which, shall we say, twists the bounds of reality -sometimes literally in his drug induced descriptions in 'Naked Lunch'.. but mostly in his radical prose style (something between james joyce and aldous huxley but with an extra ingredient of the bizzare).. somehow this meeting of two artists works out and creates this frightening alternate noir-like alter-universe called interzone.. Highlights of the movie include Cronenberg's strange puppetry which bring to life Burroughs creatures of his own unconcious mind.. This is a beautiful movie to look at - and one that plays like a fever-dream.. My only dissapointment was that I had just read the book - and was still so in awe of Burroughs writing - that I had trouble excepting an interpretation.. But Cronenberg's artistry actually enhances more than it detracts. 
 I've read several books on eating disoreders-all good-but none helped me understand eating disorders and how to approach a loved one with a problem as well as this book. As family members, we so often unwittingly create more resistance when we think we are helping our family member, simply because we don't know the right way to approach the problem. This book helped me think the way the eating disorder thinks, and that made all the difference. I highly recommend it 
 This movie is one of my favorites.  Although at one point it's a little corny, it's overall an awesome movie.  It's definitely a plus that Jonathan Davis of Korn does the music.  The music is definitely beyond great.  I would recommend buying this dvd 
 It has long been apparent that Iain Pears is a marvelously skilled writer. His series of mysteries, all set in Rome and focusing on art forgery, theft and murder, is highly sophisticated fun. His "Instance at the Fingerpost" is a complex puzzler which challenges the reader at every twist and turn of its devious plot. Here, however, he moves into new territory. While "The Dream of Scipio" is as intricately plotted as "Fingerpost" Pears adds a moral dimension. He not only examines good and evil, but poses the question of how, in times of crisis, a mere human being can tell one from the other.  The book is set in a small section of southern France, but his characters live in three widely separated historical eras: The final days of the Roman Empire, the time of the great plague which devastated Europe in the mid 14th century and the German occupation of World War II. In each case we see good people doing evil things for what the feel are morally sound reasons and bad people doing good things for their own selfish reasons. The book is more complicated than that--in Pears" vision, life is not black and white but various shades of grey.  Still, he seems to say, there are some things one must not do; not for any reason.  This is an unsettling novel; an uncompromising look at reality that makes for compelling reading. It is a book I could not put down, even when it actually became painful to continue reading. 
 This cd is great.  "Pain" is my favorite song ever.  I have one other three days grace cd, and I think this cd is right on par with that one 
 As the author of "Thinkertoys (A Handbook of Business Creativity)," and "Cracking Creativity (The Secrets of Creative Genius)," I, generally, read most published books about creative thinking. I'm very familiar with Tom Wujec's work in the field and highly  recommend Tom's book "Five Star Mind." The book is not only a  solid book about creative thinking, but it's fun as well. In my opinion,  it's one of the better books in the field and will help readers of all ages  to become creative in business and life 
 My dad served in the 1st Marine division in the Korea War. The Marines first help stop the tide of the North Korean invasion. The Marines then help stabilize a front to protect all that was left, the Pusan Perimeter. Next the Marines were called to storm ashore during the famous Inchon landings. They then liberated  Seoul. The Marines then reembarked for a cruise that landed them on the opposite side of the Korean Peninsula. There they went up into the mountains. The Chinese soon intervened  into the War. The Chinese  sent millions of troops in to Korea. It was not long before the Chinese sheer numbers overwhelmed some U.S. Army units  and others had to withdraw to keep from getting surrounded. The Chinese were to also cut off the Marines from their logistics base. Cut off in the mountains the Chinese the figured they would soon destroy the Marines. They were wrong but it took a lot of hard fighting and the support of the Air Force for the Marines and the Army units that were also presence to fight their way out.  My dad told me the Air force saved them. The marines had built a forward airfield that turned out to be so critical. Because of this forward  air strip, the Air force was able to fly in supplies  when they were cut off. The Air Force also was able to provided close support missions. The cargo planes after unloading, were able to the fly many of the wounded out. The men were soon on the way to hospitals as far away as Japan and the USA. One of the missions involved dropping bridge sections to replace part of a bridge that had been destroyed by the Chinese.  This support by the Air Force enable them to fight their way south.   Captain Frank Mayer was sent to find out what was happening in the battalion's rear by Lt. Col. Roise.  "Mayer. 'I started down the road by myself in the dark. Not a smart move, but I was still under the illusion that the 'rear' was relatively safe. Then I began to worry about being mistaken for an infiltrator. Just then I ran into a group who turned out to be the last stragglers from Hill 1403. They said the Chinese were right behind them. I peered over their shoulders into the gloom and got off the dumbest remark of the evening; 'I don't see any Chinamen.' One of the stragglers said 'Just walk down that road and you'll see all the Chinamen you ever want to see.' That's when I decided I had gone far enough. 'What did you find out?' asked the colonel. 'The Chinese are behind us.' 'What else?' 'What else?  Sir, that's pretty big news by itself!' Colonel Roise replied 'We'll take care of them.' "  The Marines did take care of them. Only remember the  Korea War has never official ended. The Chinese still know this. Their puppet Kim Jong II is building Nukes and has ties with Iran. There is still only a ceasefire that stopped the war in 1953. Today there are miles of barbwire, mines, artillery and armed troops still separating North from South Korea. The most dangerous thing now is Kim Jong II has nukes and he has always sold off ever weapon system he has to terrorist and terrorist countries like Iran.  One day the Marines may have to return and deal with North Korea and China. Lets hope these hero's are like the hero's we had in the 1950's. Semper Fi.   
 This is the *best* NT Greek dictionary for students of the Greek New Testament.  Thorough scholarship; many entries exhaustively categorize word meanings and all provide references to other ancient literature.  A necessity for doing scholarly work in the New Testament, and a serious reference tool for the pastor or student.  If you do any work in the NT, you *need* this lexicon.  The 3rd edition revamps the earlier glosses and attempts to provide definitions for words.  Also has words from the Apostolic Fathers and other early literature.  However, the price is VERY STEEP.  Especially for students.  If you are a student on a tight budget (and don't need to purchase the latest and greatest copy of Bauer), I would recommend doing obtaining a used copy of the 1st edition, which can be found for under $30 at the time of this writing.  The glosses are basically the same in 1st and 2nd edition, the only thing that is changed are that more mistakes are corrected.  The 3rd edition's definitions are nice, but in general I find it is more helpful to get glosses to point me in the right direction and use a concordance/search program to get a better understanding of how a word is used in the NT 
 This a wonderful book that should be read by everyone. You should read this book if you are curious as to why the education system produces ever-worse results; why graduates of colleges are semi-literate; why high school graduates cannot do elementary arithmetic; or why America cannot produce sufficient numbers of scientists.    Who dislikes, no hates, this book?  Teachers' unions, education school academics, the school administrators and the Department of Education Educrats who ride on the education gravy train, squandering billions upon billions on incompetent education theories.    "Left Back" is a book that has earth shattering ramifications for the public debate on education and marks a turning point.  The National Council on the Accreditation of Teacher Education, the UFT and the ideologues who dominate the education field will no longer have a field day destroying our nation's future.    Please, please read this book. Read it for your children.  Read it for your country's future. And read it to find out how your ever-higher taxes are squandered for junk education theories and quackery 
 I thought this movie was a mix of Boomerang and Fatal Attraction.  It had a nice cast (Martin Lawerence, Lynn Whitfield, Bobby Brown (small role, but he did his thing), Regina King).  Ladies man gets caught up when he plays the wrong woman, and becomes a victim of her revenge.  The movie is not super great, but it was a fun movie.  There are parts that will make you laugh 
 Surely keeps you tied to your seat. Not one of his best books though. The story and characters are memorable but the ending is jarring - almost as if the author got tired of writing towards the end. But very fast pace and exciting drama nonetheless 
 The book is filled with a variety of wonderful recipes. Whatever your mood early in the  morning you can find something here to make your mouth party.  Janet Sue Terry author of A Rich, Deliciously Satisfying, Collection of Breakfast Recipes ISBN 1932586431 
 I think the thing some people are forgetting about this song is that, first, though it does have that "Hey Mickey" sound, it has a rhythm and beat that is catchy. Secondly, the song appeals to many due to its reflection of teenage pop culture (a la video imagery) of being and looking cool. Third, the song is a commentary of the pop culture on many levels. It serves not only as a literal portrayal of hollering back (i.e. in the way cheerleaders do, hence the pop appeal to teenagers,) but also in a metaphorical sense of what a hollaback girl is (i.e. a doormat.) She challenges the notion of being a hollaback girl, saying that she ain't gonna be one. She gets away with the garb, the language, and everything else, because she relates to what teens say, what they do and how they sometimes feel, all the while looking great doing it all. Can you now see the intrigue and appeal the this pop song creates 
 Gets to the Heart I have read the whole series of books by David Pelzer, each is better than the last. I recommend these books to everyone I know whether they have been abused or not as they lend insight, courage and determination sometimes in the face where none exist. Again, This newest books shows the depth that david Pelzer is.  Also recommended: Nightmares Echo, All David Pelzer Books, Running With Scissor 
 This is a beautiful book.  I have read it more times than I can remember.  I just recently ordered yet another copy to give to a friend of mine.  This book will make you reconsider a lot of your previously held assumptions, and help you to evaluate your spiritual walk.  I highly recommend anything by Schaeffer.  This book especially 
 After purchasing the first one, we bought a second.  Works as advertised and provides plenty of space for a lot of trash.  No more emptying the trash can every other day to replace the bag 
 Bought 2 work great.  Set up very similar to a cassette deck 
 THE SAVAGE GOD is a masterpiece despite the fact that it reeks of the english department. And despite the fact that Clive James was right when he accused Alvarez of being guilty of "full frontal solemnity". And like James also said, Alvarez was ludicrously portentious to claim that modern life is far more suicide-provoking than ancient life. The world has *always* been a hellhole.  One of my favorite quotes concerns Alvarez's reaction after waking up from an attempted barbiturate overdose: "My weakened body, my thin breath, the slightest flicker of emotion filled me with distaste. I wanted only to be left to myself. Then, as the months passed, I began gradually to stir into another style of life, less theoretical, less optimistic, less vulnerable. I was ready for an insentient middle age."  A lot of people are ready to be insentient from day one. And I really can't blame them. Here's my favorite quote: "The cult of the Inconnue seemed to attract young people between the two world wars in much the same way as drugs call them now: to opt out before they start, to give up a struggle that frightens them in a world they find distasteful, and to slide away into a deep inner dream."  
 This is a well written book. He makes the memories of his childhood seems so vivid. It leaves you wanting to know more about his life. If you're looking for a good book this is one of them 
 I am very impressed with the Brainy Baby videos we have tried so far (Shapes & Colors; English; Animals).  My 16-mo-old is captivated by this Shapes & Colors video and I've been amazed by all the shapes she can identify (triangle, circle, square, rectangle, oval, heart, star, crescent).  I'm not saying she learned all of this from this video; she's also learning from books, puzzles and our conversations in "everyday life."  But what I like most about these Brainy Baby videos -- as compared to Baby Einstein -- is that they name the objects clearly as they show them.  The BE videos we have tend to show objects along with nice music (and my daughter enjoys naming the objects as she sees them), but as she is quite interested in learning names for objects right now, I like the fact that these videos name everything.  If your child likes you to read word/picture books or identify every object they see, these videos will probably be a great hit 
 I liked this book.  It had good characters, a good plot, and tied all books in the My Teacher Is An Alien series together very well.  However, some things were exceedingly unrealistic.  A good example is the captain of the spaceship.  For anyone who doesn't know, this captain is a sort of fish tank like box who can speak and think, and supposedly his species from his planet are  advanced enough to join the League of Worlds.  This is utterly ridiculous.  The only thing that sets us humans apart from is one gesture: thumb to finger.  Even if a box had a brilliant idea, he would not be able to carry it out because he would have no way to carry it out.  He could not get the supplies, put them together use his invention, because he cannot grip.  I rest my case 
 This book does a great job of covering the various types of call center agents and their attributes.  Invaluable information to someone who is interested in positively changing their call centers culture 
 Anyone involved in running for a congressional seat, working on a congressional election or just interested in national politics will find this book enormously interesting.  It's short.  It's down to earth.  It's up-to-date.  And, it's one of the best on the subject.  Professor Jacobson's book features pertinent analysis of national survey data plugged into long-term electoral trends.  It covers all you need to know about how to make a run for Congress, calculating your odds and the chances of knocking off an incumbent.  It is a unique blend of academic effort and practicality that is continually useful.  It is the very best on what to expect in congressional elections for the U.S. House and Senate 
 some of these tracks dominate: the jungle brothers, the nwa remixes and the roni size.  the superman beat is kinda wack but all in all this disk is just right for listening to on a day when the sun's out and you're driving  around in your whip like vrooom.. 
 The 80's spawned one high school teen movie after another, and John Hughes was the king of that genre.  But somehow along the way among the Breakfast Clubs and the Pretty in Pinks, Three O'Clock High got overlooked.  It's quite rare when I actually meet someone who's heard of this comedy gem.  I had quite a lot of trouble even finding a copy of it on DVD and was going to purchase a copy here on Amazon, but finally found it at a buy/sell/trade store in Hollywood.  So anyway, while I am very happy to finally have this movie on DVD in widescreen for the first time, instead of watching it on my VCR on a recorded scratchy tape, I was a little dissapointed that there were no features whatsoever on this disc (movie reccomendations don't count, you can get plenty of those on Amazon).  Further proof that not enough people know or care about this movie.  Furthermore, Casey Siemaszko, the star, the heart and soul of this movie, failed to develop as a lead actor since this movie never really got any recognition, (he had a lot of supporting roles in the late 80s such as Young Guns, Stand By Me and Back to the Future) which is a shame because he is too funny in this movie.  The movie has a good cast too, even though the protagonist of the film who looks 15 years too old to be in high school, he's the perfect school bully.  Not to mention this movie has the best school yard fight you'll ever see.  Please, check this one out.  John Hughes isn't the only one who could make good 80's highschool movies and this is certainly one of the best ones 
 The book is absolutely beautiful.  It makes Jean Ritchie's songs more relevant, to read the words and the stories she associates with them.  The mention of mining in the last chapter saddens me because I know what  happened to all such communitites when the coal ran out.  The book is  beautiful 
 These days, celebrity authors earn thousands of dollars for a speech, but back in the 1880s, Ralph Waldo Emerson, the first American author known to receive payment for delivering a talk, was paid $5 and oats for his horse 
 Kurt Cobain of Nirvana, Pearl Jam's Eddie Veder, and  Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong are all sitting in an old West-style salloon. Each is clutching an album that has been claimed "Best of the '90's": Billie Joe has Dookie, Cobain has Nevermind, and Veder has Ten. Then Layne Staley busts in, clutching a copy of Dirt. He sits down, orders a drink, and challenges everyone in the bar to a fight. Bllie Joe of course doesn't have a chance, because Green Day's the worst band ever and he knows it, so of course Staley chases him out of town. Cobain puts up a bit more of a fight, but eventually realizes it's futile, and surrenders. So now it's down to Staley and Veder - in the end, Staley wins out. What I'm trying to say is Dirt is the best album of the '90's - not only that, one of my favorites ever. It's a dark, creepy, sludgy concept album about the horrors of heroin addiction. It probably scares small children. And it's got the best song of the '90's: Rooster. If you can imagine the heaviness of Black Sabbath merged with the melodic instincts of the Beatles, you've got Dirt. 1. Dem Bones: 10/10 2. Dam That River: 10/10 3. Rain When I Die: 10/10 4. Down in a Hole: 10/10 5. Sickman: 10/10 (some fans don't like it, but I love the pummeling chorus/slow verse contrast) 6. Rooster: 100/10 7. Junkhead: 8/10 8. Dirt: 7/10 9. God Smack: 10/10 10. Iron Gland: N/A. Worst song on the album, but because it's only forty seconds long that can be forgiven. 11. Hate to Feel: 10/10 12. Angry Chair: 10/10 13. Would?: 10/10 Needless to say, this is a complete masterpiece that's almost impossible to review objectively. I'll stop trying now. Just buy it. You won't be disappointed. 
 A simple story of a seemingly unimportant life that is inspiring and enjoyable. A must have addition to your library of classics 
 Karenga has done a wonderful piece in the Husia! I take this book as a counteraction to all self-help books by modern authors. Of who most of them have had some sort of power in one area or another. But who better for Africans to read than our own people of power about how to realize their blessings and priviledges that the Most High has put upon them in any given sitution. I love this book because it translate African minds of the past when power and domination was our footstool. And how we didn't use these blessings to produce negative thinking and action. And how we always gave prasie to the one who help bestowed those great achievements for us. I take this book as a holistic mental and emotional playbook. To see any sitution better side! And to remind us that nothing is new under ATEN-RA. And if you stay in the heights of the positive you would be able to see clearer all the blessing we have! TUA NTR KARENGA!! 
 I have not read a better, clearer book on what it means to be a disciple of Jesus Christ.  Boice writes with clarity and focus that constantly draw the reader back to the feet of Jesus.  This is a book that you should pull down again and again to read to be refreshed and reminded of what it means to follow Christ 
 Underworld is an ambitious book.   By examining politics, economics, and popular culture in the United States during the last half of the twentieth century, author Don DeLillo engages in some interesting speculation about hidden meanings and connections that lie beneath our notice.  In the world that he depicts, people and events sometimes seem to be connected by some kind of field or ether through which unnamable forces operate.  In his opening scene, the lives of hundreds of thousands of people are joined by an historic baseball game, where a young man senses "the body heat of a great city ... small reveries and desperations, the unseen something that haunts the day."  In other passages of the book, these connections take the form of history or a system: "that thing you feel in an office ... sensing the linked grids lap around you."  The book focuses on Nick Shay, a man with some grit who escapes a meaningless life in the Bronx and becomes an executive in a waste disposal firm and a kind of savant.  It takes a long time and many people to produce this transformation, and this results in a pretty long book: 827 pages in the hard cover edition.  DeLillo is even more interested in conspiracy theories and secrets than in Nick's personal transformation, so along the way he shares a lot of arcane knowledge with the reader about the nuclear weapons industry, environmental degradation, and J. Edgar Hoover.    The connections between a few of the minor characters and subplots and the rest of the book are not obvious, and I would venture to say that a few of these could have been omitted without great harm.  Also, DeLillo's dialogue has a definite style:  his characters seem to hoard their words, and an awful lot of them don't finish their sentences.  Whether these are defects or not probably depends on the reader's tastes.  For me, this is a much better book than DeLillo's White Noise and Libra, which have been widely praised. 
 Consider things from the point of view of the dentist and his patient . . . you'll be laughing out loud while reading this to your kids 
 This book was well worth the read, but it took a bit of time to get engaged.  If you don't give up, you'll enjoy the story 
 Great thriller. Perhaps the reason I disagree with some of the reviews is that I'm not generally a huge Maclean fan and have struggled to finish some of them. Most are a little too boys' own for my taste. I think this book as superb, though, mainly because it has a sense of personal motivation that many of his other books seem to lack, and the prologue and ending are brilliant. Particularly good are the sudden twists in the plot and the cold, methodical way the narrator goes about getting revenge. Exceptional page-turner 
 RU Still Down first posthumus 2pac album is my favorite one created after he died. Pacs vocals are not sped up and the production sounds like a 2pac album. I could list this whole album as the best songs but the standouts to me are RU Still Down, Hellrazor, Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto hip hop version, Open Fire, When I Get Free 1 and 2, Do For Love, F=== All Yall, well just forget it. Every song on here is a standout in my eyes. Pac's albums would go downhill from here. 
 I've enjoyed Robert Parker's fiction for many years now and it still entertains. He aspires to offer some wisdom along with the story and that is also fairly enjoyable. True, sometimes what he brings forth as deep psychological truth is actually pretty ordinary, but then most truth is. I long for him to undiscover psychology and discover other sources of wisdom. But you can't have everything. This particular book is up to his usual standards of clear, concise prose 
 When reading this book, I could not put it down.....i LOVED every single page of this book, I really enjoyed it....it was INTENSE, SAD, and FUNNY....What this poor guy Paul Sheldon goes thru is absolutely unimaginable. I cannot believe it......I feel so bad for this guy....how he adapts to living the way he was forced to, by this psycho crazy bitch by the name of, Annie Wilkes....UNREAL.....go out and pick this one up....like I said before, I couldn't put it down. It took me 2 days to finish it, and I did not speed read it, I TRULY enjoyed it, and was very disappointed when it was over. I am currently reading "IT" and I will review that one when I have finished....GO PICK UP MISERY!!!! 
 I just finished reading Bookends and was very impressed. It's the first Higgs book I have read (although I read and love her column in TCW). I will definitely be reading more of her literature. This was a warm, funny book with a bit of mystery in it. It wasn't predictable in my opinion, which was a nice change from most romantic fiction. I loved the quirky characters(including the golden retriever) and loved how realisitc it was. I had never heard of the Moravian denomination and am now more curious about it. This is defintely a cozy read and would make a good gift for a close friend. 
 with all the scam and vanity presses on the internet, any poor or new author is going to be lead to believe they can be published by any book publishing site they google, that is why this book is so important for any new author wanting to get published.  it not only shows examples of what a bad query looks like but also a good one, which i learned a little too late that all my failed attempts at getting published was because i was acting the same as the person who did the bad example of a query letter.  the only drawback with this is that if you don't think you can get published on your own, there's only 50 listed agents in this book which makes it seem i'll have to save up more money and buy the literary agents guide book 
 This music is simply gorgeous. Petra Haden's vocals remind me a bit of those of Elizabeth Fraser of the (equally sublime) Scottish band, the Cocteau Twins, though perhaps a more Americanized sounding version. Here she puts her vocal talents to very good use, with extraordinary input from the great musician Bill Frisell. The combined effect makes for a wonderful, warm, continuously listenable recording, one I will be listening to for years to come. I particularly like their take on "I don't want to grow up," a song the Ramones rocked; here, the song is rendered into a lullaby 
 This was a great gift for my teenage boy who asks a million questions about all sorts of things! 
 This is an interesting collection of erotic stories written by a master.  While the author does touch in several taboo areas, this is not a "trashy" collection by any means.  I felt her "Delta of Venus" was great, and to a certain extent, this collection is just as well done.  While some of the subject matter verges on the disgusting, it is never-the-less well written and certainly squirms into areas of the mind which, are for the most part, probably shut for most people.  The author's command of the language and her skill with words speak for themselves as you read each page, paragraph and sentence.  All in all, I think it is a shame more do not read this work simply due to the subject matter.  The writing is wonderful and they are missing a real treat.  
 I admit I love Buddy Guy.  I have seen him live twice and Slippin' In does a great job of catching his show.  Raw, hard Chicago blues with some R&B and Rock.  A must buy for blues fans or anyone wanting to get some BG 
 Kiri Te Kanawa's Laudate Dominum as well as the other selections, highlight her beautiful phrasing and exquisite tone of her voice 
 This is really a nice box set.  The sound is crisp(unlike last year's 2-disc collection), the book is great & all the charting singles are here.  I also like the fact that the full-length version of "Run Runaway" was used instead of the single edit.  Of course, this is probably more Slade than most people need, but better too much than not enough!  Even though this is an import, you can find it for a good price if you shop around.       
 I picked this up after reading some reviews on this site.  Let me tell you, I just want to say thank you to all the Knapsack fans that said to go get this album.  I coudn't stop listening to it.  They are just so good.  From start to finish I was feeling the magic.  If you like the get up kids and saves the day, you won't be disappointed.  So stop reading the reviews and purchase the album 
 I purchased this for my daughter who is 10.  It's really a nice item. It's a lot less mess than the paint by numbers and it's also a bit easier to use.  If you have a younger child, they need to be patient to do this since there a lot of small areas to color.  Really great product. Wish I could find in department stores 
 I first read this book to my grandchildren when they were 4 1/2 and 6 years old. They didn't want me to put the book down! This book and "God's Mailbox" also by Marc Gellman are great reading-aloud books, and also a wonderful way to introduce the concept of God to young children. I'm about to buy several more copies for the other young children in my family. [I am actually the wife of "Music Man RS". 
 Great flick with plenty of special effects and great audio and it even has the semblance of a plot. Politicians, watch out 
 This book is great!  I'm an adult who loves music but whose education was neglected in the field of music theory.  This explained all of those "mysteries" and helped me understand that music is simply another language and not just a "gift".  The style is clear and easy enough for my 4th grader to understand.  It enervated me and made me feel not-so-hopeless and that, yes, someday with practice I can play an instrument and understand why music does what it does 
 This is a must see movie. It features some of the best African-American actors and has a story line that everyone can relate to 
 It's wonderful.  If only people making videos could make a film half as good as the books I have read 
 As the other reviewers note, the meditations are very insightful and inspiring.  The format is very similar to the "Forward Day by Day" devotional guide with which most Episcopalians are familiar.  Instead of Bible verses at the top of each day's entry, however, there are short excerpts from the Book of Common Prayer.  You can turn to the BCP for the full text of the collects, rituals, and Psalms, but references are scattered throughout the prayer book.  I was hoping for something that was a little more of an organized guidebook to the BCP, with the added benefit of devotions 
 Jasmine taste is pronounced, tea is refreshing, it is as good as any Jasmine Green I have trie 
 I've been a huge Olivia fan since she began recording, many moons ago.    However her last few albums were tepid offerings at best. After buying them, I'd give them a spin or two and then they were off to the CD shelf to gather dust. Her voice sounded rather raspy, and tired, with many songs oversung.  The selections weren't terribly inspiring either.  THEN Santa dropped "Grace and Gratitude" in my Christmas stocking, and it is one of the best albums I've ever heard. Period. Instead of trite, 'heard it coming and going' love song lyrics, it is moving, well written, and meditative. The melodies are haunting, and compliment the words beautifully.  I'm delighted, and relieved to say that Olivia's back!   Her voice is once again silky smooth, restful, pure, and soaring. The lyrics obviously meant a great deal to her, because she sings them with tenderness, and spiritual abandon.   To the best of my knowlege, this CD is only available from Amazon sellers or Walgreens-either at one of their stores or online at Walgreens.com  I'd not wait another day to buy it if I were you.  You won't be sorry.     
 As a kid thinking about Probability I was very uneasy, intrigued and befuddled by its nature and was never satisfied by any explanations I could find in any book.  In Fuzzy Thinking, Kosko does a magnificent job of explaining away the mystery 
 I bought "Grassroots" in 1996 and still think it's their best work to date. The whole album has a slightly aggressive streak to it in comparison to their other albums but when they go mellow, they do so in a big way. "8.16am", "Lose" and the album closer "1,2,3..." could put you in a trance for hours. Conversely, "Homebrew", "Offbeat Bareass" and particularly "Omaha Stylee" will rock your brains out. Listening to it now the sound quality is pretty thin and weak - but for some reason that's part of its charm. Despite all the production and engineering flaws, "Grassroots" manages to get its point across. The same year "Grassroots" was released, Korn unleashed their debut which led to endless groups with superior sounding recordings (mainly to cope with the increased detuned air being pushed around) but with very little to say for themselves. Instead, 311 challenged convention and had fun at the same time. On the whole, I can't recommend this album enough. If you're feeling a little weary about the unintelligent ramblings of nu-metal posers, this (and 311 in general) will be a breath of fresh air 
 What can you say about this collection except that it is a keeper. Robert Mitchum can walk thru a small, short movie like "Not As A Stranger" and he makes it good. )Well, in that movie, Sinatra helped.) Regarding this box set, "The Sundownders" and "Home From The Hills" are unacclaimed masterpieces. "Macao" and "Angel Face" are classics. "The Yakuza" stands out by itself. "The Good Guys And The Bad Guys" is a well-done western with humor added 
 This has got to be one of my all-time favorite books.  If you're a big fantasy buff, and have read any other works of R.A. Salvatore, this is a must read.  A lot of people really enjoyed the character Drizzt from the Icewind Dale trilogies, and this three part epic compiles everything that ever happened to him before you first met him in the earlier book.  The characters beside Drizzt are amazing and dynamic, bringing their own unique touch to the story.  This book is suitable for anyone over the age of ten, yet isn't a kid's novel.  The world Salvatore creates in The Dark Elf Trilogies is fantastic, and quite immense also.  Ranging from the delving caverns of the Underdark to the over world, the setting plays a major role in the story, just like in other fantasy books, except more so in this one.  This book is loaded with detail, and the plot will be sure to keep the reader wondering what's going to happen next.  Some parts may seem a bit predictable, but they aren't as important as the major events.  Overall, this has got to be one of the best fantasy books I have ever read, and I personally enjoy it more than the Lord of the Rings and other epics.  I definitely recommend to anyone interested in the fantasy genre to read this book, otherwise you'll be missing out on a great opportunity 
 eventhough i understood about 50% of this i loved nourishing myself with it each night... 
 Remarkably candid and insightful book into the  life and incredible World War II military experiences of this belated black Medal of Honor  winner. Story of combat is absolutely rivoting, and the degree of courage unimagineable. -The author remains, throughout, fully human, immensely patient and aware of his own strengths and limitations.  -His description of racial discrimination is balanced and, ultimately, heroic. He is not bitter, and he continues to work for true integration. -If you want a hero to admire, READ THIS BOOK 
 Sharyn McCrumb is a gifted author and this book proves that yet again.  Elizabeth MacPherson is a keeper!  In this installment, our heroine is asked to commit a murder.  To make a good story even better, references to old crimes are interspersed throughout this story.  I liked the British Tour as that provided a fresh new angle on an already good mystery.  Sharyn McCrumb has a wonderfully WICKED sense of humor and her fans and followers will not be disappointed in this installment 
 This strange but charming movie combines the unique talents of director Tim Burton, star Johnny Depp and co-star Martin Landau to tell the story of Ed Wood, the 50's B-movie director of such now cult classics as "Glen or Glenda" and "Plan 9 From Outer Space", both considered to be among the worst movies of all time.  Depp stars as Wood, an eternal optimist with a penchant for cross-dressing.  Landau does an amazing turn as Bela Lugosi, whom Wood "rescued" off the scrap heap to star in his low-budget productions, all the time being a true friend in every sense of the word.  Burton contributes his singular surrealistic style--the world of the movie seems to be set in one of Wood's productions.  Not many people saw this movie on its first release, but like Wood's pictures, it's become a cult classic, but because it's so good, not because it's so bad it's good 
 Back in the 80's when I was about 7 or 8 years old, this 2 part movie came on TV and we recorded it, of course it was on Beta back then.  I totally fell in love with this movie.  After I only saw it once or twice, I wasn't able to see it again for the longest time because my family lost the tape and TV never showed it.  So I was wanting it for years and finally in the late 90's, like 98 or 99, I just happened to look in the Disney store and saw both Alice In Wonderland (1985) and Alice Through The Looking Glass (1985) and I bought them right away.  They were on VHS but it doesn't really matter because I love them so much.  To this day, at 27 years old, I still love this 2 part film and never get bored of it.  I have watched many other versions of Alice In Wonderland and no other version has had an Alice as good as Natalie Gregory or a white rabbit as good as Red Buttons.  Even Ringo Starr is in this version.  I totally love that rabbit costume and back in the 80's, you can tell, or at least I can tell how much work the director put into this film.  Since 1985, other versions haven't shown as much detail and work like this version has.  Even the roses in the rose garden looks real.  I do hope one day, they will release this 2 part masterpiece on DVD because my tapes have gotten a lot of use in the last 5 or 6 years.  If you own any Alice In Wonderland, own this 2 part one because this one puts every other version to shame!! 
 If you have the Thomas series wooden railway series, then by all means, be sure you get Duck.  He's just one of the older trains, and is almost in each and every video.  He doesn't usually have a large role, but he's a kind and good friend to all the engines.  This guy gets taken to bed in our house and also, everywhere we go.  It's pretty funny listening to all the role playing going on in the carseat with this guy and hey, he can even dance to the Wiggles!  These trains definitely develop imagination and fine motor skills, but they also become friends.  These wooden guys are VERY durable too.  They don't chip like you'd think they would when dropped onto the floor.  We plan on keeping our wooden train series and interconnecting them with a "real" train set when our little one gets older.  Also, don't forget to check out the HO series of Thomas here on amazon.  I didn't know they existed and what a neat way to introduce your little one to the fascinating world of trains.  Something they can definitely grow up with and use for quite some time.  Highly recommend Duck 
 This is not a typical chemistry book.  Dr. Schwarcz has several interesing stories such at the background of Thalidomide and the origin of the term "snake oil".  About half the book is on food and health related topics.  It's a fast read and should be interesting to anyone interested in science, health or history.  The Dr. has his own radio show on science so the topics are designed to entertain a wide audience.  The commentaries are short and make sense in any order.  I liked is so much I'm planning on reading one of Dr. Schwarcz's other collections of commentaries.  
 you know them... you hate them.... or.... you love them.... it really is that simple. Bar none... their best album is this. It always was, and always will be 
 I used this movie as part of my Hispanic Heritage Month (october) lesson in the classroom.  We did a study of Jaime Escalante and Salvador Dali.  The children really enjoyed the movie.  We just watched the classroom scenes (teacher's version of editing for content and time), while I explained what was happening.   My class loved it and so did I 
 You don't have to be a steely Dan fan to appreciate Fagen's jazz phrasing and pop hooks.  I have owned this album on vinyl, tape, CD and now digitally and wouldn't be without it.  It is as fresh and vibrant now as it was in 1982---amazingly, since the premise here is post-beatnik, jazz-noir.  I defy you to listen to the latin-tinged "The Goodbye Look" or supper club-ish "Walk Between Raindrops" without a smile and a finger-pop 
 The title says it all. I often compare this book to The Alchemist but Life of Pi has far more humor to it 
 Having a strong interest in New Testament history and being a fan of historical fiction, I was immediately interested in this book.  I was a bit surprised to find it was not a narrative, but simply a fictional collection of ancient letters between Luke -- the author of the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles -- and a Roman nobleman named Antipas.  This format, though, is well used.  Indeed, it is compelling.    We follow Antipas' and Luke's correspondence, which begins with a chance introduction.  As Antipas reads Luke's Gospel, he discusses it at first from a very Roman point of view.  But as he reads more and begins to spend time with Christians of his city, Antipas gradually sees the faults in his Roman upbringing, his pagan worldview.  He is drawn to Jesus both through the writings of Luke and through the witness and lives of the Christians with whom he fellowships.  Ultimately, he joins them and dies the truly noble death of a martyr.  (The reference to the death of Antipas in Rev. 2:13 is the inspiration of the story).    The value of this book is that it places the reader in the early Christian world like nothing else I have ever read.  Longenecker has taken all the books about New Testament History, Jewish history, and the larger Roman world of the time, and used them to create an authentic exchange of late first century correspondence between a pagan and a Christian.  Beyond the obvious monotheism v. paganism, Longenecker does an excellent job of bringing out the differing attitudes of Roman and Christian charity.  Of Christian brotherhood and its foreignness to the Roman world.  Of the worship of the emperor.  In short, Longenecker does an effective job of placing the reader back into the Roman world and communicating the challenges that Christians faced in it (especially Christians of any social standing).    This book is emotionally moving at times, especially in its depictions of Christian charity in a harsh world.  It is also an easy read.  It does not get bogged down and you find yourself looking forward to seeing how Luke responds to one of Antipas' questions or comments.  Or how Antipas responds to certain passages he reads in Luke's Gospel.  Unlike some historical fiction, it does not have moments of preachiness or contrived depictions intended to prove a point.    Very enjoyable.  And, very profitable.  
 Jim Harris is such a wonderful illustrator and the pictures in this book are so cute. It's a southwest twist on the 3 Little Pigs. We live in a desert area and it's fun to have a book to read to my 2 year old that reflects more of our local geography. I especially love that the little girl javelina is wearing a cowgirl outfit with fringe and perky little boots. CUTE 
 I loved this album more than all of Jack Johnson albums. The combination of other kinds of musical instruments gives it an experimental touch. Very soothing and lovable 
 Get it or give it.   I had never read through the entire Old Testament and my New Testament understanding is enriched by the ordering and similarity of parallel passages. In the year's reading (which takes 10 to 15 minutes per morning--I've found it has made the a.m. reading easily part of my routine), you may also want to study the gospel additionally. I noticed that when I was reading the Old Testament, the gospel on Sunday was especially refreshing.   This has been an awesome year of growth for me and this reading has, through the Holy Spirit, enlightened me.   Most of all, I think this has helped me with the discipline of what to read in the Bible and how much--so I am in the Word on a daily basis. I have been reading the NIV version.  Next year, I may go back and read again with the NIV Study Bible in hand for a more detailed look at context. Transition statements in the Chronological Bible add enough information to follow along smoothly. However, if you want more detail--the Zondervan NIV Study Bible is a good one, from what I have seen so far.     The Chronological Bible is an excellent gift or introduction for daily Bible reading 
 Excelent DVD quality and so great movie. The sounds and pictures are so great. The description of the product is very explicit in the page. This special edition is really special!  ---------------------------------  Exelente calidad de DVD y muy linda pelicula. Los sonidos y dibujos son excelentes tambien. La descripcion de la pelicula en la pagina es muy exacta. Estaq edicion especial es de verdad especial 
 The things one notices in life often depends on our point of view.  In some cases, this is literally true.  For humans living in the modern world of concrete and steel, we are often oblivious to the ecosystems that occur in other locales on different scales of space.  This book opens a window to this world through beautiful photographs and wonderful text.  Focusing on those environments lying within the tropics: deserts, tropical rain forests and African savannahs, the author uses incredible photography to show the beauty and intricacy of life among smaller creatures.    The author presents the life forms of each environment using exquisite photographs, with accompanying text that describes the lifestyles, habitat, and life cycle of each, and how they interact with their fellow denizens.  All the various animals are covered: crustaceans, spiders, scorpions, lizards, frogs, katydids, beetles, etc...  The author also goes out of the way to show those species that are the rarest of their kind, and gets them in their native environments.  Hence the reader can test himself by trying to locate the camouflaged butterfly sitting on a treebark, or the walking stick swaying among leaves and branches.  The book also gives a good background of how man affects the different species, and how many of these ecosystems can be measured in square footage.    Overall, a great book to read, or just to flip through.  The text is simple enough for non-scientists to appreciate, yet it contains enough illustrations and facts to intrigue any nature-lover.  I highly recommend this book 
 I enjoyed reading The Mark. It was definitely a page turner. Of course it makes me want to continue with the series. Tim F. LaHaye is a great author and story teller. I actually visualized the whole the thing. I would thank him in person if I could, for a wonderful job done...  Thank you.. 
 This is the first SACD that I bought from the store. It marked a very distinct quality between SACD and normal CD. My favourite tracks are Badia, Simple Gifts and Give Me One Reason. The accoustic guitar is crystal clear, the orchestra has added more depth and the vocal coming from centre speaker is really wonderful. Recommended Surround Setup included in the cover booklet is quite helpful 
 I have found myself in some difficult situations in the past year. This book is wonderful and I use it as a tool to focus my life more toward God. I feel so much better after reading it. I completely reccomend it for those who need that spirituality in their lives 
 Never Let Me Go is the story of Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy, a trio of kids who grew up at Hailsham, an exclusive and mysterious English boarding school. More specifically, the novel is the story of the strained, bizarre, and sometimes torturous friendship that grows between the three. Against the austere, unsettling background of Hailsham, their relationship twists and turns, simultaneously bringing out the best and worst in all of them- Ruth, we see, is capable of both great affection and seemingly bottomless spite. Tommy, meanwhile, is innocent, insightful, and yet hopelessly naive. Kathy, the story's conflicted, regretful narrator, is a bundle of contradictions, simultaneously strong willed and spineless, loving and bitter, moralistic and utilitarean. The interactions and struggles of these three make for a surprisingly touching, at times cathartic, character study.  Ishiguro has created quite the backdrop for this little drama: Hailsham is a downright eerie place- It's a sprawling, luxurious boarding school in which none of the students seem to have family names, or even families. The place is teeming with inexplicaple unwritten rules, seemingly meaningless rituals, and overprotective teachers. As such, Hailsham creates a feeling of both extreme privliage and silent opression. The result is a moody, atmospheric setting, in which there's a constant sensation that something awful is lurking just beneath the surface, and that it would be exposed if Ishiguro would only reveal one or two more facts. But every revelation only breeds more questions, and the tension remains just beneath the surface. By keeping the heart of the novel seemingly just out of reach, Ishiguro is able to craft an amazingly suspensful page-turner that packs quite the emotional wallop.   However, Never Let me Go isn't perfect: Ishiguro never takes the time to develop his characters. He simply gives us thumbnail sketches, and expects us to fill in the blanks for him. As a result, it's pretty hard to sympathize with them sometimes. Also, the story takes on a somewhat cheesy, ham-fisted sci-fi element that almost ruins the mood. Hailsham's atmosphere is rooted in mystery, not some done-to-death conspiracy story (I won't give away just what the sci-fi element is, but I will say that it has been done before). Having said that, the awful (?) truth behind the existence of Hailsham does have a pretty profound effect on the characters, and as a result, it does have its uses.  At its best, Never Let me Go is a tense, suspensful novel about human relationships and victimization 
 Read it NOW! For you, Rwanda, and humanity.  I love you Immaculee Ilibagiz 
 This album cant really be restricted to 5 stars!..Every song tells its own story and manages to include you emotionally. Peaches and Cream is an obvious stand out. I would definatly advise anyone to see these guys live! I did last year and without doubt it was the best concert ive been to. What You Want is probably there most famous song, an amazingly inspiring track..even better acoustic. Other standouts include Bound to Ramble, Company Sin, Seeing Angels, oldman. JBT are one th most original bands to hit the scene for a long time..a mesmerizing sound mixed with in my opinion the best guitar skills globally...Watch the video to Ocean and your see why. BUY THIS ALBUM!!...AND THREE! 
 I started with a D50 and have loved it from the very begining. I felt ready to step up to the next level, but didn't think I was ready for the d200. When I heard about the d80, I read everything I could. The biggest selling point was the fact that it was the same internal workings as the d200 in the more consumer friendly d50 body. I don't use all of the mode setting and find myself in Shutter and Aperture Priority most of the time, but it's nice to have the others there when I don't want to think about or have time to fiddle with settings.  The in camera image enhancements are amazing--but a word of caution. Vivid +2 will definitely give you vivid shots--if not too much so.  I've had this baby for about 2 weeks and imagine it will be my camera for the next couple years.  Compared to the Canon 30d (which I was thinking about) or even the new 400d (I haven't actually held one yet), this is the Nikon to have.  On batter life, I had a recent shoot where I took over 800 shots in a 3 hour period. The battery was at about half and that's with quite a bit of LCD viewing.  At this level both Canon and Nikon offer great equipment--you can't go wrong with either. Just get one of each in your hands, snap a few shots, and go with the one that feels the best for you 
 I should read this book sooner and it would have saved my relationship with Lily Susanto the lady I love so dearly. I still love her very much till this day. This book I suggest ever one gave it a good look even if they are not buddhist. It also deals with family as well, A great book.. It touch my 'soul' and I shed tears and my heart ache knowing that I should read it sooner 
 This book helps you bring more to the story.  Each book has a message or theme.  Each story has an activity go go with the book; language arts, crafts, games. Develops thinking skills in young children 
 It's entertaining with lots of advise - whether ethical or not - it resembles some people's behaviour in a corporate office. You don't need to learn how to do it, just be aware of the games that people play in the office. It will help you to identify some of them and avoid being caught in it 
 I think my grandfather's life has changed tremendously since he discovered this form of healing. Learning more about it is beneficial to anyone that is interested in taking a different path through their life. He does an awesome job at explaining what he knows 
 Green Day is simply the best band out there. They put on the best live shows and have the best cds. It would be stupid to call Green Day the worst. This cd has great audio and all my favorite songs. If you like Green Day you'll love this CD and DVD 
 A well written, eye opener of a book!  This book explains the basic dental procedures we've all endured with emphasis on how that dental work affects our health.  The authors include a very interesting perspective of dental history, current procedures, solutions to previously performed faulty procedures, and even some well founded nutritional advice.  This is a must read for anyone with chronically ill health or for anyone who desires to make well informed decisions regarding their health.  I never would have thought a book on dentistry and health could ever be such a "page-turner" 
 The world of theatre criticism can be a brutal and mean place where careers are lost and broken. The chance for comedy is just as enormous. Diana Rigg has compiled some of the meanest, nastiest, and funniest theatre reviews ever published.  Playwrights, actors, actresses, directors and the  productions themselves are all hung out to dry. This book is a hilarious  addition to anyone's collection 
 Very good and scary movie.  Saw years ago on video, DVD makes it so much better.  Some say it's better watching it for a second time-you may miss some key facts the first time around.  One of my favorites! Highly recommended 
 This book is one of Christie's less well-known ones.  I know that I had not read it until now, and I thought I had gotten through all of Agatha Christie's Poirot books.  But it is a wonderful mystery story, and written in the true Christie fashion.  There are more twists and turns in a seemingly simple murder case than a small country road.  This book starts with the premise that only one person could possibly have killed the young girl, and Hercule Poirot is brought in to at the very least, not have the murderer's sentence extend to capital punishment.  But in true Hercule Poirot fashion, he finds out that even though it looks like only one person could have done it, there were in fact more options than that.  As I reread some of the Agatha Christie classics, I am overwhelmed by her craftsmanship.  She is the true queen of crime, and no one has taken over that mantel yet 
 Sure, this is a funny book.  There are parts that are hilarious because you know it to be true; but then again, there are parts that are offensive because they assume things (Like if you are a guy and marry a Jew, you'll never have to make another decision again in your life). They use personal photos in here (none that are touched up) and some of them are fantastic (I love the Grandma going on a seaplane with her own floatie wrapped around her).    I didn't like the comparison between Christmas and Chanukah because there actually is no comparison considering they are nowhere near alike and there is no similarity other than the exchange of gifts.  If you aren't so broad minded, you will probably find parts offensive, but if you let loose a little, then you should have a couple of big laughs.  These guys are quite funny (I saw them on The View and found myself laughing along with them) and I can't wait to see their show in New York when I go next year. This certainly is an entertaining read and I think it would make an excellent Chanukah gift or a treat for yourself to read over some vacation time.  I liked it 
 Queen's mega-albums were, in order of release, A Night At The Opera, A Day At The Races, and News Of The World. Personally, I've always ranked this a shade behind Opera and a shade ahead of Races. It has the gigantic "We Will Rock You" and "We Are The Champions," but there are a lot of great songs here you don't hear too often. My favorites are "Sheer Heart Attack," "It's Late," and "Sleeping On The Sidewalk." All in all, a great album 
 Anthony Haynes' "Writing Successful Textbooks" is a much needed discourse on writing exposition for an audience of learners, especially students enrolled in college courses, from the perspective of an acquisitions editor in textbook publishing. Haynes links his suggestions and cautionary advice to models of learning theory and pedagogical frameworks as well as to best practices and realities in the textbook publishing industry today. This title is a practical, highly readable, serviceable guide for textbook authors 
 More than a few of my well-traveled friends have raved about The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston as their favorite museum in all the world.  And why not?  Wait until you see it--you'll feel right at home.  Imagine creating for yourself a life that is perfectly delicious.  Imagine creating for the world a home museum experience unequaled in all the world.  The Hyde Museum in Glens Falls, NY, held that honor for me until I learned the story and saw the pictural views of Fenway Court Isabella Gardner created as her home, which after her death in 1924 was changed to be called The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.  Most museum books have wonderful pictures without so rich a story of a strong, courageous woman of impeccable, impassioned taste.  No one could have created Fenway Court except Isabella Gardner.  Few have created such a wonderful life for themselves and left such an amazing legacy.  And, she also managed to maintain her beauty and figure. And what a negotiator she was to gain possession of a piece of art she felt Fenway must own.   I feel empowered to have learned her story.  
 The size of space for writing is good and I LOVE LOVE the perforated to do lists included.  The only feature I wish for is a page with a calendar of each month.  The entire year is in the front of the planner so you have to keep turning back and forth.  
 It is strange reviewing it. It's like reviewing some sacred book...   The whole World is here. And more... Here is Argentina with its familiar (to Borges) streets; here is a poem about chess, the Moon, tigers. Men. Here is Iceland in all its beauty and past; in a way no one else can ever portray it. Beautiful poems about art, God, history, mirrors, death, life, war, Shinto, Love, time, eternity, blindness, mortality, emotion, thoughts... everything and nothing...   Through this precious book we may perceive all of this through Borges' blind, ever watching, tired eyes.  I love to be lost in all those words... 
 These speakers have great sound and a small footprint that makes them easy to take anywhere.  I wanted some speakers that I could use to listen to my audio books.  These are perfect.  I am listening to music right now and could not be more pleased.  
 The Van Gogh Café is magic. Nobody knows quite how or why, but they all agree that it is. Nobody knows it better than ten-year-old Clara. She helps her dad, Marc, run the café. Clara knows how much the café loves stories, and the small stories don't often stay small for long.  To the people in Flowers, Kansas, who have been going to the café all of their lives, the unbelievable is pretty normal, and the impossible seems quite possible. Anything can happen at the Van Gogh Café.  From lost loves found, to a cat that falls in love with a seagull. From food that cooks itself, to magically multiplying muffins. From prophetic poetry on napkins, to a possum that helps a man find his life again. You never know what you might find at the Van Gogh Café.  I love it!  My only complaint is that it's too short and I want more! My only question is, can I please go visit? Maybe even work there? Oh, that's two questions.  Reviewed by:  Carrie Spellma 
 The book features procedures for identifying what to measure and specific steps readers can take to determine what to measure. It's a useful guide for figuring out what to measure for a specific organizational need, but requires some knowledge of measurement terminology. While I found it a useful guide as a performance and scorecard consultant, some of my clients found it a bit daunting. Good models and examples throughout 
 I bought this relatively blind, having heard some of the songs from the first soundtrack, which can be bought at pinkapples.com in case anyone is interested.  Anyway both CDs are a wonderful fusion of celtic tunes and electronica.  The instrumentalists all sound like Pros, and I actually like the techno songs (I'm a musician myself, and usually find techno exquisitely boring).  I've been listening to it fairly continuously for the last 3 weeks, and I've only now stopped because I just got sndtrk #1 in the mail today, and it's just as good as #2 
 The book biggest strength is that it uses many quotations of John Adams, Abigail, John Quincy Adams, and Jefferson to tell its tale. These people were intelligent and very good writers. I enjoyed the biography. I enjoyed McCullough's writing style and the leisurely pace he sets for himself. The biography clearly portrays a man who lived long, did many great things, and died at peace with himself. The book glosses over Adams' weaknesses and I thought spent way too much time on what Jefferson and Adams thought of each other, but these are minor flaws. I enjoyed Morris's biography of Roosevelt more, but this book was a good summer read and was far better than McCullough's 1776. I learned how this nation owes a great debt to this great, but flawed man. 
 This is one of my favorite books and my appreciation of it was only enhanced when they made a movie of it.  Patricia Highsmith has a dark sense of humor about her villains.  She also makes you put yourself in Ripley's place and though he is somewhat of a psychopath, you can see how one thing leads to another as he gets deeper and deeper into trouble and mayhem.  The book group I lead at our local library will be reading this book this year and I am expecting them to have mixed reviews of it.  Not everyone wants to suspend moral judgment for such characters and not everyone enjoys being manipulated into sympathizing with a killer.  This is the first of a series of "Ripley books."  I've read them all and would recommend them highly 
 I really liked this book. I liked the first one more but this one is almost as good. I think that the other one had more action is the only thing. This one is still a great Sam Fisher adventure. I am a huge fan of the game, and some have said that this isn't much like it, but I dissagree. People who liked the last one would like this one, just make sure that you read the first one before this. It will make more sense 
 Just when I thought every band I had ever loved had vanished, The Lemonheads show up out of nowhere. With none other then Bill Stevenson of "The Descendents" on drums Evan Dando has return with another great collection of fun, thoughtful and of course catchy songs that like classics such as "It's A Shame About Ray" and "Lick" won't soon be forgotten. I highly recommend to all and every Lemonheads fan 
 For those unable to reach for a copy of Foreign Relations of the United States for the appropiate years, or unwilling to dig through them, this collection of Service's reports is a good stand in.  The reports are reproduced and edited together by subject.  This has its good and bad qualities.  Good in that you can more easily look up Service's point of view on topics in China, but bad in that it makes it easier to over look or confuse the chronology of the reports. Overall, a must have for anyone interested in John Service 
 It works in New Jersey, just wait a night before you say something else 
 As a resident of Chicago, I am grateful to the author for writing this book.  Now, I know where to have my knives sharpened, buy fresh ginger, and find the best teas 
 The birth of TG is messy and disturbing to be sure - the sound quality is atrotious and some of the lyrics are truly frightening - but it is nothing if not unignorable and unforgetable. And for all the fuss about the din of noise, the industrial clatter blah blah blah, there are some quite beautiful moments on this cd. "After Cease to Exist" in particular is darkly ambient and almost relaxing. Not the best of the official TG releases, but an absolutely essential purchase 
 I like this book, mainly because I find I share similar tastes as as the authors. If they recommend a CD, I generally enjoy it. Their selection of the best recordings of people like Corea and Jarrett I also agree with. Whereas I have been disappointed with other publications such as the Penguin and AMG guides which have a different viewpoint.   Not surprisingly, the book is very good on the British scene and what is happening on the Babel, Caber and Provocateur labels. The UK is very interesting at the moment, with lots of young exciting players and music.        
 Well, the product and the shipping times were perfect, I appreciated to receive so quickly such a cool item. The dvds are 7 per box, with the complete two seasons and some bonus features. If you like Orange County, you must get it 
 This is my favorite book of all time. As an artist/author I can relate completely with the main character, the endearing, irascible but delightful Gully Jimson. It seems as though the Universe is against him trying to work and create his art! Like the great William Blake, Gully's painter poet hero, Gully is not respected and appreciated for his original artistic genius.  The prose is outstanding and rich, lyrical, poetic and beautiful, the characters unique, realistic and unforgettable. If you never read another book in your life you need to read this one first. I have read it again and again and when times get tough it always makes me laugh!  I only wish Joyce Carey had written much more as he was the best of the best 
 As a brand management and marketing consultant, I try to read as many of the newly published marketing books as possible.  Most of them rehash old material, are not very useful and are quite uninspiring.  Not so with John Winsor's "Beyond the Brand."  It is well written and easy to read with many useful examples and case studies.  But, more importantly, it focuses on what really matters in developing compelling brands -- authenticity, customer intimacy, standing for something, listening, crafting your story, using your intuition, etc.  And his "Bottom Up" strategy model uniquely organizes these concepts in a simple to understand fashion.  It is clear that John Winsor knows of what he writes.  If you want to gain a fresh perspective on brand building, buy John's book.  I highly recommend it 
 This is the best mountain biking trail book I have read, period.  Nice maps with the excellent addition of elevation gain and loss graph for the ride.  Thorough trail descriptions allow one to gain a flavor for the ride  while mentally preparing you for the challenges ahead.  As an added bonus,  Timm's writing style is enjoyable reading that will have one's imagination  out on the trail regardless of where you are sitting with the book.   He  has obviously ridden many miles with a crazed biking grin while writing  this book and it shows.  Rides throughout the state are covered from gentle  suburban greenways for casual riders to the knurliest of  Pisgah descents  for the hardcore addict.  Anyone who has any off road biking interest in  North Carolina should have this book.  It makes you abandon thoughts of  work and long to just get outside and ride 
   The third and final installment in Kieslowski's monumental Trois Couleurs Trilogy is probably the most popular, and most humane of the three.  The beautiful Irene Jacob plays a model, Valentine, who finds and returns an old man's dog, and subsequently gets drawn into that old man's world. The neighbour is an ex-judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant in a marvellous, layered performance of disillusion, horror, fear and disdain.) who has taken in his old age to spying on his neighbours via surveillance equipment.  At first she finds The Judge pathetic but comes to see she is not as dissimilar to him as she may imagine.  The acting is exemplary, the cinematography is superb and the story, while not wholly realistic (There seems to be a touch of ex machina deus, or divine intervention in Kieslowski's farewell masterpiece.) is very thoughtful, and considered.  This is probably the most fully-rounded of the three films in the trilogy and in many ways the most satisfying - perhaps because it DOES ask the audience questions about fate, chance and the possibility of God.  It is the late work of a grand master of the cinema. And although I must confess the first time I saw it I thought the tricksy ending in which Kiewslowski manages to tie-in the other two movies in the series a little sentimental and contrived, after several viewings over many years it becomes clear that the contrivance is precisely the point.  This is a film with a great deal of questions to ask its audience and a number of provocations, and by this stage Kiewslowski had earned a little indulgence with his unlikely plot twists.  Enjoyable, thought-provoking and breath-takingly beautiful, this movie - along with the other two in the trilogy - has had a profound impact on the cinema (particularly on European cinema, but not limited to; Sophia Coppola is a fan!) produced since and needs to be added to any sensible cinema-lover's collection.  Outstanding 
 Grant has out-done himself with this re-write.  His inside information about the Ark of the Covenant and it's possible return to Israel is amazing.  I loved his understanding of the battles of Gog and Magog.  This  book is a must read for those who hunger to understand God's prophetic  word 
 I found it very difficult to sustain my interest in this book. I found it to have a flatness of language and feeling, as if it were written by Babbit himself. I understood that Sinclair Lewis was at once satirizing and presently sympathetically this Midwestern go- getter, shallow and ambitious, who too is hypocritical in his betrayal of his wife.  I find that the great writers create characters who we come to deeply care about. Somehow I could not do this for Babbit.  The fault may be in the reader, but I found the whole enterprise boring 
 I've always wondered if MGM, which was known for its musicals, would have been the industry leader in that category if little Miss Gum hadn't come along in the late '30's.  This is a great compilation of Judy's best from nearly 20 years of MGM movies... and nearly every song will make you remember the film and specific scene it came from.  You'll "see" Judy at the mirror as she expresses her love for Clark Gable with "You Made Me Love You," you'll "see" her bouncing on the trolley as it hurtles down a street in old St. Louis, you'll "see" her leading that wonderful gang of Harvey Girls as she salutes the "Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe."  They say that music is "emotional shorthand;" this CD is a time machine to the 1930's and '40s... when Culver City was the entertainment capitol of the universe 
 This book will change what you thought you knew about gov't and special interests.  Everyone thinks the gov't has always been controlled by special interests, but most don't understand how deep the connection is.  And how long religion and oil(whale and from the ground)has controlled and steered this country from it's inception.  This is not a politically motivated book, it's a "history tends to repeat itself" book.  You will definitely learn a ton from this book.  Top notch, but definitely not a optimistic view of the fate of the United States. 
 An enjoyable book to read and enjoy with your child. I don't think you can get through this book without singing the words and lots of giggles 
 This is my favorite beading book of all time. The instructions are simple and helpful and the examples in the gallery are exquisite. After five minutes with this book I'm hauling out my beads and needle, even when I'm exhausted from a day at work

 I am working from home with my third business,its very sucessful by my standards, and I have its growth firmly under control.I picked up a copy of this at the library, wish I had read it two businesses ago. If you have a small business, or want to start one, please read this first, its the best small business book you can read. Its honest, no hype or promo work, I now have a copy and use it it to keep on track wit hsome of my details.  Many of the lessons in the book I learned the hard way over the last ten years, by reading this you can avoid a lot of Pain 
 A fan of Koontz since I read Dragon Tears back in 1993, I would often allow my mom to check out audio versions of his other books for me to read from the library. I have not, as yet, encountered a Koontz book that I didn't like. Even the Taking, which I can admit wasn't necessarily one of Koontz's best works, is one that, when finances permit, I will probably add to my listening library. However, I have to say that one of his best works was probably False Memory.   The nightmare begins one morning when Martie Rhodes, a young computer game designer awakens to a glass of unusually sour grape juice. She thinks nothing further of it until she takes Valet, her Golden Retriever, out for a walk. On her way home she is suddenly seized by a premonition of a disaster looming somewhere on the horizon. Upon returning home, she looks into the mirror and is suddenly terrified by her reflection.   Elsewhere in the morning, Martie's young housepainter husband Dusty has his own problems. His younger brother, Skeet, is in the very act of attempting to throw himself off the roof of the house he's been contracted to paint. Dusty acts to save his brother's life and ultimately succeeds.   Things only get worse when Martie goes to visit her childhood friend Susan Jagger, who has recently developed a terrible, crippling fear of open spaces. Though she attends therapy sessions every week with a little nudge from Martie, Martie notices that her symptoms only seem to be growing worse.   Things take an even more disturbing turn when Susan calls Martie up later in the evening to confess that she has lately been visited by a mysterious nighttime rapest who leaves her with no recollection of his visits. Martie, however, has her own problems as she is assailed by panic attacks that grow more and more intense as they come, driving her to eliminate from the house any object that could potentially be used as a weapon to mutilate or even kill her loved ones.   Susan, meanwhile, makes a daring attempt to catch her rapest in the act. Remembering a video camera that once belonged to her X husband, Susan loads it and conceals it among the leaves of a plant in her bedroom. The truth she uncovers thanks to this clever trap is a shocking one that places her life and those of the Rhodes' in diar peril, for the identity of her visitor is one that she never expected.   Martie and Dusty, meanwhile, with the aid of a few close friends, set out on a quest to discover the source behind the inexplicable events that have befallen them. Their quest leads them to New Mexico, where they uncover some dark secrets that may have a more personal meaning than imagined...   All in all I was extremely impressed with the book. It was certainly one of Koontz's best 
 Having been to the ISGM (Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum) before reading either "Mrs. Jack" or this book, if planning a trip to the museum I highly recommend you read at least one of these books.  The museum is truly magnificent, however my only criticism is that the administration of the museum cannot seem to decide if they have a "house museum" (like the Newport mansions) or an art museum.  There is precious little information posted within the meusum to tell you what it is you're looking at - the guidebooks available at the museum woefully inadequate.  After reading Mrs. Jack I realize that much of this may have been stipulated by Isabella herself - she expected you to know what it was you were seeing without cheats like descriptions.  Art for art's sake.  It did not matter if Rembrandt painted a canvas - you either like it or you don't - merely wanting to see it because it's a priceless Rembrandt is too bourgeois for Isabella to have considered.  In her day, in her level of society, you could still buy a Rembrandt or a Vermeer, 100 years later this is a lot harder to do, making these paintings more rare to us than her.  She knew John Singer Sargent personally, so having your portrait painted by him was probably less of a big deal than we see it as today - anyone in her level of society could hire him, so to her - what was the big deal?  100 years more time has made it a big deal to us.  
 Jack WHyte has done it again.  Another adventures addition to the Camulod Chronicals.  Whyte's style of writting has made every page interesting to read.  With ongoing adventures for the young Arthur, a leave from the colony is a must.  This story of Arthur keeps getting better with each book 
 John Locke's Second Treatise on Government is the Natural Rights philosophy's greatest essay. Locke, an English freethinker, wrote both his Frist and Second Treatise on Government to refute the patriarchial and absolutist writings of Sir Robert Filmer. Locke clearly believes man is imbued with the natural right to life, liberty, and property. He believes men have a right to live free from tyrannical government.  Locke shows how when a government degenerates into tyranny the "people" have a right to revolt and throw off such government. Sound familar? Jefferson wrote these words into the Declaration of Independence. Locke believes that liberty is a man's right by his very nature of being human. He points out how that men come together to form a government, based upon a social contract, and that the rulers or government must abide by that contract or man returns to his natural state. In the natural state men are not bound to the current ruler but may institute new government for their security and protection.  Although he believed that government should not be changed lightly or on a whim, and believed that the ruler must violate the contract and usurp power, he nevertheless pointed out that government is of men, not God or gods. He repudiated the doctrine propagated by Filmer, that rulers are appointed to rule by God, ie: the Divine Right of Kings.  This "wee little book" as Jefferson put it, has had a tremendous influence on the Western world. Locke, a child of the English Enlightenment has caused conservatives and other tyrants, socialists and communists to shudder at the right to throw off tyrannical government. A truly great read 
 "With Love as our only reality, health and wholeness can be viewed as inner peace, and healing can be seen as letting go of fear." -Gerald Jampolsky, on What Is Real in Part I.  We all have our own past experiences, value systems, and personal opinions.  To the best of our abilities, we utilize the tools we currently have to make choices and decisions.  These choices and decisions are made not only in our own self interest, but also for the benefit and happiness of those we care about.  To be concerned for ourselves and those around us is certainly normal, and I believe a natural part of human nature.  In, "Love Is Letting Go Of Fear", Gerald Jampolsky suggests we take another look at the many possibilities for choices we can make regarding our lives and choose only one: peace of mind.  According to Jampolsky, our past guilt and fear interfere with our present reality because we spend much of our time worrying about a mix of what has already happened in our lives, and what has yet to occur.  As we dwell on our past and consider our concerns for the future, we deny our only real opportunity for lasting harmony: choosing peace of mind in the present moment.  Admittedly, achieving peace of mind as our single and highest goal in life is not easily accomplished.  Gerald Jampolsky shares many of his own personal stories throughout the book about working with these issues and keeping peace of mind in the forefront as the main objective.  In order to accomplish peace of mind, Jampolsky points out that forgiveness must be our single function.  You cannot come away from this book without realizing it was written from the depths of Gerald Jampolsky's heart.  He points us tenderly in the right direction as he tells us about achieving peace of mind through forgiveness, and gently reminds us that the responsibility is our own.  Jampolsky assures us that as we set aside our fear, limitations, and judgements we can discover our true essence- Love.  "Teach only love, for that is what you are." -Gerald Jampolsky  ~Brian Douthit author of "Perfectly Said: when words become art" 
 I received this book several months ago.  I have read all of Ms. Browne's other books and found this one to be equally entertaining.  I loved that she used women from her Messageboard of Love as examples in this book.  These women are absolutely hilarious.  It is like finding a whole new group of friends.  If you love to laugh read this book 
 The book gives a comprehensive treatment on image processing and covers the appropriate amount of information. The depth of materials was appropriate for someone already familiar with basic signal and probability theories. This is definitely the book to keep as reference if you plan to work in the area.  An additional chapter on image reconstruction will be extra helpful 
  As much as I appreciate and respect the work of the editor, I was distresed to find that passages in which Ruskin addressed labor reform were left out. This was in Chapter 6. In the original, Ruskin argued for preserving the integrity of individual workers. I found that this edition left out pages that concerned labor reform, making the work appear to concern architecture alone. If you are interested in Ruskin's views on society, then, be cautious of this. For my part, I ended up resorting to the Norton Anthology of Literature for the text I needed.   In the "Gothic" passage of SoV Ruskin wrote quite forcefully in defense of labor. He emphasized how important it is for buildings to show the work of individual workers. Signs of their work are an essential part of the architecture, he contended. Much of this argument does not appear in this edition.  It remains a wonderful work for those who are interested in the architecture alone.   
 My 1-year old received this for christmas last year and as much as she enjoyed touching and inspecting all of the different animals, her older sisters (4 & 6 at the time) had as much fun organizing them, placing them in various places on the ark and disassembling and reassembling the ark.  Nearly a year later the now 2-year old and [..] still love playing with it, along with their 9month old baby sister.  They love to role play and have used this set to act out many creative scenarios.  Has held up prefectly with even the most abusive friends and was well worth my money

 A detailed history of how legal, lifelong, heterosexual monogamous marriage has been actively promoted, mandated, and enforced by various means throughout the history of the USA, with little or no tolerance for those who espouse nontraditonal relationship forms.  Well researched and well written.  Highly recommended 
 This is the most impressive cutter I've EVER seen, and I've seen lots of them (mostly on their way into the trash because they wobble, or anger me in some other substantial way!)  It's true, fast, sharp-edged, fits nicely in the the palm, and dishwasher too, with no tears - ITS tears, you understand.  I would buy another one if 'small grays' carried this off in the night.  Great price, great tool, fast service.  Highly recommended 
 Jeffrey Ford's "The Trentino Kid," starts things off on a slightly creepy note. It's about a guy who has frittered his youth away in what he thought was an easier route. He's regretting the choices he's made when he comes across a ghost that'll force his hand in a (hopefully) new direction. This is a story that'll resonate with anyone who wishes they had taken a different path years earlier. I know it certainly struck a nerve with me!  Tanith Lee's "The Ghost In The Clock" is atmospheric as is her usual style and features a tale of a clock with a horrific past, a ghost and a good dose of madness. Descriptive writing, a creeping sense of unease make this one a chill inducing read.  "The Thing About the Night" just wasn't to my taste. Too scientific, me thinks.  "The Silence of the Falling Stars about a park ranger whom I didn't care for at all didn't work very well for me either, I'm afraid. I can't pinpoint where it went wrong. I just found it dull overall.  Gahan Wilson's "The Dead Ghost" was a short and to the point recounting of an injured man's encounter with an overweight, naked ghost. I enjoyed this one, maybe because it was a nice breather after the previous two stories which I thought were both over long.  Oates "Subway" is a haunting but somewhat familiar story of tragedy and a woman's never-ending search for love.  "The Seven Sisters" is a story about 7 formerly grand homes now falling to ruin. This one didn't resonate with me in any way and I can't really remember much else about it.  "Doctor Hood" was more accessible the the previous story. It's about a woman returning to her childhood home because she's worried about her increasingly distant father. It's about loss, letting go and features a good dose of ghostbusting. I enjoyed the originality of the end of this one.  "An Amicable Divorce" is a story rooted in tragedy and is deeply emotional. It's about a man still deeply in love with his ex-wife. Sadly, she isn't at all in a good place to return his love but calls him often and begs for help with a creature that is inhabiting their home late at night. This one gets under your skin and lives up to the promises made by the editor and, despite it's very gloominess, was probably my favorite.  "Feeling Remains" is about a young boy whose feminist mom seems more interested in everyone but him. After forcing him to care for an aging neighbor who dies, he's haunted by the old lady's treasured book of photos. This story, the neglect of the child, and the over-the-top selfishness of the mother annoyed the heck out of me.  "The Gallow's Necklace by Sharyn McCrumb" was a "past coming back to haunt you" type of ghost story that was very enjoyable. The idea of the Gallow's Necklace was so utterly chilling it won't be something easily forgotten.  "Brownie, and M" Charles Grant has always been a difficult read for me. His quiet style of horror didn't work for me when I was younger and more into the likes of Clive Barker & Poppy Z. Brite but this story, about a group of elderly friends who are all experiencing strange haunting phenomena, is disquieting in a way that kept me turning the pages. Or, maybe I'm finally old enough to appreciate him ;)  "Velocity by Kathe Koja" Unlike Grant, I adored Kathe Koja's earlier work (Cipher and the lot) even though the style was extremely difficult to get into. She was always one of those love 'em or hate 'em type of writers who I happened to love. I worked my through her books of body modification and love affairs gone sour and always looked forward to more. Somewhere along the way I lost touch with her work and no longer have patience for the fractured writing style when I try to go back and re-read them. This story wasn't nearly as difficult as her longer novels but it didn't move me and isn't one I'll remember come tomorrow.  "Limbo by Lucius Shepard" is a novella length tale of a former criminal finding love. Or so he thinks. I loved the revenge theme of this one and how it all tied together so nasty-like at the end.   "The Hortlak by by Kelly Link" is the kind of weirdly quirky short story that I really enjoy. It's sort of a David Lynch-like version of "clerks". The world has been turned upside down, zombie's wander thru convenience stores, a strange clerk revels in bizarre pajamas, and a woman gives homeless dogs one last glimpse of fun and freedom. It's all very strange and doesn't always come together in a cohesive way but I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.  "Dancing Men by Glenn Hirshberg" is a coming of age/innocence lost type of story where one young boy has to face his grandfather's horrific memories of the Holocaust. This one is a gutwrencher because the horror here isn't of the invented variety.  Though the book contains a few small duds, the majority of the stories were genuinely creepy 
 Sorley had become the preeminent biographer of military leaders. His first book, Thunderbolt, was a joy to read. Honorable Warrior is the story of man who fought, the Japanese, survived the Battan Death march and many years of  unspeakable horror in Japanese prison camps. He also fought with great  bravery in Korea. However, I t was his time as Chief of Staff when General  Johnson faced his most difficult professional agonies. Anyone interested   in leadership, the military or American history should read this book 
 To me, Heathcliff is one of the most complex and compelling characters ever written and I had once thought that any actor would fall short in playing him in a film or miniseries.  Having watched this beautiful and haunting adaptation of one of my favorite novels of all time, I have to say that Ralph Fiennes has more than succeeded in bringing the aforementioned anti-hero to life.  Emily Bronte would have been proud.  Everyone who has read Wuthering Heights knows about the tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and how he becomes a dark, brooding, manipulative, diabolical man who takes his revenge on the people who he feels have wronged him and torn him away from Cathy, including her daughter and his own child and ward.  Fiennes brings out Heathcliff's many conflicting emotions flawlessly and his performance floored me.  Juliette Binoche as Cathy Linton/Catherine Earnshaw is great as well.  The supporting cast is quite splendid too -- no cardboard cutout performances here!  The backdrop of the moors is beautiful and gothic, just like Bronte described them in her book.  I am very impressed with this adaptation.  I haven't seen the 1939 film adaptation or the miniseries from Masterpiece Theater yet, but I wonder if they come close to this wonderful film.  The BBC will produce an adaptation some time next year and I think that Richard Armitage (North and South) would make a wonderful Heathcliff because he too could bring many nuances to his acting.  In the meantime, I shall treasure this one and watch it over and over again 
 This is a very well-written, readable, and interesting book that incorporates some of the latest information about brain neurology, consciousness, and memory.  Goldberg presents complex information in an easy to understand way.  His thesis is that early in life, our brains have a greater ability to analyze and assimilate new information, developing neural "patterns."  As we age, our analytical ability degrades due to physical aging of the brain, but we continue to thrive because the many "patterns" accreted over our lifetime help us to quickly recognize new data and categorize it.  The adult brain's extensively-developed repertoire of patterns/data funnels is an analogy for "wisdom" which intuitively reaches insightful conclusions without much analysis.  As a result, Goldberg suggests that if we consciously cultivate our mental activity, building up neural connections and "patterns," we will insulate ourselves against any potential cognitive erosion due to aging.  In the final chapters, Goldberg goes on to describe his facility that provides computer-mediated mental "workouts" to those who desire such therapy.  I felt that this part of the book was a bit of a tease, or advertisement.  Goldberg doesn't tell us what mental exercises to undertake, the implication is that we need to seek the services of his facility, or devise our own mental exercise program.  I found this part a bit disappointing.  (For those seeking such practical advice/exercises for brain development I recommend "Mozart's Brain and the Fighter Pilot" by Richard Restak. 
 The famous American-West landscape photographer, Ansel Adams and friend of  M.H.A., said of The Land of Little Rain: "The sharp beauty of The Land of Little Rain is finely etched in the distinguished prose of Mary Austin. Many books and articles have probed the factual aspects of this amazing land, but no writing to my knowledge conveys so much of the spirit of earth and sky, of plants and people, of storm and the desolation of majestic wastes, of tender, intimate beauty, as does The Land of Little Rain." (Re: "A Note on the Land and on the Photographs", from "The Land of Little Rain"- Houghton-Mifflin Co. 1950).   Indeed, M.H.A. displayed an uncanny sensitivity and understanding of the desert lands in the Owens Valley, California. Death Valley is, indeed, harsh and unforgiving, but to the astute observer who has learned how to live within the limits of sparse resources, it is an unequaled Paradise. She writes so eloquently and poetically of how the desert people and flora/fauna survive. The interaction of desert botany, biology, hydrology, geography, meteorology, and ecology come across vividly and often humorously with such lines as:   "Once at Red Rock, in a year of green pasture (a wet year), which is a bad time for the scavengers, we saw two buzzards, five ravens, and a coyote feeding on the same carrion, and only the coyote seemed ashamed of the company". (chapter 3- "The Scavengers")  M.H.A. studied the land, the flora/fauna, the weather (her "2" basic desert seasons- summer and winter) and she learned from her neighbors the Shoshone and Paiute Indians (she preferred to call the American Indians "Amerinds") , the Mexicans, the white settlers, and many colorful desert loners such as the "Pocket Hunter" (for seeker of pockets of gold)- her name for an old  prospector friend. She learned much wisdom and practical knowledge from her Indian friends like "The Basket Maker", Seyavi, whose life story is so eloquently told. The Indians shared with her their survival knowledge of how to find water from signs displayed by plants, how to read the activities of  animals for food, how to "know" which plants are medicinal and/or edible and which plants to stay away from:  "Live long enough with an Indian, and he or the wild things will show you a use for everything that grows in these borders". (Chapter- "Shoshone Land")  This beautiful little book finishes with: "Come away, you who are obsessed with your own importance in the scheme of things, and have got nothing you did not sweat for, come away by the brown valleys and full-bosomed hills to the even-breathing days, to the kindliness, earthliness, ease of Pueblo de Las Uvas."   According to Ansel Adam's notes, Las Uvas is Grape Canyon or Creek and is part of the Tejon area south of Bakersfield, Ca.   After reading this fine book, one will come to understand why so many people have referred to M.H.A. as the "Henry David Thoreau of the American West". Thoreau is the author of the renown classic, "Walden".   There are many different publications of  The Land of Little Rain and many have variations from the original format, ie., different introductions, preface, illustrations, etc. The text is all that really matters, of course, but I have checked-out a few of the different copies from regional libraries so I could copy  the intros by such notables as "Cactus Ed" (Edward Abbey- "The Monkey Wrench Gang", et al.). Abbey's Forward is in the 1988 Penguin Books edition. My copy is a reproduction of the original 1903 edition complete with line drawings by E. Boyd Smith who knew M.H.A. and the regions she wrote about.   Ansel Adams teamed-up with Houghton-Mifflin Co. in 1950 to give tribute to this outstanding classic by publishing a version her book with 48 of his photos taken in the Owens Valley, California region where the book was written and M.H.A. lived for sometime.  In describing the various areas and geographical locations in her  book, M.H.A. cloaked many of the  popular modern regional names with original Indian or old nicknames known only to a few to protect the privacy of those she wrote about. Adams and the editors used several resources to decipher the pseudonyms so he could match them to his photographs with the current regional names for accurate descriptions. They published an interesting glossary of all the names that could be deciphered in this 1950 edition.  More information including photographs of M.H.A. and her life can be seen at the Owens Valley Historical Society website: www.owensvalleyhistory.com/mary_austin/page49.html

 any mp3 you find can't do this justice - you need the original article.  buy it an be glad you did.  this album is chill as f**k, but it won't put you to sleep.  in the same way that reich or glass can maintain the static dynamic, this album is always on the move if you look - otherwise, it will be content to lounge in the background.  I like it most because it is what I think of as an 'optional listening' album: there is great depth if you choose to listen critically, yet the album doesn't require a thinking cap to enjoy.  (and yes, that is a very intentional dig at recent 'idm'. 
 I've read almost all of F Scott Fitzgerald's work and I was delighted to find this compelation of short stories. I read this book alomst four years ago and I can still remember the characters and details of each story - my favorite was Diamond as Big as the Ritz. Try it out and you will not be dissapointed 
 I honestly didn't know what to expect from this album. The past MXPX productions have been ok  and had a few good tracks here and there. But in contrast, this album was remarkable and I was completely amazed.  "Young and Depressed," is a song all about depression. Even though it had some miserable lyrics, it rocked the socks off of me when I listened to it. It has a catchy beat and is really funky-ass. I think it's funny that the band talks about depression in the song, then suddenly the lyrics switch to talking about being 'well dressed'.well at least there's something to be happy about. " You're young and depressed / with no future in this loneliness / you're young and depressed / But you're pretty well dressed / Yeah you're pretty well dressed." Well . at least you're pretty well dressed. That's all that counts anyway, right? Very reminiscent of Morrissey in "Hairdresser on Fire," where he howls, "you are repressed / but you're remarkably dressed."  "Heard That Sound," is the debut single for the album. I think it appropriately shows how great this production really is. It has definitely been stuck in my head for the past few days; the lyrics are good, and the beat is great. Definitely a keeper.  "Wrecking Hotel Rooms," is another song that I couldn't get enough of. When I listened to it, I knew there was something different about this song. I indexed it as one of my favorites, but when I went to do my homework about this track, I found out Mark Hoppus from Blink 182 was on vocals. Ehhh whoops, do I feel like a loser now or what? I suppose Mr. Hoppus has wrecked his fair share of hotel rooms during his illustrious career, so at lease MXPX consulted an expert for this song.  "Late Again," is the only complaint I really have. This song was so annoying and obnoxious I couldn't stand it for another minute. It has been banned from my CD player for time and all eternity. The repetitive nature just ruins an otherwise good song .and makes it fast paced and racy.  "Emotional Anarchist" is just another track that kicks ass. The lyrics mixed with the catchy tune make it hard to resist. This song deserves a whole lot of credit, because even at its short length (2:02), it made me want to start my own personal mosh pit.  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this album. I enjoyed listening to it and found a new favorite album for the next week or so. I would have thought MXPX would have seen their last days, after changing record labels three different times over a decade's span, but I was obviously wrong. Look's like the band has cranked out a record worthy of their fans' allowance money 
 Toni Morrison is excellent in these three lectures. She analyzes some white American novels brilliantly and shows how the whole structure and meaning can be re-read from the presence of what she calls Africanism at the back of the mind of the author and at times in the novel itself. Her approach is far-reaching and does not only take into consideration the presence of a black person, but also the deeply metaphorical presence of a dark side in the author's imagination and novels, a dark side that informs the whole work and structures the plot and the story. She tries to explain this presence of this dark side by showing how the Europeans who fled Europe to come to America for a new start arrived with no real model to imitate, and that they had to structure their own personalities from scratch. This could only be done by finding an alter ego that will embody the  other  any person needs to build their personalities. This  other , she says, is naturally the African slave that brings together several differences that make him perfectly easy to become the object of this ego-building : social alienation (slaves), cultural and linguistic alienation (they have been torn away from their cultures and languages) and racial alienation (blacks). The last alienation makes the other two absolutely irreversible because it cannot in any way be changed or hidden. This explains the structuring power of race or rather blackness in this society whose hierarchical structure is never denied or even questioned. Yet I remain slightly unsatisfied in the absolutely uniqueness of this experience. The Europeans when they arrived found the Indians and they tried to make them subservient and even slaves. They could not do it because these Indians did not survive very long in such a position and the most enterprising ones, Cherokees, Iroquois, Seminoles, etc, learned very fast and easily conquered their autonomy and developed a viable economic system. So the Europeans turned to Africans who were rather easily turned into slaves, with no pangs of conscience for the Europeans because they were not natives, so the land was not theirs, and they were black, hence absolutely different by embodying century old fantasms and fears among Europeans who discarded black as being devilish, satanic, dirty, etc. Here we have to insist on one element that Toni Morrison discards too fast : the Europeans had to exterminate the un-enslavable Indians to get their land and then bring the Blacks to America. The Indian genocide is the primary condition for the enslavement of the Blacks. The second element is that she seems to consider the European Enlightenment justified this enslavement of the Blacks. Here I have to disagree because Monstesquieu, for one, and quite many others like Rousseau, Diderot, it is true mainly French people, rejected this approach that pretended Blacks were not human and even had no souls. This French Enlightenment actually produced the abolition of slavery by the French Revolution, even if Napoleon reinstated it later on. That would have enabled Toni Morrison to answer a question she does not ask because she has no answer : where did the abolitionists come from, where did abolitionism come from, if what she describes is the only connection with Europe ? But there is even another question. What she describes is in perfect agreement with the logic and dialectic of the  subject  as advocated by Lacan. Since she quotes Marie Cardinal she should have found out about Lacan. In absolutely any society so far (no developed class-less society has ever existed on the planet) when a subject rejects the  Authority  pole of his personality, authority that is embodied in someone else, in the  social other , that person is dominated by his impulses, positive and negative, and he becomes his only master. Then he has to rebuild this pole of his personality, and the  other  becomes the one he is going to reject. In all our societies there has been an  other . She hints at social alienation and evokes cultural and linguistic alienation. But our societies have always found a scapegoat that became that  other  they could easily reject, enslave or even massacre : the Jews, the protestants or the catholics, the moslems, Arabs, gypsies, or even women as for that, and for some today in our lay societies priests and believers of any denomination, and our societies can even use one category of the past to build up the rejected group : fascists, nazis, stalinists, maoists, etc. The only point she has is the over-determination that color adds to this phenomenon, though Arabs or Moslems in Europe today, and for centuries in the past, qualify for that kind of racist attitude, and we all know about agism, sexism, homophobic attitudes and many others. She though has an enormous point when she says that invisibility does not solve the problem because the Blacks may be invisible in language, literature, and other politically correct discourses, but they remain visible and at times hauntingly overvisible in the minds of people. One cannot decree the end of racism with a law or a couple of anti-racist classes in school. I think that Ralph Ellison saw more and farther when he said  we have to be one and many at the same time , or when he defended democratic diversity in society and in each social or racial group of this society.

 The transaction went very smoothly with no problems.  The book arrived in great condition and in a timely manner 
 Another well-done book by Anna Grossnickle Hines! Beautiful illustrations, too.  Pair this with Della Ross Ferreri's book, HOW WILL I EVER SLEEP IN THIS BED? or one of the Barney or Elmo books on this topic to help your toddler adjust to the transition of a big-kid bed 
 This story of the 'Can Do' must have come up during Mr. Tougias' research into his previous book, 'The Blizzard of '78,' (which is still available). The previous book takes place on land, a lot of people stranded on the freeways. This one takes the reader to sea aboard the 'Can Do.'   'Can Do' is the motto of the Navy Seabees, and the captain/owner was a retired Seabee. He must have felt that he 'could do' what the Coast Guard in their 44 footer couldn't do. Although the 'Can Do' was a 49 foot steel hulled ex-pilot boat, it just wasn't up to 40 foot waves and 100 mph winds. When the engine was killed, the boat and its crew were doomed. The 'Can Do' was a strong boat, but the Coast Guard 44's are damn strong. Further the Coast Guard boats are designed for this kind of storm. I'd have been pretty scared to take anything but a submarine out in that kind of weather.   This book is based on the recorded radio messages received from the 'Can Do.' The radio kept working up until the very end, providing an in depth look at a disaster that is rarely seen 
 'Boogie Nights' does for the disco seventies and the porn industry what 'Nashville' did to country music.  It shows the underside of the glamour presented.  The film shows us all the trappings that draw people to the "high life," then pulls the rug out from under it.  We see the usual suspects and the usual draws:  There's money, fame, lust, passion, and drugs.  But these benefits provide an understated banality that comes to the fore.  The seemingly long, drawn out conversations are only postcards of emotion that show the depth of personhood that seems to escape all of the protagonists.  It is superficial, and all of life's best elements seem to go out the window.   There is the calculated cheesiness of the producer (Burt Reynolds) and his odd detatchment from his craft.  He both revels and drowns in the lust and money that are presented to him.  He meets a young aspiring hopeful (Mark Wallberg) who must overcome his poverty and alienation from home.  His naivete' is striking, and he doesn't entirely change in his innocence, only becoming a casualty of it.  (The way he practices to become the next Bruce Lee in the midst of his success as a novelty presentation is certainly a sad commentary about his life.)  His new success doesn't make him all that happy, including his rationalization that his movies are making marriages more passionate.  The aftermath of all the calculated lust makes everyone, except the calloused producer, a casualty in a different way.  One fellow porn star (Don Cheadle) demonstrates that his true passion is for a loving marriage and a hi-fi business, but the decent, conventional world won't let him.  Similarly, a fellow porn creator (William Macy) shows tragically that love transcends lust, even when it won't ever become realized.  A female porn star is devastated by her cocaine addiction and an inevitable result of a custody battle.  If we aren't convinced near the end of the movie, then a "candid camera" scene between "Rollergirl" and the man off the street certainly shows how the emotional baggage catches up to all of the porn industry's false promises for true happiness.  The initial draw to 'Boogie Nights' may be deceptive.  It presents the glamour of all that the modern world believes to be desirable, but cleverly shows how the lowest common denominator can restrict our lives from even greater happiness. 
 This post-war made film (1951) about WWII is rather retrospective and honest in its telling of the tale. Wayne is very good here in an uncomplicated role. Mixing, submarines, lurking enemy, and old flings or ex-flings with a lot of macho dialogue (without preaching) along the way, this film does not fail to entertain. George Waggner's direction give a lot of freedom to get his story across.   
 Very informative and interesting on the Franchising Busines 
 This was what American people used to look like, at play, at ease, and in color. In fact, Epstein is very well on par with Sternfeld, Shore, and Eggelston (a peer of them all, really...) and working in 35mm, his compositions exceed all of theirs in youthful fluidity and spontaneous grace 
 I'm using this book for my 1st grade son as part of our home school program.  The stories are short and quick to get through so you can have short lessons. These stories and figures are so often referred to our in literature, sayings and culture that it's a great book for children to read. 
 Kesey's book is at once a meditation on the individual and his place in the community, a look into labor issues, a depiction of life in a small town, and a portrait of the notion of family.  The scope of "Sometimes a Great Notion" is truly ambitious, but as the reader follows Kesey's unfocused but always necessary travels, they may find themselves as much of the landscape as the grand forests the characters inhabit.  If one gives this book a chance, they will be in for a memorable experience.  Highest recommedation. 
 This work was selected to be a community read. Barbara Ehrenreich's adoption of an unassuming disguise provides her readers with a dramatic portrayal of minimal income low level jobs. Ehrenreich's investigative approach is to be commended. But it remains to be seen if readers take Ehrenreich's frustration and then do something to cure it 
 If every adult or parent would read this book, they can help being a better parent.   I recommend it highly 
 Sara Stein shares her amazing in-depth knowlege of the botany of weeds with a sense of humor that makes this book a "I can't put it down" volume. 
 Thought-provoking and informatve; well-written and entertaining; sure to stimulate free speech and intellectual endeavour wherever it is read.   Essential for debaters of all ages, debate coaches, and anyone interested  in improving their dinner party conversation.   Never find yourself without  a contentious opinion again 
 Ode To The Master Trickster  Some say you have obscure South American roots. Some say you magically appeared in the 60's Weaving fact with uncanny human insight. Others say weaving only  Enchanting fanciful stories. Hats off to the master trickster.  Some say as a lad in Lima They called you little Arana. They say you were fascinated by  The mysticism of local lore. As a young teen you learned and practiced your craft. Learning to spin those wonderful tales, Hats off to the young master trickster.  Some say your mother passed away When you were a fine arts student. Still distant from your father, Some say you never recovered. Retreating deeper into those wonderful tales, Hats off to the master trickster.  In Brazil you were the witty fellow, The big liar living off cards, horses, and dice. A first class seducer at the local plaza, Honing your craft Practicing those wonderful tales Hats off to the master trickster.     Disappearing from sight for years With little news of your fate. Eventually resurfacing in LA With a new identity. Not just weaving, But now writing and publishing  Those wonderful tales. Hats off to the master trickster.  The Doctors of Philosophy were impressed, The dissertation committee signed on early, Giving you their academic endorsement  And a blank check To publish your wonderful tales.  Hats off to the master trickster.  The shy and the timid, You gave them that sliver of hope, That their dreams and fantasies Might be fulfilled, As promised in your wonderful tales. Hats off to the master trickster.  The impeccably dressed businessman, The erudite academic, And the old world shaman Shared power with the field hand, As proclaimed in your wonderful tales. Hats off to the master trickster.      Daring to dream, Stretching that ever so small crack Between the worlds. Luminous beings going nowhere. Quite unlike your wonderful tales. Hats off to the master trickster.   De Mille was on to you, Hammering relentlessly at your falsehoods. You answered and respun those beautifully In your next volume of wonderful tales. Hats off to the master trickster.  Your devoted minions waited patiently For your directions. Reading your words, Practicing your rites. Often ending with ears ringing In deafening silence, As they tried in vain To make sense of your wonderful tales. Hats off to the master trickster.  Moses, Mohammed, and Jesus, Did you deceive them as well? Or were they merely tools of your craft? For your wonderfully spun tales, Hats off to the master trickster.      Your brethren in the orthodoxy Knew you all along. They also have long histories Of rewriting and refining Their corrected versions of wonderful tales. Hats off to the master tricksters.  Being weak yourself, You knew our many frailties. Do we live with them? Overcome them? Or weave them into our wonderful tales? Hats off to the master trickster.  Living out your life in comfort. Reshaped by the corpus of your tales. Only to pass into the next realm, Where many may suppose You are still weaving those wonderful tales. Hats off to the master trickster.    George Pennington E'town, Ky.        
 I love some of the sound effects that were added to this recording though Fat Possum added 3 bonus tracks done without remixing to try and satisfy everyone no doubt.  "Chain of Fools" especially is a must-hear with the rapper effects.  On my copy, however, "Black Mattie" (the first bonus track), starts over a minute into the track.  Do I have a defective copy or is it supposed to be this way 
 I got hooked on The Menu series by the New Haven edition, and I must say that Goldstein and Murumba have outdone themselves again. With an easier-to-read rating system and more top 50 and other categorized lists, this book continues to make me salivate every time I read it 
 I saw Anna in Asheville and thought her presentation was excellent -- thorough, compelling and hopeful. Finally I have a perfect word for healthy, high quality -- GOOD -- food for ALL. It's GRUB!   As a registered dietitian, I wholeheartedly embrace Grub. It's informative, useful and easy to read. It's a jam-packed, how-to primer for a new way of eating and belongs on our kitchen table for insightful inspiration and recipes. I'm buying Grub for my 20-something children who have influence over their friends and tremendous buying power to influence their future food system. Anna is a synergistic brilliant blend of her famous mother AND father -- Grub, in fact, is dedicated to the latter. Make no mistake though, Anna independently flies on her own -- as Grub proves -- in her vision and drive to correct the industrial, corporate food injustices in the world. "Local, just and fair" -- that's GRUB. Get it and make a difference. Melinda Hemmelgarn, M.S., R.D. Food Sleuth, LL 
 Excellent quality briefs and my husband really liked them.  They are a simple style, but look very classy as far as briefs go.  I would highly recommend these 
 Pakmer's books usaly don't have to much depth so I usaly don;t consider them among my favoirt books. But I do enjoy her plots and they are easy reads so I won't deny reading them. After Midnight though is just my kind of book, so despite there nt being that pull on my emotions I still can honestly say it is among my favoits. I am reffering though to the original, not the new reprint. And there is a huge difference.   Clayton Seymor's sister meets and falls for a man she met on her island get away and she is not all to excited about this because he happens to be her brothers biggest enemy.   Nicki Seymor knows that Kane Lambord is Clay's foe, the man who is funding his opponents bid for congress and whos father owners a tabloid that could expose the scandelous marriage between his sister and his political ally. But Kane does not know Niki is Clay's sister. Its the whole forbiden love thing, meets her brother is destroying him, and yet he still loves her and everyone thinks they should hate each othet but they don't.   But beware, the second version of the story is absolutly horrible. Clay and Niki and Cortez are pretty much the same charectors in both, but in the newer one Palmer turned Kane into a total jerk and so there realy is more reason to dislike him than anything. The relationship between he and Niki consistes of three enconters on the island before he decideds to try and seduce her and a realy creepy situation in his bed while she's sick. I read this first and because of the teaser in the begining of the book, which gives a scene that is not in the book, I decided that I had to read the origianl because as bad as the second book was I felt like there was obviously a lot a stuff changed, and in fact there was. If you've already read the second one and thought Kane was a jerk you'll think he's much better origialy, he does not push her to be his mistress and he legitamatly shows normal feelings for her, plus he doesn't go so far when she's sick, and she's also not as sick and weak. Of you can't find the now out pf print version try the newer one and pretend he's not so bad. 
 We are new investors and this book has filled in all the gaps.  Excellent for anyone in our position.  Gives a full rounded view and flipping real estate.  Thank you! 
 This book is very useful for anyone who tries to understand the phenomenon of modernity, it origin, and its weaknesses 
 A. Zee has written a very intelligent book on the finer aspects of Chinese cuisine explained with easy to understand Chinese names, their gastronomic connections and the cultural implications. Zee beautifully intertwined food  with history, poetry and language. He has spiced his topics with true life  stories like a famous Chinese poet eating the poisonous Fugu (puffer fish)  and proclaiming it was worthwhile dying for. Truly an inspirational and  accomplished work, cerebral and delightful. A must for all who love Chinese  food 
 I was never a big fan of Loggins. But then a friend of mine recommended me to buy this album. Lo and behold, I become addicted to listening this album and later on I bought Loggins other albums. This album outstands and able to deliver messages about relationship (personal or not) in depth, well, at least I got the message clearly. I'm very much impressed with Loggins. He's musically talented and yes, a genius. Can't argue more. 
 Tom Broadbent is out enjoying the desert when he hears gunshots.  He finds a dying prospector who gives him a notebook with instruction to give it to no one but his daughter.  Tom, am man of his word, keeps knowledge of the notebook form the police and sets out to figure out who the prospector was so that he can locate his daughter.  The book is full of numbers like a code so Tom enlists the help of a code breaker now studying to be a monk.  But the numbers aren't a code but readings from a ground radar machine.  Compiled, the numbers show a picture of a almost mummified dinosaur fossil.  The find is incalculable but there is no information about where it is.  Meanwhile the forces behind the prospector's death have recovered a sample of the fossil but need the notebook to locate the main find.  One of these forces is ruthless and willing to kill.  He suspects Tom has the information and sets out to get it.  This are complicated even more as the fossil is somehow related to a shadowy organization connected with the final Apollo mission and something discovered on the moon.  All of these forces begin to come together as Tom tries to carry out the promise he made to a dying man.  It will not be easy for Tom or his wife to survive this but they keep trying.  It all comes together in the end in a satisfying way.  There are elements of this book that seem influenced by Preston's work with Lincoln Child.  It is easy to see elements of THUNDERHEAD, THE ICE LIMIT and any books dealing with natural history museums.  This book, like his collaborative efforts, is well paced, imaginative and entertaining.  Watching all of the plot threads come together at the end is almost a pleasure to watch.  Almost because the reader will want to pay attention to the story's revelations and not the author's mastery of the writing craft.  If you have enjoyed any of Preston's other books you are sure to enjoy this one.  Check it out 
 Lisa was hanging out her clothes to dry and one sock blew off the clothes line.Curious Hedgie found the sock and thought it was a hat,so he put it on his head. Other animals laughed at Hedgie at first,but then they had an idea. Each animal went to the clothes line and took a piece of clothing off the line . The animals used the clothes to keep warm during the winter. Lisa sees Hedgie wearing her sock and runs after him. She catches Hedgie and pulls the sock off his head.She then goes looking for the rest of her clothes.She finds all the animals wearing her clothes and says "How ridiculous they look. Don't they know that animals don't wear clothes!" I loved this book! 
 I've played this CD for my daughter since she was born. Ultimate chill out song.. Rainbow Connection! She could be screaming bloody murder and this CD has always put her at ease.  I strongly recommend this CD. 
 These indians a marvelous this book is what times calls a probe 
 Thorough and scientific, this a good companion volume to Jim Halfpenny's excellent book on the same subject.  Whereas Halfpenny's book is an excellent introduction for students and teachers of ecology, Marchand's  book goes into more detail on physiological, behavioral, and biochemical  adaptations to winter. It is therefore best suited to biology majors,  graduate students, and naturalists with a desire for a complete explanation  of how animals and plants adapt and survive in cold weather 
 When I ordered this speaker dock, I wasn't expecting the quality and sound that this unit puts out. When I first hooked up my Sansa player to it, I could not believe the sound that came out of this unit. Needless to say it was much better than I was expecting. The dock is very easy to set up and use with any Sansa player. The unit comes with all the inserts to fit any of the players. The unit can be powered by the included AC adapter cord, or it can be powered by 4 AA batteries (not included). I really like being able to power it with the batteries as you can take it with you anywhere you go. The unit itself has independent on-off and volume controls, and is a great accessory for your Sansa player. The speaker dock it well worth the price, and I would highly recommend to anyone thinking about buying one 
 This is a book for singles that is not out there too much.  It challenges singles to use their singleness to advance the cause of Christ with all of the extra time we have by not having children & spouses.  The world's  message is to live to please yourself, but this book - like the Bible -  challenges us to live to know,serve, and please God 
 Family Matters is a solidly written and engrossing book which I literally could not put down. I read it compulsively over the course of two days and resented time spent on the mundane things like eating and family.   The story is a familiar one-- an aging father with Parkinsons falls to the tender mercies of his family. Unresolved past issues, insufficient pension, and a host of unrealized dreams combine to create a story that is moving and very relevant. Mistry writes with clarity and compassion and never consdescends to either reader or characters. It is not always an easy book to read, but it never gives in to either bleakness or despair.  Given the theme, and the remarkable number of sources from which it draws (Lear, etc.) it is amazing that Mistry does not fall into the trap of using stereotypes or cliches. Family Matters successfully avoids complaisance and completion, managing a satisfying ending without giving into the temptation to tie up too many loose ends.   Although there is a great deal of detail in the book that is specific to Indian culture and the contemporary politics of Mumbai/Bombay, there are still enough issues of general human import that it should appeal to readers from every culture. Very highly recommended 
 For any student of the Civil War north or south this is a must read! It is well written and informative. And to top it all off it was written by a person who was there. This is not a second hand account 
 i really liked this book.  i read a lot of theology and it is rare to find a book that hits that experiential note without it being sappy or weak theologically.  the book sort of has a blue like jazz flavor to it but it has more of a foundational ground and agenda.  in blue like jazz, rick mckinely is "pastor rick says..."    it was cool to get to know pastor rick and his friends in reading "Jesus in the margins" but even more so it hit a chord with me because the Jesus he presented made a lot of sense.  so often i get the feeling that people think christianity is a religion and Jesus is our god who makes the rules.  this book presents a different Jesus, one is even though he is God, loves to hang out with sinners and isn't afraid to break the rules.  i understood something about Jesus that i never quite have in the same way before reading it...that Jesus knows what it feels like to be on the outside and that he went outside those boundaries for a reason.  for me and for other screw-ups.  the book gives theological feet to a mission mindset that cares more for sinners than arguing over trivial things in some sort of christian club.  
 All Together in One Place is a wonderful story.  The characters are well developed and the plot has many twists and turns to keep you wanting to find out what's going to happen next.  Wonderful story.  Could hardly put it down.  Highly recommend 
 Most informative book ever written. Something to live life by 
 Lila's new album is undoubtely one of her best.. She's ironic, sad, exhalarating, all at the same time. It reflects perfectly the way we Mexicans act and think, always moved by deep-rooted feelings. I loved this album.  Y s, como buen mexicano uno se siente identificado con este disco... con la pena, la ansiedad, la angusta, la alega y el regocijo que son parte del alma mexicana y que nuestra oaxaquea universal canta como ninguna. Mueve mucho por dentro. Es perfecto. Gracias Lila por este regalo a tu Mxico y a tu gente. 
 The book definitely proved useful in my first experience with LP guides: if it didn't already have the information, it would at least point you in the right direction as to where to get it. Though the information for big cities like NY, San Fran and Chicago are limited, it's extremely easy to pick up free guides in those cities anyways, so it doesn't matter too much.  The recommendations for food were about 2/3 accurate in my opinion, regarding price, value and quality. It's great how downtown maps are included, and more comprehensive for the bigger cities. Contrary the opinion of another reviewer, I was grateful for the inclusion of suggested lodging- for all the times we didn't follow our itinerary and needed to check for vacancies whilst still driving. Because all the lodging suggestions are non-chains, I also stayed at one place the guidebook recommended that turned out to be excellent and because it was privately owned, I would have never found it otherwise. It was very homely and good value.   Though I wouldn't carry the book around while actually wandering around the city (too heavy and thick), it was good for leaving in the hotel and planning the next day's activities. On the whole, the concisely outlines what is worth seeing in each state, but expects you to actively seek out more information for details: don't expect that you can rely solely on this guide, especially not if you're into seeing some non-touristy sites 
 It causes wonder with its sensitive and prudent style and, ultimately, by its incredibly smart, honest and thoughtful result 
 Live albums is someting I've always had a bit of a problem with. Maybe it's because I've always wanted to be in the shows and not listen to them at home.... A lot of the time the sound is really bad and you hear the crowd more than the band. Not on the record in hand. Recorded live at CBGB in 1993, The Jesus Lizard play a set of post punk and hard core that is explosive, tight , flowing, angry and gentle all at the same time. You can really smell the sweat coming out of your CD player... 
         Tried and true might well describe the products offered by Caswell-Massey as generations have relied upon them for both quality and efficacy.  Established in 1752, it's America's oldest Chemist and Perfumer.  My grandmother enjoyed their products, and I do, too.  	Their Almond & Aloe Liquid Soap is a boon because it not only cleanses well but moisturizes as it does so.  Far too many soaps leave skin feeling dry and itchy.  	Almond, as we  know, has a lovely distinctive fragrance as well as skin softening properties.  Combine it with aloe which contains healing properties, and you have a uniquely beneficial cleanser.  	Other ingredients include Vitamins A and D for nourishment.  This soap is particularly useful for those who wash their hands frequently during the day and for those with normal to dry or sensitive skin.  	Other items in Caswell-Massey's Almond & Aloe line include Body Balm, Bath Seltzer, Cold Cream Soap, Hand Cream, Hand & Body Emulsion, and Almond Body Splash 
 Interesting, well written and easy to get your head around 
 I love the Bunny Suicide books!  Mr. Riley makes them so funny, and we should all be ashamed for enjoying them so much.  I enjoy the way he works in current pop culture and events to some of the suicides, making them that much more hysterical.  My favorite in this one has to be the bunny who ate all the beans!  A laugh riot 
 Basic hair care/styling advice throughout the book, very good for someone who wants more general knowledge on hair products, styles, how to take care of but it wasn't very detailed.  there was a cute story throughout the book of 4 friends living their lives and each chapter related a hair issue to what information about hair was written next. for example one chapter a girl was going on vacation so there was advice on what to do with your hair when traveling.   fantastic pictures, especially in the wedding section beautiful hair styles  the book was very well put together and is a nice, enjoyable read...I finally learned what exactly a chignon was and how to create it 
 I have used this matcha daily for about 6 weeks now. It is very good for what I use it for. I make my own version of Starbucks Green Tea Frappuccino. (Once that drink name started to roll of my kids' tongues easily - I realized I was spending too much money on these drinks - and daily!)I am not familiar with various grades of matcha, but did not want something pre-sweetened or modified because I wanted to control the sugar, etc. I make my frappuccino like this: sorry - I do not measure - so you may have to modify these amounts because I am guessing!  1 1/2c milk 2 heaping spoonfuls (the spoon that's included) green tea powder 1/8c simple syrup (I make it myself and keep in fridge for week or so) 10+ice cubes (adjust to your taste - depends on size of cubes)  Blend this in a blender - longer than you think - pulse first then blend for a bit - I scrape down a bit bc the powder flies around a little and you don't want to lose any. (Simple syrup is 1c water, 1c sugar heated until sugar dissolves) It is much easier than it may sound - I make these daily in the morning. I hope this helps anyone else out there who is addicted to the GT Frappuccino - it is slightly different (I think they use a different gt powder and a honeydew syrup), but I liked mine MORE within the first week of having them!  
 When my husband first saw which company made the film, his initial reaction was, "This is not going to be good - it's one of those cheap films".  However, within minutes, he was as into it as I was.  This movie will keep you guessing as you move through its many twists and turns.  What seems like a simple bank robbery is much, much more.  Reminds me of "A Simple Plan".    Excellent 
 I must begin with this - I have a short list of books that I recommend to my friends and the first one on that list is THE WINNER. From the first page until the end, it had me wanting to know what was going to happen next. What a novel thing to do - set up a lottery and then disappear. Would you do it??? That is what the main character LuAnn faces. I would say everyone has heard of the Lottery and dreams of winning it - hence the title. This book is just a fast page turning suspense. The villian is evil and a complete mastermind at games. I loved it. Buy a copy today! You will not be disappointed!!!!!!!!!! 
 This is an excellent book which not only shows you the sweetness of the Yoga of Discipline but that makes you believe in your own capacity of becoming the person you've always wanted to be! Very practical, very inspiring, very helpful! I loved it 
 The book cover it all. The information is dated, but if your building a Chevy using used cast iron parts this is the book for you. If your building an 8000 + rpm screamer, get this book!! There is a lot of theory and Bills advice on what to do and what not to do. A big section on camshaft theory too.  Hopefully the reissue the book... mine is totally worn out 
  A whopping 17 songs on this effort, which would be XTC's last album for many years. It's a mature, well rounded work that combines the lush, orchestrated pop of "Skylarking" with the bright, bubblegum psychedelia of "Oranges & Lemons". Thus, more Beatlesque bliss for XTC.  Both Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding wear their influences on their sleeves big time; Lennon, McCartney, Wilson, Davies, even Burt Bacharach.  "Then She Appeared" is a major standout with spot-on Beach Boys-like harmonies, shimmering guitar lines, and all the like. A sunny, upbeat pop masterpiece. And it wasn't even released as a single!  Also pop perfect is "The Disappointed" which sounds like XTC doing Tears for Fears doing The Beatles. This album showcases a band who can obviously write beautiful hooks and melodies in their sleep at this point.  Partridge is also a great storyteller; witness "The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead", a more guitar driven pop/rocker. Is it about JFK? Jesus? An actual pumpkin? Total lyrical mastery. The wonderful "Holly Up On Poppy" musically combines brooding psychedelia with bouncy pop in yet another wonderful song. Also worth noting is "Dear Madam Barnum", another guitar-driven pop number with great lyrics. Who writes lyrics this clever anymore? He really is one of the most gifted songwriters of all time..his wit even puts some of his idols to shame at time.  Partridge reaches a new level of sophistication on songs like "Rook" and "Wrapped in Grey". The former is a cryptic, downbeat piano-led poem (of sorts) which Partridge said reduced him to tears when he wrote it (as it just came out of nowhere). The latter showcases that Bacharach influence I eluded to before (as well as a heavy dose of Brian Wilson); like "Rook", it's also a piano/string section led chamber pop number. This one alternates from somber verses to a cheery, celebratory chorus. Both are among Partridge's best compositions.  Colin Moulding also turns in his most musically mature composition to date with "Bungalow"; The song travels from a cheesy organ-laden intro to rich, lush piano passages. It sounds like some long lost Tin Pan Alley classic.   Mouldings other tunes are also very good. "Smartest Monkeys" travels down a cliched lyrical path, but the music is strong and catchy. And Dave Gregory turns in an awesome solo (which sounds like a processed guitar, but is actually a synth I believe). "My Bird Performs" is sublime, and features some nice trumpet work.  Other album highlights include the lush, psychedelic "Humble Daisy" (think Lennon meets Brian Wilson), the tense "That Wave", the celebratory "Omnibus" (which sounds like something out of a musical), and the closer "Books Are Burning", a mid-tempo masterpiece which makes a common chord progression sound fresh.  XTC are so good at making sophisticated, smart pop music that it's depressing. Why? Because I can't find many other bands who can equal them. It's a shame that very few people have even heard of them. 
 Smooth, beautiful jazz tunes rendered by a master.  Coltrane's saxophone is every bit as expressive as the voice of the best singer, as he demonstrates on the wonderful title track.  Put this on your disk player to give your surroundings an atmosphere of sophistication and quiet grace 
 If it is a mystery book readers want, Nancy Farmer has definately brought a whole new world of adventure for us. This excellent story stretches from the past, present, and future while managing to keep you on the edge of your seat.    This story starts with three children escaping outside the boundaries of their guarded home to find rude monkies, people of the earth, vicious thieves, dishonest mothers, and MUCH more. Every step of this amazing journey comes as a satifing surprise and yet another clue to the main solution. Following the children's every step of the way are Africa's most unusual detectives...the EYE, EAR, and ARM all with phonomenal powers beyond imagination.    Sooooo finally here is a match worthy enough for the Westing Game. Dare to read it at night 
 "Feels Like Home," Norah Jones' follow-up to her Grammy-guzzling 2002 debut "Come Away With Me," should please fans and win her new ones.  The disc is similar to its predecessor, but it also takes notable strides in other directions. If you found yourself dozing off to Jones' music in the past, there's a far less chance of doing it here, as the new album is less dreamy and languid.  The first evidence that Jones and her band are turning things up a notch is the urgent "What Am I To You?" -- a Jones original that features electric guitar. A more subdued version of the song appeared on certain Asian versions of "Come Away With Me."  The disc's tempo picks up far more with "In the Morning," a catchy contribution from band member Adam Levy. Later, we get to the happy-go-lucky "Creepin In," which features an excellent guest appearance by Dolly Parton. This is a fun track, and it's easy to imagine the two artists dancing arm in arm down a country road.  The disc also contains a handful of tracks that would have fit splendidly with the more uniform "Come Away With Me." One such tune is the melodic "Those Sweet Words," which is a perfect showcase for Jones' vocal talent. The priceless "Carnival Town" drips with as much sugar and charm as "Sunrise," with its laid-back arrangements and ethereal harmony.  "The Prettiest Thing" will relax you with its warmth and simplicity, and "Don't Miss You at All," which finds Jones writing her own lyrics to Duke Ellington's "Melancholia," makes a perfect closer to the album.  What the listener gets with "Feels Like Home" is pure musical excellence. The hype of Jones and her "Handsome Band" of skilled musicians is justified all the more with this release.  To top that off, the live performances in Madrid of "In the Morning" and "Long Way Home" are absolutely superb, as the pair have proven time and time again in concert performances to translate particularly well live. "Creepin' In" is also excellent, and the music videos for "Sunrise" and "What Am I To You?" are as enjoyable to watch as the interview (of a very charming, self-conscious Jones) that rounds out the bonus DVD is informative.  Furthermore, while "Sleepless Nights" and "I Turned Your Picture To the Wall," a track penned by Levy's late grandfather, are two bonafide gems to add to the "Feels Like Home" CD, "Moon Song" is by far the superior of the trio. Invoking a sense of a picturesque landscape eclipsed by nightfall the powerful fluorescence of the moon, this track epitomizes what makes Jones and the Handsome Band such a special group of musicians.  Whether or not you loved "Come Away With Me," there's something for everyone here. 
 The principles in this book can help you to form an empathic bond with your children and other family members.  I highly recommend it 
 This book covers all the basics in a colorful, fun, yet no-nonsense way that does not waste either the home teacher's or student's time. I was very impressed with the worksheet format, as the pages are perforated and can be  torn out and worked on. Using familiar Sesame Street characters is a big  plus too. An answer key is also included, along with many helpful  suggestions to the home teacher. This book will give value far exceeding  its cost 
 Spellbinding is the word!  The story has so many twists and turns, you don't know where it's heading.  Big surprise in the end!  You will love it!  If I could, I would give it 6 stars instead of 5. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal 
 If you want to make an impact in a new environment regardless of your position, this is it. Insightful.   
 To me nothing by Martha and the Vandellas ever matched the initial hit of "Come and Get These Memories".  I identified with the sadness of lost love. But the quality of Ms. Reeves' work with the everchanging members of the Vandellas is sole and separate from the style of the Supremes who got all the breaks.  Of the several compilations available, I think this one is the best bargain as it contains the major hits and some good lesser tunes. They had a rocking style that still sounds good 35-40 years later.  Oh, those horns!  It is true that once the group became Martha REEVES and the Vandellas (never caught on with me), Martha might have been more successful with the resulting solo career had she perhaps had a child with Berry Gordy.  She might have finally been first choice to get the big tunes like some other Motown artists, maybe made a bogus movie biography of, say, Lady Day where the evil white man addicts her to drugs (not true) or a nothing movie about a model. (She might have even got Mr. Gordy to direct).  But I digress.  This is the package of songs that I vote for in preference to the other albums about.  I just hope Martha and whichever Vandellas are on the songs herein don't have to sue Motown AGAIN for their royalties 
 After creating and perfecting the role onstage in England and on Broadway, Lovely Pauline Collins breathes refreshing life and spirit into this well written character.   Collins is so endearingly charming that by the time Shirley learns to love herself, the rest of us already adore her.  Whether in a plain-walled flat or an idyllic Greek Island, It is a pleasure to spend time in her company.  It's a wonderful vacation, which is why I've seen this film enough times to know nearly all the dialogue, and I've developed a fondness for chips 'n' egg.    Tom Conti, effectively masking his Englishness with a greek accent, leads a perfect supporting cast.  The actors who play Shirley's son and daughter, her uppity neighbor, and the young girls who play Shirley and Marjorie Majors as teenagers, all hit the right notes.  Joanna Lumley gives a nicely understated performance (in contrast to her over-the-top comedy turns elsewhere) and Alison Steadman makes a good enough impression here that she is a welcome presence in subsequent roles like the recent CONFETTI.  Keep an eye out for Bernard Hill as Shirley's thoughtless husband - after ignoring Shirley, it seems only fitting that he go down at the helm of the TITANIC...    I wish Paramount had made the effort to include some extras, like a commentary with Collins, a followup on the girl who so perfectly played young Shirley...or at least an alternate soundtrack with the original British brand names and vernacular that have been overdubbed for America, but I suppose Paramount's attitude is we're lucky to get it at all.  Paramount has again ignored very attractive original key (poster) art that effectively conveyed the spirit of the film, in favor of a bland cover that looks like a People magazine - and about a million other DVDs.  I'm buying it the day it comes out, but how many others will overlook the lackluster cover and miss the charms hidden within?   Shirley's journey of self re-discovery is very likely to remind you of who you used to be, and who you wanted to be...  take a holiday and run off with Shirley V. -  you'll never want to leave her 
 The original cd included with the adapter was bad so I contacted Belkin's Customer Service and they were happy to send out a replacement cd.  Upon arrival it was used to install the item and within minutes I was experiencing connection speeds never before experienced on my laptop.  Also have the Belkin Pre-N router, which I love.  After having tried D-Link and LinkSys items in the past with poor results, Belkin has my admiration.  Better than my expectations 
 This is one of the most intelligent and delightful books I've read in a long time. The stories are charming, filled with wit, wisdom, and humor. And the illustrations are wonderful. You'll continue smiling long after you've finished reading. Rabbi Harvey's wisdom is for people of every religion. I look forward to his next adventures. 
 Kakuzo Okakura (1862-1919) was born in a Japan that had seen Commodore Perry but had not yet renounced the Shogunate. By the end of his life he had seen the Great War and Japan's first imperialistic military adventures in Korea and Manchuria that would culminate in the tragedy of the Second World War.   The scion of Japanese aristocracy, Okakura chose to spend the latter half of his life as an expatriate living in Boston, Massachusetts, where he befriended the Brahmins of that city. THE BOOK OF TEA was written in this period, sometime in the nineteen-oh-ohs. Written for an American audience, it eloquently introduced the Boston bluebloods to an idealized vision of Japan, the Japan of cherry blossoms, kakemono, and Chanoyu, the Tea Ceremony.   Reading THE BOOK OF TEA, one realizes that Okakura was not "selling" Japan to the West. THE BOOK OF TEA does not engage in any lacquer-box hucksterism. Rather, THE BOOK OF TEA is his paean to and his lament for a Japan of the virtues that was all-too-rapidly being consumed by Occidentally-intoxicated militarists and industrialists. THE BOOK OF TEA was written to banish the soot-stained chrysanthemums of Okakura's deepest nightmares.   Although this reviewer came to THE BOOK OF TEA expecting a manual on the Tea Ceremony, this book is nowhere so vulgar as that. Yes, a manual on the highly stylized Chanoyu has its place, but it's place is nowhere without this book which penetrates to the heart and soul of the ceremony. This reviewer can honestly say that THE BOOK OF TEA provided him with comprehension, a deeper insight, and a first true appreciation for Japanese art forms, so different than the European.   In its simplicity and its elegance, the Tea Ceremony is a form of Zen practice. Every element, from the atmosphere of the tearoom (called in Japanese "The Abode of Fancy," a world unto itself), the selection of the flowers, the artwork, the bamboo tea implements, the bright, sharp jade green macha tea, and the specially made jangling teapot and ceramic cups, speaks to an aesthetic foreign to the West. Okakura calls it "Teaism," a play on Taoism, and its purpose is to delight the senses, touch the heart, and place the participant fully in the present moment.  Shambhala Publications has presented THE BOOK OF TEA in a fine paperbound edition, the colors, typeset, and dimensions of which please the mind. Shambhala has also provided color photographs, in truth forms of abstract art, of the tea implements in use, that add a visual dimension to this already fine book.        
 This book wasn't as good as I was expecting due to the rave reviews.  But, it did a great job painting a picture of the place and time.  Good character development and very timely.  Wish it was a peaceful world as you want to visit this part of the world 
 More than a simple historical treatise, it is a character study in human nature and its affects on the human actions that make history.  A classic of historical works in its detail and insight on human action we know as history.   Thucydides is unmatched in his insights, clarity of language and thought, and in his informative description of the history of his time.  A must read for anyone wanting to plumb the depths of western civilization and ethos.  An enjoyable read for any historiphile.    It could use more maps but be sure to check the back of the book for the few it does have 
 I used this textbook as my main study material for the SOA/CAS P/1 exam. I found it to be well-written and understandable. I have some background in calculus and probability (long-forgotten college courses). I'm hanging on to it for future reference. It's actually possible to learn the material from the book all on your own. All in all, one of the better textbooks out there. 
 I finished reading it, a non-Elvis Cole entry.  The enjoyable, rousing story pulls you along enough to overcome any friction the unlikely premise might generate. There are a couple of interesting twists including a big one near the end. More space is devoted to the ex-con's character development. All in all, something different. 
 I get chills just thinking about this album. If I could make love to it, I would! Seriously people, simply put, this album is a f***ing masterpiece! Malkmus is a genius! If you have any sense, you'll buy it right now 
 I have purchased this book several times and have read it and then I give it away to friends and acquaintances.  It is a very good book 
 My men's group and I just finished going through this book and Wow!  Many of our group members have been believers for over 15 years while others are new to starting their journey with Christ. Across the spectrum every single one of us in our 8-10 person group would show up going, "I learned something new," or "What an interesting perspective. I have to review that again."   Every one of us felt like we grew from the material in this book.  For someone looking to have a change of heart, this is the How-To to all the books on the Why. Very practical steps to take and practice as well as plenty of scripture referenced and relied upon.   This is a call to use the tools in the book (meditation, prayer, service, etc.) to prepare the heart so it can be transformed by God. He makes it very clear that doing any one or two of the disciplines in and of itself does not bring change. God changes us. The disciplines allow us to prepare ourselves like a farmer works the ground, preparing it for a harvest that will come in its time.  Each chapter was a bit overwhelming to even spend an entire week on,as the implications of each topic extend into challenging the reader toward a life change.  His organization of the Inner Disciplines and Outer Disciplines. Again to think of things like Solitude being an Outer Discipline shed new light on the topic, but one he defends very well.  I was grateful for the Journal Handbook that goes with this as it allowed me to further explore each concept over a year. In our men's group I found the supplemental study guide helpful in communicating the central concept of what may have been a difficult chapter to understand due to the language and writing style at times. Also, the study guide helped add additional scripture for us to look up during our meetings.  There is a reason this book shows up on ever Top 50 Christian Books list out there and it has been in print for over 25 years. Regardless of where you are at with your walk with God you'll get some meat in this book and leave with plenty to chew on and hopefully apply to your life 
 My family and I had a recent BBQ and set this unit up on the picnic table next to a cooler full of assorted meats..Guests were grilling knockwurst, brots,wieners,franks,sausage and kielbasa. We thought the kids would love it, But all our guests raved about it. By evenings end the grill was a mess,Unit's Cover and removable tray in dishwasher, wash and wipe down non-stick rollers and stainless body, reassemble, and it's ready to go. Not really designed for a crowd. Perfect for our small family

 The Beatitudes may seem like a strange way to begin a sermon, but they famously open Jesus' "Sermon on the Mount" in the Gospel According to St. Matthew. These pithy, paradoxical promises have fascinated Jesus' followers from the beginning of the Church, serving as a kind of manifesto of Christian spirituality.  "The Beatitudes for Today" is a series of creative and hortatory essays about the eight Matthean blessings. (Luke has four blessings and four, less popular woes.) It's well-suited for private meditation or group study. James Howell, a Methodist pastor, does a good job of explaining the key Greek words, and he steers clear of many misuses and misinterpretations of the text. Most readers will appreciate his widely ecumenical selection of supporting voices, from John Calvin to Therese of Lisieux.  Though the Beatitudes can be seen as attitudes to emulate, steps toward spiritual maturity, and even as a platform for social change, Howell never lets us forget that they are, first and foremost, divine blessings. And that is a good place to begin. 
 I found this story sad but very good with nice ending. She suffers alot but I really enjoyed the ending 
 Lippmann's thorough analysis of public opinion serves as an intriguing contemporary counterpoint to Edward Bernays' "Propaganda" (though both books are in many ways timeless).  An interesting read - I'd highly recommend it to anyone interested in politics or group psychology 
 When I got this book, I needed a manual that described the effects of embalming techniques. This book is loaded with diagrams to guide the physician along the way. Please don't miss the chapter on the holistic  benefits of psycho-pyramidology 
 in the deep of british blues with the complete and accurate work made in this book! Great and rare photos within' an very good analysis of musicians and his music with date concerts over the years make of this book an must for fans and collectors 
 The compact size of this book makes it easy to keep handy, and it is full of useful information.  Some may (through personal experience) disagree with parts of it, but it will be invaluable to any new owner as it covers such an array of topics.  The easily readable style doesn't talk down to you, but is as if you have a friend talking to you.  I think it is excellent 
 On opening this Christmas present I inwardly groaned - didn't like the title and the subjects seemed to be ones that had been covered many times elsewhere.  BUT...I was so wrong!  The writing is clear and entertaining, and the subjects are covered in new and interesting ways.  If you like 'popular maths' books then you'll find Ball to be a great new author to keep an eye on.  If you are a math teacher or instructor you'll find lots of material here that can only enliven your lessons.  One of the best popular maths books for a long time 
 I loved Sparks book The Notebook and added most of his books to my must read list. I really liked this book, he kept it interesting, but The Notebook was much better 
 No matter how much, or how little, money you have, you will be enriched by this timely tome. Like Rabbi Leder himself, 'More Money Than God' is hip, funny, engaging, and wise.  It helps us reexamine our relationship to money, and how money affects us and our relationships to each other. Too many of us let money guide our lives. Rabbi Leder teaches  how age-old spiritual guidance -- and Judaic principles -- can help you sort out your own morals and values when it comes to things you really can't put a price on. Rabbi Leder provides just the right "light touch" so that 'More Money Than God' comes across as good old-fashioned shmoozing,  not sermonizing. But the lessons here are timeless and invaluable, for young and old. What Rabbi Leder has to tell us is  simple, but not simplistic. You and your family will benefit mightily from this book. I bought a copy for my teenage daughter, and I've heard her quoting from it to her friends -- enough said.  Enjoy 
 This book provides a fresh view of the German people during the Nazi era. I loved how Mr. Massaquoi despite being a victim of racisim pointed out that not all German people supported the Nazi government. Many of the movies and books on the era always give the impression that Hitler and the Nazi party ideals were supported 100% by all the German people. Mr. Massaquoi provides us his life story in a direct and straight forward manner. He gives a balanced view of the ill-treatment that all non-aryans suffered.

 Expertly written by Akbar S. Ahmed (Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies, American University, Washington, DC), Islam Under Siege is a ground breaking examination of critical issues surrounding Islam, the West, and how the two diverse cultures view one another. Ranging down the last few centuries of history, and into the post-modern world of globalization, and now in the wake of the September 11 attacks, Islam Under Siege ranges from such central issues of controversy as the Islamic treatment of women, the failings of Muslim leadership, the quest for Muslim ideals and a global paradigm, and more. Islam Under Siege is a quite sober analysis and a very strongly recommended addition to Islamic Studies reference shelves and reading lists 
 If you enjoyed "Briefcase Full of Blues," then this one is a must have. It's as simple as that 
 One of the most amazing stories in western literature is Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol.  When brought to the stage, the journey of Ebenezer Scrooge from a horrid, lonely miser to benevolent, vibrant celebrator of Christmas can be an enthralling experience.  The recent production of this show at GeVa Theatre attempted to take the audience on just such an adventure 
 I love this camera the first day I received it I took 3 rolls of film.  It has been the best purchase I bought this year. I got a real good price on it and i received it fast! 
 Kant is by far one of the hardest philosophers to understand.  Perhaps the toughest part is that Kant ruminates for several pages on the same subject.  If the reader lets go and takes the reading with a trance-like state, then the reading is not so hard to understand.  Another suggestion: read the first part of the sentence and skip all the commas, and read the very last part of the sentence; then go back and read the whole sentence including all the phrases in between the main clause.  This will open up the eyes to understanding all the tangents Kant tends to take.  A must must must read for those who want to understand the philosophical development of "man and nature" and its progressive development to our post-structural times.  Enjoy the pleasure ... or pain of reading this wonderful book 
 Among The Missing is strange territory for Laymon.  Unlike some of his other works of horror or suspense, this is pretty much a straight murder mystery.  Because of the toned-down plot, Laymon's writing is somewhat milder as well.  Not too much gore to be had, fewer random acts of violence and much less sex.  Yet Among The Missing is still a wonderfully entertaining, quick read.  Not Laymon's best - for that, read Island - but definitely one to check out 
 Around the time that Desperation & The Rugulators were floating around for the public to view and decipher, Stephen King decided to take a gamble on a long lost form of publication known as the serial novel.  Back in the days of Dickens, people in America used to wait months and months to get Dickens' newest novels one piece at a time.  Sounds like torture.  Well...it was sort of exciting.  Supposedly Steve-O himself didn't know how the whole thing was going to turn out.  So we got a longish yarn in six parts.    John Coffey is a prisoner on The Green Mile (death row) in for killing two little girls.  Soon he's got a date with old Sparky.  The story is told through the recollection of ex-prison guard Paul Edgecomb.  Coffey is a large, quiet black man who doesn't seem to fit in on The Green Mile.  He's so gentle and kind and soft-spoken.  You gotta wonder what drove him to kill those two sweet little girls.  And he has a special gift.  This is King at what he does best, pure story-telling.  When he gets into his groove, there's no one better at spinning an enjoyable yarn.  After the dry-spell of '92-'96 with some of King's worst novels ever, The Green Mile was a welcome change back in the right direction.  Shades of brilliance, King still surprises us Constant Readers after all these years.  Dig it 
 When I decided to self-publish my first book, I was intimidated by how expensive it was going to cost to buy Page Maker and I also didn't want to spend a month learning how to use it properly. Luckily, I found Aaron's ebook on Amazon and it made it possible for me to use Word and create a professional book that was accepted by the bookstores (they have a very high standard for quality print work). Now that I'm working on my second self-published book, I'm happy to see that Aaron's ebook has been updated in a paperback format. Just like the ebook, this book is essential for learning how to use Word to professionally produce your book.  The biggest benefit of Aaron's book is his experience with using both the MS and Mac versions of Word for self-publishing. He doesn't just tell you how to set the necessary properties and list the steps to perform, he also tells you the "gotchas" that can catch you off guard. His advice can save you many hours of headaches. For example, when I wrote my last book, I didn't take the advice of "Don't use Master pages. Buy more memory if necessary to store the entire book in one file." Stupid me, I used Master pages instead and literally lost most of my hair as I watched Word continuously corrupt my documents and lose my hard work. Even some of my backups were corrupted! What I do now is that as I write the book I keep each chapter in a separate file and store it in its own folder on my harddrive (with all supporting documents). When I'm ready to print the final version I copy and paste everything into one HUGE file (over 500 pages) and print that. That works much better and I haven't lost anymore hair since.  ;-)  Another benefit is that he points out the differences between using Print On Demand services versus a commercial printing press. There are important layout decisions you need to know about.  A couple things I thought were missing is that at the end of the book he lists great resources to check out, but in my opinion he doesn't empahsize James Filici's book on typography enough. I feel that this book should be read first because is has so much great informatin about typography in it. Secondly, I didn't see any mention of where to get Postscript fonts. If you check Adobe's website, they have an introductory set of fonts that give you everything you need and its much cheaper than buying individual fonts. Search for "Adobe Type Basics".  Overall, this book is just what you need to print professional quality books without using PageMaker or Quark Express. It will save money as well as future headaches 
 I thoroughly enjoyed Dead of Night, as I've enjoyed all the Doc Ford books.  There are just a couple of things that stopped me cold and brought me out of the experience.   1. In chapter 14, Doc has printed out a series of articles on the guinea flea, and mentions the "sheath of papers" sitting on a chair.  As an educated man, he ought to know it's a "sheaf" of papers, unless he's talking about the envelope they're in.  2.  Doc refers to Ransom being his "only living relative".  Then what does he consider Laken?  How is a son not a living relative?  This isn't said to someone, where Doc might be trying to shield his son, it's in the narrative of the book, where we the audience certainly aren't a threat.  Maybe I'm being too picky, but what are editors for 
 I like Jane Austen, but this is a very special book, even for her.  When I was widowed a few years ago, I read Persuasion.  Lots or people here love this book, but it holds a special place in my life because it gave me the will to go on. We live in a youth-oriented culture which tries to tell people that only the young, the rich and the beautiful have a right to love and happiness; this book says that all people can have a second chance at happiness. Persuasion taught me that the pain over losing the one you love does not have to end your life.  You can start again, and perhaps be even happier than you were the first time around, when you were young and didn't know what life was about. I know some people prefer the dashing heroes in Austen's other books, but Anne and Captain Wentworth are much closer to who most of us are. We are not flashy or rich; we don't always have supportive families; our beauty might only be seen by the people who love us the most because they've looked in our hearts. Love will not bring us land or access to the powerful, and it won't make our families act more kindly to us.  But what love does is act as a shelter from the storms of life- death, sickness, insensitive people.  While women now have more freedom to love than they did in the early 19th century, they are still hampered by unrealistic ideas regarding how the mind and body ages, the value of maturity, how having 'baggage' can be a sign that one has been places and seen things, and how common sense and human decency may be more important in the long run than beauty or good fashion sense. Most women are still afraid to be alone with themselves or to carve out a satisfying life without a man. Because most women and men don't value these concepts, Persuasion is not ranked as highly as Austen's more exciting earlier novels.  Still, if I could only take one book with me to a desert island, this would probably be the one 
 After buying the original "The Fast and The Furious" I found most of my enjoyment came from making fun of the movie and shaming it.  However, I can now say I am a fan of the trilogy (all 3 films are good).  Lucas Black is simply The Man and gives another great performance here.  Bow Wow does a surprisingly good job as well.  Car buffs and street racers will especially like this movie (which I am neither).  This is a fast paced and exciting action packed movie that many will enjoy 
 Let's face it, Ted Dekker has his own style.  Some love it, others like it, others hate it.  Whatever you think of his style, you have to give him one thing, he writes with passion and emotion.  And in Obsessed that's exactly what you get: a gripping thriller written with emotion.  What the story lacks in characterization and detail, it more than makes up in theme.  In short, Dekker succeeds in reminding the reader how much God obsesses over His children and that we are to obsess over Him in the same way.  Obsessed is a modern-day parable worth reading 
 The Origin of Species is likely THE most important book ever written.  Unfortunately, Mr. Darwin was not a good writer for this age.  His language is antiquated, however, the facts and theories are timeless. 
 James Patterson has done a number of overlapping novels around the theme of beautiful genetic hybrid children who fly.  His books are often page-turners that engage the reader almost against your will.  One is inclined to forgive the loose ends of plot development that he leaves lying around. However, the notion that a large group of renegade genetic manipulators could operate in secret and with impunity from law enforcement (not to mention investigative journalists!) as it kills off its opponents and conducts massive man-hunts for seven flying kids, is a little too much of a reach.   Still worth the read, even if you don't buy the sequels.  
 I've never liked David Cross much, but this movie is one of the funniest movies i've EVER seen. This isn't "regular" humor, hence, why some don't like it. There's so much subtle humor that many just don't get. Expect ALOT of cameo's, including Maynard James Keenan as the pimp in the video. [... 
 You probably won't see a film made in the U.S. in which a father and daughter are vying for the affections of the same man! This German film begins with the motley group of Zobel (played by handsome Gotz George, one of Germanys' most popular actors), his lover Karl (Christian Redi) and Zobel's daughter, Lizzie (Jeanette Hain) making their living by practicing petty crimes like picking pockets and con schemes. When Karl is hit by a car during an ill-fated scheme, Zobel and Lizzie search for a replacement. Rudolf, a cute 25-year-old gas station attendant fits the bill. But complications arise when both Lizzie and Zobel fall in love with Rudolf. Rudolf returns affections to both of his admirers, which of course soon results in numerous conflicts. This gritty comedy is infused with charm and pathos (both Zobel and Lizzie are lonely characters seeking a ray of happiness in their dreary lives). The film suffers from a weak ending that is not entirely satisfying but the film is one that is definitely recommended 
 If you are a product developer or even thinking about becoming one this book is a must have 
 Good material, easy to read and understand!  Needs more info on types of paint available and how to use them 
 I see this book referenced in the literature of customer service, complexity science, and employee-oriented studies.  Having now read the book, I can see why so many people refer to it.  First, the book is  extremely clear and easy to understand.  It operates at a common sense  level that is missing from many management books.  Second, the author is  describing case examples from his own first-hand experience.  And he is  certainly not Al Dunlap.  Almost anyone would identify with the principles  espoused here, which is to focus your resources and attention on where it  will do the most good.  Although people who refer to this book are clear  about seeing the customer service aspects of Carlzon's thinking, I found  that his strategic thinking about where trends force improved performance  was even more impressive.  Put the two together, and you have a remarkable  opportunity to improve.  Three, he explains very well the context of why he  did things and how Scandinavia is different from the United States.  That  added a lot of meaning for me of case examples that I am not familiar with.   If you want to see three examples of how unstalled thinking can make a big  difference in your company, I urge you to read this book.  Carlzon is a  true stallbuster in areas like overcoming communications, bureaucracy,  disbelief, unattractiveness, and misconception  stalls.  If we ever do  another edition of The 2,000 Percent Solution, I would certainly like to  use some of these examples in it.  I particularly recommend chapters 5  (setting the strategy), 6 (flattening the pyramid), 7 (taking risks), 8  (communicating), 10 (measuring results), and 12 (the second wave).  You  will not find better advice anywhere else on these subjects.  Unlike most  management and leadership books, this one is a quick and easy read.  Yet it  contains a lot of meat.  Carlzon seems to be able to get his point across  in about one-third the space of most business authors.  You'll like the  difference 
 Greene has clearly drawn out the ways of the seducer.  Most of the men and women in here are naturals at seduction and are not consciously doing the principles taught.  But those that tend to mess up their seductions can learn quite a few things from these people.  With everything i teach at my site The Seduction Bible, i still believe that this book is excellent for those looking to score that one special girl.  Those wanting to learn how to go out to a bar to pick up a woman are better off on sites like mine.  But this book deserves 5 stars 
 Dean did a fantastic job footnoting his evidence, data and sources; he gives the reader ample information if they want to explore this information further (or make a vain attempt to refute it).  Like other reviewers, I'm not sure why this book did not get more press. Dean briefly points out that the media has done a terrible job covering Bush and Cheney, as most of the major news outlets just seem to flow along with the spin. This is not a theme of the book, just a digression. Sorry.   Dean does a nice job cataloging Bush and Cheney's business failures and questionable deals, their rampantly unethical 2000 campaign and their mistakes, failures, lies, cover-ups and spins up through the spring of 2004.  Other books are now being published that have picked up on the same scholarly and impassioned path as Dean; they are "Fiasco" by Thomas Ricks (about the disaster of war in Iraq) and "The One Percent Doctrine" by Ron Suskind (taken from a Cheney statement that the US needs to go all out, even if there is only a 1% chance that terrorists have enough power and will to attack America) 
 Go back in time and live, travel and fight with the Nez Perce as they seek to return to their own lands. Feel their utter despair as gradually they are chased down by the US Army murdered, and finally with so few left,  forced to live the lives of captives on a reservation. This book brings  home the enormity of the crime committed by the US Government of the day,  not only against the Nez Perce but all of the Native Americans, it should  be compulsive reading for all US schoolchildren. It is without doubt one of  the most absorbing books I have read on the subject of Native Americans.  Dont take my word for it, read it yourself, you will not regret it 
 Iron Maiden is truly a legacy that makes heavy metal and progressive rock fun and interesting. while i tend to stick to music such as industrial and punk, i cannot help but love iron maiden. that being said, everything on this album is a definite 5 stars...easily tops powerslave and much heavier than seventh son...it kind of has the emotion of seventh son mixed with the hard rock of powerslave..only the hard rock is cranked up a few 1000 jolts from powerslave's level. sea of madness is maybe the heaviest maiden song i have ever heard!  get this if you are new to maiden! it is worth the price too...the packaging is beautiful and the enhancements these maiden discs have are among the best ive seen 
 "le le low" is a greaaat song. i love the guitar in it, and the beat always makes me want to dance. In "have a good sleep" the singer does little high note sort of yelps : ]  and like all all of HHH's songs the lyrics are always so witty and incredibly creative. the sound on this EP is so unique, and like no other artits i've hear before. in "Touch you, touch you" it's hard to get the lyrics right in the beginning. but i think the vocals in this song sound really really great. "5 times out of 100" at first reminded me a little one of their first albums "scenes one through thirteen" in terms of the keyboard. this song is really energetic and my favorite part is about 3/4 of the way through it when the song slows down a bit. "More for show" is great and of course has amazing lyrics like " a dollhouse drawn in sand. the random lack of dirty hands". and it's a complete feel good song. 
 Excellent account of the transformation from caterpillar to butterfly. It's a great gift for children and butterfly loving adults alike 
 I found this book very informative on the subject of Cairn Terriers.  Probably the only one needed.  It's detail makes it ideal for use as a handbook and the many colored pictures a pleasure to read and see. It includes product suggestions as well.  I found I still needed more information concerning training than what was covered in this book 
 A fine picture about life in a small Texas town. Easily a classic if they would give the added footage back to the directo 
 If you like the Little Rascals from the old day you will love this new and improved movi 
  Biopic of the French scuptress (played by Isabelle Adjani) who showed great promise as a young woman and then came under the influence of Rodin (she became his lover) and went mad. She is contrasted with her brother Paul, who is weak and afraid of life's risks, while she is strong, independent, and willful; he goes on to success while she achieves nothing but madness. Rodin uses her, emotionally and physically, and when she becomes pregnant by him and wants him to marry her, he refuses (he's actually living with another woman). She has an abortion, attempts again to get Rodin to marry her, fails at this - and then slips into the madness of paranoia. She continues to sculpt, has one showing, but it's not a success and she goes off the deep end. She spends the last 30 years of her life in an asylum. The movie is good, mainly because the script is excellent; so is the period photography. At times it goes soft, though, especially in some of the scenes with Rodin (played well by Gerard Depardieu) where a knockout punches should have been delivered. Interesting, however, and well worth a watch 
 This book is an excellent read if you want to know how non-muslims fair under islamic law.  Radical Islamists adhere to medieval traditions and laws mandating the Jihad.    subjugated people are given three choices:   1) convert, 2) pay a head tax, or 3) die.  This is not something in the past either today there is no  Muslim state, which offers full civil rights to members of other religions. Many Christians work in Saudi Arabia, but they are not allowed to practice their religion in public because there is no religious freedom in Saudi Arabia.  The State Department's report on Religious Freedom points out that the Saudis do "not always respect this right in practice and do not define this right in law." 
 Wonderful CD.  Faron Young just the way I like him. Every song was as honky tonk as I hoped or as we always say,"Good Beer Drinkin Music." Jodi S 
 This is a book that I have referred to over and over again to get myself organized and stay organized.  Emile Barnes uses a no nonsense approach to get you organized.  Her common sense system of using a timer and giving yourself 15 minutes to stay focused on your area of attack is great.  I am a working mom with two toddlers.  I read this book originally when I got married 7 years ago.  I read it at least once a year to reinspire myself and as a constant reference to stay motivated with a busy schedule to get organized 
 I started reading Heinlen when I was eight, and didn't know that some of the books he wrote were written for kids while others for adults until AFTER I had read both Time Enough for Love and Friday at the age of eleven.  Due to this, a large chunk of my social and political views were molded in a slightly different cast as my peers as Heinlen is,as my father put it, "the only man who could ever start a cult I would join" (which would have proably horrified him).  Having said that, take my review with a grain of salt.    This is proabably my LEAST favorite Future History series of books, if only because it seemed to have the least point.  The rampant incest, free love, pokes at organized religion, and general snubbing of societal rules bothers me not even a little.  However, unlike most of Heinlen's books, I didn't finish this one feeling like I had figured out a little more about the world I live in, or the world I want to live in.  There are aspects of Mama Maureen I take to heart in my own life, but unlike TEFL which I quote at my friends ad naueseum and attempt to work into the way I live my day to day life, I finished To Sail Beyond the Sunset feeling oddly empty.  While I greatly enjoy the later Heinlen's, I don't enjoy when there is an Us/Them mentalitly to them.  The thing I like most about TEFL, I Will Fear No Evil, and Friday is that I can get wrapped up in the story without worrying about who wins and who loses.  To Sail Beyond the Sunset attempts the same feeling without being quite as succesful.  Having said that, I would kill to have Ira Johnson in my life, be one of Mama Maureen's children, and I'm still a hoping deep down inside to get to go travelng with Dora and Laz and Lor, and of course Lazarus.  I live by the Eleventh Commandment and try to emulate Maureen's definition of a lady at every chance, and parts of this book have stuck with me between readings as with every Heinlen novel I've ever read (and as of last week I have read every piece of fiction he ever put into a book).  I've read this book easly twenty-five times, I'm just saying it is ABSOLUTELY NOT the first or even fifth Heinlen to read, if you didn't like TEFL stop now, and be prepared to put the pre-imprinted notions of society to the side while reading this one, and expect to be a little uncomfortable if you can't 
 This is a unique series in that the lead character never changes, but her geography and the minor characters are always different as she moves about from national park to national park.  This time out, we got to revisit the Natchez Trace Parkway, where ranger Anna Pigeon was last on duty in "Deep South."  It kind of made me wish we could keep going back to Mississippi for more, because keeping this book in the same locale as another made it feel more homey and familiar, rather than a bit lonely like the other books.    Anna is called for assistance when an aide finds a body in a historic building on park lands.  It's middle-aged, overweight local Doyce Barnette, who has been stripped down to his tighty-whiteys and left on a bed, a dire passage circled in red ink in a Bible in the room.  Doyce also has some strange bruising on his body that indicates possible bizarre sex games might have led to his death.  An investigation into his life doesn't support his interest in such activities, though, and things aren't adding up.  Doyce had two living relatives, his mother and his brother, who is also the local mortician.  His only close friends appear to be his poker-playing buddies, who don't seem all that close to him.  Anna and Sheriff Clintus Jones's investigation doesn't seem to be turning up much in the way of useful evidence, and every witness interview they attempt goes awry courtesy of annoying ranger Randy Thigpen, Anna's nemesis on the job.  Anna's personal life is again in turmoil, too, as the man she has fallen for is not only a lawman, but also a priest, and a married one at that.  Ranger Thigpen tells Anna he's turning over a new leaf, hoping that his last few months before retirement can be peaceful ones, and Anna grudgingly agrees to give him a chance.  Her other ranger, Barth Dinkins, plays a more peripheral role this time out, spending most of his time restoring a slave cemetery, which is also wound into the murder plot.    I had a very hard time putting this book down because I had a feeling I knew who the bad guy was very early on, but I couldn't be absolutely certain until the end.  In addition, I had a niggling idea as to what led to Barnette's death, but couldn't quite put my finger on it.  As usual, Anna finds herself in grave danger and has to use all her skills and wits to come out on top, which she does with aplomb.  I have liked every book in the series, but this one was particularly fun for me, maybe because I was right about who Anna should be looking out for, and I knew it would lead to a gripping conclusion.  I'll be sorry not to return to the Natchez Trace Parkway next time I visit Anna Pigeon, but I like this series enough that I'll gladly follow her into murder and mayhem wherever she goes. 
 This Read with Me DVD helps kids with letter recognition, matching lower and upper case letters together! It also emphasizes rhyming, which is an important pre-reading awareness. My daughters and I found out about Chicka Chicka Boom Boom from Blue's Clues, so when this showed up Christmas morning, they were so excited. My almost four-year-old daughter understood how to use this toy with only minimal instruction from me. She watched the dvd "read" the book to her, and then she chose to play games based on the book she had just read. It is very interactive, educational, mesmerizing and entertaining. She will play with this for 30 min-1 hour, asking me questions every now and then. She likes that she controls what happens, whether it's just reading or playing the games. She asks to play this when she wants to be a "big" kid. She thinks she's playing video games, just like Dad 
 At 10mp, this camera takes some of the clearest and visually stunning pictures I have ever taken with a digital camera.  The clarity and detail alone are reason to get this camera. The display, although pooh-poohed by others as too small, is quite large to me.   The cameras small, lithe design is another selling point.  Nothing bulky about this camera. You can put it in your front pants-pocket if you needed to.   Do yourself a favor and get this camera.  You won't regret it. 
 I am ever grateful that this book was recommended to me.  It has changed my life in many ways and helped to send me on my spiritual journey.  I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking spiritual development 
 In the 1970s, Sir Elton John's sound inmediately set him apart from most others by being piano-based in a rock'n'roll world dominated by guitars. Another early characteristic was a set of dynamic string arrangements by Paul Buckmaster. Coupled with Taupin's often opaque but emotionally resonant lyrics, the results were unique in the history of music. Songs in this style included "Sixty Years On", "Burn Down the Mission", "Take Me to the Pilot", "Levon", "Madman Across the Water", and the best-known of these, "Tiny Dancer".  "Your Song", one of his earliest popular hits, incorporates some other features found in many of his songs: It is in  binary form, with the verse repeated before the chorus begins; the piano accompaniment is prominent, though the song also features an orchestra; it uses a slowly building crescendo that brings the song to a tutti climax. Other songs that follow this pattern include "Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me" and "Rocket Man".  Elton has been one of the dominant commercial forces in the rock world since the 1970s. His success has had a profound impact on popular music, and contributed to the continued popularity of the piano in rock  & roll.  This compilation is the best opportunity to have a Sir Elton John's Masterpiece Performances so that I strongly recommend it 
 My husband and I were on a one-week whirlwind tour with a touring company. We purchased this right before hitting Florence and Tuscany and it was an invaluable resource. The photos are beautiful and the information provided was just enough to get us excited (and knowledgeable) about what we were seeing. The Street-by-Street guides were particularly helpful since we were given a small black and white map by the touring company which didn't point out anything useful! I am using the book as a reference as I scrapbook the trip, and it will be a wonderful souvenir in the years to come. Thank you 
  Hands down the best Sci-fi/Horror series on tv today. I am completly addicted 
 This is much better book than the second In Style book. There are detailed tips on how to look for the best fit and what shapes flatter which body style. I was hoping to see more pictures of actual clothes so that's the reason for four stars 
 Very comprehensive and most importantly fun. Don't take my words for it. Polled in a certain drummer magazine as one of the best instructional drumming dvds. 2 thumbs up!! 
 Who creates the ideas that move people and nations? And why do they do it? Surely ideas and convictions motivate many of us to act in important ways. In his revolutionary book, Darren Staloff explores the relationship of  intellectuals to the cultural products they create. Read this book to find  out about Puritans; but read it thoroughly to learn about ideas and their  use. This book may change a lot of what you think about ideas and  intellectuals. It is highly recommended for all thinkers and skeptics 
 I'm a fan of Celebrity Roasts and a even bigger fan of William Shatner and his "off the wall" style of acting, singing, and his unique way of poking fun at himself. When I heard that Comedy Central was going to have a Celebrity Roast of him I just knew it would be a comedic explosion and thats exactly what it was! Words can not describe how funny the insane insults were and knowing William Shatner, you can only imagine how crazy it got. It got so crazy that it almost seemed like they were roasting George Takei who was on the roasting pannel who played "solo" on Star Trek because of his recently "coming out of the closet" and saying he was gay. Shatners comments on George Takei were pricless! All in all it was a complete blast of laughter that I enjoyed and when I get it uncensored on DVD I will watch it again and again and treasure the laughter 
 I was born nearly 15 years after Apollo 11 landed on the moon. Despite that, I have a deep interest in the early manned space program. "A Man on the Moon" is by far the best book about early space flight that I have read. I am not a woman of science. In fact, almost all technical jargin is way over my head. My interest lies mainly in the lives of the astronauts- I want to know who they are. This book does two things I love: 1. it focuses mainly on the lives of the astronauts, and 2. it explains the science and technical aspects in a way I understand. I've read many of the astronauts's auto/biographies, and they are, of course, biased. Chalkin gives the facts in a well written and interesting way. While in the spirit of Tom Wolfe's "The Right Stuff," "A Man on the Moon" is much easier for a modern audience to follow. The Tom Hanks miniseries "From the Earth to the Moon" was based on this book, and for any fans of that I strongly suggest this book as a suppliment to the movie. Just fantastic 
 Need a change from your usual read? Sit back and enjoy Shawan Lewis debut novel "Help Wanted", where a higher power has the final say and if you believe... then all will prevail.   I enjoyed the four stories in this book. I was especially partial to the stories "The Rain Maker" and "The Working Girl". In "The Working Girl", I appreciate that Paris was able to resist her boss's sexual advances, even though she could have gotten payback for Russ's cheating a**.   An enjoyable read; let's see what Shawan has in store for us next. Well done!  Locksie  ARC Book Club Inc. 
 I loved Megan's Abbott's book!  It's an achievement.  She handles the form as a master.  The writing is elegant -- I especially like the rhythms of the catalogs,  the litanies; the vivid present tense.  And, I like the subtlety with which she weaves her ideas -- the fusion of noir and fifties-suburban-ideal; the feminist take on both genres -- into a fast-paced and entertaining novel.  It is cinematic.  A great debut.  
 I was very touched by this movie.  It was not the actual story/plot, or it's accuracy that was important to me.  Rather, what was meaningful about this film was the portrayal of a personal Transcendence the main character brings about in his life--from rage, hate, and bitterness, to self caring, willingness to learning, inner directedness, to a sense of spirituality and something "bigger than himself," to forgiveness and "letting go," and then the untimate Transcendence--reaching out, risking trusting others with his core pain, and risking loving others.  Also, this film portrays some very rare people who demonstrate commitment to their principles, determination to care about "the individual" and to rectifying an injustice.  I do not know whether or not Rubin Carter murdered those people.  From my stand point, this is a movie that models personal healing.  It is touching and inspirational--even if it were to turn out to be total fiction 
 When I first heard Field Mob, it was on the DTP compilation album, Ludacris Presents Disturbing The Peace, I wasn't very impressed.  They were decent on the song Georgia, but if I were looking at buying their album solely based on that song, then I wouldn't have bought it.  However, So What was released a while after Georgia and the song blew me away.  It was lyric filled and catchy at the same time.  The song quickly became a favorite of mine.  So I continued checking them out, and I was happy with what I heard.  So when the cd Light Poles and Pine Trees came out, I rushed to pick it up.  The cd starts off strong with 1,2,3.  It then goes into the song My Wheels which is a pretty good song.  After that is the hit single So What with Ciara, followed by a sex song called Baby Bend Over, which is one I skip.  Then is another one of my favorites, Smilin with Ludacris.  This song is basically addressing all of the haters and is an excellent song.  Then is Area Code 229 which is decent.  A skit follows, and then another highlight in Blacker The Berry.  This is only Smoke and it samples an old Tupac song called Keep Ya Head Up.  This song is amazing.  Then I Hate You comes up which is forgettable, followed by At The Park, Shawn Jay's solo.  This song is very good.  Then is another sex song called Eat Em Up, Beat Em Up.  This song is catchy but it is kind of nasty as well.  Then is Pistol Grip, Sorry Baby Feat. Bobby Valentino, It's Over, and Georgia.  All of these songs are all pretty good.  Overall, I would recommend this cd to everybody because it is an excellent cd and everyone should own it.  
 This is a book that is the symbol of the work that Alan Lomax has put into collecting folksongs. The book is one of the greatest, and what some folksingers read and memorize. It is well worth whatever anyone would sell  it for, and probably more than that. It also has a discography of some of  Lomax's favourite folk albums up to 1960. A good investment 
 This is a good Hard Rock band that failed to make it big but still wrote good songs. You get everything they recorded for cheep money. It is worth a listen 
 When I saw this movie back in the l970s, I was knocked out of my BVD's with Joe the Magnificent. I had never seen a creature like him before: gorgeous, tough, sweet, funny and sex personified. I've read where this  movie was NOT improvised, that Paul Morrisey adhered to a professional  script and was a strict, but creative director. Then, I've heard it was  just the opposite. I really don't think Joe was faking his drug induced  stupor, expressions, mumblings. I loved Holly Woodlawn but nearly upchucked  when her hideous, pregnant sister entered the picture. Gross is too mild a  word. That drooling wet mouth and buck teeth, her bloated figure, yuck! I  wish that sad little lost child, Andrea Feldman, had a bigger part.  Thankfully, she was showcased in Andy Warhol's HEAT, another favorite. Once  I was in the Village during that time and my boyfriend told me Joe  Dellasandro was walking just ahead. I fled--not wanting to see a real  embodiment of a movie icon. The same thing happened when Liz Taylor left  the theater each night during her starring role in "The Little  Foxes" during the 80s. Each night I would study the gigantic crowds,  waiting to glimpse her. But when I'd see the stage door open and she began  to make her exit, I fled. Reality's a nice place to visit but I wouldn't  want to live there. Gotta run and watch Joe, my Joe, my wonderful Joe in  "Trash." A real underground classic 
 This is another of the fantastic "Sheep" Books by Nancy Shaw. In this adventure the sheep go for a hike in the  woods, lose the trail and then get lost. Do they find their way out of the forest? I love their surprising ending. I have loved following the five sheep and their seagull friend through their adventures. Young children who read with me love to look for the seagull, to spot the sheep with the knitting, and to find the rhymes on every page. The books are easy reading for the newest readers, with beautiful pictures on every page 
 From the opening bass chops of Peter Cetera and the haunting laugh of Terry Kath- this album is gripping. The final album of the original line-up of Chicago shows a return to some of the hard rock stylings of their 1969 debut album on songs such as Mississippi Delta City Blues and Takin' It On Uptown.  Mississippi Delta City Blues- Viewed by some fans as Terry's swan song. This song can be interpreted on multiple levels. Terry's laugh at the beginning of the song juxtaposed with the lyrics about masking his unhappiness is a very nice creative effect. Peter Cetera shines on the bass on this song. The guitar riff is catchy, the horns accent Terry and Peter's performance. Although this song had been around since Chicago's days playing the club circuit in the late sixties, the lyrics seem particularly pertinent to Terry's feelings at the time of its recording. His unhappiness is expressed throughout the song despite his somewhat jovial tone- it's almost eerie that this was recorded so close to Terry's death.  Baby What A Big Surprise- This is the rough in the diamonds, reinforcing the label of "ballad band" for Chicago. It might as well have been called If You Leave Me Now Part II- This Time We'll REALLY Give You Cavities.  Till the End of Time- James Pankow's second endeavour as lead vocalist. While somewhat slow, this song still contains a lot of the elements of earlier Chicago. The syrup doesn't run quite as thick as on Baby What a Big Surprise. The horns are still quite prominent, the vocals are well done by Pankow leaving some fans wondering why he only sang lead on two Chicago songs during his entire (and continued) tenure with the band. The harmony vocals at the end of the song are some of the best harmonies Chicago has ever done.  Policeman- Musically speaking it's not one of Robert Lamm's stronger songs. The lyrics however are written quite well in a story-telling style which is somewhat reminiscent of the songs of Gordon Lightfoot and Harry Chapin. The horns are quite prominent, Terry's guitar playing accents and compliments the horns nicely. The harmony vocals compliment both Lamm's vocals and the horns. Unfortunately after this song Lamm's songwriting skills seemed to fall into a slump.  Take Me Back to Chicago- A touching song written by Danny Seraphine and "Hawk" Wolinski for Freddy Page, the late drummer of the Illinois Speed Press. However with Terry's untimely passing being so close to the release of this album this song is seemingly just as much written for Terry as it's written for Page. The preach by Chaka Kahn at the end of the song is a nice touch. This is easily one of the best Danny Seraphine penned songs and it shows his emergence as a songwriter.  Vote For Me- Typical Robert Lamm political commentary. This song is quite tongue-in-cheek, however, lyrically speaking it seems a bit weaker than Policeman. On the musical end of things this song has a stronger feel to it than some of Robert's other endeavours from the late seventies.  Takin' It On Uptown- In a word WOW! Terry Kath at his absolute best! Both vocally and on guitar- Terry Kath shines on this album. Some of Terry's best playing since his marathon solos on Live at Carnegie Hall. The lyrics are written by Fred Kagan, however they seem to carry a similar theme to the lyrics of Mississippi Delta City Blues. This song has a more upbeat theme to it although Terry sings it in an almost angry, fed-up tone. Moreso than any other song of Terry's- this seems to be a duet between Terry the singer and Terry the guitarist.  This Time- For a slower song, Terry really jams on this song as well. Lee Loughnane's lead vocals are very reminiscent of Terry's soulful style in fact at first listen one would almost assume that it is indeed Terry, not Lee, on lead vocals. One of Lee's finer attempts at being a songwriter and a singer.  The Inner Struggles of A Man- The orchestration on this piece provides a beautiful segue from the more upbeat This Time to the more somber Little One. It's a very beautiful piece and it sounds like it could be used for a film.  Prelude (Little One)- Picking up where The Inner Struggles of A Man crescendoes this is an excellent lead-in to Little One.  Little One- Written by Danny Seraphine for his daughters, Terry puts his stamp on this piece as well. This song can easily be interpretted as being just as much for Michelle Kath as it is for Danny's daughters. The string orchestration in the background really compliments the horns and Terry's voice 
 The shirt is true to the description.  It's lightweight, fit's true to size, wicks away sweat, dries quickly, and looks good.  Heads up, it is so lightweight with thin fabric that the wearers undergarment can be seen through the material 
  Well researched, easy to use, perfect for the the seasoned cook or novice alike. She even advices you on what to buy in the way of cookware, a big boon to many a wedding list!  It is a touch evangelical, Delia is always prone to giving you advice like a stern School Marm (so it feels like something you have to do rather than might do!) and this is reflected in her slighty dry, bossy and occasionalyy dreary writing, think cooking with a St Trinian's Head mistress if you have never seen Delia on TV. But I have to hand it to her, if you follow her recipes to the letter YOU WILL NOT GO WRONG!  Just curtail the cookware shopping list or do as she says and get a MUCH bigger Kitchen 
 Twila Paris is a great CCM artist, everything she sings uplifts you and gives you hope.  She sings great, and the songs she picks are spectacular.  This CD is a perfect "Best Of" CD of her 20 years of work, including three new songs, which are on par with the rest of her material.  The only disappointment with this CD is the fact it did not contain "He Is No Fool," my favorite Twila Paris song, however that doesn't detract enough to lower this from five stars.  Buy this today, you won't be disappointed 
 Angels was the smallest college in Cambridge.  It was  built at the beginning of the 15th century.  Fairly had a fellowship.  St. Angelicus students had to find their own lodgings.  Fred Fairly had taken the science tripos and received a first class degree.  He came from a rectory and so his material wants were limited.  He was used to making do. At the end of his first year as a junior fellow he wanted to tell his father he was no longer a Christian.  Fred knew the country was not a place of peace.  The Rectory had been built in 1830.    Daisy Saunders wanted to know how the human body worked and applied for nursing training.  She was seventeen and her mother had died recently and she was free to live away from home.  Daisy, now known as Saunders, was a probationer during her first year.  She was told to keep her eye on James Elder, an attempted suicide via the Thames.  It was January 1912.  To all the patients, except for the dying, food was of paramount importance.  Elder refused to eat.  The constable had said he was a gentleman.  He asked Daisy if the incident had appeared in the press.  For arranging for a notice about Elder's conduct in the newpaper, Daisy was dismissed.    Fred Fairly and Daisy were in an accident with bicycles.  A Good Samaritan thought they were married to each other and put them to bed together in the spare room to regain their health.  Fred was enchanted and afterwards he looked everywhere to locate Daisy.  The kindness of the Wrayburns, the Samaritans, gave Daisy a place to stay in Cambridge.  She would do work in the house in exchange for room and board.  She had traveled to Cambridge to find work in a private hospital.  Happily Daisy was employed at the mental hospital and Fred found her again at the Wrayburns'.  They went for a walk in the country.  Fred asked Daisy to marry him.  Mr. Wrayburn told Daisy that Fred could not be a junior fellow if he married.    In the trial, pertaining to the accident, the journalist, who had accompanied Daisy to Cambridge, was able to identify the man who drove the horse cart wildly causing the accident.  When the heart is broken, efficiency is impaired.  There was some suggestion in the testimony of the journalist that Daisy had been or would have been used, but for the happening of the accident.  Daisy had to leave the Wrayburns and Cambridge because of what was disclosed in court.  Leaving her lodgings, she was free at last to cry over the hurt she had caused Fred.  Daisy and Fred passed each other on her way to the train station.  We do not know what action, if any, resulted.    Both of the young characters are portrayed as having beautiful consciences.  The writing is elegant.       
 If you want just one CD that gives you an overview of Joan Baez's career and contains her greatest hits, well...you won't find one.  Her career has been too long and varied for that.  She was at Woodstock and at Live Aid.  She covered traditional English and Spanish folk songs, protest and mainstream pop.  Joan's is the finest female voice of the 60's folk revival and protest movement -- pure and melodious and true.  This particular CD has too much Dylan for my taste (although, contrary to Amazon's editorial, Gates of Eden is not on this album).  Good at the time, these now sound very dated.  But that is an accurate reflection of the period.  We tend to forget now that a great many fans admired Dylan's songwriting but wished he would leave it to the sweet-voiced Joan to sing them.  My personal favorites are the traditional English songs Mary Hamilton, Geordie and John Riley.  She sings them exquisitely.  If you share that taste, you must get this CD.  Given that this album has a wide variety of music and the resale value seems quite high, this is a prime candidate for ripping and burning the tracks you like and selling it on, especially as the insert notes are minimal and not worth keeping.  As a child of the 60s, the album of hers that I remember best and which now seems most representative is her eponymous 'Joan Baez'.  Start either with that album or with this one.  
 This is a tight set from one of the best dj's out there. Not sure if this is Seaman's best work, but it is definitely a contender. Try Seaman's renaissance master series or Nick warren's renaissance. Janeiro Solid sessions is rocking 
 This is a classic read. I have many books I read again and again. I learn something new every time. I will reread these stories for years to come. Wish Toole was still alive 
 This book start of pretty simple with a family being killed and there house torched, but then thing get interesting as the DEEP story line starts to open up. This is only the second prey book I have read, the other one being Rules of Prey, and I thought this was a great book. This is just a good book all around, they way Mr. Sandford jumps from charecter to charecter is smooth and isn't confusing at all. A real page turner with new evidence and suspects being thrown at you, but not in a way that will leave you saying "What! Where did he come from? or How does that have to do with this case. The only problem I have was the few parts that talk about the previous case that Lucas talks about. I guess its from the previous book and I havn't read that one, but don't worry these books seem that its okay to read out of order you just may be confused on a couple of paragraphs. Anyway I loved this book and will be reading more John Sandford books in the future. 
 As an author of a book that uses a fishing metaphor to illustrate how relationships work, I was approached by someone about this book.  So I bought it and must say that it truly gives the more serious angler a better understanding about what fly fishing for trout is all about.  Having read about a dozen books on trout fishing (in doing the research for my fishing analogy), I think this one is one of the very best.  The pictures are beautiful and something that every California trout fisherman should have in his personal library 
 This book is an excellent introduction to the topic. Benade explains the subject assuming that the reader has no background in science (good for musicians) and no background in music (good for scientists). He writes the book as if he's translating a mathematical proof into plain English. Benade starts from scratch (even the notion of pitch is considered alien) and builds wonderfully intuitive understandings. Yes, this is an old book, so if you are NOT new to this field (and not afraid of math) then you'd be more interested in one of the Rossing books. But on the plus side, because the book was written before Benade had access to modern laboratory techniques, the "experiments" described in the book are all simple to understand and can be done at home. Unlike the Rossing books (which I also highly recommend), Benade's book does not read like a textbook or a reference source. It is very easy-to-read, so you can actually benefit from just sitting down and reading it (though Benade does provide problems at the end of the chapter for the dedicated reader).  In response to one of the unfavorable reviews posted, I do not find any fault with Benade when he states (p. 66) that "lopping off the higher frequency ... harmonics does not alter the perceived pitch of the sound." In fact, this statement comes right after an in-depth explanation of how the higher frequency partials DETERMINE the pitch for INHARMONIC sounds (e.g. chimes and bells). Perhaps the reviewer was confused by Benade's terminology. As explained on p. 63, Benade uses the word "partial" generically to describe higher frequency components. Benade reserves the term "harmonics" for partials that have  whole-number relationships.  I wouldn't use this work as a college textbook, but I would certainly add it to the students' list of additional recommended references 
 Excellent!  Highly recommended.  A very unknown true story in the midst of beautiful illustrations 
 This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while.  While I can see some people not being drawn to the absurdist humor that makes up this movie, for the fans of shows like Stella or shows like Tom Goes to the Mayor or 12 Oz. Mouse on Adult Swim, this movie is an instant cult classic.  Definitely check this one out 
 This book covers such a variety of subjects and is so beautifully illustrated throughout with old-fashioned artwork.  From folklore to poetry, traditions to recipes, stories to songs, crafts to gift ideas; this book has it all!  I just love to browse its pages to put me in the Christmas mood. It would make the most wonderful gift. 
 very interesting book... I found it to be very detailed it doesnt just give facts it breaks everything down for you... It is a book that has answered alot of questions for me. 
 Received this item in perfect condition too.  It is also a great book 
 All Pokemon movies will get 5 stars from me.  My daughter loves Pokemon and we've watched this movie several times together and she about a hundred times by herself and its very entertaining 
 Covering all aspects of b-boy culture, this great documentary is a must have for all those who always loved b-boying. You may drop a tear or two at the end of it. Just for serious hip-hop cats. Just explendid 
 This book is great for working with in the field, very helpful with identification 
 I enjoyed this short mystery - the first featuring Anna Pigeon, park ranger/sleuth.  It's a classic whodunnit set in Guadalupe Mountains National Park.  Although I found the mystery predictable, Barr does have a better writing style than many mystery writers and the setting was original and interesting.  This series does appear to get even better as it proceeds - I'm liking the second Anna Pigeon book, A Death Superior, even better than Track of the Cat 
 I just finished Pawley's Island and now I've read all of MS. Franks books. I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed every single one of them. She's a wonderful writer and I especially love her sense of humor.  It's such a let down not having one of her books to read. I guess you can tell that I'm a great fan of her work. I can hardly wait for the next one to come out. It was a very good read.  Jane Templeman 
 This is the third time I've written this review, and I feel like Talese himself when he talks about working and reworking a piece and than maybe ends up throwing it away. I think that is part of the key to his book. A writers life is messy, demanding, and often, not fun; it relies on the writers passions, what interests him, and his inborn capacity to often not get it right, not convince or please the reader-he didn't please me in many of the diverse pieces in "A Writers Life"-but then again, sometimes it clicks, as some of the other pieces do. What Talese deserves a lot of credit for is showing, not telling, or talking about the writer at work (he says just a little about that). He makes it clear by not saying it that being a writer is something like being a monk; working with spirit, the spirit of what's motivating him to write and write about what ever. Some of the pieces he's included here were simply uninteresting to me, but the book's like a smorgasbord, full of variety; he made it long enough and worked hard enough at it for it to have that effect, so I skipped and skimmed when I wasn't interested in what he was interested in. Talese is a prose master; his style, old fashionedly enough, is discursive and inclusive at the same time. He's like a Henry James of non-fiction; unfortunately there's little of James that I have the patience and dedication to read and that's true of some of the pieces here, but I acknowledge that James is a master of fiction, and Talese is a master of non-fiction.  A short review of Talese's book in "The New Yorker" ended by saying that it didn't "cohere." I thought about that, agreed for a while, and then disagreed. Although I think it's true that "A Writers Life" often reads like a cut and paste job of a lot of things that Talese wrote but didn't end up getting in print-it took courage to include those, and he could have rested on the laurels of what he has published-my final impression, until I change my mind again, is that the book is a coherent portrait of an incoherent activity, a writer at work. When a writer has a book published, that work may masquerade as something that one knocked off  when the truth is it may have taken a decade or more to research write revise, maybe a number of times, and produce as is the case here. 
 Mark Joyner gets straight to the point.  He explains in plain language the exact steps you need to take sell your product or service.   He explains exactly what makes a business stand out above their competitors, and how you can do it too. I am sure I can make money using the ideas in this book 
 I can't believe what a strong emotional effect these Kelly Wearstler interior designs have on me--some I love, some give me the creeps, but they all have such wit and power that I find myself looking at this book again and again--and I'm a shabby chic  kind of gal. Of course it's disturbing that she features herself in so many of the photographs but I think she's a genius. Most design books have pictures of rooms are nice, or cozy, or calm. These are rooms are glamorous, smart, and sexy.  Since I bought this book I've seen Wearstler's influence spreading everywhere. I just wish I could afford her to decorate my house 
 My son is 6 years old and he loves this book.  The instructions are very clear, he has no difficulty in following them.  He has created dozens of pictures since buying the book and is quite happy to spend hours simply making pictures.  He gets a real sense of accomplishment from being able to create the pictures.  I highly recomend this book 
 Fast, fun & colorful poems about the ocean animals for the pre-school set. Very simple, so if your child knows a lot about marine animals you may want something more detailed 
 This is an important book in order to understand the Constitution and the response to 9/11.  The attacks on this book here are ridiculous.  Even liberal critics of the Bush administration and Yoo think this is an important book.  Cass Sunstein, a famous liberal law professor, wrote a review in the New Republic that said: "The most important theorist of the 9/11 Constitution is John Yoo."  He says "Yoo has offered an inventive and provocative set of arguments about fundamental questions, and he presents his arguments with unmistakable determination and all the skill of a good lawyer. 
 The entire book is clear, concise and very informative. It is BY FAR the best book that I've found on building an aviary and it's sooo easy to follow. The pictures and illustrations are top notch. 
 I recieved this book about a month ago and read it in on day. I just couldn't put it down. I LOVE behind the scenes things that they (now) show on DVD and this book was just great!  One thing I didn't realise when I bought it was the book was published in 1989. This doesn't really affect anything...except for when it talks about the book Scarlett which was in the process of being written at the time.   After reading this book it did give me a newfound respect for the book "Scarlett" (which, it is a good work...on it's OWN, but no comparison to "Gone with the Wind" and I think the author was not true to Scarlett) But after reading this book, I am no longer as "resentful" (for lack of a better word) towards that novel. I think the Mitchell estate did the right thing.  There were also so many interesting things...I had NO idea it took all that work and that they had THAT much trouble in making the movie.  All in all...A very good and interesting book well worth reading for any GWTW fan, be they a "Windy" or not 
 This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  It's about this guy and his friends who work for a computer company who, for all the obvious reasons in corporate America, hate their jobs, so they plot and plan this massive scheme to transfer the company's earnings into their own account.  Though produced in 1999, it's surprisingly not dated, as I just recently viewed it again. It is hilarious, with quotable lines that you remember for years to come.  I think people who are in an office environment can appreciate it the most, yet I don't work in one myself and still fully grok the humor.  I don't think the acting is particularly good, but the dialogue makes up for it.    There are some very funny sub-plots that add to the main one, like Jennifer Aniston's flair.  My favorite character is Milton, because he is so quirky and over-the-top funny.  And of course Lumberg, the boss everyone loves to hate!   
 I've read WORLDS IN COLLISION four times over the past thirty years, and I still think it the most important book I ever read.  More and more watching scientific programs on The Discovery Channel, The Learning Channel and PBS, I see and hear things which come straight from Velikosky, but never once is he given the credit 
 This was the first time I have ever bought books online and I am quite impressed with the quickness that the books came and also the super shape in which the books were in.  
 This book was given to me while I was leaving D.C. Feeling defeated and confused in how to handle my American clients, much like the feelings I have in London dealing with my teenage kids, I opened the book and surprisingly the book helped open my eyes.   Treating this dictionary more like a book on the history of Americas adopted language...Helped intrigued me more by illustrating clearly a comedy, a weakness, and a immaturity the states exhibit with brut force. The book didn't help solve my problem, but did give me a sense of enlightenment  and understanding on how to handle my American clients next time. Much like my teenagers, I will show them unconditional love, but I'll have to wait until they grow up to give them more responsibilities.  Nothing more appealing then the words "Oxford", "American", and "Slang" for the cover. For me, the title "Hatchet Jobs And Hardball" is awful and misleading. 
 I am a Financial Planner (CFP) and can recommend this book to everyone. The modern women should use this as guide line to life.

 There are on the Amazon site two excellent, informative reviews of the Pepys' diaries. They say far more than my own contribution.  I have read in and out of the Pepys' diary more than once. I did this in part because I have read many times that they are the ' best diaries' ever written. Without contending with that I found that they were not for me the most interesting. This probably shows more about my own shortcomings than it does about the work of Pepys.  Pepys' work is filled with description of the life of the time. It is rich in perception of the great city of London in Restoration times. It is filled with personal anecdote, gossip including that relating to his prodigious sexual appetite and activity. It is a busy, businesslike work. And it tells more about a world outside than a world in.  In the diaries I most love there is the quest of the soul to deeply understand itself and its relation to other people, and God. I find that the flurry of activity in the life of Pepys does not lead to this kind of reflectiveness. And thus for me the 'diary' is not a highly significant work personally.  
 I always give high ratings that challenge my beliefs. The book advocates bringing people into the community and then teaching them doctrinal beliefs. Getting a point-in-time decision is not as important as incorporating the non-believers into the church and slowly teaching them to live as a Christian and learn our language. A Faithful life is more important than a point-in-time questionable decision. Correct doctrine is important, but teachng them the whole truth as they grow in a Christian community is the better way to go. This book help me to think through the theology of outreach that a church should have. 
 If you want a better compilation, maybe buy the Metallogy-Box or just all of their records...By the way, to the insulting coment of: "Anywhere but a red state" - seems like your parents are brother and sister from somewhere behind the cowbarn of Yankee doodle redneck United States of A..holes. Long live the leather- Queens and especially the NERDS OF INDIA!! 
 I'm just now delving more in to the blues and this is an excellent cd. Great guitar, bass, throaty singing, blues personified. Excellent remastered sound as well. Get it 
 Excellent book for anyone considering the implementation of a computerized maintenance system. Not only stresses the need for a sound planning and scheduling process but actually provides the nuts and bolts of how to do  it. Its obvious the author, Doc Palmer has a handle of whats needed to be  successful as the manager of large maintenance force. I would really  recommend this book to anyone involved in the maintenance of a power  station 
 I was living in Rome during the spring of 2002.  Luciano Ligabue was all over the media.  He had directed a film (Da Zero A Dieci) and the song "Questa E' La Mia Vita" was its theme.  Thus, any time that a promo came on for the film you would hear the song.  At the time Liga's proliferation of Italian media was total and "Questa E' La Mia Vita" became the theme song of my stay in Italy.  Now it's become a song about my life as well because it was so central to my Italian experience.  A rocking, somewhat bittersweet song, it has a quality of reminiscence that will make you want to listen to it repeatedly.  He has actually captured through one song the perfect soundtrack for happily thinking back on your life.  As for the rest of the album, it's excellent.  "Tutti Vogliono Viaggiare In Prima" is another great track.  For fans of Liga this is a must, and it's also good starting point for those who want to check him out for the first time 
 Great fun book of    information not necessarily pertinant to our currnt lives but very educational and fun in any case.  
 No other writer I know of is more gifted at creating complete and consistent worlds - (complete with footnoted documentation, academic histories, philosophical disputes, secret societies etc) and then turning them inside out for us to view their architecture as a hall of mirrors. Borges plays skittles with ideas that most of us would labor our entire lives to get our heads around - if we were so inclined. The relationship between author and narrator in his first-person stories is beautifully crafted. This collection is a perfect introduction to this fantasic mind - and I only say "introduction" because you will want to read more 
 I encountered this text in my recent 20th Cent. Art course and found it extremely helpful. It's wonderfully readable and provides the student with lots of color illustrations to make late-night study sessions more  bearable. Its mass is threatening, but in relation to its subject matter it  successfully encompasses the most important aspects of modern art, and its  various components 
 This was a book I read years back. Over the years I've thought about this book and how it opened my eyes. I bought extra copies and handed them out to friends. Everyone I gave it too has enjoyed it greatly. It will teach the power within 
 I love Zorro and Guy Williams so any biography about him would be welcomed.  Ms. Lane's 500 plus pages is truly a dream come true.  It was a pleasure to read and it answered questions I have always had about his mysterious life in Argentina.  He was a good actor and a wonderful man who enjoyed life.  I am inspired by his life and those who were important to him such as his wife, children, Pat and his many friends.    I was pleasantly surprised to read that we share a love of reading, the stock market, wines, the Egyptian wing of New York's Metropolitan Museum (I've been to Egypt twice!) and even have similar foot problems!  Thank you Antoinette for writing such a complete biography.  It was wonderful to read.  I'd even buy a copy of what you left out!  
 This book is not one to spell it all out to you. There is such hidden humor in it you don't even see it, however there are some parts of the book that leave you speechless. You can't help but to relate to Marie and her family at different times of the book. I have read this book several times and love it more and more each time.  
 I bought this mouse because the color matched a graphic skin I put on my notebook computer and the price was within my ballpark.  (I ALWAYS pay attention to customer ratings, though, and others like it)  Have been extremely impressed with it since I installed it.  It IS, truly, plug in and go.  No driver software to lose track of.  The mouse action is as good as any I've used and it's comfortable enough.  Well worth buying 
 THIS A VERY GOOD BOOK. SHOWS HOW HARD WE ITALAIANS HAD IT IN THOSE DAY WHEN OUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS HAD TO COME OVER HERE. VERY GOOD ENDING 
 I heard the rest of this album, it did not really stay with me...  I've found that U-ziq has a few stellar tracks, and the rest just dont impress upon you.  I can think of one track on every release he has that I would definitely lodge in my top 50.  This release gets 5 stars from me because the track I am focusing on has a serious lasting quality for me.  Hasty boom alert was a very pleasant surprise to me, I dont play anything but this track.  It has a timeless quality, and it blends well when life can seem kind of hectic, or chaotic..    I guess, in short...  This track is somewhat of a lullaby.  I and a close friend revere this song, nothing short of religiously.  The appeal lies in the vibrant string sections...  the drumwork literally makes you think its immersed in water.  The cymbal crashes sound like a dive into a perfect blue sea.  Do not pass this song by, it is phenomenal.    heavenly. 
 Years and years after finishing his highly popular and adaptable "Tripod" trilogy, John Christopher caved into public yearning and added a single prequel to his three-part series.  Fans of the "Tripod" books are divided as to whether or not this was a good idea.  Some people claim that the three books are perfect in and of themselves and that this prequel was a bad idea poorly executed.  Others state that this is a well-written book that definitively clarifies how the tripods got a hold on the world in the way that they did.  And still others, like myself, think that the books are pretty silly to begin with, but they're fun reading and a prequel like this one isn't going to change what was already out there.  Nuff said. 	 In this book we meet our hero Laurie (who, I should tell you right now, is a boy) and his best friend Andy.  While participating in a wilderness trek, the two come across a startling scene.  It happens in the middle of the night as they camp out in an abandoned shed.  From over the horizon they spot a huge three legged machine, picking its way carefully along the landscape.  To their horror, the machine casually plucks up an escaping farmer, and destroys the man's house with a few well-aimed bashes.  In no time the army is called, and when attempts at a peaceful reconciliation are dropped, they destroy the tripod forthwith.  Laurie and Andy return home to their families and all seems to go back to normal.  Of course, there is that weird tv show that came out after the Tripod disaster called the Trippy show.  It's your usual fast-paced tripod-based entertainment with catchy music.  Laurie's half-sister is obsessed with it, and she's not alone.  Suddenly people all over the world are watching the show and becoming mindless pawns.  So when more tripods land on Earth once again, suddenly there are people everywhere waiting to greet them.  The world is in serious danger, and there's not much Laurie can do to stop the onslaught. 	 The book's kind of a zombie film put on paper.  At one point, people who've already been hypnotized by the program start wearing silver metal caps that prove their allegiance.  They also start "capping" their unwilling fellows, thereby taking away their free will and making them slaves of the Tripods.  In such a situation, your nearest and dearest could suddenly turn into your enemy without your ever knowing it.  Apart from the obvious zombie-like quality of the story (and Christopher is to be commended for his abilities at making a good child-friendly horror tale) the book also reminded me a bit of the first three movies in the Star Wars series.  You go into this book knowing full well that, in the end, the Tripods are going to win.  So how do you end it on a happy note?  Keeping this in mind, again John Christopher has adeptly given us a book that ends in a hopeful mind set.  It makes for a fascinating read. 	 My personal problem with the series has always been that there aren't much in the way of women in the books.  I was delighted for the first 25 pages of this tale to learn that the narrator of the book was named Laurie.... and then I found out that Laurie was a boy.  Doggone it.  The women that remain here are pretty annoying as well.  There's Martha, Laurie's grandmother who favors her granddaughter, henpecks her son, and is seen in a mostly negative light.  Ilse, Laurie's step-mother, is fine but vapid.  And Angela is seen as a spoiled little brat who only comes into her own when the family vacates their home.  It's funny, but at the end of the book Laurie makes a statement that girls are more likely to join his family's rebel resistance than boys and then promptly has his head almost bitten off by an angry Angela.  This is the only moment that Christopher clearly shows his sexist hand.  I looked at the motley crew of men and women who are left free at the end of the book and had to wonder where all the girls went in the future books.  After all, the free people living in the White Mountains in subsequent novels were all men.  Ugh. 	 Personally, I think this book is a much better read if you pick it up after the first three tales in the series.  Though it contains the same outdated views of women as its predecessors, "When the Tripods Came" is still a worthy addition to an already captivating series.   
 My children loved this book when we borrowed it from the library. They wanted to read this book for a whole week.  They could not get enough of it. The graphic and the story line kept them interested.  They are delighted by the flip pages and cut outs 
 This book was good for quick bio's about "real" pirates. My nephew was excited about learning the history of pirates and this book did not disapoint him 
 What can we say about the literary icon Sherlock Holmes that hasnt already been? Very little, so we therefore redirect our evaluations towards the unending line of dramatizations that even today are still being released. In my humble opinion, these are the best efforts, certainly in pure audio format, of these immortal tales ever to be produced. Merrison may at first bug you as he did me. We are used to a more booming authoritative Holmes. Merrison has a decidedly very small and nasally timbre to his voice. But his incredible acting abilities will quickly win you over. His absolute command of the situations and his sadly all too sparsely employed dry humor; make him as formidable a Holmes as any who have attempted the role. Contrast to Jeremy Brett's somewhat effeminate and decidely dark interpretation of the great detective, Merrison offers a much more genial and personable version, yet one that is no less impressionable than any of his predecessors.  But it's the late Michael Williams to me, however, who finally after 100 years of fruitless attempts by actors, displays a true understanding of the character of the narrator, John Watson, and in doing so, makes these productions such a resounding triumph. Watson is all too often seen as a boob, ala Nigel Bruce. Or when not, he is played as dry humorless tagalong. These stories, through Williams's depictions, offer us at last an interesting and complex Watson. As Doyle no doubt intended him to be. Clearly no match for his constant companion intellectually, but as the absolute invaluable assistant to Holmes. Gone are such ponderings as "Why would a genius keep company with such a fool?" Or "Why would such an interesting multi faceted eccentric, befriend a lifeless, vapid man of medicine?" As in all BBC productions, the supporting casts and sound effects, provide true listening enjoyment in the spirit of the golden age of radio 
          I am a sixth grader from Cornwall, New York. The book I read was Travel Team by Mike Lupica. Danny Walker is a kid who doesnt make the local travel team called the Middletown Vikings just because of his size. Dannys dad,Richie Walker,he led the vikings to win in the finals. Richie goes on to be a pro but stops because of a brutal car accident causing him to lose his marrige and not able to play anymore.          Dannys dad heard about how danny got cut from the basketball team so his dad made a team of people that didnt make the team. There team name was the Middletown Warriors. The warriors beat the vikings in the playoffs.If you are a sports fan you will love this book. The lesson you learn from this book is that you should never give up and work towards your goals. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sports. [... 
 I loved this book. It brought a whole new perspective on giving birth and the beauty of it. I gave birth at a big HMO Hospital and I felt that I was treated as a number basically. This book has taught me a lot and probably I will make different choices for my next baby 
 Dark Light is a surprising book.  Although not a professor of history,  Linda Simon is associate professor of English at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York, and it shows.  The book is well researched and very informative, but more importantly, it's very readable.  I have to admit it took me a while to figure where we were going in the enterprise.  At first the book seems like a biography of Edison.  This would hardly be surprising given the subtitle of the book:  Electricity and Anxiety from the Telegraph to the Xray.  Edison is almost Mr. Electronics himself.  The Wizard of Menlo Park, as he was known at the time, was responsible for major improvements in telegraphy, electric lighting, and phonographic sound, among other things.    The author's jump to Beard, one of Edison's brief partners, lost me a little.  This was mostly because I had never heard of the fellow.  Reading on in Simon's book, however, was very enlightening.  Apparently Beard had been instrumental in expanding US medical practice into the emotional sphere.  Rather less famous than the European experiment with it in Freud's work, Beard never the less brought the effects of stress in modern life into public focus with his articles and his own work in physiological cures with the use of electricity.  I had no idea the extensive use to which 19th century medicine had put what it referred to as "electrotherapy" in treating anxiety and depression.  Most of us know about electroshock therapy in this context, but Beard worked with electric "baths."  Simon's discussion of the man's financial interests in this therapy make it sound like the man practiced nothing less than charlatanry, but as many workers in the health care profession know, part of the treatment of any condition involves the patient's own belief in its effectiveness.  Furthermore, recent treatments for depression and anxiety have in fact turned to electroshock by "pacemaker" type electrodes placed into selected nerves.  Even obesity might one day be treated in this fashion.  Makes Beard seem positively psychic.  Speaking of which, the book also delves into the public interest in spiritualism at the time.  The subject is never without its proponents in any age, but apparently the 19th century was particularly concerned with the topic.  Simon notices the connection between the loss of so many family members by much of society during the Civil War and the introduction of new technologies based on unseen "forces" and "fields."  Placing the two in juxtaposition certainly makes the interest seem much more rational than it might.  It also explains why figures famous for their scientific contributions or for their scientific training might become involved in the movement in some way.  Alfred Russell Wallace, the naturalist who with Darwin was co-discoverer of the theory of evolution, was one such as was Arthur Conan Doyle, the author of Sherlock Holmes, who was trained in medicine.  Elisha Kent Kane, an arctic explorer and doctor, was involved with Margaret Fox, one of the women who started the movement in this country.  All in all Professor Simon's book is very intriguing and well worth reading.  It inspires the reader to look for other books on the 19th century and its culture.  What more can one ask from a book?  
 This is a treasure trove of goodies for XTC fans. Alternative versions, early demos, rejected singles and live tracks pepper this "odds and sods" collection. You can probably cherry pick your way to a really grade A single disc here but hey, as rabid XTC fans we must have EVERYTHING!  However, if you're new to XTC I would suggest one of the 'hits' compilations out there 
 I purchased this book after reading Kunstler's most recent book, The Long Emergency. I found the author had much to say though at times his stridency and passion may have clouded his message somewhat. But hey, if we are talking about the end of society as we have known it for the last one hundred years perhaps a little passion can't hurt. I was moved enough however, to purchase his earlier book (1994), The Geography of Nowhere.  In the ten years that Kunstler wrote Nowhere, things seem to have gotten even worse. Make no mistake about it folks. Kunstler passionately believes that the automobile is the root of all evil. Who can blame him? If anything our roads are more clogged then ever. Three car garages in McMansions on two-acre lots now seem to be the norm. Mega-mega-malls are becoming the norm rather than the exception. The Mall of America, in Minnesota, has parking for 12,000 cars!   Kunstler effectively makes the point that we can not go on like this. Our car-centered culture is sapping our collective strength, replacing our will to resist what we intuitively feel to be bad for us with a blind unthinking acceptance of mediocrity. In essence, we have moved from communities with soul and meaning to well, the geography of nowhere, where disconnectedness and distance between people and spaces are the norm rather than the exception. Nowhere addresses issues of the mind and heart. The Long Emergency addresses the economic and social impact of the decline of oil production on an energy-cheap fuel junkie society. Taken together, these two books stand as a stunning indictment of our culture.

 Ballistic missile defense is a strategic idea that simply will not die. Having been put to rest (or so we thought) by the 1972 ABM Treaty between the US and USSR, it continues to be disinterred every couple administrations. Ironically, the pattern that remains constant is that the US and the (now former) Soviet Union are never in synch on the merits of the deployment of such a system. Whenever top American administrator favor it, Soviet leaders oppose it--and vice versa. Only former Secretary of Defense McNamara's coercive campaign to convince the Soviet Union that the US would keep multiplying it strategic offensive force in the face of possible ABM deployment finally bullied the Soviets into accepting a treaty. My book catalogues the early chapters of this seemingly unending saga from the origins of ABM systems to the ABM accord. It highlights the early fascination of the Soviets of a system that they saw as merely protecting people countered by the American fear that such a system would threaten or erode our offensive deterrent capability. The tale continues through the Reagan and Clinton and the George W. Bush administrations, as a system that apparently cannot measure up to awesome technological demands looks for a rationale politically convincing enough to persuade enough Congressional legislators and American citizens to underwrite such a questionable (and potentially destabilizing) strategic program. In the end, the American pursuit of a defensive shield can perhaps best be explained as a neurotic quest for absolute security saved from oblivion by the emergent Age of Terror 
 This is no easy reading, and it is not for people totally without basic knowledge. Harrison, a great scholar who wrote in the 20s, won't tell you who Athena is- you should have a basic idea in order to enjoy the complex stories about her and all the Olympian deities! We didn't get the background told at school, only the stage when belief in the Gods was actually dead, preserved only as a cultural phenomenon. Harrison will tell you about the time when belief was ALIVE. If you want to know about the ceremonies, the secret rites, the hidden names, the shift of power from goddess to god... and in all this in a factual, reliable manner- then this is the book you should read 
 I have just started to write my reviews on this website.  I always read the other ones before I write my own.  I love how Catherine Coulter writes so differently from other historical romance writers.  Her books always have taboos and serious issues.  According to a lot of the reviews I read about Catherine Coulter on this website, alot of people are always putting her down for writing about things that actually did and do happen to women all over the world.  I don't enjoy reading romance novels that are sugar coated, so her books always make me rush to the book store to pick them up.  If things like domestic abuse and over bearing men offend some women, then quit reading historical romances.  Besides, it's only fiction anyway 
 Our two children (12 months and 23 months) just love this set.  The boards and pieces are very sturdy.  We like that the boards are two sided.  Good variety and amount of shapes.  This is a classic toy that will last for years- we see it as one that we will keep even after our children have grown out of it- great to keep around for visiting kids 
 THE long-awaited publication of the second volume of Martin Bernal's Black Athena also sees a reissue of the controversial first volume in paperback. Whatever the final verdict on its thesis of proto-Afroasiatic as the origin of later languages, it provides a brilliant reconstruction of the racist and anti-Semitic contest in which current assumptions about "the wonder that was Greece" took shape. Flaubert, De Tocqueville, Matthew Arnold and Thomas Hardy all make unexpected and discomfiting appearances.  Breaking the spell of that particular "myth of Hellas" that has held the European imagination in its grip for two centuries may be indispensable amid the challenges of the post-imperial age. Both exciting and accessible, Bernal has performed his task with great courage, ruffling the feathers of classicists, linguists and historians the world over.  
 Admittedly, it has been many years since I thoroughly read this book (almost twenty to be exact), but I will try to share some of my recollections with potential readers. The central premise and fundamental  focus is on the paradoxical fact that we humans are both free AND  determined. Not predestined, as Hillman weakly argues in THE SOUL'S CODE,  but determined by our inherent limitations, talents,  vulnerabilities,  circumstances, etc. These determining factors are what May terms  "destiny." Freedom--true autonomy, the liberty to choose, to  consciously decide how to relate to one's destiny--is to be found not in  the absence of psychobiological determinism or quasi-autonomous  "complexes," but in spite of them: "Freedom," says May,     "is thus not the opposite to determinism. Freedom is the  individual's capacity to know that he is the determined one, to pause  between stimulus and response and thus to throw his weight, however slight  it might be, on the side of one particular response among several possible  ones." Especially important is May's recognition of how chronic  repression of one's anger or rage--the daimonic--impairs one's freedom,  preventing this sometimes necessary and healthy response to authentic  encounters with destiny. As he puts it: "The concept of destiny makes  the experience of anger necessary. The kind of person who 'never gets  angry' is, we may be sure, the person who also never encounters destiny.  When one encounters destiny, one finds anger automatically rising in one,  but as strength. Passivity will not do. . . . Encountering one's destiny  requires strength, whether the encounter takes the form of embracing,  accepting, or attacking. Experiencing the emotional state of anger and  conceiving of destiny means that you are freed from regarding yourself as  too 'precious'; you are able to throw yourself into the game, whatever it  may be, without worrying about picayune details. . . . Constructive anger  is one way of encountering destiny." And all authentic creativity  arises from this deeply existential encounter. A seventy-year-old May  philosophically muses here on many other topics too, such as the vengeful  roots of narcissism, modern sexuality, meditation, mysticism, as well as  the relationships between freedom and anxiety and joy and despair. While  not as rich as LOVE AND WILL, or powerful as POWER AND INNOCENCE, FREEDOM  AND DESTINY is an important volume in May's valuable body of work, and can  be well recommended 
 "Gloomy fatalism" influenced by Schopenhauer is how critics described this novel when it was first published.  Thomas Hardy's (1840-1928) sixth novel is about doomed love and chance, and when it is measured against his masterpieces, TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES (1891) and JUDE THE OBSCURE (1895), THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE (1878) succeeds as one of the Victorian novelist's most powerful works. It tells the story of an idealistic and intellectual young man, Clym Yeobright, who abandons the ambitious goals set for him by his strong-minded mother, after becoming infatuated with a free-spirited, sensuous woman, Eustacia Vye, in a wild and lonely place. The plot unfolds on Hardy's "partly real and partly dream country," Egdon Heath, a dark Wessex moor associated with tragic possibilities. As Alexander Theroux observes in his Introduction to this edition of Hardy's novel, Hardy was committed to the deep expression of nature's ironic chaos and strange apathy, even hostility toward man (p. x), and in this respect, Egdon Heath could be described as a major protagonist in the novel.  It has been said that Hardy viewed life as something to put up with.    When Clym Yeobright (the "native") returns to Egdon Heath from his studies in Paris, he decides to reject his chosen profession and marry Eustacia Vye instead.  Eustacia is a darkly complicated young woman (and one of Hardy's most fascinating characters), who hopes to escape her dreary existence on the Heath for a more cosmopolitan life in Paris. (In a heart-wrenching subplot, Clym's passion for Eustacia leads to his estrangement from his mother, Mrs. Yeobright, who disapproves of the union.) Prior to Clym's return, Eustacia loved Damon Wildeve; that is, until he proposed marriage to Clym's cousin, Thomasin Yeobright. To further complicate things, Diggory Venn, a reddleman, secretly admires Thomasin. For his self-destructive characters, the course of love is never happy in in Hardy's cruel universe. "Black chaos comes," he writes, "and the fettered gods of the earth say, Let there be light" (p. 15).  Reading Victorian fiction does not get any better than reading Thomas Hardy. Returning to Hardy's brooding, melancholy novels after first reading them more than twenty five years ago, I am re-discovering Hardy's brilliant ability to convey familiar, primordial truths through his fiction, making him worth reading again and again.

 Even though this is an illustrated book, it's really more for adults than small children. The humor might escape wee ones, although they would enjoy the pictures, which are funny and well done in a simple style that's reminiscent of the illustrations in Shel Silverstein's books. I't s quick read, but definitely a good find. An fine choice as a coffee table book 
 When I was playing HS football, this movie hit the air waves.  It did so with such a powerful stir as well.    Guys crying at or watching a movie was never heard of, but for weeks afterwards, my teammates and other friends admitted to crying when we all discovered that "Pic" had cancer and especially when he was told after an operation that he still did.  This is the first of many James Caan great acts.  The week before the Superbowl this year one of the networks showcased the foundations for cancer run by the families of Brian Piccolo and Walter Peyton.  It was amazing seeing old news footage and videos of Brian with his wife.  Caan and Fabresze looked just like them.  The movie really broke a lot of ground. First, a white and a black player sharing hotel rooms on the road.  Even coach Hallas warned them that there may be trouble.  But these two, who vied for the same position, would become the best of friends.    Piccolo even ups the ante when Sayers gets injured working with him to get back to playing.  Brian tells him that since he was second team, he did not want to be first team if Sayers could not play.  He told him he was going to beat him at his best and they worked together to get Sayers back in playing shape.  Eventually, they both start in the backfield and they are elated.    Brian's illness comes on quickly, yet you feel the sadness and the suffering of all around him.    After the movie I found the book written by Gayle Sayers entitled; "I am Third."  The movie was based on Sayers autobiography.  For anyone interested in playing sports at any level, this book is a must and is related to the movie for sure.  The movie shows that the ultimate of teamwork is working together and sacrificing for one another.  Practing what you learn in Brian's Song will take your work life, family life and social life to a much higher level.  Enjoy this movie with your family and friends.  And really, it is okay for guys to cry, they will even brag about it 
 Like many of the other reviewers here have already stated, this is a book to be read by everyone!  I am not a reader of westerns but I loved this book.  After 800 pages I was never so sad to see a book end.  "Lonesome Dove" has a little of everything, drama, action, humor, and a few love stories to boot.  There are few books that have made me laugh or cry like this book did.  By the time your are done you will have new friends Woodrow, Pea Eye, Claire, Lorena, but especially Gus McCrea.  and you will also have some new villains particularly the frightening Blue Duck.  I can't recommend a book any more than this one 
 It was a great buy! Got the movie in great time, and there wasn't a thing wrong with it! =) Thanks 
 Firstly, most don't realize this is the essence of his message. All the instrumentals match his message that he's trying to convey, and that's why it's so dark, seedy, and full of grime. "Ghetto traps didn't trap me, I got out." from Money Greedy is a crystal clear answer to that times' Hip-Hop community and their "trapped in the ghetto" mentality. With that verse alone, he belittles 2Pac, Master P, and other artists that claim to that the system can't be broken. Despite the money they've made, they're still trapped in the ghetto? Sure, and Tricky got out when he makes a fraction of their record sales. Everyone goes on about how demented it sounds, and how it pushes you toward the brink of insanity. Well guess what? That's the point. This is the life he's gone through, what he's seen, and it's not pretty. Obviously enough, in contrast to his previous releases, he was waiting until he got someone's attention with more "acceptable" sounds, and naturally his true followers would be able to cut through the yellow tape and realize that there was a deeper message beneath everything. This is the album you should've been waiting for. And it came, went, and got blasted. Figures, but I wouldn't hesitate to pick this up if you want something new, urban, artistic, and a true centerpiece for the trip-hop underground. This album and it's themes transcend country to country, and speak true of the danger in running the streets, daytime or nighttime, always being a target, where paranoia doesn't exist, it's a way of life, and the cesspool that mixes cops, drugs, women, money and your roots. It's like this where I live, and I know it is in NY, and I wouldn't be surprised if you can feel this anywhere on the globe 
 I am very pleased with this product.  The Atelier wash is soft, absorbent and looks good after laundry.  I have always found the Martex brand to be top quality.  
 Actually, the oil is not to prevent the objective from scratching the slide, but instead to allow the slide to be viewed at that magnification at all. With that high a magnification the refraction will be very high, and a lot of light will escape before it ever gets to the eye (the light is going through glass, then air, then glass again, distorting its path greatly). The oil that is used for these microscopes has the same refractive index as the lens glass, and so light travels through it at the same speed and doesn't run off course 
 I would recommend this as a reference source and buying it. It contains very useful information in many areas, such as endocrine problems and yeast etc. I have a few reservations. It only dedicates 5 lines to toxicity and detoxification, which more or less tell you to buy someone else's book. For one of the major contributary factors of Chronic Fatigue in many people, this is not really acceptable. If you are going to write a book about CFS, you can't just leave out key factors. My other reservations about the book are that it tends to mention many rather severe treatments and pharmaceutical drugs where these should only really be used as a last resort if at all, as many natural equivalents are just as effective (e.g. candida control etc). Lastly, the book doesn't clearly differentiate enough between what the reader should do by themselves, and what they should leave to a specialist to really prescribe the right treatment for them. It reads like a list of supplements. Apart from that, it is quite good. A useful overview of CFS, including toxicity, can be found at health-spy dot com 
 If you are a Sam Raimi fan then you know that his old car is always featured somewhere in his movies.  This movie is great in every aspect but especially because if features "The Classic"( which is what Sam calls this car) in almost every scene.  This adds a touch of comic delight to a very tense and suspenceful movie.  This role is usually filled by Bruce Campbell but in lieu of his precense "The Classic" is a worthy stand in.  All kidding aside this is an excellent movie and well worth your time.  Keanu Reeves gives an excellent turn as a creepy wife beater.  Cate Blanchet is as always flawless.  Every role is excellently cast and acted with skill by all.  Sam's direction is always great and this is no exception.  
 This to date is my favourite FLA album for with the leaving of Fulber, Leeb & Peterson have orchestrated a turning of FLA from outright dark electronica to a more synth base techno style mixed with dark ambience and Leeb's almost robotic lyrics. A great masterpiece. There is still aspects of darkness in the sounds of many of these songs but it is not overwhelming or deeply inbedded like many other early FLA albums. This is more of a dance orientated album that many dance party DJ's have picked up on. The fist song 'Corruption' is beautiful, a great luminous opening followed by a change into ambient techno. But the best of the CD is best to come with two songs back to back, 'Columbian Necktie' and 'Evil Playground'. Wow is all I can say. The sounds of both songs are so different from each other but seems to mesh together so well. Leeb and Peterson are masters at this genre of music and 'Flava Of The Weak' is one of the best ambassadors for modern industrial music. 
 This book succeeds where so many other books have failed - Harris has written a scholarly book that's fun to read. What's really surprising is how little controversy this book has provoked so far.   A previous reviewer complained about Harris's style - well there's no accounting for taste, and Harris's method of leading the reader from one topic to the next in a logical sequence is part of what makes the book so good. The chapter on cow worship leads into a chapter on cultures that consider pigs disgusting - and others that treat pigs like beloved pets.  What must surely be the most controversial aspect of the book begins when Harris compares the cargo cults of New Guinea to Christianity:  --- excerpt ---  I'm sure that you've noticed the resemblance between cargo cults and early Christian beliefs. Jesus of Nazareth predicted the downfall of the wicked, justice for the poor, the end of misery and suffering, reunion with the dead, and a whole new divine kingdom. So did (cargo cult leader) Yali. Can the phantom cargo mystery help us to understand the conditions responsible for the origin of our own religous lifestyles?  -- end of excerpt --  He then goes on to point out, in the chapter called "The Secret of the Prince of Peace" that in spite of later Christian revisionism, Jesus was not actually a prophet of peace but a messianic warrior:  -- excerpt ---  The lifestyle consciousness shared by Jesus and his inner circle of disciples was not the lifestyle consciousness of a peaceful messiah. Although the gospels clearly intend to deny Jesus the capacity to carry out violent political acts, they preserve what seems to be an undercurrent of contradictory events and sayings which link John the Baptist and Jesus to the military-messianic tradition and implicate them in the guerrilla warfare. The reason for this is that by the time the first gospel was written, nonpeaceful events and sayings which had been attributed to Jesus by eyewitnesses and by unimpeachable apostolic sources were widely known among the faithful. The writers of the gospels shifted the balance of the Jesus cult's lifestyle consciousness in the direction of a peaceful messiah, but they could not entirely expunge the traces of continuity with the military-messianic tradition. The ambiguity of the gospels in this regard is best demonstrated by arranging some of Jesus' most peaceful statements in one column and the unexpected negations in another:  Blessed are the peacemakers. (Matthew 5:9)  Think not that I am come to send peace on earth, I come not to send peace but a sword (Matthew 10:34)  Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. (Matthew 5:39)  Suppose ye that I come to give peace on earth? I will tell you nay, but rather division. (Luke 12:51)  All that take the sword shall perish with the sword (Matthew 26:52)  He that hath no sword, let him sell his garments and buy one. (Luke 22:36)  Love thine enemies; do good to them that hate you. (Luke 6:27)  And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them out of the temple... and poured out the changer's money and overthrew the tables. (John 2:15)  I should also note at this point the obviously false construction traditionally given to what Jesus said when he was asked if Jews ought to pay taxes to the Romans: "Render unto Caeser that which is Caesar's and unto God that which is God's." This could mean only one thing to the Galileans who had participated in Judas of Galilee's tax revolt - namely, "Don't pay." For Judas of Galilee had said that everything in Palestine belonged to God. But the authors of the Gospels and their readers probably knew nothing about Judas of Galilee, so they preserved Jesus' highly provocative response on the mistaken assumption that it showed a genuinely concilliatory attitude toward the Roman government.  --- end of excerpt ---  Harris doesn't mention it, but his view of human culture is based on his anthropological paradigm known as cultural materialism. Those who read and like this book and want to learn more about the basis of Harris's views should check out his book "Cultural Materialism: The Struggle for a Science of Culture." 
 Sun.Moon.Stars. That's all you need to know. Best song I have heard yet this year - In fact put that on any mix you make and everyone you know (even your Aunt) will want to know who it is - it truely is that party vibe that our music has lost.  The 808 Baseline in Undeniable is freakin awesome. Murder of a teenage life is as good of a story you'll likely hear all year. I got this cd with no media whatsoever. Everyone on here thinks that's a bad thing. It's MosDef, let the music speak for itself.   Brilliant!  wer 
 I started reading this book when my newborn was about 2 weeks old and I only wish I had read it before she was born because as soon as I started implementing the techniques that Dr. Karp suggests for calming babies, I found I was able to comfort my crying baby almost instantly.  I plan to purchase this book for every expectant mom I know - its that good, and honestly, it may be the best gift any parent could receive!  As a first time mom with next to no experience handling babies, I felt anxious and uncertain whenever I heard my baby cry the first couple of weeks.  Those feelings were just compounded by sleep deprivation - I remember one night feeling desperately frustrated when, after feeding her, I still could not get her to stop crying and fall back asleep.  Dr. Karp's book helped me to better understand why my baby cried when she was not hungry or wearing a wet/soiled diaper, and more importantly, how I could effectively comfort her so she could stop crying and we both could get some sleep.  Now, at eight weeks, she typically sleeps for stretches of six to 7 hours at night (one night it was 8!) and when she wakes, she is smiling and appears well rested.    New parents: if you buy ANY baby book, get this one - you will not regret it!  
 Story about a group of American soldiers charged with the responsibility of guarding a castle overlooking an important crossroad. Must read for people who appreciate the Catch22 type humour 
 This book provides an excellent framework for thinking about murderous thoughts and deeds.  A readiness to have murderous intentions may well be part of our human natures, rather than a sign of mental illness, antisocial attitudes, or evil.  The more we understand about our behavioral adaptations (prepared behavioral responses shaped by evolutionary forces), the more we can recognize them when they arise, stop and think, and choose among various alternative behaviors.  In my work as a forensic psychologist, I rely on evolutionary theory as one framework for understanding humans generally, and for appreciating differences among humans.  Buss's work is useful for scientists and practitioners, and is accessible for ordinary folk as well.    Reading this book can help one think like a scientist 
 After reading a ton of reviews, I decided to buy this dvd presentation of my favorite opera.  The sound is much more immediate than the Levine/Nilsson recording (thankfully).\  The orchestra plays this score so well.  I enjoyed it as much as Abbado/Marton.  Rysaneks singing is better than Marton. The singers vary from ok (Varnay-a noticeable wobble) to near great (Rysanek-what an amazing high register).  At times, she goes high on some of the pitches.  The staging and acting were excellent, even knowing it was lip synced. The only irritating thing was the number of screen shots of the actor that played Agamemnon. In all, this is well worth the money.  In high quality stereo sound and performance. The extra dvd was quite interesting too 
 I saw this at the movies at the time....did not care for ashley judd at all until I saw this and I became an admirer of her and how she was so sweet to simon in the film,however,the friendship,the tragedy,the hillarious parts in the film all played so well,now,it takes a lot for me to cry but after this film let out,my fiance at the time,was trying to console me all the way home after seeing this,I cried my eyes out,but in a good way....a definite must see...just make sure a loved one is nearby to pass the tissues,or water,or a hug....enjoy! 
 It was an exciting book because I learned about volcanos and Mexic 
 I own the Szell recordings which finally convinced me that Schumann's symphonies were worth getting to know (Kubelik's readings on Sony just didn't do a thing for me), but listening to Bernstein's Schumann was like hearing an entirely different composer. I agree with another reviewer who wrote about his response to the Adagio in Symphony #2. Although I didn't have tears rolling down my face, it certainly grabbed me and wouldn't let go (Szell clocks-in at a little over 11 minutes; Bernstein over 13 - but its not overt indulgence like his Tchaikovsky 6th). It was like listening to Lenny's Concertgebouw Mahler 9th. It is wrenching. I wouldn't ever let go of Szell or Bernstein - both have much to say about this often maligned composer of symhonies 
 Professor Lewis R. Gordon (Temple University) has outdone himself in this groundbreaking introduction to Africana existential thought! In addition to a breakthrough in Africana studies, Fanonian and DuBoisian students and  scholars alike will appreciate the fruit of Gordon's labor. I would highly  recommend anything written by Gordon; his style and method are very  endearing to the reader 
 I dove into this book and devoured it with ravenous pleasure.  I loved it all the way up to the last chapter "The Final Exam," when the whimsical insanity and humour which had defined the book thus far deflated and was replaced with an ending which left me scratching my head and muttering "what the hell?"  Perhaps this was Kidd's purpose.  I know one thing is for certain, this book presented me with images that I had "never before seen, and will never be able to forget. 
 If you're not moved by this performance, stick to listening to 'Lady In Red', thinking it is the best song Chris De Burgh ever wrote. A lot of my favorites are not performed ('Moonlight And Vodka', 'Crusader', 'Carry On', etc.), but then an artist like Chris De Burgh cannot possibly sing all his best songs spanning over 30 years of songwriting 
 Streetcore is an album and a musical genre in the sense that it is an idea you think when you make music. According to Joe Strummer, "Streetcore is a distillation of all the most extreme psycadelic music, showing lenghty knowledge of reggae, dub, funk, blues, jazz, folk, hip hop." This album is amazing, and I guarantee that if you pop this into your CD player, sit down and listen to the entire album straight through, you will feel better. At the end of the last song, you will feel this certain aware calmness. You will feel at peace. For whom music is an anti drug, Streetcore is a clear moment, and for those whom music is an irresistable drug, Streetcore is a pillowcase full, an expression of rythm and color and every single emotion in one moment. Streetcore is a murmur from a departed friend. Fortunately, once put into a CD player, that murmur becomes more. Thank you, Joe, and thank you, Mescaleros, because you guys don't get nearly enough praise as you brilliant musicians deserve. Peace be with you 
 Even though I rate this collection at 4 stars, I actually think it could have been much better. The reasons for this I'll return to below. This collection is a bit odd - 2 discs, one consisting of B-sides, and one with a live recording - two nice features for the fans, but unfortunately neither of them complete, which makes them not as valuable for the fans as they could have been.   Disc 1 - The B-sides  This lot is naturally quite a mixed group, as is only natural. Severa, reviewers have already commented on the natural and unavoidable problem with B-side tracks - being album leftovers, they will often be of lower quality than the album cuts. That's true sometimes, but not always, and this collection contains some really great tracks - as well as some not-so-great tracks.  'Shine Acoustic', , 'Map Of Your Head', 'Shrinking Universe', and 'Recess' are all of a quality that would easily allow them for inclusion on album without falling short - in fact 'Recess' is much better than many of the tracks included on the 'Showbiz' CD, and 'Shine Acoustic' might be in my top 5 of favourite MUSE tracks EVER. The latter is a ballad of amazing beauty, the slow sound of rain falling leads into an almost ethereal song, and Matt Bellamy is doing a vocal that shows him to be way beyond any other vocalist presently in rock music, bar none. In contrast, the almost merry 'Map Of Your Head' is quite irresistable, the jingling - medieval, some have described it as - sound standing quite off the usual MUSE sound - without really sounding out-of-place, because with MUSE you never really know what you get. 'Shrinking Universe' and 'Recess' are honest rockers, the latter with a beautiful piano drive very much remeniscent of 'Sunburn' from 'Showbiz'.  'Nature_1' is another track that deserves mention. It's something as rare as an uptempo acoustic song, with the acoustic guitar as the primary instrument. 'The Gallery' is an instrumental track, not the most interesting they've done, but not bad. On the more weird side, 'Forced In' seems to be drifting along somewhere in outer space, interesting certainly, but very odd. Interesting is also 'Hyper Chondriac Music', a scaled down version of album track 'Hyper Music' - forget all about a rushing pace and mind-blowing noisy guitars - oh, the roaring guitars are there still, but where the album version seemed almost primitive, at least if you didn't listen to the lyrics, this version is anything but primitive - omnious, threatening and nearly grotesque at times, yes, but with grandeur and beauty to follow. Very interesting indeed.  Less fortunate are the results on 'Ashamed' and 'Yes Please' - both are honest rockers, but without very much to offer besides that. Especially 'Yes Please' is way to heavy and primitive to my taste - fans who appreciate the more noisy side of MUSE, however, will probably be delighted in these tracks.  On the bottom-line I will add, that the B-side CD should not be considered as an album, but as a compilation. This one has much to offer the fans, but is not the place for newbies to come.  Most annoying is the fact that the collection is so incomplete. The CD runs for only 40 minutes, so there's some 30 minutes to follow, and loads of B-side tracks have been left off, especially from the Showbiz period. The band might have considered them below standards, but die-hard fans will now have to pay big money to find all the old singles to evaluate for themselves. Also, a double single set was released along with this collection - the Dead Star / In Your World singles, that features the two A-side tracks, and two B-sides, Futurism and the killer cover of 'Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You', that is now legendary among MUSE fans! None of these four tracks are available (in studio versions) besides on these singles, so it seems odd that none of them are on this CD. That's a huge minus for this CD.  Overall rating for CD 1: 6 out of 10.   Disc 2 - Live From Paris  What needs to be said about this recording can be done fairly quickly: MUSE a fabulous live! Matt Bellamy easily proves that his amazing vocal is not only a studio-produced phenomenon. The songs are delivered in a more heavy mich here, which will appeal to some fans and not to others. Certainly I'm not too keen on the very aggressive side of MUSE, but the takes on tracks like 'Citizen Erased', 'Showbiz', 'Megalomania' and 'Muscle Museum' are top rate. Some of the tracks included does not range among my favorites - the nearly absurd 'Micro Cuts' and 'Agitated' among them - but that aside, there's not a spot to put on this recording.  The downside is that this CD only features a selection of the songs recorded on the two nights, october 28 and 29. Apparantly unknown to some fans in the US, a double DVD was released with these CDs; one DVD with a full-length concert recording, and the other with a documentary. Oddly enough, 'Dark Shines' which is on the CD is NOT on the DVD, but what the explanation for this is escapes me. Still, it would seem more natural to release either a complete B-side collection, or a complete live double-CD. As it is now, this double CD collection offers neither fully.  Overall rating for CD 2: 8 out of 10.   OVERALL RATING BOTH CDs: 7 out of 10. Good but not essential 
 Life seems perfect for young boy Sora (voiced by Haley Joel Osmont) with his buddies Kairi and Riku on his island but when a freak storm mysteriously takes them away things go out of hand. The same weird thing has happened in the imaginary disney kingdom where King Mickey Mouse has mysteriously vanished without a trace with only Donald and Goofy on a mission to find him,  Along the way they meet Sora and team up with him to travel to different worlds based on each disney movie like "Aladdin", "Little Mermaid", "Hercules", "Tarzan", "Beauty and The Beast", "The Nightmare Before Christmas" and more as they battle the evil heartless and such bad guys like Ursula, Jafar, Hades, and more.  One of the most ingenius and unique video games i've ever played! successfully combines disney with Final Fantasy to create one incredible game that will blow your mind. Fans of both Disney and FF will rejoice as this game puts together both things, the graphics are spectacular especially the music score. The controlling is good once you get use to it and you'll hear the voices of Billy Zane, James Woods, Tony Goldwyn, Sean Astin, Jodie Benson, Robbie Benson, Chris Surandon, and Gilbert Godfried here, this is one hell of a game you must have if you love RPG and disney with FF alike.  Get it today including it's even better sequel 
 Title: The Broken Blade Author: William Durbin Pages: 163   "The Broken Blade" is an excellent book based on adventure, courage, and hope. This page turner is about a teenage boy named Pierre who sets out on a treacherous journey and returns a man. Pierre's father has an accident with an ax and chops off his thumb. Without his laziness, Pierre would have had HIS thumb missing. So Pierre has to force himself to live the life of a voyager to raise money for his family. During his trip he meets Indians, bears, death, and suicidal rapids. But overall he met great friends and an inner strength he never knew he had. This book tells of amazing faith and survival, you will never want to put it down! I certainly loved this book and I'm positive you will too.  
 I have been searching for  books on  Professional Innkeeping and  related  Hospitality  Management.  This book is one for the  collection 
 This book should be required reading for anyone involved with EAI, especially integration architects.  For those of you who may not have heard about ESB, it is a rather new approach to structuring a SOA (service-oriented architecture), using a distributed MOM infrastructure, XML messages, intelligent message routing, automatic transformation of messages, and centralized administration. The SOA approach to EAI solutions is compelling, but it is still too early in the game to tell if ESB will take the world by storm. It has a lot of promise, and many EAI vendors are jumping onto the bandwagon that Sonic, including Dave Chappell, helped to build.  The book offers the first comprehensive definition of an ESB that I have seen, almost entirely stripped bare of vendor-specific information and sales info. I say almost, for some issues (such as app-servers vs. ESB service containers) are presented in a less vendor neutral fashion than I would like. Overall, the book stays high on useful content, and low on vendor product positioning.  The books combines nicely described technical descriptions of ESB features with some high-level case studies culled from Dave's experiences in industry, or based on interviews with IT leaders that he conducted while researching the book.  The technical descriptions avoid becoming too detailed, but are sufficient to capture the essential issues encountered in integration. The book's diagrams, resembling Gregor-grams, are very useful, although I was a bit mystified to find a reference card for the glyphs used, tucked away in the back of the book. The diagrams are self-explanatory, IMHO.  The case studies are similarly abstract, avoiding introducing a level of detail that would cause the forest to be lost amongst the trees. At times I wished to a little more detail here, but I suspect I'm something of a glutton for punishment that way.  ESB is threatening to become something of a buzz word these days, what with IBM weighing into the ESB market. This book should help secure a rational, useful definition of Enterprise Service Bus before the marketing machines of the various integration vendors obliterate it in a storm of white papers and glossy brochures 
 I opened the first chapter and wow! a science fiction time travel that asked for my attention every minute until it finished. It was opened directly to the sensation after drinking the experiment drug which can bring you back into the long forgotten past. The past I am talking here was not in the time span of the narrator, but outreached 600 years, digging from the DNA memory of his ancestors which built his now. The theory of survival. This is not some Einsten Relativity story, where mind and body could be transferred along the time dimension, but it was only a loop of mind travel in which could do nothing to alter the past.  The writing style is the trademark of Du Maurier, with clues, subtleties and irony turn of events whose importance sometimes escape from the first time reading although the sentences themselves are effective but still have the literary beauty. She dared to explore the possibilities and left no stone unturned. The selection of past time itself can raise a debate to whether it was a pure past or already meddled with personal infliction. However, the introduction chapter (warning: read this AFTER you finished the book) by other famous author gave some light to the background circumstances.  The ending is quite open to give the reader freedom of thought, to imagine the meaning of it, whether it was all over, in the real meaning, of both worlds or just for one, or better yet, if an 'alter' ego gone, will the other follow ... or was it 'alter' ego anyway 
 I bought this album eight years ago in college and it quickly became one of my favorite albums of all time. Even now, having listened to it hundreds of times, it's still able to evoke the same emotions in me it did when I was a tender 19 years old. I'm just amazed at how good Pinkerton is. This is an album that stands the test of time, and really is exponentially better than any of the other Weezer albums.  
 Great for law students taking an estate planning course or an estate and gift tax course.  Also good for people wanting to learn about estate planning in general.  I would recommend this book 
 Just as I expected!!! Hard to find even in stationary or kitchen product stores. Delivered quickly with no complications 
 there is not much information out there on bamboos and this book fills the gap.  It's a must buy for the biologist in the grass world.  Lots of excellent pictures of the plants and good text to go with it.  Well  written 
 First off, I like the price.  I had been wanting to buy Kinison dvd'd for some time to add to my collection, but the price tag for the box set or individual dvd's were too high for my liking.  Then this set comes along, collecting "Breaking the Rules" and "Family Entertainment Hour," along with the special extras that came along in the COmplete Sam KInison box set that collected these two titles, but this set also includes the new release "Outlaws of Comedy." All of this for the same price of just one of the single dvd releases.  The only thing that I feel is missing is "Sam Kinison: Banned," what would have been his second HBO special, but HBO decided that it was too over the top for them to release on the air.  This is the special that oincluded Sam's "Wild Thing" video, as well as a couple of his other music videos.  Hopefully, this may be on the horizon.  If you want to add Sam to your collection, this set is the right buy for you.  I was not disappointed, though the sound quality on "Outlaws" is kind of lacking, it was clear that it was not taped professionally, but this does not deter one from enjoying Sam's unique comedy.  Highly recommended! 
 There are some truly excellent ideas in this book...in the end it is worth the effort.  Still, Professor Bobbit's lack of self discipline in writing this behemoth did make me knock a star off the rating.  He does construct a solid and original model for viewing the history of the state, and I feel profitably applies it to the current turmoil of the day.  The book gets more speculative at the end, but the author is the first to say when he is launching into conjecture.  Reading these parts is not without value, but given the sheer size of this volume they should have been cut as an act of mercy.  In spite of this, the historical content is well researched and the ideas here are exciting.  Bobbit soberly and insightfully shows us how the state has evolved, and sheds light on how it is changing today.  Since the extravagant length of the book seems to be turning people away from a piece that should be read, however, let me say two things.  First, The Shield of Achilles is broken down into two major sections.  I read one, put it down for a few months, and came back.  That way I was not at any point overwhelmed.  Book I stands on its own without a problem, book II less so.  Two, with such an extended indoctrination into Professor Bobbit's way of thinking, you do walk away having a real handle on his ideas.  It is a bit like swallowing the idea whole, or perhaps vice versa.  Gird your whatever, develop a plan of attack, and read the book.  There's real gold in there, you just have to dig. 
  I ended up buying this camera (even though I heard bad things about Kodak) because I liked the feel of it in my hand.  I don't like small thin cameras.  And it is somewhere between a point and shoot and and SLR.  Since I can't afford an SLR I went this. I have to say I love the camera.  I have already shot enough pics and printed them on my printer and they came out great.  I love all of the features.  It reminds me of my 35mm SLR that I still own and use from time to time.  I don't find any lag in taking the pictures.  However, if you are on auto shoot, it needs to focus first before you take the shot.  But my 35mm SLR did the same thing.  I thinkg the shutter is just fine.  I would reccommend this camera to someone who needs to upgrade from a point and shoot.  After reading the reviews, I am seriously thinking about getting an extended warranty for it.  Escpecially since my last camera crapped out on me 1 1/2 years later.   The only thing I seem to have a problem with is my fingers like to hit the control buttons on the right side of the camera while I am trying to take a picture.  It could be that I am a lefty and all of the controls are on the right side. But for the price, you can't go wrong. 
 Crack gives you the straight poop. Advice on how to act in your interview, how to answer questions, stat questions, logic puzzles, basic market questions, derivative valuation questions, and even some soft ball qualitative questions. Brilliant, and one of a kind 
 In a career full of vastly dissimilar masterpieces, Small Change is one of those handful of Waits albums that markedly stands out from the rest.  This is only Waits' fourth album, continuing his evolution into ravaged-voiced, drunken nighhawk beat poet that came into fruition on his previous record, Nighthawks at the Diner.  But this time around, Waits merges this persona with a set of truly moving, melodically rich and diverse tunes.  On the albums immediately following this one (Foreign Affairs in particular), Waits' character was beginning to show signs of stagnation, empty role playing.  But in 1975, on this record, none of these signs of wear come through.  What's left is a completely unique and compelling atmosphere, with excellent songs to compliment.  'Tom Traubert's Blues' is arguably the greatest thing here, one of Waits' most recognizable songs and one of his most moving lyrics, not to mention the phenomenal melody.  Elsewhere, all the sides of early Waits have a spot, from hilarious beat-rap poet, desolate drunken piano balladeer, sinister storyteller; all of them have a place here, and arguably are at their pinnacle.    If you have an interest in early Waits, Small Change or the more accessible, gorgeous 'Closing Time' are the places to start.  In the 1970's, Waits was also a major innovator within the rock and roll genre (as he more famously was in the 1980's), but efforts such as this go slightly un-noticed due to the more familiar efforts such as 'Rain Dogs'.  Small Change deserves a listen from anyone who digs Tom Waits.  
  The book came quickly and in great condition.  Would use this seller again 
 Delivery was quick and I love the album!  Great service is always provided by Amazon.com 
 I run two websites using this program, easy learning curve, I recommend it to all my newbie friends that need a simple, workable program. Ignore the crittics, this is a nice program.Only wish in batch editing I could do multiple web page saves. 
 This is really a good book, but not long enough. Fortunately the pictures add  to the time you can spend with your youngster reading the book. It is a good story line 
 Some of this book is abhorrent.  So why do I give it five stars? Because the stuff that is worthwhile is fantastic.  So I sighed at the silly stuff and let the rest help improve my life 
 This is the first review I have done but I thought this book was excellent and it sure came in handy for me when I needed to prepare a resume over a weekend. I picked up `Surviving the 15-Second Resume Read' at my local library along with `Resumes for Dummies'. I looked at `Surviving' first and was glad I did. The author gives very thorough and specific instructions on how to prepare an effective and great looking resume. There are plenty of before and after examples with explanations of why changes were made. She even gets into the details of font selection, font size, and how to set up `styles' in Microsoft Word to make it easier if you have to make changes later. She mentions things you should and should not include in a resume. It's not uncommon to see things in resumes that the author says you should not include (like an Objective). After seeing some of the resume examples in `Surviving', the ones in other books don't look near as good. You can't go wrong with this book. If you only get one book on writing resumes, pick up `Surviving the 15-second Resume Read' 
 This is one of the best books I have read in the industry and I own MANY . It is direct straight to the point  and informative . I highly recommen 
 This book contains all you ever wanted to know about social anxiety, and is sure to help you understand the condition. However, I would have preferred more focus on solutions rather than so much reaching (about 300 pages). I might suggest starting with a shorter book or course (I used the program at mc2method.com which was great), and then reinforce your efforts by following up with this book. Good luck! 
 This cd is alright.  It is too short to be a shania twain cd.  It has some good songs like: What made you say that?, and God ain't gonna get you for that 
 Going After Cacciato contains many elements of reality from the Vietnam War, in which the characters are set in this environment filled with death, loneliness, and war. O'Brien portrays this journey through forms of elaborate use of description in this novel. He describes the jungle setting and many other details of this mission so in detail that the reader is visualizing themselves pushing through the overgrowth in search of this so-called man, Cacciato. The novel Going After Cacciato portrays the division of the reality of war and the fantasy state of mind of the soldiers and is a good adventure through the cruelty and reality of war 
 From a die-hard Moby Grape fan - this is one excellent blues album.  Jerry's guitar work is world class.  Have seen him live in Seattle area a number of times and he never fails to disappoint.  An excellent addition to  any blues collection 
 From the opening minute until the closing segment of this audio book is one that will keep your interest. The author writes a story that makes you feel like he was really there observing the entire adventure. Richard Thomas who is the narrator adds great depth to the story by his wonderful reading voice. In addition, this story is a great way to learn a little history of the Civil War time period while enjoying the audio book. 
 I decided it was time to have some decent cookware.  I had a Circulon wok, and I loved the high/low nonstick, so I decided to go with Circulon.  So far I'm very satisfied.  I've been using the set for two weeks now, and it is easy to clean, very non-stick, and works great.  I love the glass lids on the pots and the silicone handles help with grip.  I'm no gourmet cook, but the set seems great to me.  A great value (I bought it for $99 plus shipping)!!!  Easily the best non-stick cookware I've owned.  
 As my title states this is a nust buy. Enjoy it slowly, one story ay a time. You will not be sorry. Consider purchasing the two collections of his novels also from Everyman's Library 
 Key Words: Health, Digestion, GI, HSO, Food, Nutrition, Digestive Disorders  "Restoring Your Digestive Health - How the Guts and Glory Program Can Transform Your Life" by Jordan S.Rubin and Joseph Brasco is a good resource book for all sufferers of digestive disorders. In a very detailed and fairly simple, easy-to-understand style, the authors, a naturopathic doctor who was an ex-patient and a Board-Certified Gastroenterologist, explain the reasons for poor digestion and the resultant problems.  The book deals with a variety of GI problems such as IBS, Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, Dyspepsia, Candidiasis etc., and the role of intestinal flora in optimal maintenance of health. The authors offer a number of useful suggestions and very specific dietary protocols for each problem.  The experience of Jordan S. Rubin who was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease - a very serious 'incurable' disease and who tried a number of doctors and treatments adds credibility to the book. The critical role played by various foods in maintenace of intestinal flora, i.e. the various bacteria which help in optimal food digestion and absorption is brought out well. The authors explain how HSOs (Homeostatic Soil Organsims) play a major role in improving and nurturing the intestinal environment. The treatment regimen given in the book is based mostly on what worked for Rubin, modified over years by the combined wisdom of Rubin and Brasco who claim to have helped thousands of sufferers over the past few years.  The book is specifically aimed at the US and Canadian readers, but the general principles are applicable to all. Thus for understanding the types and causes of various stomach ailments, this book will be found useful for all English speaking readers. I found it very interesting and useful to understand the general principles of good GI health.  The book would have better value if suitable illustrations accompanied the detailed explanations about the role of various organs in Alimentary Canal or GI tract as it is called. The dietary program given will not be appropriate to people with different religious beliefs. Thus all non-vegetarians will not be able to accept pork or beef etc. And the program is certainly not suitable for vegetarians, though some of the insights will help lacto-vegetarians too.  The opinions expressed by the authors about the other testing and treatment options may not be acceptable to all readers, esp. those who benefited from them in earlier instances. The opinions do come across as rather subjective and self-serving at places. In my opinion, that chapter could have been written better by the authors.  The book would also have benefited from better editing and proof-reading. Chapter 10, 'Protocols' could have been shorter since mostly same matter is repeated under each condition. Alternatively, that chapter could have been bound in tear-off sheet style, so that sufferers can tear out specific sections for day-to-day reference or may be paste to their refrigerator / kitchen cabinet. Typographic errors and style errors are present, which however, do not prevent our understanding and appreciation of the subject.  These minor shortcomings not withstanding, I strongly recommend this book to those who need to better understand the Digestive Disorders in themselves or their relatives and friends etc. A good buy.    
 Denise Tyler and Audre Vysniauskas' PRACTICAL POSER 6  comes from an avid Poser user and author of several other books on the subject, and provides advanced Poser users with the latest set of options for the program. An introductory overview and review opens chapters which quickly move to more advanced features of working with interfaces and building scenes with the Poser library. Black and white screen shots offer plenty of applied examples while a centerfold of color polishes results 
 I gave this adorable book to my dad for Christmas (and it's mate 41 Uses for a Gradma to my mom) and he thought it was the best thing.  The colorful, sweet artwork and precious wording makes this book a perfect gift for that great grandpa in your life.  My kids enjoyed reading all of the "uses" for grandpa as well.  I highly recommend this item 
 I receive my item quickly and its a high quality item that works great. 
 The text is the classic Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem, and the paintings give it new life for the visually-oriented kids of today. This book will help them visualize what the poem is talking about, which becomes more important as time passes and kids are less accustomed to reading the words of older poems. If you want kids to really appreciate this famous poem, this book should help them connect with it 
 I'll be as upfront as this documentary filmmaker was in his story telling: I'm a survivor of eleven years of sexual abuse at the hands of my father. My 3 siblings also were abused as were other children. How do I know? Besides them telling me, I often witnessed the incidents. Not all serio-peodophiles are the stuff of witch-hunt hysteria, but trust me they'd sure like you to believe that was the case. I state that now because the filmmaker gives the audience the most important information first as well: this father Friedman, he loved his child porn. You don't need to be Sherlock to figure out what comes next.  Or maybe you do. I didn't because being up close and personal with a molester for the first 15 years of my life, I have a radar for such things. I had heard about this supposedly controversial movie for a while now but did not seek it out. I just happened tonight to come upon it on a specialty movie channel here in Canada.  I think this documentary is a movie first, documentary second using real life persons - some of whom can act better then others. Hmm. Art imitating life?  And what a window it is into the life of one peodophile's family.  As soon as we discover father Friedman has ordered one child porn mag, you have to be pretty nave to believe it was his first. And yes, we soon learn he had a stack of kiddie mags. Then, as you discover this award-winning teacher gets excited about little boys, who couldn't put two and two together and think he just might be a risk to his students and had been to his 3 sons? Oh, we do learn he only did "one kid." Then it's two. But they weren't his students. Earlier it was only one mag and no children. Oh really? One or two -- they were somebody's children!  What parent wouldn't have alarm bells go off when they discover their teacher is REALLY into their kids? The hysteria that ensues I would think would be less criminal than the fact that this teacher has kiddie porn, has molested and might molest one or more of these students.  Watching this film is like watching a window into an episode of my family soap-opera. The mother is cast as the villain; the father is the talented victim/"peodophile, yes, but he didn't do his students!"; the three sons are the entertaining drama-making by-standers. In my family there were also 3 sons, but with a sister. Our mother was nave, yet devoted; our father, unlike father Friedman was not lovable or quiet, but was when it came to anything to do with our abuse. Over 30 people found out about our abuse and his silent admission had him sail through unscathed until I finally went to a detective in 1981 when I was 20!! [our family story can be found in Father's Touch here on Amazon.com] Capturing The Friedmans is a horror movie. The quiet father who loved kiddie porn and molested by his own admittance at the very least two kids is completely responsible for the travesty that befalls his family and community. The "evidence" as portrayed in the film leads the viewer to believe that witch-hunt hysteria of the community destroyed one peodophile's family.  While it is a travesty that anyone (investigators and or/parents) would mislead children to wrongly testify, a devil's advocate could suggest that the community's reaction opened pandora's box. Did the community have the right to know their student's teacher loved child pornography and had a sexual interest in children?   Again, what amazes me is that people can state, "only two kids".  The "one" neighbourhood boy my father molested in my presence "only one time", I happened to report to police a decade after the incident. I met this brave now man who supported us, years after the incident, at the preliminary hearing. It took all his strength to come forward, be at the court house, be in the presence of his one-time molester. He looked like the raped young soul of a decade earlier.  No, there is no such a thing as just one incident, one victim. Once is too much! Capturing The Friedmans suggests that a village destroyed one boy in particular [the youngest son was co-accused with the Father of molesting several students, and in a plea-bargain to avoid possible life-time incarceration, admitted his father had molested him]. This is one case where the sins of the father fell on the son and if this film leaves a viewer with the notion that anyone or anything was the primary destroyer other that the peodophile father, then I'd re-catergorize it as fantasy - documentary 
 In his Preface Hegel states he will defend Metaphysics, a science that has  fallen into disrepute since the days of Kant.  He does this with great  skill and uncommon insight.  His method is a new operator in Logic, the  Speculative operator (popularly known as the Dialectic), and Hegel  demonstrates the use of this new operator from the most Abstract to the  most Concrete categories possible.  In his Introduction Hegel states that  his book will show forth 'the mind of God before the creation of the world  and a finite spirit.'  Decide for yourself if he was successful in this,  but I say he was.  This book is not usually well-received by the modernist,  while the postmodernist will condemn these ideas as 'Logomachy.'   Nevertheless, Hegel's SCIENCE OF LOGIC (1812) has had an enormous impact  upon the avant-garde and upon some of the most influential intellectuals  that history has ever seen.  In this book Hegel incorporates the Categories  of Kant in a new, metaphysical paradigm and demonstrates to those who  struggle to follow his New Logic that God is Real, the Real is Spirit,  Spirit is Mind, Mind is Reason and Reason is the Goal of all History.   Others have rightly said that God is the Goal of all History, but Hegel  fleshes out the details with scientific precision and invites scientific  criticism of his new logical operator.  (Note: This is a book for experts  and specialists.  If you have not yet read Kant, do not expect to  understand even a single page of this technical tome.)  For the student of  modern philosophy, this book is a rocket ship to your next destination at  the apex of Western Philosophy 
 I have a ton of Hawk cd's.  Yet this is one that I invariably reach for time and time again.  It is absolutely flawless from start to finish.  There is absolutely not one wrong note on this entire session, not one thing that I would change, except perhaps, out of selfishness, to make it a bit longer. 42 minutes just does not seem long enough.  But if you know the Hawk when he's blowing ballads, you know what to expect.  Although it doesn't explicitly say it, this was done for the Moodsville series.  So that kind of gives you the vibe on this one.  So does the title though.  But then you have Tommy Flanagan on the keys, and on upright, you have Wendell Marshall who set things so right on Red Garland's session during "When There Are Grey Skies."  The bottom line is that you are in for a treat from the moment you pop this baby in your cd player.  Dim the lights, turn up the volume, curl up with your baby, and you know what to do.  At the same time, and speaking from experience, this cd is perfect for letting you know, late at night (or early in the morning depending on how you look at things), that "fella, you ain't in things alone and many a good man has done been down exactly the same road you're traveling."  It's a comforting reminder, believe me.  So this is a cd for all times, good and bad and it's a dam! beautiful one.  You can't pass this one up any longer.  Get it today.  You'll thank yourself and then kick yourself for not getting it a long, long time ago 
 In my opinion Veritatis Splendor is the finest of Pope John Paul's encyclicals.  It is the best in terms of theological content as well as its ability to enrich one spiritually.  This document addresses head on many of the abuses found in today's Catholic universities and seminaries; abuses ranging from a failure to recognize the Magisterium of Christ's Church to the preponderance of such philosophical schools as proportionalism, relativism, and pragmatism which tend to deny the existence of absolute norms and therefore lead to eventually to lawlessness. 	It is the law that the Holy Father sets forth as the means of fulfilling the Christian faith.  The natural law is the expression of the Divine Law within creation and can be known by men through right reason.  The law, unable to be fulfilled by man without God's grace, is now capable of being fulfilled through the power of the Holy Spirit unleashed through the Gospel and made available to us through the sacraments.  The Holy Father eloquently expresses how it is through living out the law, even in extremely difficult circumstances that the Christian manifests Christ's presence and power in the world today and proclaims His Kingdom most effectively. 	Finally, the Holy Father firmly confirms the Church's constant teaching that there exist negative moral norms that can never be broken even with the intention of attaining some contingent good.  For example, one may never rob in order to feed the poor.  Yet Christ's mercy is ever present to forgive and strengthen anew those who fail to live the law and turn to Him for help. 	Reading this encyclical made me want to live the law, to seek virtue, to know the power of Christ at work in me.  Besides being an excellent work of moral theology and Magisterial teaching, it is above all in my estimation an uplifting spiritual treatise. 
 This book covers the eventful life of a passionate craftsman who lived through major events of the Renaissance.  In Florence, Rome, and Paris, Cellini managed to gravitate to the most powerful political and artistic  personalities, but his relationships with them were always bumpy.  Cellini  had an artist's temperament and more - his passionate temper and sense of  righteousness, combined with the unscrupulous nature of many he  encountered, caused constant friction and turmoil which make the book a  nonstop and occasionally violent thriller.      The book's one  disappointment for those interested in history is the lack of extensive  description of the places where he worked and travelled.  It's centered on  Cellini, his relationships and activities, and his craft.  He does however  have a great description of the defense of Rome in 1527, in which he was  firing artillery from the top of Castel St.-Angelo.      George Bull rates  five stars for a great translation which captures the spirit of the  original, its passion, wit, sarcasm, bitterness and insight.  Given the  work was written with Florentine colloquialisms, this is an achievement.         Highly recommended 
 When it comes to ancient history, Michael Grant is the greatest! I've read several of his other books and he never fails to amuse and inform. His book on Cleopatra is informative as well as entertaining. Cleopatra was a Greek Macedonian ruler of Egypt with a deep love for culture and powerful men. Her liaisons with Caesar and Antony are very well described, as are her achievements as queen. Mr. Grant is truly the greatest 
 I've read all the Jesse Stone series books and haven't been disappointed yet. Once you start reading it's hard to put down. Always great characters and plots...... I would recommend this series to all......... 
 Phil Spector is famous for his wall-of-sound studio mix that is easily identified in 1960s pop music such as that of the Ronettes and the Crystals.  This music is amazingly fresh after all these years.  Last year Saturday Night Live brought Darlene Love in to do a wonderful spoof of Christmas music, much in the vein of the music on this recording, on "Christmastime for the Jews."  Love is still in great vocal shape, and the song is a scream.  Going in to the commercial break Love does her beautiful version of "White Christmas" and I think Lorne Michaels and company did us a disservice in not allowing her to sing the whole song on the show; this CD is worth the price just for this wonderful version of the song. 
 I first heard some of this as the lead-in to Macca's "Driving Usa" concert. I was mesmerized, and intrigued about the source of the world-music instrumentals. When various websites pointed me to this cd, I just had to have it. It's a terrific concept album, and the fact that this is the same Sir Paul that we've loved for forty years makes it even more special. He has once again reinvented himself. Buy it, turn the lights down, and let your imagination roam 
 Harkens back to the Classic Maiden Days!. Buy it you won't regret it 
 The Last Queen submerges the reader into a world of ambiguous morality, tumultuous politics, and an epic struggle against the weavings of fate woven so tightly that the fabric can barely be stretched, let alone torn. If anyone ever dreamed of being a European prince or princess in the late 1400's this novel will surely dispel the fantasy. As an amateur historian I have intellectually accepted the difficulties of ruling well and conceded that few had the power to overcome the corruption of power or had the intellectual acumen to succeed as a royal statesperson. But in Christopher Gortner's novel you feel this viscerally. To succeed against the odds was a miracle when it happened; which is probably why we can count the reigns of the truly noble on our fingers. Juana was, as we say now, set up for failure, but her struggles against her fate were epic in scope. From the first realization that she was trapped by the inertia of her royal lineage to the love/hate relationship with Phillip to the ultimate clash with the misogynist Grandees of Spain. This is not a book that will cheer you. But it is a novel that will tear at your soul and follow you into dreams 
 A lovely story about trust and letting go.  Any dog lover would love this 
 Mom is 91 yrs old and lives by herself.  She is unable to take a bath in a tub because she has difficulty getting up.  Taking a shower was tiring for her and this stool is just what she needed.  It is light, rustproof and inexpensive.  Very pleased 
 At the beginning of the book, Pietra Rivoli sets out to find an answer to the anti-globalization cries of the activists, to build a case to convince them of the power of the markets in improving the life of the poor. Instead, we discover an intricate web of interrelationships of politics, economics and culture; we realize that the trade skeptics need the corporations, the corporations need the skeptics, but most importantly the sweatshop workers need them both.   This book really stands out in its scope and conclusions. All too often we are exposed to one-sided attacks on or treatises for globalization - this book offers a comprehensive look at both sides, and more importantly it recognizes the importance of both. Amartya Sen (Nobel prize winner) proposed and supported many of the same ideas before, but this book articulates them exceptionally well and offers plenty of real, historical examples to seal the case.  I read this book for a class, but it's a kind of book I would have no hesitation reading on my free time either - it's a solid investment of your time and a real eye opener.  
 I read "What Was She Thinking?" and liked that one, so read this one.  Completely different in style and the character is a rather unpleasant but fascinatingly wicked lug that I could not help but like while I found him pretty vulgar, and a bit funny at the same time.    I love this writing style. I like lots of dialog and little of the going on and on about the pattern in the wallpaper.  Just a great read for me. I loved the way the daughter's letters and the action kept grapevining each other. I can't imagine anyone not liking this read - just a great read. 
 If you enjoyed Jungle or Fast Food Nation, and/or are a nutrition/health enthusiast, this book is a must-read. It is fascinating, well-paced, reasonably comprehensive and enlightening about the history of obesity research and the current state. It balances scientific biographic accounts with social events/scenarios. Should help people show more sympathy towards larger people 
 I work for a mail order company in Kansas, and we once purchased this CD-ROM.  Textile Designs, Volume 1, Florals.  Our copy is lost, and I'm searching for a new one.  Does anyone know where I might find a used or new copy?    Does the most recent volume include the images from the older volumes 
 I love the dehumidifier it is so much quieter than my old one and I love that a hose can be connected and put into my french drain so I never have to empty it. My basement is very damp and this dehumidifier really does the job well 
 "River" has it all -  the sure direction of Redford, excellent script and acting, and the breathtaking beauty of Montana. This is a nuanced film about two brothers on divergent paths and their complicated relationship with each other and their dad. But it's not corny or maudlin. The fly fishing sequences are symbolic in many ways. This is a great film all around, but would be worth buying just for Craig Sheffer's performance alone 
 This is a readable, sensible book for anyone who manages, leads or especially owns a company. If every business followed this advice, there would probably be a lot less workplace violence and much higher success rates. These guys talk with authority and back their concepts up with believable data. One of the more original books I've read 
 Just wanted to mention that Brain Plague is also very amusing.  Chrys's microbes often just wanna have fun & cause no end of ruckus partying up in her brain, setting up night clubs, discovering that they can imbibe alcohol etc. It's really great to have a SCI-FI novel that can combine serious themes with a leavening of humor 
 I read this book in my early 20's and it served as a catapult to getting my life going.  At 23 I had so much potential and didn't know where to start with it, but reading this book got me going and motivated more than ever.  I became a huge fan of Ms. Sher for helping me put reasonable goals together and follow through on them. 20 years later, I have everything I wanted at 23.  I charted my path clearly and confidently after this book and I recommend it highly for people who need guidance, but who are motivated to acheive 
 This book was great! I sincerely think that everyone who works with children and teenagers should read this book.  It is also great reading material for teenagers.  I think if more people would read it, it would help them to understand that all people are valuable and it doesn't make a person taller if they make someone smaller. Everyone all around gets hurt.  
 This movie pictured a sizable segment of the U.S. population that has not gotten much attention in the movies - the high involvement Mediterranean family. Many Italians I know  said that it could have been their family. The movie works so well because the author and star really lived and knew the life she depicted. I enjoyed the wry humor.   At the beginning I was prepared to hate her father. He was so sexist and bullying and anti-intellectual. And the women of the family were so cynically manipulative. It did not occur to me until late into the movie that the father was really afraid. He had only the best in mind for his family, and that included his daughters, and that he too felt out of his element in a different mix of cultures that is the United States.  One other detail pleased me; the role of the community college in helping people break free from a confining life to move up in the world. Not only do they learn academic things, they meet wonderful people from other cultures there, fall in love, and marry them.  The photography was wonderful and the acting was superb, especially since  the movie was made on a tight budget.   This is one of the best films I have seen in the past ten years.   
 Gully Foyle is no ordinary man.  Gully Foyle is a nothing.  Abandoned on a wrecked spaceship to die.  But Gully Foyle is not ready to die; he manages to escape his wrought prison and proceeds to embark on an adventure that will not only change how he looks at himself and the world, but how the world looks at him.  The Stars My Destination was a surprise.  Published in the mid-1950's, the book felt like it was written (with only a few exceptions here and there) within the past decade.  It is truly amazing how correct Alfred Bester was about a whole host of technological issues; everything from computer-controlled defense systems to how people and objects react in a microgravity/zero-g environment Bester pretty much hit the nail on the head.  And to top it all off, there is a genuine, character-driven and character-building story behind it all.  The only criticism I have to offer is that I wish the crux of the story got moving a bit earlier on than it did.  On whole, I highly recommend this book.  The Stars My Destination is like no other book I've ever read from this period in science fiction. 
 The East West knife cuts through carrots like butter!  It is so worth shelling out a little extra for the quality you recieve in this set of knives 
 My partner and I, having never been to Maui, followed the recommendations in this guide. We never would have found many of these places unless we'd first lived on the island.   It was just what I wanted when bought the guide -only better.  The book paid for itself.  What more could you ask?  I would recommend the book.  Just before I submitted this review I peeked at what others had said also about the guide.   It seems that we all have a similar review!  
 I found this book to be a very entertaining read about the men who have served our country as President.  If you are looking for a serious history book, this is not it.  But if you are looking to learn something about the men who have held the highest office in the land, and at the same time be entertained - this is a great book.  I found it very interesting that several reviewers thought the author had an "agenda" or was "partisan".  The amusing thing about these claims is that half the claims are from reviewers who think the author leaned to the left, and the other half from reviewers who thought he leaned to the right!  How can the author be biased in BOTH directions?!?  I can only assume that the reviewers who claimed bias in one way or the other are those that are either extremists to the right or left, and have a very biased opinion themselves.  For instance, one reviewer writes that he "found this book to be biased toward the right, with nothing bad to say about George W. Bush's Iraq War" and "makes unproven, unsubstantiated claims about Bill Clinton..."  Then another reviewer states that the "bias in regard to Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush begs for clarification or at least a recognition of the author's preference for left of center politics."  I could list example after example.  If you are an extreme righty or lefty, maybe you shouldn't read this book if you will get your feelings hurt.  Otherwise, for the majority of the electorate that does not have blinders on and realizes that there is good and bad in everyone, including the Presidents, I highly recommend this book 
 I am ready to Chase the Lion after reading this book. Mark Batterson is a fantastic writer whose style is comfortable and yet conveys great ideas without beating you over the head with them. I loved this book so much I bought a copy for my Pastor 
 This book has loads of great ideas for beautiful birthday cakes. I haven't tried making one yet so I don't know if they're easy. But I will surely be using one of the ideas for my 2 year olds up and coming birthday 
 I loved Richard Peck's 'A Year Down Yonder' it was sweet, funny, cute, and well written. I have been made a deffinite Richard Peck fan from reading this book, it's the first one of his books I've read.  'A Year Down Yonder' is about Mary Alice Dowdel, who has to leave her Chicago home to go live with her Grandma in Louisiana, when her father loses his job. Mary Alice is at first skeptical about living in this small town with Grandma Dowdel, but soon she realizes that Grandma is more than she appears...... and after that you'll just have to read the book.   You don't have to read 'A Long Way From Chicago' the preceding book to 'A Year Down Yonder' to understand it. So, please enjoy 'A Year Down Yonder' by Richard Peck 
 Sue Grafton has to be the most reliable mystery writer out there. Even a sub-par offering from her is leaps and bounds better than the best of other mystery series out there. Part of what is great about her is the way she shakes everything up just a bit in each book so that you never feel like you're reading the same thing twice. Case in point: in this installment we find our beloved Kinsey Millhone rebounding from being fired by the California Fidelity Insurance company that had been her base of operations in the previous novels. Humbled by the experience of being canned, Kinsey is trying to make ends meet working out of a law office. When her new boss' PI dies suddenly he asks for her help tying up the loose ends of a case that is coming to trial in three weeks. Working under a time crunch and eager to get back on top of her life again, Kinsey attacks the job with renewed vigor and her usual gutsy style. Grafton also showcases her adept plotting skills with perhaps the most intricately plotted installment yet. Kinsey's case takes on many thrilling twists and turns that are honest-to-goodness surprises to the reader -- and predicting who the culprit is becomes virtually impossible, making for a fun ride. It had been a while since I last visited Santa Teresa with Kinsey's last adventure, "H is for Homicide", but with "I is for Innocence" Grafton has ensured that this loyal fan will not stray so far again 
 This is a delightfully clever romantic comedy succeeds to a much greater degree than that computer animated film.In this subversively funny film, that means stage performances are held with all male casts even in the female roles, since women were not allowed to perform onstage in those days.This movie is rated R for a few simulated sex scenes, violent swordfighting.In addition to everything else, Shakespeare in Love also functions as a tribute to the magic of live theater. Whenever problems arise, impresario Henslowe says not to worry, his explanation of how the difficulty will be solved is a wide-eyed.  
 We were looking for a substitute of the likes of the Video Now or some the other mindless electronic toys on the X-Mas must-have lists. It isn't much cheaper than those others, but we felt that the options for creativity were greater with the PIXTER.  Like the other systems there are built-in functions: a tetris-like game, a drawing page, word games, dot-to-dot pages, and more. The stylus tool is fairly easy to use and the drawing functions have many stamps, backgrounds and other methods to enhance artwork. The PIXTER will save selected works, also there are many accessories to extend PIXTER interest, additional cartridges some with licensed products like Sponge-Bob, Barbie, Walking with Dinosaurs, Teen Titans, each allowing real-time clips and editing of TV scenes ($20 each). One of the most interesting accessories is the digital camera for even more personalized creative play.   My 8 and 5 year old were hooked by the PIXTER. The only problem is the batteries, some systems come with chargers or AC ports, the PIXTER DOES NOT. We bought rechargable AAs for the toy.   Also many stores do not carry assessories for the system, but TOYS R US has the digital camera for the set (@$[...]) which is really great, allowing users to modify & play with photos of their own 
 Doug Gray writes this book like he's coaching you one-on-one in your own living room.  His personal stories are powerful.  His insight and perspective guide you along the way. Do the homework and he will take you to the next level 
 WOW! Sexy and impressive! Richard Meyer's Outlaw Representation proves to be a triumphant exploration of how conflicts over censorship and homosexuality have transformed the history of modern art in America. From Mapplethorpe to Warhol, the author masterfully charts the complex crosshairs of sexuality and politics as we witness again and again the collision between gay sensibility and the long arm of the law. I was blown away by Meyer's grasp of his subject and the light he shines onto this sad litany of censorship in America 
 Deborah Gray White writes tellingly about the double evils faced by the Black woman of the old South: racism and sexism. Truely, they faced a lack of personhood at every turn.   The author weaves together quotes from the enslaved Black women to tell her story. As other reviewers have noted, there does tend to be something of a feel of a feminist slant to the writing. I certainly would not argue against her basic premise of white male abuse of Black female slaves. However, having researched the White female slave owners, I would contend that women of the South were as guilty as the men of evil and condoning evil.  Reading firsthand accounts of these Black "sisters of the spirit" is the only way to truly gain a feel for what they endured and the larger cultural evils. Three examples include: "Behind the Scenes," "The House of Bondage," and "Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl."  Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of "Beyond the Suffering: Embracy the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction." 
 I had to have these for my son.  I believe that we have lost a lot in childrens programming over the last few decades.  Unfortunately, it is our children's education that is being lost.  Today's programming is being overun with entertainment rather than learning.  I happen to find that there are some programs that are educational and entertaining at the same time.  Unlike most of today's shows!  The Electric Company teaches children in a comical way how to read using phonics.  What other show today does that 
          This album is just classic. Supertramp was never really my cup of tea until I heard this album. So, this album is just amazing. I would say it's their best, but I haven't heard of their other albums. Song Highlights: Gone Hollywood, The Logical Song, Goodbye Stranger, Breakfast In America, Oh Darling, Take The Long Way Home, Just Another Nervous Wreck, Casual Conversation, and Child Of Vision 
 I agree with the other reviewer, mine has become slightly more curved over the few months that I've had it.  It's not dishwashed, I don't leave it in a hot pan, and rarely left it "face down" on the counter because I'm weird about cross contamination.  The curve of the turner is more pronounced than it was when I bought it, but it's still better for flipping than my narrow turners are.  Especially my good sized pancakes, no run off on the sides from sagging over the edges of a narrow turner.  I still recommend this turner.  And the colors are great.  
 This is a great read-aloud book for kids of all ages!  I teach high school, and tell stories as an avocation (yes, I know the two are not mutually exclusive!).  When I get to the part where Bismark tries not  laugh, I go into hysterics.  Little kids love it, high school kids ask to  have it read again, and adults have been known to snicker a time or two.   It's a good read, and an audience-pleaser.  Some food for thought, too.  My  favorite line is Zachary's: "It is a tragedy to be clever but not  happy."  Spinoza couldn't have said it better.  I had the pleasure of  meeting Ms. Monsell at a reading conference once.  She has made the world a  happier place by creating this wonderful story 
 I actually bought this book as a Christmas present for my husband who is a big Duke fan.  I am the Tar Heel fan in the family and thus you see the method in my madness. However, he started reading it on Christmas day before all the wrapping paper was cleaned up and could not put it down for hours.  He did make a number of comments disagreeing with various premises of the book, but it certainly kept his attention. I've just started the book and particularly enjoy the references to the author's family (I knew his father years ago) but it does bog down a bit in detailing the games during the season.  Still, for any of us who have lived in Chapel Hill and been infected with the Tar Heel "bug" it is a 'must read. 
 This book is massive and holds a wealth of information unsurpassed by any management/business book I've encountered. The layout is exceptional and is unassuming as it's driven by icons and clearly organized. The book has a top-notch advisory board. The little extras listed under "For More Information" such as websites and books are invaluable. They've done all the legwork for you. Also, each section highlights possible application of the concept discussed in a section called "Making It Happen" and the numerous management checklist make this book very applied. If there is a lacuna in your knowledge base it will surly be filled with Business the Ultimate Resource. Additionally, the bios and details of business gurus are helpful in understanding what it takes to be successful in a global marke 
 H.G. Wells wrote War of the Worlds as a warning to the complacent, world-dominating British citizens of his era to not take the status quo for granted. The arrogance of some British politicians in particular rubbed Wells entirely the wrong way, particularly their sentiment that the British had an 'obligation' to 'civilize' the world (read: colonize) for its own good. Well's book was a rock thrown at that attitude-on-a-pedestal, and although he didn't knock it down, he made his point- and in spectacular fashion. In one way, the Martians *were* the conquering British, with their superior weapons and baffling ways that must have seemed incomprehensible to the natives of Africa and other areas colonized by force.  Wells' dark tale was also a warning that even the British- despite their firm belief in their world destiny- could be squashed like so many bugs by an indifferent cosmos that didn't give one whit about the British (or anyone else's) false boast of superiority. In the end, though, it's a hopeful book- just as the Martians died off because they weren't biologically suited to live in this world, Wells also foretells the end of the British Empire because the British (alien) way was not the native way of life in the colonies, suggesting that the British wouldn't survive there long; the natives would eventually prevail. And they did. On top of all that, it's rousing entertainment that can be read just for its drama and suspense.  And that's why it's still in print a hundred years later.  -Mark Wakely, author of An Audience for Einstei 
 Personally, I thought this film was brilliant!  When I first saw it a few years back I admit that I didn't like it much, it seemed rather stupid to think that a robot could 'become' human, but on viewing it again years later, I can safely say that I missed the whole point of this film.  Andrew is a robot to begin with, but one with feelings and the ability to learn. He wants to learn, wants to talk, wants to create, and through some mistake when he was being created he can. His unique ability, mixed with his owners kindness and help allow him to grow up like a real human, by learning, having memories, caring about his family etc.  This film shows Andrew's aim to become human, and follows his life from when he first became the 'machine' of the Martin family, to when he finally fell in love with their youngest daughters grand child, and becomes human to die beside her on their death beds.  It is a sad movie, with a few tear jerking parts (especially at the end) and it asks a lot of questions which we don't often think about, like can robots have feelings, can they love, and can they become human? In the end, what does defy whether you are a human or not, is it being born with the right, or can you earn the title.  This is a definite 5 for me. true, it is a very long film and the start can drag on a bit, but it is a beautiful tale that I believe everyone should watch at least once 
 Well written, very informative, and very easy to get an up close and real personal feeling for the men and women warriors of WWII and the sacrifices they made to guarantee freedom 
 At first, when I heard "Who We Are" on the radio I was unimpressed. A few weeks later, her second release "Sick Inside" played on the radio and I couldn't believe it was the same girl who had sung "Who We Are". I was completely blown away by the song and I purchased the CD and immediately listened to all of the tracks. I can honestly say that the title track "Who We Are" is the weakest track on the entire CD! Whatever brilliant PR guy had her release this first should be dropped quick. "Don't Go" and "Cold" are two of the best tracks I've heard in a while, and the entire CD itself is wonderful. Seems as if Virgin Records has dropped her contract for weak sales, but they are the reason behind the weak sales themselves! A Wal-Mart exclusive tour? Give me a break! Hope is a rising star, extremely beautiful and talented, and with just a little nudge and correct promotion she could be huge. And btw, to all the record companies that release these CD's with protected content, GET A LIFE. If your pea-sized brains haven't already figured this out, we as consumers do not, under any circumstances, want these types of releases, and the hit to your wallets should be proof enough 
 This is the best book I have ever read on parenting and will help you even if you are not a parent. It is amazing. I return to it over and over again and it has helped me communicate better with my husband as well as my kids. 
 Wonderful surprise.  I bought this CD based on one song I heard on the radio, ususally a mistake.  I am thoroughly enjoying the whole CD.  I will definitly buy more 
 This book was absolutely amazing.  You get so attached to the girl as you read, the teacher is a miracle worker.  I recommend this book 100% 
 My students LOVE this book. They refer to it regularly. The flow charts and diagrams are invaluable. The systematic diagrams help students visualize how various networks components work individually and as a group. This is a great beginning network book as well as a reference tool. The chapters are short and to the point. Reproducing the diagrams without the text allows assessment of student understanding 
 Ralph and Vince have taken a very complex topic and distilled it into very simple and manageable topics. Including real life experiences to back the theories makes it more compelling and pragmatic. The authors have blended a multitude of dimensions succinctly; such as: tooling with frameworks, strategy with operation, services with outsourcing to highlight the variations. A real read is what does justice to the book.  The topics and related progression is quite realistic - starting with the basics around the need for a common vocabulary, moving onto the core competencies that enable it (such as tools, methods and frameworks), eventually moving into flawless execution by connecting the dots with strategy.   If you are looking for ideas, real life experiences and key take-aways in managing complex transformational initiatives in todays competitive business environment, this is the book.  
 When I first purchased Building Walking Bass Lines, I knew how to read notes in the lower five frets of the bass, and played bass at a high beginner's level.  I'm also a full-time college teacher (business), so I know solid teaching of any kind when I see it.     Unlike other books on walking bass lines I'd tried to learn from, this book got me walking over chord changes quickly and fluidly, and with a minimum amount of pain.  Friedland gives a brief overview of how to read notes on the electric bass, briefly discusses how to construct chords, and then launches into the clearest and most gradual explanation of how to walk over chord changes I've ever seen.  He has a lot of "hands-on", play-along exercises at the end of each concept, and they're stripped of unecessary complexity so you can see the concepts clearly.    A major strength of this book is how you see results in your playing immediately, which encourages you to keep practicing.  It's important for anyone learning something for the first time to see immediate progress in their ability, and Friedland has written this book to achieve just that.  The exercises get more and more difficult as you go along, but were never out of reach for me.   The end of the book gives the chord changes to 10 jazz standards.  After working through this book, I knew enough to hold my own in a gigging fusion band with some ex-music teachers and university graduates in music.  Also, I found the concepts I learned in the this book made me a better rock and folk player, because I understood how to construct interesting bass lines under chords in any style -- all this was an outgrowth of my jazz knowledge gained from the book.  Anyone who writes that this book is "too easy" or "too basic" is actually complementing Friedland, because it takes a master to dissect a complex topic into something everyone can understand.     
 I had a bit of a problem with this book and accompanying CD.  I just can't seem to "get in the gap" as Wayne instructs.  I've only had this CD and book for a few months, so I am practicing as Wayne encourages.  It is so hard to still the mind to make a conscious connection with God.  But I don't think it is anything that Wayne is doing wrong, I believe it is me. 
 Was this book worth buying? Yes.   Did I thoroughly enjoy reading this book? Yes.  Did I thoroughly enjoy reading this book a second time? Maybe.  Is it a bookshelf keeper? Still debating.  Cherry Adair's new series involving TFLAC, although not the Wright brothers (and sister) for sure, but with its own unique flavor that proves appealing.   Gabriel, the oldest of three brothers, all TFLAC operatives, all carrying the legacy of being wizards and the side plot of a curse, that they will have to choose duty over true love or fate their beloved to a death by the hands of the curse.  Eden, a brillant research doctor who has spent the better part of the last six years with her older research partner developing "Rex" - a prototype super bot with the face of a 5 year old boy who is indestructible and can do most anything. While Eden only saw the good Rex could do for humanity, the terrorist group who steals Rex and kills Eden's research partner see all too well the evil that can be unhatched with a machine of such capabilities.  Gabriel Edge is assigned to get to Eden - before the terrorist do, get the schematics and information telepathically and using magic build another Rex to destroy the first since it is the only known way to destroy Rex. But for some reason Eden is able to block Gabriel from extracting information from her. Gabriel must win her trust to save the world, protect her from terrorists and a turned wizard, while fighting the attraction to Eden to save her from the curse he believes cannot be broken.  While this book was overly satifying the first read, it didn't hold up to the secondary reading too well. I definitly felt the end of this book was rushed from atleast 7-10 pages into 2. Everything was wrapped up with a big bow right at the end which didn't suit well with all the drama of the curse spread thoroughout the book. As always though, Adair delievers in the romance and lights up the pages with her scenarios.   I thought it mirrored a little too much Christine Feehan's particular style, which works for Feehan, not necessarily for Adair. Definitly liked Adair's previous works and style a little better. I am glad I bought the book and read it, but not too sure if I am going to keep it. 
 If you have struggled to undertand mythology or just plain wondered what it is all about, then look no further this is the book to read.  If you think you already know what mythology is, you may be in for a surprise. Mythology is what you get when one generation needs to pass on important information to the next generation using only verbal transmission.  No books, no internet, no writing - only stories stored in memory. Now try to imagine all the different ways that the stories could get modified and distorted over one thousands years of reciting. That is what the authors have done, through years of research and rigorous analysis they have reconstructed the origins of many myths. The process and methods that they have devised will serve as a foundation for future inquiry.  This book shows what happens when experts in humanities merge their knowledge with what is often called "the hard sciences". The resulting consilience is truly enlightened.  Also worth noting, this book essentially ends the speculation begun by Julian James in "Origin of Consciousness..." it also makes sense of Freud's Oedipus complex and Jung's nonsense. 
 This CD is phenomenal.    For A jazz CD to achieve the status of 'phenomenal' is not an easy task.  Not because jazz as a genre or type of music is inferior to any other genre, but on the contrary, jazz is the most cerebral and emotional amalgam of complexity and simplicity.  This being said, a small handful of musicians in the past have mastered the art, this yin and yang of seemingly contradictory elements; harnessing them into a single song or album -- Resplendant musicians like Duke Ellington, John Coltrane, and Thelonius Monk,  a few of the dynamic fathers who understood and saw the entire aural mosaic of jazz, not tile by tile, but as a whole, and were lifted on wings of aural prophecy to move freely and melodically throughout their own creations.    Ben Allison is the young prodigy bassist of this CD, who is part of a New York Jazz Composers Collective, and subsequently is a partner in the ownership of the Jazz Club "Kush" near Downtown N.Y.C.    Allison not only understands the respect of traditional inheritance his instrument entails, he is a fearless experimentor, and genius improvisor, both spontaneously and pre-meditatively.  The last song on the CD, "Tectonics," is a perfect illustration of his multi-faceted brilliance.  Tectonics, as young Ben uses the word, means the tactilization of sound, or the texturing as Ben narrates in the sleeve notes.  Allison conjures dozens of different tones from the Bass ranging from varied and unorthodox methods of plucking and striking the strings, to loading the instrument with playing cards and money pieces for a muffled sounds.  He is truly a technically proficient and blistering paced bassist, as well as an eloquent, deliberate, and patient commander of his instrument.     Michael Blake Plays Sax on this album.  Blake has possibly the most muscular tone on the sax since Ornette Coleman.  I want to be careful with this comparison, because most people have a hard time separating style with tone.  This is because in most cases style and tone are contingent upon each other.  However, Coleman had his albums where it was as if a woman had laid her hand and his chest,  calming his fingers and easing steady deep breaths into the saxophone.  I call Blake's tone muscular because keeping on the theme of tectonics, if there was to be a visual manifestation of Blake's tone in the first piece, his sound would be an Olympic track and field athlete, male or female, chiseled in every way to perform the task at hand, powerful and graceful in each movement.  Blake contributions are narrated perfectly by Allison in the sleeve notes as, "[Blake] solo's with conviction and feedback."    We have Frank Kimbrough on Piano (the same line of suspects is emerging from Medicine Wheel and Third Eye) who is equally as experimental with his instrument as Allison on the bass.  Kimbrough is an unbelievably subtle yet important piece of this musical posse, contributing tones and themes, and transition keys that are dynamic to the production of each song.  He has poignant solos in the songs, "Jazz Scene Voyeur," and "Charlie Brown's Psychedelic Christmas."     Jeff Ballard is the percussion wiz here.  Listen to the first twenty ticks of the first song on this CD.  Jeff Ballard does live with a drum set what music theory nerds take years to program on a Roland.  In the first song, listen to his high-hat fills and snare trips that suffuse the background beat.  Ballard is as punctual as he is creative, he is as precise has he his abstract.  He really outdoes himself for this album, in my mind reaching Carter B's (Dave Matthew's Bands drummer) status for more than just a moment.     A handful of other players here make some very subversive contributions to the album: Ted Nash, who has been acclaimed highly for his collaborations with Wynton Marsalis, and Horton who uses some atonal work in the song "Swiss Cheese D."  The first three songs are killer, one modern and space-paced, the other two more traditional.  Listen to all of "Riding the Nuclear Tiger" as the last two songs provide a finale well worth waitng too.  Goodbyes especially for this CD hold lingering regret.  Tone-wise, and end-of-epic-CD-blues.    Ben Allison himself says of the album,  (this is a memorized paraphrase) "It's about the excitement of almost losing control, and just barely being able to hold on."  That's what happens when savants and geniuses collaborate and make an aural brew filled with the perfect blend of experimental ingredients and traditional method. Thank you, that is all 
 a very good book for begginers in SQL; it explains main concepts with a lot of helpful example 
 I love this story, and this version is, in my opinion, by far the best performance of A Christmas Carol available.  My family makes a tradition of watching it every Christmas.  George C. Scott is tremendous 
 It seems like the reviews of "The Catcher in the Rye" are fairly polarized.  Some people identify strongly with Holden Caulfield, while others tend to think he is spoiled or annoying.  I think there are good reasons to feel either way about him.  For me, though, Holden Caulfield is one of the most likeable characters I've ever encountered, and it's probably because he's so honest. He tells you everything he's thinking, whether it's embarrassing or not. Most of the time what he's thinking is either hilarious or depressing; often it's both at the same time. But every now and then he also explores deeper emotional territory...like the loss of a loved one, or the fleeting nature of youth and innocence.  In fact, although people view the book in different ways, for me "The Catcher in the Rye" is not the story of a rebellious malcontent. Instead, I see Holden as a sensitive young man who is struggling to deal with the death of his brother...while at the same time making the confusing transition between childhood and adulthood. Although on the surface we see Holden going around calling a lot of stuff phony, underneath his defensive exterior he literally aches to connect with other people, and he treasures the few moments when real connection becomes possible. To enjoy this book, then, you've just got to remember that Holden Caulfield has a heart of gold...it's just that he's also in a lot of pain. And like everyone else, he's not perfect. Great book 
 This book is one of those rare gems - truly inspirational and with great practical advice. What made this book outstanding for me was that it successfully combined three things: (1) inspirational principles; (2) practical explanations of how to apply these principles in real life; and (3) anecdotes from some of our most successful entrepreneurs and sports figures, who tell us how a particular principle was central to their life.  Any one of Kelly's ten principles alone, can help you become more effective as a leader, better in your business life, and a better human being. The ten principles combined are a great recipe for success - in business, and more importantly, in life.  The anecdotes that Kelly weaves in and his writing style make this book an easy read; you may find it hard to put down; yet you can read any one chapter out of order and its lesson stands alone very well.  Books like this should be on every high school's short reading list. 
 Good book for beginners and for those who have reached a place of discovery, but much too repetitious for me.  Don't listen to the audio while driving as Tolles voice is a monotone.  Rayna Gangi, author, "Forget The Cures, Find The Cause." and "Mary Jemison, White Woman of the Seneca. 
 This is a great resource! Our team booked over 200 qualified sales leads at our tradeshow with nothing more than the information from this book. So far with the follow up process we have closed 40% of the leads. The only way this book won't work for you is if you won't work the tactics 
  Tackling the biography is Arnold Rothstein is not like undertaking to deal with the life of most equally known men of even the same time.  Rothstein was covered, as can be seen in the bibliography, in hundreds if not thousands of articles of the time in newspapers, magazines, books, and legends.  The problem is not lack of words written, but lack of actual knowledge of the subject.  Simply put, much of what has been written is legendary, apocryphal, repetitive, speculative or downright false, and it must have been an overwhelming task to wade through the junk to find the goods.  Pietruszka has done as good a job of it as likely can be done at this remove.  Further complicating the task is the personality of the subject, in this case a man who was clearly highly intelligent, charismatic, and industrious, but was missing some kind of chip to his personal makeup that would have made him fully human.  Judging from the book, AR loved the multiplication of money in any way possible, judging everything and everyone useful or not useful based strictly upon the expected financial return.  Associates passed in and out of his life and he had no compunction about lying to them or ripping them off or leaving them hanging out to dry, to take whatever heat might come down in his wake, and he'd pick them back up again if there was money to be made with no personal feelings entering into it.  It must have been hard to resist his charismatic pull, but harder to actually like the man.  Before reading this book I had known a little about Rothstein, mostly from the gambling/World Series angle.  I had been unaware of his deep involvement in drugs and similar financial adventures.  I wonder to what degree some of the crimes ascribed to Rothstein are simply a case of saying that because he was involved in this, with so-and-so, he MUST have been involved in that, with so-and-so.  Notably, Rothstein's own little black book of records may well have been `edited' by the cops after it was found, and of course the missing sheets are missing.  There seems to have been little actual written proof of much of anything Rothstein did, and there are so many conflicting stories and points of view it is hard to know the man's actual deeds with any certainty.  Rothstein's relationship with his wife stands in complete contrast:  the one person from whom he did not intend to make money he put on such a pedestal that he found himself unable to approach her as a wife, as a woman, and of course this created further suffering.    I think that this man was a very one-sided genius, essentially an amoral machine.  Pietruszka has done an excellent job of trying to separate fact from fiction of his fascinating subject. 
 I found this book to be very informative.  And it also confirmed some of the things I thought, but could never get my doctors to give me a answer on.  I recommend this book to everyone -especially those who have thyroid problems (among other things) 
 Indian Larry's bike is pictured on the cover and I find myself opening up to his bike "Wild Child" and the very words are vividly painted on the belt drive; in fact every bit of the bike exudes a beauty and wild genius -- especially in the details. Both Indian Larry with his busily tattooed body and his bikes are loaded with content and meaning and the picture of him and Paul Cox look like they are on fire speeding along a quiet road on their beautiful unique bikes. It is amazing to have these photos since Indian Larry took the express to Biker Heaven.   I enjoy paging thru the book looking at the different styles. In section 3, Seate has "new blood" and Tom Langton's Gold bike with a seat that says "Pleasure to Burn" almost makes me want to give my old school bike fantasies a rest...Almost!   Billy Lane's bad boy hubless bike that looks like a bit of hell, insanity and chaos that found reason -- a reason to ride. Seate's description of Kendall Johnson's "paint schemes" using phrases like "Felliniesque circus nightmare" are insanely amusing but I found Johnson's work far more exciting featured on Discovery Channel than in this book.   If you don't like paging thru a wide variety of bike themes this isn't for you. If you enjoy a big heavy book both in weight and variety than this is the book for you. I really enjoyed this book!  You can return to this book over and over and enjoy something different each time or revisit your favorites.  I return to the pages with Indian Larry and I am so glad I got to meet him and see his art in the flesh --- and metal.        
 This interesting and simple little book helped me grapple successfully with the psychological fallout of a divorce.  I was sorry I had not read it before I had created big problems for myself by listening to my gremlin 
 Why do mathematicians do the things they do?  Those of us who use math mostly to figure out the tip at a restaurant or balance the checkbook are far removed from the professors who are doing research and experiments (words that have not always been connected to pure mathematics) or who are doing just the basic proofs that mathematicians are famous for.  G. H. Hardy wrote the classic text to explain his passion for his work, _A Mathematician's Apology_, in 1940.  Now comes _Meta Math!  The Quest for Omega_ (Pantheon Books) by Gregory Chaitin.  It covers some ground that will be familiar to readers of the superb _Gdel, Escher, Bach_ by Douglas Hofstadter, and indeed, Chaitin shows his own proofs for some of Gdel's and Alan Turing's work.  He goes on to describe his efforts in pursuing the weird number Omega, a number so long and complicated it is "just across the border between what we can deal with and things that transcend our abilities as mathematicians."  Readers who pick up this book should be warned that if Omega is across a border of understanding that challenges mathematicians like Chaitin, it is too complicated for a book of 200 pages to make plain to the uninitiated.  Chaitin has, however, given an explanation of his work on Omega that will give ordinary readers some idea of the nature of the questions involved; as he says about good questions, "You can't answer them in five minutes and it would be no good if you could."  Even better, he has shown just why he keeps probing at these esoteric frontiers of knowledge.  The discussion on the big ideas here goes back to ancient Greece, and you could trace it back longer if there were more of a written record.  The ideas may be big ones, and forever unresolvable, but Chaitin is undaunted in the pursuit of trying to clear up a further corner or two.  Omega itself is a defined as a probability; one can write a computer program to generate pi, but no program can generate Omega to any known degree of accuracy.  It is thus a number that can be defined and discussed, but cannot be truly known.  Chaitin shows that no mathematics, even at his level, will suffice to compute what Omega is.  And once again is illustrated the lesson from Gdel: there are strict limitations to what can be known by means of even the purest of mathematics.  But this is no reason to despair (and Chaitin comes off far from pessimistic).  Math is still a useful guide, and so often models the outside world with utility.    That even the purest mathematics is subject to the same sort of unknowns that all the sciences have to put up with is quite agreeable to Chaitin.  In fact, he is obviously delighted by his endeavor to clear up his little corners of knowledge, even though the effort might only mean that more questions have to be answered.  He clearly relishes this sort of role rather than the one that David Hilbert proposed for mathematicians at the turn of the last century.  Hilbert exhorted mathematicians to work out a formal system that would eliminate vagueness, make proofs obviously correct, and make all true statements provable.  Such a system might even be done by computer nowadays (and Chaitin pays attention to such computer languages as LISP that are indeed formal systems).  But Hilbert, Gdel proved, was wrong.  Chaitin repeatedly emphasizes with delight that mathematicians cannot take a machine-like approach to their work.  Intuition cannot be eliminated from mathematical enquiry, although not all intuitions are equally valid.  An intuitive approach is something he relishes as he does his thinking.  In fact, when he is working on a new idea, everything in quotidian life becomes unreal as he concentrates on his abstractions.  Listen to his description of this work: "It's pure sensuality, pure pleasure.  I put beautiful new ideas in the same category with beautiful women and beautiful art."  This is not the sort of eggheadism of the stereotypical mathematician, and Chaitin's book has fascinating facets of a self portrait, the sort of insights that even those who find its math daunting should be able to enjoy 
 I took a class from Dr. Buss while I was in college.  I highly recommend any of his books.  They are informative and interesting all at the same time.  
 With this volume, Richard Ellmann elevates Oscar Wilde into the select circle of Ireland's other literary giants of whom he wrote so eloquently:  William Butler Yeats and James Joyce.  (It was left to Michael Holroyd to  give George Bernard Shaw his due.)  While this volume is a sophisticated,  wide-ranging, scholarly biography, it also brims with Wilde's wit and bold  life, which, as Oscar himself pointed out, was where his genius lay.  The  slow, steady accumulation of detail, allusion and anecdote pays off as  Wilde reaches his pinnacle--the original production of "The Importance  of Being Earnest"--only to plunge into the abyss of imprisonment.  As  Wilde tempts fate with rough trade dalliances and his ill-conceived  challenge to the Marquess of Queensbury, you find yourself almost shouting  out for him to stop and save himself.  But he doesn't,  because Ellmann  makes us understand that Wilde's nature led him to that point.  The end is  sad, but his wit never deserts him, right up until his death throes when he  notes that either the wallpaper in the room must go or he must--which he  does shortly thereafter.  Today, qualities that Wilde pioneered are a part  of modern life:  camp humor, scathing put-downs, an emphasis on style, an  obsession with appearances.  In Wilde's day, he was an almost solitary  figure in that regard, leading the way into the modern world.  The  witticisms of "The Importance of Being Earnest" are as humorous  and apt today as the day they were first spoken in London in 1895.  Richard  Ellmann helps us understand why 
 Several years ago I was in a class at Cornell Law School that Drs. Clemente & Greenspan taught. Winning at M&A was a required text and their insights from working on several high profile deals were inspiring. Just a few years later, I am a successful in-house counsel to many recent acquisitions of a relatively high profile multi-national corporation. I have had the opportunity to share the finer lessons from Winning at M&A with our COO, director of Corporate Development, and our head of HR. Drs. Clemente & Greenspan have written an important book whose lessons seem to transcend time or circumstance. Just like Peter Drucker's management wisdom seems to apply to every company, economic environment, and business circumstance over the last 50 years, the work and guidance of Clemente & Greenspan in Winning at Mergers seems to be timeless and evolutionary. It allowed me as someone with little experience in the realm of consolidation and backwards integration to understand the ins and out of the process before I had ever sat in on a deal. This book should be read and kept by those who want to learn about business, marketing, or M&A 
 I ordered then of these heated lotion dispensers.  All arrived in perfect condition and in a timely fashion.  I received a heated lotion dispenser for a gift and love it so much that I bought them for my daughters, my sisters, and my friends.  I even bought one for my granddaughters so they have nice warm lotion to put on after a bath 
 If you have the slightest feeling that you may one day use a firearm for self-defense, you should buy this book and read it.  There are some caveats though.  Laws concerning guns and self-defense change constantly, and vary from state to state.  The state-of-the-art in firearms has changed a good bit since this book was written, i.e. most modern defense pistols work well with hollowpoint ammunition, and hollowpoints are leaps and bounds better than they were.  Take the information on guns and ammo in the book with a grain of salt.  I still reccommend this book because the state-of-mind type stuff still applies, and there aren't a lot of places to get this kind of information.  This book could very well save you lots of money and trouble.  If you are going to buy this book you should really consider buying the last two volumes of Combat Handgunnery and get yourself a subscription to Guns and American Handgunner magazines.  Check your local laws on self-defense, and check to see if your state has a "Castle Doctrine" law.  There are a few states where you have an obligation to retreat before shooting an intruder, even in your own home 
 Now in a newly revised and updated third edition, The Undefended Self: Living The Pathwork by teacher, therapist, lecturer and author Susan Thesenga is a practical and meaningful self-help guide that elaborates highly on the ancient wisdom of Socrates: "Know Thyself." From understanding and transforming the needs and desires of the lower self, mask self, and higher self to following a new spiritual path, The Undefended Self is a journey through the positive and negative sides of human nature toward a plateau of greater acceptance, self-esteem, and happiness. Especially recommended reading for readers aspiring toward their own enduring and personal transformation 
 I kept passing by this one in the video store. I figured that I would have heard of it if it was any good, right?  Wrong. It's almost ten years old as of this writing, and I never heard of it, and it's really good. I mean, Really Good, in lots of ways. It's got characters I can really care about. There's Leaven, for one (Nicole de Boer, aka Dax of DS9). She starts out as the stereotypical wimpy, screamy girl. Then there's Quentin, who starts out the take-charge cop, the one you're sure will get our little band out of this lethal labyrinth. Just keep two things in mind. First, everyone changes over the course of the movie. Second, wanting to see some jerk get it is also a kind of caring, just not a nice one.  The way the characters change is another thing to like. This movie borders on the minimalist, and its fair to say they didn't spend a terrible lot on sets and props. The characters carry everything, and do it surprisingly well. This isn't a Great Movie in the sense of literary snobishness, but still a heck of a flick. The actors, plus the script they're given to work with, really make the movie. Another bit to like is that spending thing - they didn't do much. The actors are all good, but not in the gazillion-dollar class. Sets and props are well done, but there's not much to them. Costuming couldn't have cost more than $20 for each of seven actors. All this proves that money doesn't make a movie: artists and artistic vision do. Maybe money helps, but Cube shows that you can still get a big-budget feel on a very modest budget.  What's not to like? The ending. I'll let you get there on your own. Maybe that's why this movie didn't take off and make a boatload of money for everyone involved. But, they didn't spend a lot, so I hope they all went happily to the bank anyway. They deserve every nickel they made from it.  //wiredweir 
 A caveat to all Westerners who may think our most sacrosanct values are protected.  Silva reaches into inner space to warn us of the dedicated nature of the enemy.  If this is fiction, it is well dressed as a wake-up call to its readers 
 Remy is a girl who goes through lots of boyfriends.  There's always two to three weeks of fun, then they are out the door, and she's moved on.  Then finally she finds someone who doesn't fit any of her priorities, but she still falls for him.  She just thinks this relationship will last over summer, but he has different ideas.   The main character grabbed my attention from the beginning.  Remy reminded me a lot of my own self.  Even though she reminded me of myself I still had dislikes about her.  I disliked how she didn't think she needed any love from anyone in her life.  I did like how she didn't deal with drama in her life, which is the way I try to live my own. 
 This is a complex, somewhat clumsy, thick, odd, and eventually wonderful novel. James Page is a crusty old Vermonter who blasts his TV with a shotgun and locks his 80-year old sister, Sally, in her bedroom. While imprisoned there, she finds and reads a cheap paperback thriller about marijuana smugglers in Mexico (actually written by Gardner and his first wife, Joan). The two stories are then woven together with considerable leaps of time and missing pages in the thriller. At times, Gardner wanders around in philosophy la-la land, while at other times he can write the most surreal and beautiful poetic prose about nature, and at still other times he can portray the emotional torture endured by James and eventual redemption of his humane spirit. The introduction, by Tom Bissell, a Gardner admirer, is excellent. We will never know why Gardner had to die at age 49, or whether he willed it; but this novel stands as one of his very best. My own favorite, however, is Nickel Mountain, a much earlier work 
 Folks who accuse 'Krull' of being a 'Star Wars' derivative, should keep in mind that 'Star Wars' in itself was 'inspired' by the likes of 'The Hidden Fortress' and such.  What is so special about 'Krull' is that the journey to the Beast's lair is as fun and entertaining as the climatic battle near the end, if not more so.  The only bone I have to pick with the movie is that they should've retained actress Lysette Anthony's soft and sweet voice instead of the obvious overdub 
 I loved this story.  It was written in true steel fashion...exciting, interesting, and fullfilling 
 I have five kids ranging from 6 years old to 18. This game can be played by all - individually or in teams. It is basically a scavenger hunt... each person or team gets five cards, and has to find the things listed on the cards. Some of the things we have had to look for in the past: a station wagon, a vehicle with mudflaps, a "yield" sign, someone walking their pet and and my favorite.... "something that is upside down."  Obviously, someone other than the driver needs to be able to read. Sometimes things have to be explained to younger kids. As you explain, they learn - what could be better? (We had a great conversation once about why tractor trailers have all those stickers on them.)  If you have to travel with kids, and you value your sanity, this game might be for you 
 Terrific cast explores the question of ethics in the world of G.I.'s upon their return from WWII. An examination of the value of honesty in communications, whether in the marketplace or in the home. Interesting for period detail. 
 I saw this movie today by accident. I was surfing the channels and came upon the opening of the movie. This movie made me cry and inspired me to do more of what I do. I work with kids who are almost as bad off as these were. It proves that kids respond to a caring adult, and even tough love. This movie is truly inspirational and I plan to purchase it immediately and show it to my kids 
 As I was reading this book, I couldn't help but wonder about all the research she must have done.  She not only shows proficiency in ancient Greek, Catholic ritual and history, and centuries of religious history but through it all she even manages to provoke an interest in Dante without putting you to sleep!  You end up solving the puzzles right along with the characters, similar to the Da VInci code- but oh, so much better.  This could easily be called the thinking person's DaVinci Code.  To top it all off, she throws in a surprising and untypical love story.  I found my self desperately wishing this story was true and was truly disapointed that it wasn't by the end of the book   This story was a a great antidote to all the dumdum fiction out there now.  So, for a fun read that dunks you headfirst into a whole other world, I can't recommend it highly enough.  It is really just.. wonderful.  
 Jeff Beck has always been one of my favorite guitarists.  This disc really proves that he's still got the edge!  I highly recommend this disc.  Caution: do not order from Yodelin'Pig.  Although this is supposed to be the Japanese import version of this disc, they sent me the domestic version 
 The book provides a concrete, actionable framework for steps to get your IT organization under control. The ITIL framework can be an overwhelming body of information. This book extracts the real world examples of what works and what doesn't. It helps dispell some of the myths about change control processes. Great starter book or quick reference guide for implementing your own ITIL based control processes 
 Oh, what a great, great, GREAT movie!  Now I'm sure that a lot of born again Christians might not find this movie redeemable in any way because afterall, it is poking fun at the Christian faith, epecially the "born agains" and the "fundamentalists". But even before the movie came out, I found that group of people to be particularly entertaining, anyway.  There is a great line in this movie when the Mandy Moore (Hilary) character throws a Bible at the Jena Malone character (Mary) and Mary says to her, "This isn't a weapon..."  Wow. Wow oh wow oh wow...the Bible isn't a weapon and yet sooo many "good" Christians use it that way. They're all about being loving BUT they'll only love you if you believe EXACTLY like they do. They're all about forgiveness and compassion, but only after you grovel and beg for it. Now, I'm sure there are a lot of really wonderful Christians out there and if you're one of them drop me an email at.....what...did you honestly think I was gonna tell you? Yeah, sorry, guys but I did the "saved" things years ago...somehow I couldn't swallow it hook, line, and sinker.  Don't get me wrong. I love Jesus. I love his teachings. I think his teachings could totally transform the world. I just don't think it was his intention to be worshipped. Now, I could be wrong but if Jesus was truly "God" why would he get upset with that person when he said, "There is none good, but God alone." Why wouldn't he have said, "There is none good but me!"   Jesus was Divine...but so are you...so am I...we don't need a religion to follow to be worthy. Afterall, God created us in "His" Image and Likeness. We are not human beings who are having a spiritual experience; we are spiritual beings having a human experience. This is  a very spiritual movie. Its message  that everyone of us is redeemable is very powerful. That all "sin" is a mistake and we can always go to God for everything we could ever want or need no matter what because the divine has never ever once refused us. No matter if we're gay, or belong to another religion, or even if we don't belong to any religion. God is with us now and forever.  So, rent this movie or better yet, buy it. If you are a fundamentalist and it ruffles your feathers, good! Maybe you need to question your beliefs. Maybe you need to just follow the two commandments of Jesus (1) Love God with all your mind, heart and soul and (2) Love your neighbor as yourself because your neighbor is an expresion of God no matter what he/she may appear to be.  Spirit loves you...always has...always will...get this movie. 
 Parts of this recording are so beautiful that when I listen while working, I have to pause what I am doing and close my eyes. I don't remember how I ended up buying this CD (it certainly wasn't planned), but I am so grateful.  My rabbit hates it though. When I listen to it at home, he stamps his feet. So I can only listen to it at work. : 
 When my 3 daughters (aged 6, 9 and 11) first got this video, they thought it was "baby-ish"- they even mocked the "animal" moves instead of joining in; however, the next day, early in the morning I caught the middle one hopping to the music and cheerfully trying it out!! the little one soon joined in (the 11 year old still refuses to, of course).. ever since they tried it, I wake up to the sound of the "elephant", which cracks them up EVERY morning- it sure beats other sounds that used to beam through the TV set those lazy summer mornings!! 
 This book shows you how to live and diet with ordinary food. Common sense and smart shopping can really be fun and easy if you follow the guidelines in this book 
 An invaluable resource to homeschooling families to use with studies on coinage.  This delightful and moving story could easily be joined hand in hand with a study on the coins of America.  The content fully supports the  type of family values normally found in the homes were homeschooling is a  must 
 This was one of the early Aphex Twin records from ten years ago. It was released as two rare EPs. The second one is hard to find. I know this sort of stuff because I spent a lot of the 1990s listening to techno. Luckily for those who own these records, this is a CD only release. Aphex Twin released many records as Richard D. James, but as AFX, it was reserved for often more experimental works, and more obscure. This record documents the early AFX. It often mixes odd drum breaks with the sound of children talking. It's not too different from the recent "Rubber Johnny" record. This is worthwhile. 
 I really love the music of the carter family, and bought this album being familiar with mother maybelle as a member of the group, but not with her as a solo performer...man what a treat this album is. Anyone who has even a vague interest in folk or early country should get this. It's a very intimate performace by one of the most talented women in traditional music. This is a gem that takes your breath away...makes you feel like you're right in the audience (i found myself feeling relieved when she announed an encore song...even though i knew from the tracklist there'd be one). there should be more records like this out there...because maybelle on her own is just as overpowering as any outfit she has been a part of. Get this  
 I really recommend any book written by this great man. This book truly gets to the essence of what praying is all about. I was touched by these prayers, reading them was like a peaceful meditation.   Thank You Miguel...Pau 
 The book has lots of great drawing. I wish it had more explanations. But I still love it 
 My son really enjoyed this book for its interesting presentation of math..  he even named a cat puppet after Penrose.  
 Simply stunning flick on HD DVD.  Considering early reviews that downplayed the difference between standard DVD and HD, I wasn't expecting such an incredible image (and some HD DVDs aren't that much of an improvement over regular DVD; see SERENITY).  This is the disc I'll throw on whenever I want to show someone what HD DVD is all about.  As for the movie, this is what sci-fi should be: daring and way over the top.  After PITCH BLACK, who would have have thought Riddick's story would have taken such an epic turn?  I don't know whether it's an ego trip, creative cliff diving, or a just a return to "old school" sci-fi where writers created new myths, unique worlds, and bizarre technology (and tread dangerously toward embarrassment with coining their own vocabulary -- can it get any better than "Underverse" and "Necromongers"?).  I hope it's the latter, but it doesn't matter.  Just enjoy the ride.  With all the tired sci-fi thrown at us by Hollywood, it's great to have something fresh given to us.  Forget what you've read from critics and the fanboys out there; THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK is the real goods.  Great HD DVD 
 interesting and informational, I love i 
 I am throughly sick of all the people that are calling us morons and stupid and stuff like that.  Name-calling only shows your immaturity.  Keep it to yourself!  As for the book, I think it is a good read.  But listen, if you have any problems with us, you don't have to call names and put us down in other ways.  It makes me so angry.  I don't go around telling you guys that you're stupid morons for what you believe 
 Place your left on this bible! This is what I consider to be my very own bible and it was introduced to me by Kathleen Scokzen in a class called Global Women's Issues. This woman (well, maria and Kathleen!) is right on point and brilliant if you ask me.  Her explanation of the Object/Relations theory is probably one of my favorite sections.  Anyway, everyone should own this book! Ame 
 Perhaps its birdsong which is the attraction: if so, pick up Donald Kroodsma's The Singing Life Of Birds: The Art And Science Of Listening To Birdsong. Learn about how birds acquire their songs, how they vary between species and places, and how to identify birds through song. First-person observation and reporting accompanies scientific facts and research. Professor Kroodsma has studied birds and their songs for over thirty years; but his The Singing Life Of Birds is that perfect cross between research and casual observation which makes it engrossing to a wider audience than college-level students of ornithology. 
 Nice photos, adorable kitties, regular ol' calendar.  My kitten is cuter than any of these, tho 
 If you saw it in theaters and liked it then you like this dvd as well.  The special features are awesome 
 I really have the feeling that I am not knowledgable enough about the period in question in the Thucydides to provide any kind of reasonable context for the work. Instead, this review will focus on some reading tips and reactions aimed at the more generalist reader who may be attempting to get through the text.  First, the text is daunting. Be patient with it, and put it down if you need to. It pays off. I'm not someone who reads battle scenes with absorption, and still I found that if I absorbed the text in small enough doses, then I was able to follow with interest.  Second, use the appendices at the back. The explanations about the Spartan and Athenian Leagues, the Greek monetary system, and the Melian dialogues were actually quite helpful in places for reading the text. These appendices are provided in the Penguin edition of the Thucydides.  Third, take notes. There are a lot of big thoughts, and I found that I absorbed them better by writing them down for myself to think about later.  It is time-consuming to attempt the History of the Peloponnesian War. It is also worth it, to my mind. I got a lot out of reading it even without being a historian with expertise in the time and region. Give it a try, and give it the space that it deserves.  "So it is now reasonable for us to hope that the gods will be kinder to us, since by now we deserve their pity rather than their jealousy. 
 The only band that can give thrash greats Megadeth and Slayer a run for their money, its unfortunate that they are never mentioned alot, even though they were just as important to the thrash genre as Kreator, Pantera, and the Big Four of thrash. My complaint aside, this album is by far one of the greatest metal albums of 1991 and by far Sepultura's greatest ever. While Metallica was slowing down their speed and simplifying their riffs, Sepultura was doing the exact opposite. This CD is so blazingly fast, it nearly topples Slayer's Reign in Blood in overall headbanging madness and crazy solos.   Songs Arise, Dead Embryonic Cells, Desperate Cry, and Infected Voice are my favorites, but there are no weak spots in this classic. Also worth checking out are Kreators Pleasure to Kill, Sepulturas Beneath the Remains, Slayers Seasons in the Abyss, and Megadeths Countdown to Extinction for some thrashy goodness 
 I wasn't expecting much when I dropped this 1998 movie into the DVD player...  There is a lot to commend itself. Matt Damon gives a convincing performance of a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer who finds himself with a big case on his hands just as he passes the bar exam! Danny Devito is slimy, shady, sarcastic, and sleazy (in other words, perfect Devito) as Damon's partner.  The main story involves a poor family whose son is denied needed medical treatment for leukemia. The sleazy Big Insurance Company has denied his claim and betting that they will not press the matter. They bet wrong! Our hero, guided by some unlikely supporters and a sympathetic judge (Dixon from Alias), come to the rescue.  The pieces fit together quite nicely. Justice is served, bad guys are taken down, and Matt Damon establishes himself as an unlikely, unwilling hero and endears himself to the pretty girl in the process.  Nothing wrong with this story or this film. Very delightful and satisfying in every respect.  
 This is an incredibly researched work.  Marguerite Feitlowitz has interviewed and probed into Argentina's past with an ear toward the language used and its effect upon the victims of the Dirty War. As a person  who has studied and written about this time, I was fascinated to read her  approach. The language used by the torturers of Argentina was sinister and  telling; she has solved the puzzle of their words and let the world  understand their aims and goals.   	It is a brilliant book, and  important for anyone who is interested in 1) Human rights; 2) Latin  American history; 3) Human nature; 4) The politics of a nation's memory 
 I bought this set just for the cube speakers, which I use as wall-mounted rear surround sound speakers since they are so light.  I think they sound great.  I hooked them up as my main speakers just to test, and they sounded great as well.  Very crisp sound.  I have not noticed any "holes" in the sound as commented by other reviewers, and they are perfect for my home theatre.  I can't comment on the bass module because I don't even use it, but I bet its not that great given how small and different it is from Bose's other more expensive bass modules.

 And this film is proof.  Too bad I got it on some cheap, crappy double feature DVD with a horrible transfer, but it was still worth all the icky graininess to watch it.  Good suspense, yet barely any plot.  I don't know how he does it, but he does this type of murder mystery/slasher mix pretty well.  DEFINATELY reccomended 
 "The Encyclopedia of TV Game Shows" is the bible to game shows. Over 500 game shows are recorded in this book, full of information to rack your mind on game shows. Classic favorites from yesterday such as "What's My Line?", "I've Got a Secret", "Beat the Clock", "Strike It Rich", and "Twenty-One" are included with current favorites such as "Wheel of Fortune", "The Price is Right", "Jeopardy", "Family Feud", "Hollywood Squares", and "Pyramid". Included also is information on the celebrities who guest stared on the game shows, the personalities and a synopsis of their careers, airdates of the shows, what network they were on, the rules, the different versions, and even the prizes won and funny moments or bloppers that happened on the show. The book also includes information on awards won, a tribute to Mark Goodson, a brief history of game shows, and over 170 photographs to help you remember. The only negative things about the book was that some shows were short-changed ("Press Your Luck" for example, they should have talked about Michael Larson and the different whammies), and it hasn't been updated, so some shows are MIA ("Millionaire", "Weakest Link", "Blind Date", updated versions of old shows, etc.), but these are minor things that don't hurt the book much at all. In 60 seconds and for the grand prize: -How many shows did Bill Cullen host? -Who hosted "All-Star Blitz?" -What game show was on CBS in the 1990's for only one episode? -What three game shows did game show announcer Johnny Gilbert host? -What was the orignial format of "Wheel of Fortune?" -What host brought the Beatles to L.A.? -What game show had a town named after it? -What game show was made into an ice cream by Baskin-Robbins?  You will learn the answer to these quesions and more by reading this book. It's a lot of fun and you won't be able to put it down 
 I just saw this exhibit at our MoMA, and the work is outstanding. Some of the images are color, some black and white. There are a number of styles and artists, ranging from the very famous to those unknown outside of their small communities. The point is that these are images of musicians--it's that simple.   Sometimes, Liebovitz's work is witty, sometimes it is unflinching in its honest portrayal. There is vulnerability in the subjects of her black and whites because they are so close, often just the face of the subject. To term them "ugly" is simply wrong. It is rare to see behind the artifice of celebrity images and see performers without makeup and with their skin texture and pores visible. Some of the photos are taken in people's homes, or backstage rather than on a set. This lends considerably to the intimacy and honesty that she is trying to convey.  If you want shots of your favorite singer looking oh so pretty, go to their PR person. This is a serious body of work from a renowned photographer. It blends both her celebrity work with her own private interests in portrait photography for non-commercial audiences. 
 Wow... timing really is everything.  Hearing what an amazing book this was when it first came out, I picked up the first trade -- which collected the first four issues -- and was a bit underwhelmed.  So, I stopped reading.  Now, I could not be happier that I took a chance on this hardcover (the purchase of which was prompted by similar, although stronger, praise).  Robert Kirkman, Cory Walker, Ryan Ottley, and Bill Crabtree have created something really special.  Invincible tells the story of Mark Grayson, whose father Nolan is the world's most powerful superhero, Omni-Man.  Besides this fact, Mark, a high-schooler, has had a relatively normal life, until one day, he starts developing super powers.  So, he calls himself "Invincible," and, often at the side of his father, begins to learn the family business.  Or so he thinks.  You see, there are really two series here: Everything that happens before issue #7, and everything that happens after it.  That's because issue #7 marks one of the most satisfying stunners I can recall ever reading in a comic book.  (Of course, I won't spoil it here.)  So, the first four issues were still a little flat.  They were okay -- very nice to look at, with some memorable characters (Atom Eve and Robot come to mind) -- but it all felt like standard superhero stuff.  However, starting with #5 (Mark's space-tangle with a confused alien), things take off a little.  With each passing issue, the stakes are raised: Mark's powers develop, we meet the Invincible version of the JLA archetypes... and then it happens.  *COUGH*  By the end of issue #13 (the last in the collection), there's a new status quo, one that promises some very interesting stories in the future.  Robert Kirkman has been, as far as I can tell, either gloriously brilliant or terribly mediocre with his comics writing.  While Marvel Team-Up and his ill-fated Captain America run were of the latter, stuff like Walking Dead and Invincible is, thankfully, of the former.  The pacing is great; Kirkman seems to understand when to give detail (for instance, how superpowers would affect the relationship between a boy and his best friend) and when to gloss over it (after Mark gets his powers, we don't go through all of his training, which would be tedious and repetitive; we just hear of it).  The plot devices, which would just be spectacular stunts in another series, actually serve to move the story along here.  Kirkman's characters, the ones that aren't archetypes, really pop with energy, like the aforementioned Atom Eve and Monster Girl, a chain-smoking little girl who can morph into a grotesque creature.  The characters' actions give them depth, or more accurately, the characters' depth dictates their actions.  It really feels like Kirkman & Co. just assembled the pieces and let the story tell itself.  Not to overstate my case, but it sort of like reading Carver or Hemingway: There are no wasted words here.  Every character and every line of dialogue does something, which adds to the tremendous energy of the book as a whole.  Also, more than any other comic I've read, Invincible loves to pile on the in-jokes.  First, there are the story arcs, with names like "Family Matters" (the first arc, which deals with the Grayson family's daily lives and includes characters who attend Reginald Vel Johnson High School under the supervision of Principal Winslow), "Eight is Enough" (because of the seven members of the Guardians of the Globe, plus Omni-Man), and "Perfect Strangers" (in which the big twist and the character-altering aftermath come).  Then, there are panels, even entire pages, there solely for the benefit of the readers paying close attention.  For instance, in the first issue, one of the signs that Mark's powers are arriving is that he accidentally hurls a bag of trash into the stratosphere.  Then, in #6, we're treated to a full page that simply shows a man walking his dog in England -- he's soon startled by the same bag of trash, which lands a few feet (meters?) away from him.  "Ey, wot?!" is all he can manage.  Had I not been reading the collected edition, I might not have understood the page, at least not so quickly.  But since I was, it was a fantastic touch, and there are others like it, all of which show the creators' respect for their readers.  The artwork is uniformly stellar, not an easy thing to accomplish with two different artists.  But that's the thing: If I hadn't known beforehand that there were two artists on this book, I might not have figured it out.  Walker and Ottley's styles here are so similar.  If anything, the book improves a little when Ottley comes aboard (issue #8), as his figures are just a bit more fluid than Walker's.  But honestly, it's hard to think of a book that's better looking than Invincible.  No other title boasts quite the same combination of vivid color (Crabtree deserves kudos),  dynamic action, and distinctive figures.  (The detail on some of these faces -- unbelievable!)  And those character designs -- mostly Walker's, from what I gather -- are stunning.  Omni-Man, the Immortal, Atom Eve, and Allen the Alien all have great looks.  It'd be hard to argue that this is not how superheroes would look were they actually real.  Should have stuck with this book originally.  Oh well.  But I guess it's actually nice that I caught the hardcover collection, which is loaded with extras, some useful and interesting (the full script for the first issue, original character designs and concepts), some not so much (a few too many panel layouts).  I can't imagine Invincible reading better as a monthly than a collected edition, and I can't imagine a collected edition that gives you more bang for your buck than the Utlimate Collection.  I absolutely cannot wait for volume two 
 Stephen P. Robbins provides a broad overview of effective management principles. While many of these principles are familiar, Robbins writes in a compelling, authoritative style, and he uses behavioral research to bolster many of his suggestions, some of which go against common practice. Skeptical? Just look at his examples of companies that have used these methods successfully, and his comments from experts in the field. The chapters are organized into a series of short bites, presented as "truths" about different areas of management. This small easy-to-carry book is handy for reading in chunks while you wait or commute on the train. We recommend it as a handy summary of general management wisdom supported by the findings of behavioral research and nicely seasoned with occasional nuggets of information on effective, but less common, techniques 
 When my child was first diagnosed I ordered twenty different recipe/cookbooks for special diets/allergies.  This is one of 2 that I actually use frequently.  The recipes are simple and my child likes them.  The information on substituting ingredients and creating safe versions of forbidden items is excellent.  Most of all I found the author's attitude and sense of humor very liberating and empowering.  Reading this book always makes me feel that I can do this.  It's an excellent starter book to help a parent or the newly diagnosed person with food allergies to get control of their diet and attitude.  I highly recommend it 
 The Essence of Dreams...The Creativeness of Silence...The Fortitude of Love...   
 13 Little Blue Envelopes was pretty cute. Not quite a "must read," but I would definitely recommend it. Ginny goes around Europe following her aunt's orders and really discovers who she never thought she could be. A good, short, semi-funny novel 
 Author Paul Johnson did a masterful job of exposing both the genius and hypocrisy of the intellectual breed. The book is a fascinating historical accounting and a spicy gossip page simultaneously. The book is very fun to read and very informative. I have become a Paul Johnson fan and can't wait to read his other writings 
 This is the first episode where we really see the heart of Tony in his dealings with a teenager struggling with the horrible death of his father. A must see 
 This is a book rich in provoking thought. While I have read it more than once through cover to cover, I still keep it handy to read sections of again. It approaches mindfulness from a Western thought perspective and avoids the comparisons with Eastern thought. This is not a detriment. It helps to focus the material. It is also the source of much of the ongoing playing with ideas that I still find with this book. By now, you may have realized that Ellen has not presented us with a silver bullet. But she does provide much insight in the relationship between the physical and the mental. The third party view or that of an outsider coming into a group, are both inherently examples of mindfulness. Without pre-set notions, anything is possible. Read and enjoy 
 Exactly what I expected. Good service by Amazon. Good price. Shipped quickly. And the fryer seems to be even better (heats quicker, larger capacity) than the old Frydaddy (many years old) which I dropped and broke. I'm very satisfied 
 I really enjoyed this book and have purchase the next book in series.  If you are a fan of Dean Koontz you will not be disappointed.  I give it four stars only because it is one of those books where you have to get past a chapter or two before you are hooked in, but well worth the wait.  Whew, what a ride 
 If you like cats, you'll appreciate how this one's personality comes through. SIX-DINNER SID is a black cat who gets whatever he wants -- most of the time. It's a simple, funny story you can read over and over. The illustrations are marvelous, with bright and pastel colors, and lovely detail in the flowers, etc. You can even see the cat's individual hairs and whiskers. The streets look somehow European (the book was originally published in the UK, so I suppose that's where it's set). I love the street scene on pages 3 and 4 so much I'd like to frame it! As for the wonderful cat, the pictures really capture his personality, the angles cats love to contort into, and the idiosyncracies of catdom. How fun 
 I originally saw this film in 1972 when it came out and it was intense.  Usually, when I re-visit a film years later, I have a different response then when I first saw it.  This one still got to me, so I checked the credits.  It was written by Robert Bloch.  That's why it still works. 
 This text presents itself as moderate level of reading and most subjects must be read twice to understand the content 
 Oliver Stone, along with Woody Allen, Martin Scorcese,and Stephen Speilberg, are arguably the most prolific maintream hollywood directors of the last quarter century. This doesn't mean they are not, at times, controversial, and Stone is probably the most controversial. JFK, Nixon, are like Alexander, somehat fictionalizedc historical films. Moreover, in Alexander Stone attempts to resurrect a lost breed (mostly from the mid 50's to the mid 60's- the apogee of American unquestioned power and imperialism) the historical epic. The epic, according to literary theorists, is often an attempt to give an almost divine right to imperial escapades.  In this film, Stone offers an Epical blueprint (the probably closest relative is The Gladiator)  of the rise and fall of empires.Anthony Hopkins, as narrator and Ptolmey, uses the term Orientalist is his description of Alexander's quest. Orientalism, of those who have read Edward Said's brilliant work of the same name, is the the slanted-imperialist attitude of Europe- and later the US- in viewing people from unfamiar cultures as inferior, sexual and violent heathens, and conquerable for their own good. This attitude which reached it's zenith in highly imperialitic 19th century Europe, and is an underlying attitude- and justification- for the US's current middle eastern preemptive and dehuhamizing aggressive policies.  The movie, itslf, is worth the time. The Macedonian flashbacks  seem to take away from the building tension of the movie. It's good that Oliver is re-editing it. I would prefer Jolie as Alexamder's wife, Roxanna, rather than his mother. Firth, himself,is pretty good as Alexander but seems a bit too frail and introspective- but his "humane" proto-imperialistic/paternalistitic vision seems on the mark, and distinguishes him, and the movie. Also, their failure to defeat India and older and more evolved culture bespeaks of the limits of Empire- and Orientalism. However, I would have preferred a little more wisdom imparted from Alexander's teacher- and one of the world's greatest philosphers, Aristotle. But, perhaps, that's my own preference. This is not a European art film, nor does it intend to be.  One does not need to see this picture as conceptually and critically as I do to enjoy it, but to realize that there are many parallels in Alexander's quest to modern meglomaiac ventures does help one see this as a more cohesive and meaningful effort. Stone, the big picture histoical and cultural critic does it again; but the movie does still need a little tweeking.  
 Torn, as in whether to rate this book as a useful instructional guide, or boring casual reading.  Torn, as in the author's feelings on whether to write about the sentiment and philosophy behind photography. Sections get weighed down by the author's need to discuss (in overly maudlin terms) the creative expression offered by photography. I would have preferred a book to be either wholly technical or entirely emotional (and clearly presented as such, so that I could avoid it).  Torn, as in the pages falling from this poorly bound book. Several friends have informed me that their copies fell apart, too.  All in all, I found the procedural information to be clear and concise, covering not just basics, but some more interesting darkroom techniques. It seemed that the rest was serving as filler; personally I would prefer more picture examples and less of the non-procedural text. However, this book is a good alternative to some of the better, but unfortunately out of print, darkroom guides 
 I love this movie i saw it at the movies 2 times t.i. played a great roll in this movie this is a must have movie for your collection and also a great and wonderful movie for a teenager 
 This is a great book.  Takes you behind the world of horse racing.  Lots of twists and turns.  Really enjoyed this book 
 Although this book is not nearly as Popular as Kite Runner, it gives a more accurate representation of life under the Taliban.  In Kite Runner this was almost a passing fancy.  Here everyday life is more accurately portrayed in the lives of simple people enmeshed in the realities of Talibanian existence both from in insider's and outsider's perspective.  Although not nearly the comfortable read as Kite Runner, if the reader wants a flavor of living under the Taliban, this is the place to read.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is I believe the book could have given a more complete vignette then it did 
 First of all i would like to say this is possibly the greatest rock album that i own.  This album might not appeal to most people because not every song sounds the same... they are actually almost all different almost entirely.  After hearing "nothing sacred" i figured that this band would be just like every other "rock" band out there untill i listened to the whole cd.  You can not judge cd on it's first listen either.  I actually listened to it once and then tossed it on the back seat of my car as i have done with most of my favorite bands.  If you are going to listen to any song at all then listen to "figure 8"  While it may be a 13 minute song and most people who enjoy todays "pop rock" don't even have the attention span to pay attention to anything for 13 minutes it is possibly one of the greatest songs i have ever heard.  If you can not find the genius in this song then your favorite bands are probably staind, korn or chevelle (ok so i couldn't mock tensionexperiment's review with nonpoint seeing as how they are my second favorite band but i'm sure he doesn't understad their music either)  If you like something new and different and you didn't think that nothing sacred was a "bad@$$ hard rock song" then take a closer look at this album, you'll be suprise 
 Robert Clark author of Intelligence Analysis, has written an extremely comprehensive work on the discipline of intelligence analysis.  -Intelligence Analysis is a must read for every analyst, whether you are new to the profession, a seasoned professional, or someone who really wants to understand the analysis field.  Clark provides insight into the target-centric approach and provides many useful examples as well. This book will become the premier reference on intelligence techniques and analysis for every true analyst 
 After waiting for 4 years SP is back to his best with Hotel Costes 9. Not since Hotel Costes 5, has there been a more elicit mix of chill, tango and simple chords that make a really good Hotel Costes, the best in its class. # 9 is in the grand style of Hotel Costes 2,3,4,5 - which after last years dissapointment breaths new life into this label. 
 I play a 120 bass Piano Accordion and I saw this toy accordion and it just stole my heart. It's a sturdy little diatonic accordion and it's beautifully tuned in chords so you can't play a wrong note. It's a load of fun, and when my friends say they can't play music--- I hand them this little axe and they have a blast! It's compact, beautiful, and a load of fun for anyone of any age!  
 Great concept and easy to follow. Our 2 yr. 8 month old boy was potty trained over the weekend. We did nothing previously to potty train him until we read this book and put the time aside to do this. Grantid, he did not leave the house for two days but we were finished by Sunday. No pull ups at night, no accidents. It's now been 3 months. Good luck 
 This book encompasses the best of both poetry and natural beauty.  Though Dr. Ackerman does sometimes get lost in the turn of a phrase, one cannot help but be caught up in her passionate adventures and her reverence for nature 
 Set at the beginning of the twentieth century, Ford Madox Ford's novel "The Good Soldier" is the story of two married couples Edward and Leonora Ashburnham and John and Florence Dowell. The couples meet while wandering in Europe, and after becoming acquaintances, they continue to meet every year in Nauheim in Germany. The Ashburnhams are leading a nomadic life thanks to Edward's scandalous behaviour with a number of women. Leonora, a beautiful but cold Irish-Catholic has assumed responsibility for their financial affairs after Edward squanders a fortune on a courtesan. Edward, "The Good Soldier" is a former British Army officer. He's noble, brave, and capable of fantastic acts of benevolence. When he enters a room, his good looks and confident bearing "snapped up the gaze of every woman." Everyone--except Leonora--admires Edward. The American couple, the Dowells are wandering around Europe thanks to Florence's delicate health. Florence's 'heart condition' forbids another transatlantic trip, and John is more or less Florence's nursemaid.  Many years after first meeting the Ashburnhams, narrator John Dowell recalls the key events in their lives. Dowell is the quintessential "unreliable narrator." He is simply unaware of his wife's true nature, and blissfully ignorant of the passionate events taking place under his nose. So when events come to a head, and he can no longer ignore the obvious, Dowell attempts to piece together the events that took place years before, and he asks: "who in this world knows anything of any other heart--or of his own?"  "The Good Soldier" is a brilliantly structured novel--a masterpiece in character study. Dowell's function is mainly to record the events that he failed to interpret correctly at the time of occurrence. He isn't a main player here--rather, he's a historian who elects to ignore what he didn't wish to see. Yet, by the time the novel ends, Dowell possesses great insight and understanding of all the other characters--Leonora, who effectively emasculates her erring husband, Edward whose weakness and sentimentality ruin him, Florence, whose self-righteousness and ability to deceive reaches astronomically hideous proportions, and Nancy, the ward of the Ashburnhams, whose desire to punish Edward matches Leonora's. Above all, Dowell effectively translates the notion that a great tragedy has taken place. Leonora and Edward are trapped by their marriage and by their natures. Leonora's response to Edward's irresponsibility is the only choice she can make, and consequently, the Ashburnhams' incompatibility is endured in insufferable silence. Many literary critics consider "The Good Soldier" to be one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century--I think it's one of the most powerful and complex novels about adultery and betrayal that I have ever read--displacedhuman 
 Margot Weinstein succeeded in extracting a number of important career development competencies from practice. This book is not theoretical in nature, which makes it very accessible. It takes real life situations and problems as examples and builds on these in order to define and enhance career success. A good read for anyone interested in expanding their own career potential. 
 As a admirer of historical older homes across Amrica, and a recent returnee to college at age 49 for a second career in interior architecture, this book is a welcome site.  I have a collection of architectual books of Mansions in every grouping or by an architect or designer.  The one minor flaw that I and other reviewers have had is that while the original black & white photos of the manisions with update written information on the current condition is great, we never see photos (if possible) of the homes as they look today.  This one actually shows on occasion a current photo of the house as possible.  Example is of Zog Ruins just off of Highway 106. Zog was abandoned by its owner in the early 1950's and the gatekeeper left it in 1959.  The house was vandilized in the 60's. The photos of the house are as the house as it sat in ruins during the 60's and the last photo is dated 1968.   The books photos are not done in the slick style other books on mansions are done, but rather in a personal photo scrap book sort of way.  One can actually feel the way M. Randall felt as she assemblied this book.  Ms. Randall pours her heart into her personal scrap with love and care and it is seen thru out the marvelious book.  Photos are in B&W and color.....while the color ones appear to be Poloariod style, it is refreshing to see them presented this way.  Text is simple and straight forward.  This would be a great learning tool in architecture and interior design schools as a reference or teaching book on preservation & restoration.  This book is a must for lovers of Long Island, New York or great mansions of anykind 
 This book gives a great overview of issues that most effect women by sharing stories and facts to illustrate important areas where change needs to occur, from childcare and family issues to equal pay, and women in sports and science.   I found it quick and easy to read--and I have very little time as a working mom!--with practical and doable actions if I so chose. For example, I was appalled to hear about the state of (very little or misleading!) sex education for high school students. Since I have kids about to enter their teens, this issue spoke to me. And it gave several ways for me to get active: by not supporting funding for harmful abstinence programs; asking my elected officials to fund honest and comprehensive sex ed; and then how to make sure my kids develop their own decision-making and critical thinking skills related to sex (and how to talk to them about it!) And this is just one of the 50 Ways... in the book.   I highly recommend this for people who want to get involved but are not sure how--and who don't have time to read huge volumes of books on politics and public policy.  
 I thoroughly enjoyedthe book and it had alot of useful information in it. The dj returning was a nice touch 
 I agree with the other readers, with one caveat: an annoying distraction for me while reading this otherwise excellent book was the author's chronic use of incorrect terminology when referring to female genitalia.  There are at least 5 or 6 points in the book where she refers to a woman's vagina, when what she clearly means is vulva.  It's just irritating when female writers, especially, don't know the parts of the female body 
 this has been one of my favorite novels for a very long time now. faulkner's delicate diction and command of character never fails to impress me.  the book deals with the death of addie, the mother of the bundren family. each chapter is voiced by a different character, and each character has their own way of dealing with the grief caused by addie's absence, from obstinate stoicism to complete psychic breakdown. in one chapter, addie herself speaks from beyond the grave and reveals her true feelings about the family she left behind. some may find the novel to be a difficult read, but it's well worth the effort to enjoy this quintessential faulkner offering 
 To paraphrase JOhn Lennon: evereybody's talking about Marxism and Modernism, Structuralism and sociologism, this-ism and that-ism; all I am saying, is give the narrative a chance.  That is really what this greatest critic of all time - a man who is to literary criticism what Beethoven is to music, or Tocqueville to history, or Shakespeare to English poetry - ever did.  Only he armed himselv with such a broad and wide-ranging array of different interpretative approaches, that he was always able to extract more, and more diverse, meanings, from any significant passage; and that not by illegitimately stretching the content to cover areas the writer had never conceived of, but simply by bringing out what already was there.  His account of a passage in Ammianus Marcellinus, for instance, ought to be read by every historian of the late Roman Empire to understand what really was happening to that ancient civilization in the fourth century; as should his reading of a short story by Boccaccio (together, I would say, with Chesterton's magnificent essay on Chaucer) to understand the spirit that was awakening at the height of the Middle Ages.  And this book is just as broad as it is sharp; just as it manages to pierce to the very heart of a single well-chosen subject, so too it covers the most extraordinary range of subjects, from the beginning of our culture (Homer and the book of Genesis) to high modernity (Proust), from the obscure (a stunning review of a bloody sixth-century anecdote by Gregory bishop of Tours) to the famous (Shakespeare).  It is the finest book of literary criticism and history ever written, not only on account of its keen penetration and insight, but also of its enormous and wide-ranging learning, that allows the reader access to almost every century and every area of our Western heritage 
 We love it and it cleans easily.  You just pop out the trays and pop them into the dishwasher.  Highly recommend 
 When I read the first book of Mr Woolf for me it was a revolution in term of loyalty for retail organization and all the things in the book I try to apply them to my customers. The second one that I have read in 2006 (five years after it's first edition brings me less learnings. May be it's too late, may too much books have been written on the subject (loyalty and CRM).  Whatever the book should be read because Mr Woolf is a specialist of the subject. 
 man this is a smokin combo of shuggie albums, the brotha is bad! Everybody should know about this cat 
 Gothic 2 is the only RPG I have ever replayed; with the Add-on included in this Gold version enhancing and expanding the original game fantastically.  I live in the UK where this version has still not been released (why?), so to get a copy I had to order it to be sent to a friend in the States, who kindly posted it on to me.  Gothic 2 has a living world where things happen around you and people get on with their lives - go to work, then the pub, maybe cook some food and then home to bed, for example - as do the animals, with prey getting chased by predators.  Quests are interesting and much more than just take this package to so-and-so.  With some faction quests you even get to see and play the other side if you replay the game and say, join the guards instead of the merceneries.  The Add-on has some brilliant new areas, quests and creatures with the whole thing being wonderfully integrated into the original game.  The Gothic games are the only games where I have gone and practised my swordplay in the fields, as fighting is more than button bashing.  Fighting is actually fun in these games, not something I can say about any others (although I have high hopes for Oblivion...).  British gaming magazines have criticised Gothic 2 for: -you not being able to choose your appearance.  Who cares when you look believable and your armour and weapons can change?  Anyway, playing in first person is more immersive than third person and then it doesn't really matter what you look like. -the voices not being very good.  OK, you get to recognize some of the actors' voices playing different parts and the final "things" (I don't want to give any kind of spoiler away!) voices are a bit pants, especially for what they are, but it doesn't matter because the rest of the game is so good. -not having enough stats/skills to raise and personalise your character. OK, so there's not a vast range of skills and stats, but enough to make you have to choose where to spend your points and to have to specialise, so what more do you want?  Having 50 different skills to choose between instead of 15, say, does not make a better game.  Ultimately, if you like RPGs, you should buy this game and have many hours of pure fun.  Maybe you too will decide it's too scary to go out at night and instead find a nice bed you can sleep the night away in, or a bench to sit on and admire the view whilst waiting for dawn and some light to see what's coming next ... 
 I've earlier reviewed Livio's book on the Golden Ratio and if you'll read my review of that book, you'll see that I found it somewhat disappointing, though liking parts of it enough to give an overall 4-star rating. This book is much better. Basically, it addresses two topics: the attempts made over the ages to use formulas (such as the one we learned in algebra in school for the quadratic equation) to solve higher degree equations, which failed when algebraists got to the fifth degree, and the mathematics that describes symmetry, called group theory. These two topics would seem to be unrelated, but in fact, when Evariste Galois proved that the formula could not be found for fifth degree equations, he did it by inventing group theory! This book explores this connection, while also giving a lot of biographical information about both Galois and Niels Abel, who duplicated Galois' result about fifth degree equations.  I found that this book reads very well, and I highly recommend it 
 I have always been interested in Computer Science and I picked up this book to better understand email -- which these days is Outlook and Exchange.  It is an awesome resource for me to learn about the applications and it actually got me hired on as an unpaid intern to help out my dad's company put out an Outlook/Exchange applicatio 
 Letha uses natural herbs and remedies to help you feel and look great 
 I write from the perspective of someone in China who wants to explore the Chinese language itself - undoubtedly a large cross-section of travellers to China share this because they disproportionately have fallen in the deep end of language study prior to departure (especially if it's at tertiary level).   So, you want to get down & dirty in mainland China - not in the sense of visiting "Gay & Lesbian Venues" (p297), but are looking to buy a good Chinese text? Or want a good overview of the various dialects of China? You'd need to look further than this book. Mind you, the best texts for learning Chinese are, in my experience, most often written or cowritten by Westerners. This could be a natural outcome of a Westerner experiencing the frustrations of learning Chinese as an adult, as distinct from a child - something most Chinese people have never done. For further comments on some of these texts, see my other reviews, as well as the Routledge Chinese series of grammars.   A comment on page 329 on the languages of Fujian province: "Locals speak variations of the Min dialect, which includes Taiwanese". I don't know whether this is an entirely accurate description. "Taiwanese" isn't spoken on the mainland as such. Taiwan is simply not *on* the mainland. It would be better to say that the Min dialect (or language), often known as Hoklo or Hokkien, is spoken in both Fujian province and Taiwan.   Despite my admittedly idiosyncratic and skewed comments, I think this is a great book to have with you in China. Especially if you are planning on travelling around.   The approach to the politics of Tibet and Taiwan are refreshing (especially for someone who's been in China a little while). Just be careful you don't take this book as a "show & tell" item to an English class like some friends of ours did - only to be questioned about the absence of Taiwan on some of the maps (or different colouring thereof)!  Now. To the warnings. This is getting away from the things I have said about the language and so forth above. I have been staying in China for a number of months now, with wife and son.  Our son is mixed race - half white half asian.  The Chinese love babies, almost cultishly so, possibly as a result of the one child policy.  So naturally when they see a child that is - to them - unusual, they can't resist but take a look.  But nobody (including Lonely Planet) ever warned us that from the moment we leave our apartment there would be people pointing at our child, trying to touch him, speaking about him within our full earshot.  Hardly anyone ever speaks to me or about me without referring to the child.  We approach a service counter and struggle to get the staff's attention away from the baby's (who is sitting very quietly in his pram).  At some of the larger supermarkets there are many female staff simply standing around with nothing to do.  When they see our child they collect each other so that they can all stare at us together and so their friends don't miss out.  You may insist that I'm being petty and I should just rejoice that the Chinese love children so.  Go ahead, bring your 1.5 year old child to Wuhan, China and go on a shopping trip and see for yourself.  You will be thoroughly exhausted.  You will not walk 50 metres without a point, stare or comment.  But usually (especially when you go to a place for the first time) EVERYONE will be staring at you.  They will come out of the shop to stare.  Nobody ever warned me as an individual (babies aside) how many Chinese people would ride past on their bicycles or yell from within their group "hello!" and say to each other laowai (old foreigner) or waiguoren (foreigner). To yell "hello!" as they go past is particularly a welcome to China.  I know it's expecting a lot but If they really wanted to welcome me to China they'd get off their bikes, begin by speaking Chinese (it is after all, the national language) but be accomodating if I can't speak it, speak in a quiet voice so that the masses can't listen in, and ask whether there's anything they can assist with. If they can't do that, they simply shouldn't bother. They are treating westerners like museum exhibits.  Consider how this behaviour would be frowned upon in the west 
 This book is a must. It will show you everything you need to know from start to finish. 
 The ideas in this book have fueled my relationship with God for 30 years.  I buy extras and give them to men I disciple at an appropriate time in our relationship.  
 I am very satisfied with my purchase.  The bedding set is beautiful and very comfortable.  I was a little disappointed in the amount of time it took to receive it but it was well worth it 
 Before I read the prayer of Jabez I always wondered about praying for blessings, but this follow up to that let me know that God really does want to bless his children. Thanks Bruce for making so easy to uderstand God wants to bless us! 
 An excellent cast, great adventure for western lovers. Each of the stars shine in their characters from a Black Camanche sold to a determined mountain man to get his furs back from indians later massacred and taken by a ruthless bounty hunter. And yes, there is romance 
 The best of the game, set and match trilogy. Exciting, lean and suspenseful.  
 Great product for the price.  However, Amazon did not specify how much it can handle. My experience is about 5 lb. Tried 8 lb on it, start to feel shaky. Still usable if you handle it carefully, but not solid for 8 lb of load 
 Sasha does it again.  Does he put out any thing that isn't good?  I was worried because it is a live disk that there would be too much crowd noise.  Sounds to me like they mixed in the crowd noise at the beginning, and in the middle of a couple of songs to make you remember it is a live disk, other than that, I think everything is recorded straight out of the decks...  Very smooth and transitional mix.  Sasha continues to push the envelope.  I actually liked all of the tracks.... wonderful bass sounds through out.  
  This is a wonderful book that combines the expertise of a wide range of experts in the consulting field. Due to the different styles of the authors, the reader is bound to find several that really address their concerns.   The book is a useful toolkit as it has templates that one can easily adapt to meet their needs. Most of the common consulting problems are addressed. Among the readily useable tools are the various exercises, questionnaires and reproducible worksheets and techniques for working with clients, among others, which make this a very user friendly book that makes life easier for a consultant, particularly those like me that are relatively new to the profession.  This is a well written book that is easy to follow and understand and that should be a valuable tool to both the seasoned professional and the novice. It is certainly a very valuable reference book that can be used as a checklist when delivering services.   
 i have been exposed to quite a bit of organic/biochemistry but this book is very well written and serves as a review to these fields as well as a nice intoduction to medicinal chemistry. i guess they all kind of blend together anyway but lemke is a fantastic author, well worth the investment 
 history of pop music, from the songs of russian-jewish immigrants, thru the blues and many others. Bakshi's style of animation may not be for everyone, but i loved it. charachters are very real, no hint of "cartoons" Can be enjoyed by the whole family. It's a unique work. like nothing else I've seen. And the glorious music! 
 An excellent book in the vein of the creative memoir, reminiscent in this way of Karr's Liar's Club.  Historical fiction at its best.  Occasionally, however, the book feels a little Rocky Balboa, i.e. too epic and romantic in the self-heroizing of the narrator to be completely credible.  One thing that is never explained is why the Red Guards would go to all this trouble with her, trying to get her to confess, when they were essentially not accountable to anyone for their actions and could just as well have taken her out and shot her if they felt like it, or those they seem to want her to betray.  She seems to have some secret knowledge that they in fact won't do this, which she doesn't share with us, which takes away a lot of the boldness and daring from her standing up to them as she does.  It's great Count of Monte Cristo stuff, but there seems no good reason for all the care they take with her, instead of either shooting her or just locking her up a la gulag and throwing away the key.  Unless of course the Red Guards were really as retarded as they seem in the book.   
 I found this group via internet radio (Sama FM) Groovesalad. I have listened to this cd a number of times and to be honest, I sometimes have a hard time getting it out of my cd player. The whole album flows nicely and pretty much every song has something to offer. My personal favorites are the tracks 1 and 2. I highly recomend this disk to anyone that likes dark electronic music with deep baselines. The sample songs on amazon dont even come close to what is being offered here. The songs have great build-up and cool layering melodies. If you are the kind of person that has a nice set of headphones or stereo with full range, I am sure you will have a fixed grin and happy ears for quite some time. If you don't your still in for a treat. A word of causion to those that may listen and drink coffee or redbull while driving - may cause speeding and hyper-activity : 
 The fifteen-year-old Duncan (Emile Hirsch) and his laconic father Edgar Mudge (Richard Jenkins) are reeling after the death of the most important person in their life. Duncan's mother and Edgar's wife died suddenly, whilst biking some farm eggs to her neighbor.  An alcoholic, she was the glue that tethered this family together, and her death has left Duncan and Edgar emotionally fragile and at a loss.    It isn't only his wife's passing that is bothering Edgar; he notices that Duncan's a "different" kind of boy - sensitive, kindly and delicate. Duncan constantly dotes on his pet chicken and dresses in his mother's clothes, perhaps in an effort to stay connected to him mom.  At church - where he sings out of tune  - a neighbor in their tiny farm community comments on how Duncan is the spitting image of his mom.   Duncan is soft, not in an effeminate way; it's just that he has an intuitiveness and a compassion that places him at odds with some of the older and rougher boys, who mock him, and call him "weird" and question his sexuality, something he's already tormented over. Was Duncan a mama's boy? Well, we're not really sure. Obviously there was incredible love between them both, but it's a love that his father is unable to replicate.   Edgar worries about his son and he loves him dearly, but he's is clueless about how to help him. He tries to get him to help out around the farm in an effort to toughen him up. He also encourages Duncan to go out with his older friends, the ringleader of which is Perry (Tom Guiry), a butch and macho town stud who likes to brag about his sexual conquests. Perry's bravado is a cover-up for his scary feelings toward Duncan, and it's only a matter of time before their relationship reaches a crisis.  Mudge Boy is the perfect example of understatement, a tale of bourgeoning same sex attraction, and also a titular exploration of the isolation of farm life. Deeply religious, Edgar could be the fire and brimstone type of father; instead he's a thoughtful, considerate and caring man, who is at a loss at how to deal with his eccentric son. Hirsch, who projects a shy modesty, is perfectly cast as Duncan - a boy who is somewhat out of his depth with the people around him, an outcast with many quirks and eccentricities.   At times, Mudge Boy can be difficult to watch, there's a quasi-rape scene, where the result of some teenage sexual experimentation reaches an ugly climax. But writer-director Michael Burke is always sensitive to his subject matter, beautifully rendering his protagonists' dysfunctions and setting them against a bucolic backdrop of Vermont farm land with it's meadows, tumbling down barns and cow patches.    Whether Duncan is sweetly ingratiating himself and getting drunk with the local in crowd, or sucking on the head of his pet chicken, he's a character who many of us will probably be able to relate to. He's desperate to fit in, confused about his bourgeoning sexuality and is undoubtedly a troubled and confused soul. The final denouement, when Duncan is forced to confront the evils of small town bigotry is absolutely heart wrenching, as is the teary and world-weary reconciliation with his father.

 Interesting and non-obvious look at apartheid.  This book raises questions such as: what responsibility does one have for the crimes of a government that have benefitted you - even if you find those crimes repulsive and didn't ask for them; what kind of future can a nation have when it's children have been so brutalized that they become brutalizors themselves.  I also think, as my title implies, that this book really exposes the way a community can blind itself or be blinded by others, gov't, media, etc., to the carnage and horror taking place all around them.  If you can believe that a South African would be blind to the inhumanity trangressing in their country, then it's not so hard to believe how people in less brutal situations can also not understand or believe what goes on in their community 
 During the Vietnam war, many air crews were frustrated by the political nature of target selection. Real, worthy targets of military significance were put off limits to avoid annoying the enemy or the allies of the enemy. Instead, missions were sent against "suspected" targets like truck parks and staging areas more often than not, this resulted in the bombing of some innocent trees. That would be frustrating but not necessarily infuriating. What was infuriating is that crews were lost and killed in the missions to worthless targets.  In this story, one crew has had enough. After seeing so many of their friends killed for no apparent reason, they decide to do something that matters. They want to bomb a military target. They want to destroy SAMs, the surface to air missiles that are so dangerous to flyers. They know where to go. It is no secret that the SAM inventory is stored in a massive artillery park in downtown Hanoi. They decide to take it out.  The unauthorized raid is a success except when speaking in terms of careers. Even then, it seems, fate intervenes.  This is a story about comrades in arms keeping the faith with each other. Its not a great movie but it's a pretty good story.   Its also a credit to Danny Glover's acting skills. You would never know that he's part of the "I hate America" crowd. 
 My best friend introduced me to this extraordinary CD about two years ago while driving up California Highway 101 at 4 in the morning. And for a solid hour I was captivated and enraptured by the story-telling of Tom Russell and Little Jack Horton. Backed by some amazing music, we hear the story of "old, outside America,"  when the likes of Bukowski, Guthrie, and Kerouc dominated the iconoclastic, "Beat" scene. This a CD to own if you have even an ounce of appreciation for the aforementioned artists, not to mention the sonorous voice of Tom Russell. I must be honest;  I faithfully listen to this CD at least once a month while driving to work early in the morning. It is so enjoyable to hear that it has become a regular part of my life. It's that good. 
 If you have a child who struggles with reading you need this methodology. Phonics based reading, decoding. Highly recommend it 
 The seller was very customer service oriented. She even shipped the product with online tracking for usps. The product exceeded all expectations (perfect condition, could easily be described as new)--shipped and received in 6 days 
 "Forest Mage" is a refreshing exception to the usual fantasy book formula. The narrating character is wonderfully and believably imperfect. The plot revolves around challenges to and changes in his psyche, detailing his internal journey of self-discovery rather than relying (as so many books do) on a clear-cut good-versus-bad conflicts. I imagine that people who only get a thrill from reading a constant stream of fight scenes may find this book a little slow, but those who take an interest in a character's internal development will have trouble putting it down. Though, I must add that once you adjust to the pace, there is plenty of action and suspense to enjoy, with a touch of horror for spice-- I found it quite gripping.  Robin Hobb has once again demonstrated her masterful skill in creating complex and fascinating characters, and everything from the storyline to the setting reflects this. An excellent read 
 Wizard and Glass has to be the most memorable books in the series which introduces you to Roland's youth and what launches him on his quest for the Dark tower and the man in black. King will introduce you to a few new words and way of speaking. I caught myself using his high speak a couple times during this read, as I'm sure you will as well.  King's Story of a world that has "Moved On" is extremely entertaining. A Post apocalyptic lovers Dream Book! Set in the far off future ware were not shooting at each other with Laser beams but Hard Caliber 6 shooters. Roland is a Gun Slinger, a Law Giver on a quest to find the Dark Tower, a nexus point that holds millions of time lines and worlds in check. Roland's quest will sling shot him back and forth between the present, future, and Past. All of Kings Books tie into this Dark Tower in some way or another. When you finish the Story, your going to want to re-read the Dark Tower series Again, & Again to catch the subtle nuances that tie everything together

 The amazing thing about commentaries is that you get to discover things you never thought you would, for instance... why the screenwriter used the title  DEAD AGAIN: its based on a story he read about a woman saying she was pregnant with her reincarnated husband. Anyways, enough of trivia. This film is a great ride.Branagh is so skilled in acting and crafting of film, theatre  etc, that he had to come into mainstream films at some stage. So, he was working hard in theatre, and he ( and his wife) discover a script about a murder that gives rise to events recurring years later. This film's  cast is superb. If you listen to Kenneth Branagh's  commentary, you will discover the most amazing connections. And throughout, they talk of this as a noir  film, well, I have no idea what that is, but this film is a great entertaining piece, and it is in no small part to Branagh, Emma Thompson, Derek Jacobi ( brought in 3 days  before he was asked to start, a last minute call), and others who made a wonderful film, and a solid entertaining piece. The DVD  extras are just the commentaries, but for this  type of film, thats fine, since that is complex  enough. ENJO 
 This was my first Python book and I was learning Python for the first time after spending years in Java . I must say this was a great book for someone trying to correlate concepts with another programming language . It bring out the powerful concepts on Python very well especially the string/list functionality. I also liked its treatment of Object Oriented Functionality as well as the description of Python's functional features. The language is lucid and the author gets straight down to an example without beating around the bush. I am giving it 4 stars only because I didn't find its treatment of Regular Expressions as extensive as I hoped and I had to refer to other books/online to get more examples  
 I believe it is fair to say that Stevie Wonder's "Talking Book" doesn't get the recognition it deserves. "Songs in the Key of Life" or mostly his successful singles get all the recognition. Aside from the fact that "Talking Book" features two wonderful chart toppers ("You Are the Sunshine of My Life" and "Superstition"), it also features something that not many of today's artists display in their music: art. Stevie displays the talent he possesses here through his masterful vocals, priceless production, instrumental mastery, and his deep, poetic words. From beginning to end, every cut--from hard-edged funk to sweet ballads to political statements--is one-of-a-kind, and sure to bring out the human emotion in all of us. Stevie Wonder--a true musical artist with a talent that seemingly no one has, or ever will, surpass 
 Another one of Jeffery Deaver's exciting, nail-biting, convoluted stories of a driven murderer and the frustrating efforts of the Lincoln Rhyme team to track them down.  A great tale for an airplane trip. You will have a hard time putting the book down when it is time to get off of the plane. 
 Seen this movie many years ago back home in Oz. Lots of funny parts in it. It sort of reminds me of Romper Stomper with a comedy twist. Great Movie 
 The first time I read this book was at the age of 13. My mother had an old, worn, 1950s copy of the book on our bookshelf, and one day I just decided to give it a try. I think the first 50 pages were a bit of a mystery to me. I remember struggling with the language at the beginning, and having to look up several words in the dictionary. After 100 pages, I had finally "learnt the language," and managed to at last translate it into my native tongue. I enjoyed it, and over the years I returned to it again and again. Now, at the age of 35, I practically have numerous passages memorized, and reading the book is no longer a culture shock. Every word of this novel is an old friend, and I wouldn't remove a single one from the text. This is the book I turn to when I'm in the mood to read, but not in the mood to read something new.  Every time I read it, I am struck by its relevance. I don't mean the morals or the need to marry well in order to win approval from society (although I think we still see a little of that to this day). I refer to the characters. Their personalities and basic code of principals are timeless. I can identify with every single character in this novel. When Lizzy and Mr. Darcy fell in love, their courtship could have taken place anywhere and at any point in time. That is why her novels are so well adapted into modern films.  You cannot possibly do wrong by reading this novel 
 I first heard of this album 32 years ago when I was a senior in high school.  Station WSDM in Chicago had what we would now call a "lounge" format and played a lot of good jazz.  One evening around 10:00 PM the late Yvonne Daniels played "Balcony Rock" from this album.  After 11 minutes of wonder came out of my speakers, she opened the studio mic and said "do you by any chance remember that?"  From that moment on I never forgot it.  I finally bought a used copy a year later, and wound up with 3 or 4 additional copies of the LP version, including one I was fortunate to have signed by Dave Brubeck himself.  Paul Desmond supposedly said that he wanted his playing to sound like a "dry martini."  This album really is 6 parts gin and 1 part vermouth!  If you want to understand the Dave Brubeck, start here.  It's the perfect introduction to a satisfying musical journey 
 This book is an knowledgeable source of microcosm and deals with short stories also essays. It is my advise for students to buy it before Grade 11. You would have an A if you read this book and look up unfamiliar words 
 I love these bags. They are easy to get out of the container, easy to open and close, and once the milk is in, they stand on their own. To be honest, I haven't tried other brands, so these may not be the only great ones 
 This book is a wonderful birds eye view for those who are left behind when our soldiers go off to war. As a military wife in Germany who also is left behind while her husband has gone off to Iraq, I loved reading this book. I have given it to everyone in my family and all my friends. It helps remind everyone that the war is not just fought by the soldiers thousands of miles away. Spouses and children are left in foreign countries to get through the days until, hopefully, they return. Freedom is not free and sometimes it is easy to forget when you are sitting at home with your family around you, that there is a war going on & that families are longing for the return of their loved ones. This book truly makes you realize the emotional side of the war 
 This is one of my favorite books, beyond all genre.  Dan is an independent American man, a hard-working character who would rather make it on his own as a poor man than have wealth and riches handed to him. A great engineer who works on machines to answer demand for domestic chores, Dan is on the verge of a robotic break through that will revolutionize his industry when he is tricked by his partners and forced into "Long Sleep", from which he awakens thirty years later in the year 2000.  The novel is told in first person view from Dan's perspective, which usually ends in failure for most authors. Heinlein uses the tense extraordinarily well and naturally. Furthermore, Heinlein has characterization down very well-not only of his human characters, but also of cat characters. His opening paragraphs about Pete the tomcat who routinely visits all the doors during winter looking for the "door into summer" sounds so much like my own cat that I laugh everytime I read it.  The book also has interesting insight into a "future world" (2000)-although very incorrect. Nevertheless, it would be a nice thing indeed if there was currently a cure for the common cold (I'm just getting over one right now myself) and pills that kept teeth from ever decaying (no more dentists!). Other speculations such as a way to entirely clear smog and some commentary on a nuclear war also make the book interesting.  There are only a few twists and turns throughout the plot; the story mainly focuses on Dan and how he overcomes his obstacles. It is an extraordinarily well-done tale, and not a boring page in the novel.  Heinlein is a genuinely good writer who will always be among my favorites

 I bought the hardcover edition of The Joy of Sex several years ago. This morning I picked it up and read it from cover to cover. I enjoyed it greatly. The new edition is beautifully printed with elegant line drawings and full color photographs. It preserves the quirky charm of the original edition, but this may be its biggest flaw.   Alex Comfort essentialy invented the modern sex manual when he wrote the first edition of The Joy of Sex in 1972. We can thank Comfort's pioneering efforts for the sagging shelves of sex books we enjoy in our bookstores today.  Still, some of his advice sounds hopelessly dated. My favorite anachronism is a sexual position he calls the "Negresse." I'm not sure how that made it past the editors. Supposedly "completely updated for the 21st century," the book has a distinctly 70s feel. I find it charming, but some of the other Amazon reviewers don't.  Despite its flaws, this book deserves its status as an enduring classic. Comfort's approach to sex is humane and thoughtful. Reading his descriptions, you get the impression of a sensitive field scientist with a knack for philosophising about human nature. Other sex books get so wrapped up in the mechanics of sex and so enamoured with graphic depections of sex that they lose some of the human perspective. Comfort's book holds on to it tenaciously. A book with a wise and unbothered approach becomes even more welcome at a time when you can see images of every imaginable sexual act on the internet. There are better technical manuals on sex. Read Comfort's book for context and for beautiful drawings. Above all, read it to learn how take your time and savor lovemaking in all its varieties 
 Though very well written and engrossing, "Africa Zero" may be confusing to someone who has never read Neal Asher before. It's beginning (and end) is abrupt and overwhelming and the action is brutal and fast moving- the reader will be playing catch-up until half-way through the first story. If you know Asher's work, this is probably what you enjoy most about it but if you've never read anything by him you will probably be a bit confused. However, Asher (as usual) excells at his streamlined method of storytelling to throw the reader into the middle of the story and engross them, even if it's at a forced-march. Gory at times but also laugh-out-loud funny and full of great visuals, "Africa Zero" is not Asher's best work but is definitely one that reinforces Asher's stand-out status among modern sci-fi writers 
 This story centers around the "Ultimate" version of Captain Marvel, and the overall reintroduction of the Kree race and their involvement with planet earth.  Also appearing are the Fantastic 4, Thor, Iron Man, and Nick Fury.  The art is terrific --- crisp and sharp, and I appreciate Captain Marvel's new Ultimate look.  A good read, and I can't wait for the last installment 
 This review is dedicated to my father. Along with "Midsummer Night's Dream" and "Macbeth," "The Tempest" was one of my father's favorite plays. This play begins with an unfortunate ship caught in a storm. In the next scene, we move from the ocean to a nearby island. There we learn that the tempest was not from natuaral causes, but from the magic of our hero Prospero. Prospero has a grudge against certain members of the ship. Prospero tells his daughter Miranda the story of his past. (Miranda must be in her late teens at least, but she often sounds a lot younger. Quite possibly due to the fact that she has lead such a sheltered life.) His brother Antonio usurped his dukedom and handed control over to King Alonso. Prospero and his daughter were banished, and the benevolent Gonzalo furnished Prospero with books he loved. Prospero has been called the greatest representation of Shakespeare himself. We may also note that while Prospero is the hero of this play, he does have one notable fault. He does enjoy playing God. One example is when his fairy servant Ariel begs the promised 'freedom of air.' Rather than asking politely for just a little extra time, (which is certainly not unheard of between friends), Prospero reminds Ariel that he rescued Ariel from imprisonment by Sycorax and he threatens Ariel with consequences if Ariel brings up the matter again before it is time. Moving on, we meet the deceased Sycorax's remaining son Caliban. Prospero tried to be nice to Caliban, but Caliban crossed the line by trying to rape his daughter Miranda. (Again, Prospero plays God. Rather than using his magic to destroy Caliban, he keeps him alive and makes Caliban perform services that he finds disagreeable. 'Disgrace is more painful than death.') We later meet Ferdinand. (The son of the King on the ship.) He sees Miranda and loves her. Prospero feels he can not let his daughter be won too easily, and like Caliban, Ferdinand is subjected to manual labor. Onto Act 2. The crew of the boat from 1.1 has survived and made it to the island.  Shakespeare uses an interesting technique here. Through Prospero's passages, we see the king as his enemy. But we are allowed generous sympathy for him when he is struck with sorrow over his missing son. And even Ariel (Prospero's loyal servant) thwarts an attempt by Anotnio and Sebastian to kill the king. Caliban then meets Stephano and Trinculo. The three become friends (through the comical use of some wine) and join together to defeat Prospero and take over the island. Onto Act 3. Ferdinand and Miranda express their love for each other, and Prospero (watching from an unseen location) is pleased. Anotnio and Sebastian make another plan to kill Alonso. At this point, we can infer that Ariel has warned Prospero of the Caliban/Stephano/Triculo conspiracy. But Prospero sees yet another chance to play God. Antonio, Sebastian, Alonso, and Gonzalo are starving. So Prospero and Ariel create an image of banquet long enough to tantalize them before they make it vanish. (Some people may find this funny, but it is somewhat below the belt, and it does prove my point that Prospero likes playing God.) Onto Act 4. Prospero shows his gentler side when he tells Ferdinand that he consents to the marriage of Miranda to him. (Like a reasonable father, he asks that Ferdinand 'wait' until the marriage is performed.) In a beautiful "Midsummer Night's Dream" nostalgia moment, there is a dance of fairies. One interesting thing we notice here is yet another reason why Miranda sounds a lot younger than she is. (She must be in her late teens. But as I said before, she sounds much younger. A little too sweet and innocent. Well, Prospero does NOT confide in her. Prospero DID not tell her of the conspiracy against him.  One reason may be that Prospero who likes playing God thought the attempt on his life was laughable. It may also be that Prospero realizes that the concept of a conspiracy against his life would be beyond the scope of this gentle and kind but too sheltered Miranda. Recall, Miranda was still an infant in exile.) Moving on, Prospero gives the famous and beautiful passage: 'Our revels now have ended.' It is tempting to believe that Shakespeare is getting ready to say farewell to his art seeing that "The Tempest" was his 2nd last play. Well, the joy of the moment is broken as Prospero realizes his enemies are still out there. In 5.1, Prospero gives yet another beautiful passage on his accomplishments. And with the help of Ariel, Prospero realizes that revenge is not a virtue. (Rather forgiveness is. Interesting that someone who enjoyed playing God finally realizes that forgiveness is the true merit of a God.) Well, Prospero reconciles with the King, Antonio, and Sebastian and forgives them. Soon afterwards Prospero informs the king that his son Ferdinand is safe and happily getting ready to marry Miranda. Even Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo are forgiven. The play ends in utter happiness. Some people like to think that Prospero 'breaking his staff' is an indication that Shakespeare will write no more. But as Isaac Asimov said: "This is too sentimental...a compulsive writer like Shakespeare could not deliberately plan to give up writing while he was still capable of holding a pen." And in support of Isaac Asimov, Shakespeare did afterwards write "Henry VIII" as well as parts of "The Two Noble Kinsmen."  
 As all Delonghi products, this panini maker is a great buy! The look is stylish, but most of all it cooks delicious food. It is very easy and quick to make all kinds of sandwiches, as well as grilled meat. It is a great convenience to have one of these at home 
 Mikhail Bakhtin first began "Rabelais and His World" in 1917 during the heady days of the Russian Revolution. Like some of the colleges of today, the University of St. Petersburg at the height of the Revolution boasted a flexible curriculum and encouraged free thought among its students. While the gunfire echoed in the streets, Bakhtin and his colleagues gathered to declare the Russian Revolution the "Third Renaissance". This comparison between the Italian Renaissance and the Russian Revolution inspired him to begin his dissertation on Rabelais. The events of the Revolution swept everyone up into the societal transitions. No one could just be a bystander. From this all-encompassing mood of social interaction arose Bakhtin's concept of the "theater without footlights". As for the significance of the individual in the Carnivalesque one has only to look to the Fool. Bakhtin considered his first reading of Friedrich Nietzsche an epiphany. The great German philosopher remained one of Bakhtin's most important influences throughout his writing career. The Fool, as an extension of the carnival, is the ultimate Nietzschean character. Able to move between worlds, he demonstrates the power of the individual to transcend societal norms. Bakhtin states, "the images of folk culture are absolutely fearless and communicate this fearlessness to all". The Fool is representative of this utopian ideal personified in the individual 
 I was wary about using this pan after the bad reviews about pro form nordic pans, but my cake turned out very well!  I followed the sunny sunflower cake recipe on the packaging, and was quite pleased with the result!  The edges were not razor-sharp (as it would have been with a cast alum pan perhaps), but the shape clearly followed the mold!  Here's the secret - using a pastry brush, completely brush the pan interior with vegetable shortening.  Then follow through with a spray of baker's joy.  All in all, good value for money.  Nordic ware vindicated 
 It seems to me that the purpose of the Ken Burns Jazz Series is to document a history of jazz music.  If that is true, and this CD is supposed to tell the story of America's greatest composer, then he (Burns) has done an excellent job.  While it's not perfect, it does include early performances like "East St. Louis Toodle-Oo," "Black and Tan Fantasy," and "The Mooche" that are frequently ignored in Ellington compilations.  It also includes some of the best recordings from the Blanton-Webster era, and the performance of "Jeep's Blues" from The 1956 Newport Jazz Festival.  Although I would have liked to have seen the "Black and Tan Fantasy" with Bubber Miley, The Carnegie Hall version of "Come Sunday," and the 1928 "Black Beauty," as well as maybe a song like "Chelsea Bridge" or "Perdido" to replace "Take it Easy" or "Back Room Romp," I realize that nobody can limit an Ellington CD to 21 recordings and please everybody, and Ken Burns has done a better job on this one than any other I've seen 
 Plot: In a revoltion by the village against his father/the King, Enion -- the young Prince and apprentice of knight Bowen (Dennis Quaid) -- is injured. As the injury could be fatal, the Queen rushes him to a dragon with the request of it's healing power. To do so, the dragon must give half of his heart to the Prince (and, of course, he does). Yet once Enion bcomes King, he disregards any teachings of the Old Code from Bowen and becomes a cruel and corrupt young man, bringing only choas to his time of reign. From here, feeling that the dragon is the reason for Enion's rebellion, Bowen vows to slay every single dragon left in existence. But once he comes upon the last dragon left (Sean Connery with vocal duties only, as the dragon is CGI), he finds him impossible to defeat. They resort to friendship instead, and Bowen gives the dragon a name: Draco (after the constellation). They team up, traveling village to village, having Bowen to pretend he slays an evil dragon (Draco) that is inhabiting whichever current village they are working (this humorous scam being done for money, of course). But soon, the past catches up to both of them and they run into the old village now cruelly run by Enion. They, with the assistance of the villagers, decide to over-run Enion and his small army. With the help of Draco, it seems possible. But Enion ends up capturing Draco. Bowen must kill Enion and save Draco, but discovers a connection between the two that makes such a task much more difficult than he'd imagined. I've given most of the plot here, but I won't say too much about this part, because it is indeed the center of the climatic drama. All I can say is that Bowen must choose between two very difficult decisions!  Dragonheart succeeds in not only a humorous and fantastic movie, but also a heart-warming one. The ending (supported by the wonderful score) brought tears to my eyes, and the story is one that will stick with any viewer for quite some time. Although the CGI dragon is a turn-off to some, be assured that for the effects available at the time, these guys used the best. Also, as for the DVD, there are some great special features including inside looks at Draco, the effects, the story, etc. This is an adventure/fantasy film perfect for almost any age and I would certainly recommend at least a rental. If you're into dragons or just fantasy in general, Dragonheart is a must-see!         
 The sound quality of the Ultra-Lounge series is excellent, even though the songs were recorded mostly in the 50's and 60's. Capitol Records packs each CD with carefully chosen tracks consistent with the theme of the particular volume in the series. Many of the selections that appear here aren't available elsewhere, either because the original album on which the song appeared is out of print, or because the song was issued as a single and never collected in an album. A few 'previously unreleased' tracks also appear here. This series is a wonderful introduction to the music of a by-gone era, and each album includes detailed notes on each track (artist, writers, date recorded, how released, etc.). I heartily recommend it to anyone who has an interest in this type of music 
 This book weaves a beautiful love story with an almost unspeakable piece of history that most of us never knew before.  Her writing is magical in its descriptions. It is not an easy book to read but one which you will be richer for the doing. And you will never forget it 
 SDRE's second album simply titled 'Lp2' showcases the bands dark indie rock form the most clearly. This album is quite similar to their debut 'Diary' but more focused. I am more fond of 'Diary'. 'Lp2' is full of enjoyable alt rock and is sometimes easier to rock to than the dark debut. 'Friday' is possibly the best track it's short and sweet and rocks. 'Red Elephant' feels like a cold bath with taunting guitar and aching vocals but delivers a positive tone. '5/4' is my favorite song on the album with it's swaying guitar and tender vocals. 'Waffle's agitated progress fires on all cylinders straight to the heart. '8' and 'J'Nuh' are respectively grand in a gentle nerve splitting tempo that elevate the album into greatness 
 Rob Huizenga's account of his time as medical intern for the Los Angeles Raiders provides a provocative behind-the-scenes look at the reality of NFL football that is by turns hysterically funny and deeply disturbing. He  conveys both the perverse attraction of being part of a team "camped out at  the edge of reality", and also the shocked disbelief at the suspect and  highly dangerous extremes that football players will go to in order to play  while injured and so preserve their job. As team intern from 1983 to 1990,  Huizenga faced a unique dilemma: his concern as a responsible doctor for  his patients, the players, continually conflicted with their own desire to  play through potentially crippling injuries. His frequent confrontations as  well with team owner Al Davis over the treatment of players clearly  illustrates why Davis's obsessive "win at all costs" attitude has made he  and his team NFL pariahs. More generally, Huizenga pointedly shows how the  intense pressure upon players from team, fans and the league itself, to  consistently perform at the highest possible level drives individuals to  abuse themselves and their bodies with a myriad of chemical substances. For  Raider and non-Raider fans alike, Huizenga's book makes for compulsive  reading. His experiences highlight the extreme "otherness" of NFL football,  in which lies its principle attraction - the oddball characters who play  it, the unorthodox means they endure to keep playing, and the high mental  and physical cost that they pay for success in such a ferocious game 
 Peter Berley - you have managed to do it again!  I am not even considered near - Vegetarian, yet I found Berley's recipes to be delightfully scrumptous.  A beautifully written and easy to follow book, I highly recommend it 
 This is not a typical read for me, but I enjoyed it.  I read the first 148 pages wondering if this was going to be a waste of time, but when I hit chapter 44, I read the rest of the book in one sitting.  Loved Max, Frannie, Kit & all the others.  Looking forward to reading "The Lake House" 
 Using examples from Christian and Islamic mystical texts,  Sells shows that these texts operate through "apophatic" language, that is the language of unsaying  or saying what cannot be said.  An important study in the History  of Religions, in Literary Criticism, and in the comparative study of mysticism 
 I found this book to be very insightful about today's marketplace in general - not necessarily limited to those managers who work internationally. The solid advice offered by these authors will certainly benefit anyone with colleagues from different backgrounds or cultures. The skills described here are essential for managers and their employees who want to remain flexible and educated about the worlds ever changing economy. Highly recommended 
 Everybody that does or aspires to draw the human figure from imagination, not particularly from live study, should run, not walk, to get this book. A long time secret classic for people working with cartoons, concept art, character design and so forth. If you think you are covered because you got Burne Hogarth's books on the human figure, think again. Not to dis Hogarth, but this one is the real thing.  
 There is no writer I know of who is more adept at capturing the depth and intricacies of a given human emotion than Gabriel Garcia Marquez. He never tires of exploring the depths of love and never ceases to be fascinating in so doing.  In 'Love in the Time of Cholera', Garcia Marquez tells the tale of Florentino Ariza and his boundless, but unfulfilled love for a childhood sweetheart named Fermina Daza. The longing and torment that Florentino experiences throughout over half a century of Fermina Daza's marriage is at times excruciating. However it is still lent a certain tragic and poignant beauty by the author.  The emotions and anguish that Florentino suffers are surely ones that are common to any human being. Equally anyone who has experienced these emotions, will know that their complexity and depth easily necessitate the 400+ pages that comprise this book. Also that it would take a writer like Gabriel Garcia Marquez to do them justice.  The conclusion of this novel is, ultimately, realistic. The conclusion of an unrequited love is rarely straightforward. There is usually not a clean, Hollywood-esque finish and the novel perfectly conveys this. Without being even the slightest bit populist, this novel is a beautifully thought out and beautifully rendered work, which will surely resonate with all of its readers 
 I don't mean to be any disrespect to the likes of Shirley Ceasar and Albertina Walker, but anyone who is a Whitney Houston fan, knows that she was meant to make an album like tthis. This is one of the best albums of the Gospel genre and the R&B world. Whitney really went back to her roots on this album and no matter what she is going through at this present day and time, she is still one of the greatest singers to ever grace this earth. She has crossed over into that treasure where people love her and want to see her doing well. Finally I would just like to say to everyone, especially African-Americans and true Whitney fans, lets nurse Whitney back to good spirits and success so that she can show Mariah Carey and Toni Braxton how its really done. WE ARE DOING NOTHING BUT MAKING IT WORSE BY MAKING FUN AND BRINGING HER DOWN. WE LOVE U WHITNEY! THANX FOR YOUR WORK! 
 This is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. It turned me into a Crichton fanatic. I have since read all of his books. He creates suspense like no one else. Forget the movie.  M.C. is notorious for ending chapters with such a cliffhanger you feel compelled to read on. 
 The book is thorough and provides many self quizzes to test your knowledge along the way 
 My daughter had wanted this book for a long time.  She enjoys it and uses many hairstyles from it.  Another great product for tween aged girls from the American Girl company 
 It was "D.I.Y." that introduced me to the solo work of Peter Gabriel. (The first one had been under my radar, a mistake soon corrected.) I knew Gabriel's work with Genesis and while I liked the band I didn't need to have it all. But then this song came out. I can still remember hearing it on the now defunct FM station WIOQ, sitting in my car and thinking, "Wow, I've got to get that." The line, "When things get so big you can't trust them at all; if you want some control you've got to keep it small," really spoke to me ; no doubt helped by the passion and anxiety in Gabriel's voice. When I listened to the whole album, I discovered an artist still trying to find his way to the world rhythms that he made his own. On this recording, Gabriel is still playing around with Genesis style characters and imagery here; on songs like "On the Air" with its hermit DJ and "Animal Magic's Professional," Gabriel revisits some older themes of separation and distance from the norm. But on songs like "D.I.Y." and "Indigo" you start to see the shell cracking as Gabriel touches on some personal spaces that always seemed to be held at arm's length before. Some songs are a bit too buried in Robert Fripp's production (Particularly "Home Sweet Home" which would have been better served by a starker setting.) but overall there is an emotional feeling here that serves as a harbinger of Gabriel's later work.  
 Works very well with my Dell latitude laptop..solve the heat issue I was having with my video board 
 Tom Cruiz gets a bad rap for some of the things he does. I think he is a great actor in both action and drama. The rest of the cast were great also. So have a "ice creme" and enjoy 
 This book was a hard read at first, slowly I started to appreciate the stories, the quotes. The military style of leadership from Powell, his unforgiving rules for people without integrity and whiners, and his chapter on "Know When to Piss People Off" was very interested. His stature in the US and even the world, and his war stories, and leadership experience, made for a rich read. Highly recommend it 
 Fifty-three years old Harry Barnett accompanies his much younger and obviously healthier guest visiting English schoolteacher Heather Mallender on a tour of the Greek Isle Rhodes where he has lived for about nine years as a housesitter.  He stopped for a smoke and a second wind while she went on, but after waiting for a while for Heather to return, Harry anxiously sets off to find her.  Instead he sees four stripes of "cerise and silver" from Heather's scarf caught on a low hanging tree branch.  He reports her missing to the authorities who suspect he killed her.  Harry quickly realizes that the cops assume he harmed Heather.  Deciding he needs to prove otherwise and finding nothing useful on Rhodes, Harry traces Heather back to England He learns Heather was visiting a psychiatrist, helping her not very successfully cope with the loss of her sister to an IRA bomb.  However, Harry soon finds his own past not that of Heather's is where the answer lies, but obtaining the proof could prove deadly from people he trusts.  On the surface the story line is a simplistic amateur sleuth investigation starring a dissolute loser hiding from his roots.  However, that would oversimplify a complex somewhat convoluted thriller filed with twists and plenty of irony as the reluctant warrior returns to the place of his greatest failure amidst other fiascos.  The story line grips the reader from the moment Harry panics when he realizes that somehow Heather is missing and continues to hold reader attention as the "hero's" stomach churns when he concludes he is the only suspect and never let's go until Harry's final sardonic confrontation with a foe PAINTING THE DARKNESS with deception and blackmail.

 This book came as required reading for a class in graduate school and helped reveal the overarching messages in the book of revelation.  This book has been one that has perplexed me since I was a young believer.  Is this book to be taken literally?  Is the book figurative?  Is it somewhere in-between?  Bauckham falls into a general examination of the book, looking at the genre, the big issues, the themes, and specific issues that scholars debate in all circles.  This book is not an exegetical painful process, rather a good look at the big picture of revelation.  How should we apply it today?  Are we afraid that we will be 'left behind?'  Thank goodness Tim Lahaye made a DVD for those people who will be 'left behind.'  Anyway, on a more serious note, this book is a great introduction to the book of Revelation and will help almost anyone get around the book without feeling overwhelmed or lost.  Highly Recommended  - Joseph Dworak 
 Steve Matchett's "The Mechanic's Tale" is a great read.  It cover's everything from his apprenticeship to his winning the WCC with Benneton.  Matchett tells his story with an insider's view and with a lot of humour (I still smile thinking of his first experience using titanium).  He also gives the right amount of technical information, so any average F1 fan should learn a thing or two about the cars, but it shouldn't bewilder any new F1 fans.  This is a must-read for all F1 and motorsport fans 
 I read this book during my sophomore year of college, and it has forever stayed in my memory as the most entertaining history book I've ever read. What's so wonderful is that its concern is the texture of everyday life  (duh! :=), rather than dates and names. Truly interesting 
 As the lowly web guy behind The Thrilling Detective Web Site, I'm always looking for good reference books, and this one's a keeper! It collects some of the very best articles, essays and critiques in one handy volume,  covering everything from film and fiction to radio, television and comics.  Passionate, diverse, opinionated, cranky, illuminating and enlightening,  it's like a Greatest Hits of Noir Criticism 
 IF ANYONE WANTS TO DISCUSS FALL IN A YAHOO OR AOL GROUP JUST EMAIL ME CHEYENNESYNFUL@AOL.COM  I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! I LOVE THE SOUNDTRACK!!! IT'S CINEMATIC PERFECTION. A MODERN DAY ROMANTIC CLASSIC WITH RELATABLE ISSUES.  ~~~CHEY~~ 
 In "Andrei Rublev" Tarkovski illuminates an era in which great faith and great brutality coexist side by side.  On one hand you see this world of great Christian artists, who live for their work.  On the other hand, you see the world of invaders.  Remember the scene where the invaders lock the entire village in a church?  The torture scenes are not very grafic, but the implications will make you sick to your stomach.  At some point they invaders pour melted metal into the mouth of one of their victims, to silence his prayers, and then put a sack over his head and drag him outside, tied to a horse.  And between these two world is a world of pagans.  They are a cast suspended between the two universes.  They are Russians but not Christians.  They are an echo of the heathen Russia.  Tarkovsky shows that Ortohdox Russians treat their heathen breathren with the same brutality as they themselves were treated by invaders.  
 Does anyone know if this is the same Sterling Johnson who is a political science prof. at CEntral Michigan University?  I sure hope so!  Let me know... 
 My high school French class watched this movie this week.  Seeing how horrible some of the other French movies we've watched in class have been, I wasn't expecting to like this one.  I was pleasantly suprised!  The Dinner Game is a very intelligent comedy.  A group of guys hold an "idiot dinner" every week where they see who can bring the biggest idiot.  This week, however, things do not go as planned, and the "idiot" wreaks havoc on those around him.  It is so fun and witty...it never ceases to hold your attention.  Definitely a film to look into 
 Many readers may already be familiar with the QuickBooks software, or its personal, home finance management software Quicken, both from the Intuit company. Intuit is well known for their superb financial management software, and when you purchase the QuickBooks 2005 software, you will receive additional startup documentation to help you with the software.  However, as is the case today with most all software, companies just cannot any longer afford to produce extensive paper based user manuals, as this cost just can no longer be considered essential, mainly because this would add further cost to the software. In today's highly competitive software market, vendors are always looking for ways to add value to their program, while not necessarily adding cost to the product. Thus, in most all software programs today, the user's manual, or the help on using the software is electronic and built into the software instead of being printed on paper based books included with the program in its retail box.  While this is understandable, this has also opened a market for third-party, add-on paper books from the computer book publishing industry, which is best exemplified by this large, impressive title by Bonnie Biafore from Pogue Press/O'Reilly. As is always the case with any O'Reilly title, you can depend on the material to be of high quality, well written by professionals known to be experts in their field, and of great value to readers.  In the case of the QuickBooks software, Pogue Press/O'Reilly has provided an important title that will likely sell very well because of the hundreds of thousands of customers who are working with or seriously considering Intuit's QuickBooks software to help them manage their company's finances 
 I used this pan for the first time for a Daisy Girl Scout Investiture.  I used PAM for Baking spray on the pan and a Duncan Hines cake mix and had no problems at all.  The cake cooled a bit longer than 15 minutes, but I just tapped on the pan and it came right out.  Everyone raved about how great the cake was and the girls were excited that it had daisies on it.  It makes a very pretty cake.  I didn't bother with a glaze or frosting and everyone liked it just fine.  
 It is closing time at a New York Museum. Two brothers are lost in the long corridors and hallways of the big museum. They find a stair case leading to the dark subbasement. One boy pleads not to go down, but the other says  that they are going. Then they go down, not knowing they will never return.   This is a very good and very intense. If you are into horror and suspense,  read it! It is not for the squemish, and it is very long read. It is told  in such detail that you feel you are in the story. The movie and book have  no compare, the book rocks, and is the best read i ever read 
 Is Windows making your computing life a nightmare? If it is, then this book is for you. Author David A. Karp, has done an outstanding job of writing a book that shows you how to fix Windows.  Karp, begins by showing you how to deal with interface quirks that plague Windows and most of the applications that you run on your PC. Then, the author covers Windows Explorer in all of its forms, including tips on how to do things like force it to remember your view settings, save your default application choices, tame FileOpen and FileSave As dialog boxes, and get XP's Search tool to behave. The author then covers Multimedia and more. Next, he shows you how to get a handle on Internet Explorer's role, and what you can do to improve your online experience. The author also shows you how to make everything work without ever compromising your security. Finally, he shows you how to reinstall Windows, update it safely, get it to start up more quickly and shut down without complaining, and finally, make it work with all your hardware.  Several techniques are used in this most excellent book to help you better understand and retain the information you need to fix Windows. More importantly, the preceding approach is what makes this book a more effective learning tool than other books on the shelf 
 I've read many political books - mostly conservative.  Michael Savage, Sean Hannity, and Bill O'Reilly are just a few of the authors whose books I have read, and while I agree with most of the opinions they expressed, I found the content to be rather dry and mundane.  Don't get me wrong, I still liked them.  Michael Savage stands out among other talk show hosts like Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity who pump out the blandest political books on the market, as his writing actually appears to have involved some labor.  But not until I read Al Franken's "The Truth" did I realize how colorful and entertaining political non-fiction can be.  Now, whether the views expressed in Franken's books can qualify as "non-fiction" is up to you, but regardless, I found this book to be the single most funny and amusing political book I have ever read.  Not only is the satire in "Truth" razor-sharp, but the overall "flow" is just magnificent.  Beginning with a dramatic memoir of the '04 election and sailing smoothly through the remainder of the book with Franken's charming humor and eloquent dissection of The Issues, "The Truth" reads like an ocean wave brushing against the sand.  And I stress this particularly with THIS BOOK, as I have just recently read "Lies" and, though wonderfully entertaining, it does not flow from chapter to chapter so seamlessly as its successor.    Franken has a gift, and it ain't for political analysis; it's for the written word.  If I weren't so smart, I'd consider him terribly persuasive, and that's definitely a talent unto its own.  Obviously, I find this book's weakness to be the opinions which the amazing writing carries, and so the 4 stars.  One of the biggest problems with Franken, and every other not-so-radical liberal I've examined, is he is not willing to accept the downfalls of his extremist counterparts, if he is even aware of them at all.  Something you'll notice about liberals is they are much more about bashing the Right than actually giving their opinion.  (Okay, they'll give their opinion on global warming and health care - things that, no matter how insensitive this sounds, are MEANINGLESS in a world where people are currently fighting to destroy the West as we know it.)  Instead of challenging the actual DOCTRINE of the social-conservative agenda, Franken zeros in on meaningless hypocricies amongst members of the right wing like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly - people I have no respect for - as if their mistakes disqualify the actual motives of present-day conservatism, or represent the others of the right wing who don't wish to be represented by such morons.  Now true, the Right bashes the Left just as the Left bashes the Right, but there's still an urgency in the right wing to solve the global terrorism crisis that is just not apparent in the left wing.  This is why Air America has failed:  Franken can get away with his twisting of the truth through writing, for the art of the literature itself distracts from the utter rubbish of it's ideological base, but when you must go on the radio every day with nothing more to say than "Rush Limbaugh is a pig," you're going to fall flat on your face.  In the end, "The Truth" is so well-written and so entertaining, yet so politically misguided.  I love it, but not for the reasons Franken might want me to.  Oh well.  It's a masterpiece 
 Having lived in Paris during the late 'fifties, I was immediately attacted to the Karnow book by its title. Upon reading the book, I wasn't disappointed. It was an easy read, partly because of the subject matter and partly because Mr. Karnow is such an excellent writer. The history lesson was great! 
 I can't believe so many people trash this recording.Next to Satriani's "Flying in a Blue Dream" I feel "Engines of Creation is one his best.It reminds me a lot of two beautiful jazz rock albums;Lenny White's "Venusian Summer" ala Larry Coryell/Al Dimeola and John McLaughlin's "Devotion".The guitar work in these albums is somewhat buried beneath the electronics but just when you least expect it comes soaring out,sometimes sweet,sometimes awesomely raunchy 
 This is a low-fi recording of a sound collage event that took place in Los Angeles in 1965.  A bunch of pre-recorded tapes were triggered and overlaid in real time using chance operations.  This CD contains excerpts from the six hour performance.    Cage was sincere about process over product.  He reportedly didn't listen to records (of his own music or anybody else's).  I think this CD is fun, but since there's no intentionality to the sound constructions it's hard to grade.  I think the last two tracks are the best blend of the source material (the same tapes keep popping up in different tracks) but if you appreciate media collage you'll enjoy the whole thing.  Be warned, though, that this is not "soundboard" quality -- sounds more like somebody set a tape recorder in the middle of the room 
 I bought this book based on the reviews on Amazon.com.  As a beginner with no formal design training I felt the book was a good beginning book to jump start my informal training.  I am glad I bought it and I agree with the positive reviews of this book.  Well worth the time and money 
 I was one of the music lovers that rejected Joni's delving into experimentalism and stronger jazz elements in her songs.  At the time I only had ears for hard rock with a few (but not too many) rock ballads thrown in.  This year I began exploring Joni's catalog that I had ignorred so many years.  I was prompted by checking one of her recent CDs out from the library.  Taming The Tiger.  Court and Spark had always been in my all time top 10 favorites list, but I wanted to see what else she had done in the 70s, 80s, 90s and 00s that I had missed.  Just bought this album along with Hejira.  I love them both but especially this album and The Jungle Line!  Hypnotic.  Didn't find a single song that I don't like on it.  And many that I love. But like I said.  I wasn't ready for this until my music tastes matured.  I think the alternative/modern rock era has had that affect on me.  Listening to softer, beautiful songs like Dave Mathews Band, Counting Crows, Sting, etc. had taught me to love, prepared the way for me to return to Joni.  Joni, thanks for the vast collection of beautiful music you've shared with the world 
 The financial performance of an organization is essential for its success. Even non-profit organizations must deal in a sensible way with funds they receive.  In 1992, an article by Robert Kaplan and David Norton entitled "The Balanced Scorecard - Measures that Drive Performance" in the Harvard Business Review caused a lot of attention for their method, and led to their business bestseller, "The Balanced Scorecard: Translating Strategy into Action", published in 1996.  In this book Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton develop and describe the Balanced Score Card, a multidimensional approach to measuring corporate performance that incorporates both financial and non-financial factors.  The Balanced Score Card method of Kaplan and Norton is a strategic approach and performance management system that enables organizations to translate a company's vision and strategy into implementation, working from 4 perspectives:  1. financial perspective, 2. customer perspective, 3. business process perspective, 4. learning and growth perspective.  - Financial perspective: Kaplan and Norton do not disregard the traditional need for financial data. Timely and accurate funding data will always be a priority, and managers will do whatever necessary to provide it. In fact, often there is more than enough handling and processing of financial data. With the implementation of a corporate database, it is hoped that more of the processing can be centralized and automated. But the point is that the current emphasis on financials leads to the "unbalanced" situation with regard to other perspectives. There is perhaps a need to include additional financial-related data, such as risk assessment and cost-benefit data, in this category.  - Customer perspective: recent management philosophy has shown an increasing realization of the importance of customer focus and customer satisfaction in any business. These are leading indicators: if customers are not satisfied, they will eventually find other suppliers that will meet their needs. Poor performance from this perspective is thus a leading indicator of future decline, even though the current financial picture may look good. In developing metrics for satisfaction, customers should be analyzed in terms of kinds of customers and the kinds of processes for which we are providing a product or service to those customer groups.  - Business Process perspective refers to internal business processes. Metrics based on this perspective allow the managers to know how well their business is running, and whether its products and services conform to customer requirements (the mission). These metrics have to be carefully designed by those who know these processes most intimately. In addition to the strategic management process, two kinds of business processes may be identified: a) mission-oriented processes, and b) support processes. Mission-oriented processes are the special functions of government offices, and many unique problems are encountered in these processes. The support processes are more repetitive in nature, and hence easier to measure and benchmark using generic metrics.  - Learning and Growth perspective includes employee training and corporate cultural attitudes related to both individual and corporate self-improvement. In a knowledge-worker organization, people are the main resource. In the current climate of rapid technological change, it is becoming necessary for knowledge workers to be in a continuous learning mode. Government agencies often find themselves unable to hire new technical workers and at the same time is showing a decline in training of existing employees. Kaplan and Norton emphasize that 'learning' is more than 'training'; it also includes things like mentors and tutors within the organization, as well as that ease of communication among workers that allows them to readily get help on a problem when it is needed. It also includes technological tools such as an Intranet.  The integration of these four perspectives into a graphical appealing picture have made the Balanced Scorecard method a very successful methodology within the Value Based Management philosophy.  In addition to this book you may want to consider the following books on the subject: - Robert S. Kaplan. Alignment: Using the Balanced Scorecard to Create Corporate Synergies. - Paul R. Niven.

 I loved this cd. It has some of the favorites, but many unknown songs. My favorite is Grateful - so beautiful 
 Her writing style is so playful, amusing, charming, and sensitive. Her observation of the environment and culture is so acute. She brought alive the scenes, the sounds, the liveliness of Hanoi streets -- just like the classic Vietnamese novels that we had to read while in high school. I bought this book for my wife, previewed it and then finished it. Highly recommended.  
 The slow man of Coetzee's novel is Paul Rayment, who in the opening pages we encounter flying through the air having been knocked off his cycle by a young motorist. The story then follows Paul's recovery from the accident, as a consequence of which his freedom is severely restricted. When he goes home having been released from hospital he is allocated care nurses and it his relationship with one of these nurses, her family, and the mysteriously appearing Elizabeth Costello that form the central theme. Sixty plus year old retired photographer Paul is divorced, and is not a man without needs, the need for love and sexual fulfilment. He falls for his nurse, Croatian Marijana Kokic, a robust and capable woman who comes across, perhaps as much because English is not her first language, as a little abrupt. Paul also becomes involved with Marijana's entire family, and especially Mariajna's sixteen year old son Drago, handsome, confident, charming and polite. The elderly novelist Elizabeth Costello makes a sudden appearance as if from nowhere and imposes herself upon Paul, and she then becomes a constant feature for the duration, acting it seems as Paul's conscience (for a short while one wonders if she is real or if she exists only in Paul's mind). What is her motive, she appears to be very knowledgeable about Paul and the Kokics, but is her interest purely altruistic? Paul's relationship with Elizabeth wavers from loathing to tolerance, and maybe more. This is a most endearing story; it is easy to see how Paul becomes infatuated with Marijana, who is fazed by none of the very personal and intimate care she has to provide. Paul's relationship with young Drago is touching; he clearly cares very much for the boy and is prepared to demonstrate that in generous practical ways. This is an interesting and unpredictable story, with a gratifying surprise towards the end. 
 Sarah Brightman doesn't have the greatest singing voice, however she does have the most beautiful and moving voice I have ever heard in my life. Her singing voice is something that can only come from the heavens, this album gave me goosebumps and made me cry. Beautiful piece of art. The album is a classical masterpiece that is haunting in every since of the word 
 This incredible Frank Sinatra cd is simply one of his best.The 1974 release is recorded live at Madison Square Garden.Howard Cosell does a magnanimous live introduction which gets you moving from the very beginning!The cd includes such Sinatra classics as the lady is a tramp,i`ve got you under my skin and i get a kick out of you.We are taken through an emotional roller coaster as only sinatra can do. From the soft ballads of let me try again,angel eyes and autumn in new york to the fast bad, bad leroy brown we are always kept on the edge of our seats!With the great Don Costa producing this musical treat soars to great heights! Sinatra ends the concert with his signature song,MY WAY!A must for all Sinatra fans!! 
 An excellent and quick read, very realistic perspective of today's political environment.  A great introduction of Mitch Rapp supporting characters.  I literally could not put it down and couldn't wait to get started on the next novel 
 A remarkably readable autobiography, following the entire life of George Lincoln Rockwell up until the publication of his first seminal work. This offers a unique insight into the character and nature of the man and the stirrings of his political/social awareness. I would consider this book one of my top five. Hard to find, and well worth the read. Do NOT make the mistake of judging him without his story in his own words. If you have read White Power, then this title is indispensible 
 This book is so expensive because it is simply an art book, showing Kevyn Aucoin's art. It is not a step by step guide. It's a beautiful book and worth it. 
 Kyuss always delivers that pure raw Rock and Roll sound without the total grunge feel to it.  New bands need to follow the direction that Kyuss set rather than Linkin Park.  
 I strongly believe that James Fenimore Cooper belongs to the American and the world history.  I learned the history reading his books.  I have all of them and I still open them once in a while even now, forty years later 
 Three facts about this film help to make it highly-rated in my book: it's very entertaining, moves fast and lasts only 90 minutes.   So, if in the mood for a combination Fugitive/Rambo story with two very intense lead actors, this is a convenient diversion to play numerous times.  Tommy Lee Jones was the mentor who trained Benico Del Toro on the art of killing and now the ex-student has gone out of control and Jones must hunt him down, something the police can't seem to do. That's the story, simple as that. The only thing was a little implausible is that old man chasing down a kid for miles. Tommy Lee might be in shape, but he isn't young enough to do what he does here. However, both men are fun to watch and the action scenes are well done. You don't get bored watching this movie.  No, the film isn't high-grade mentality but it isn't totally stupid, either. It doesn't get carried and is pretty believable until the final chase scene. Along the way, we are treated the Portland cityscape and Northwest woods, both of which are nicely filmed and look great on this DVD. 
 This DVD is perfect for anyone who has caught 1 episode of Blues Clues and their child is hooked.  This DVD really does have many of the greats and my Son loves "Magenta Get's Glasses".  Granted, if you have several individual Blues Clues DVDs already, it isn't worth it.  But for us, we only owned 2 DVDs (Holiday & Blue goes to school), this was a great addition 
 THE WIZARD OF OZ  	The Wizard of Oz is about a girl, Dorothy, who's house was carried up in a cyclone with her and her dog Toto still in it. It turns out she landed in the Land of Oz. She meets some munchkins and a nice witch who tells her to go down the yellow brick road to meet the Great Oz who can get her back to Kansas where she lives. On her journey, she meets bad creatures, and friends who also need to get to Oz. They have some difficulties along the way. Will Dorothy ever get back to Kansas to meet her Aunt Em again? 	This book has a clear message that you should keep trying, even if it's hard. Dorothy and her friends keep trying to get to Oz and anywhere else they need to be, even though the challenge is difficult. 	This is a great fairy tale. I loved this book! So if you're looking for an exciting fairy tale, read The Wizard Of Oz 
 I think this album is wonderful.It mixers rock and blues in an explosive way.The lirics are very beautiful and evocative.My favourite album of the yea 
 This little book is packed with important concepts for artists. The wisdom presented is essential for visual composition, regardless of the specific medium.  The author's treatment of value is especially valuable (pun intended). Color is important, but value is even more important. He explains why and shows how 
 Author David Peitrusza deserves plenty of kudos for his sweeping biography of Arnold Rothstein, the mad credited for fixing the 1919 World Series.  In "Rothstein" we have an overview of the man and his times with perhaps too much of an emphasis on peripheral people and events.  The reader will be regaled by stories of turn-of-the-century through prohibition era gamblers and big time criminals.  Readers will acquire a greater knowledge of the East Coast underworld and some of the prominent figures who walked the line between criminal and legitimate.  From casinos, race fixing and high society's degenerate gamblers to crooks both small time and big, "Rothstein" is an excellent account of the times of  the famed gambler.  Rothstein surely ranks as one of this country's most notorious criminal master minds. As much as I enjoyed the book I would have liked getting to know the man himself a little better.  While readers will enjoy an opportunity to learn what AR, (as Rothstein was sometimes called) did, where and with whom he did it you cannot be sure to understand what made him tick.  His childhood and early years are skimmed over while great detail is given his murder and its subsequent investigation.  Hopefully someone can come along who will provide a fuller view of Rothstein.  For that biographer and anyone interested in a man immortalized by F. Scott Fitzgerald in "The Great Gatsby"  Petrusza's book is a must-read.  Whatever "Rothstein's faults as a biography, it is still a good read and highly recommended 
 Death in Venice (1912) is a disturbing story, one that is not easy to forget. It is also exceptional literature, a classic of the twentieth century. Thomas Mann's Death in Venice might be best compared to the subtle, psychologically complex fiction of Henry James, Joseph Conrad, and Fyodor Dostoevsky.    In Munich the aging, highly respected author Gustav Aschenbach is in need of change, rest in a new setting, to overcome his growing fatigue that is impacting his writing. While recovering in Venice, Aschenbach slowly, but inexorably, becomes mesmerized by a young Polish boy staying at the seashore with his aristocratic family. Aschenbach is intellectually aware of his growing obsession, but he is seemingly unable to break away. Thomas Mann's somber portrayal of this troubled man is a masterpiece of subtle nuances and psychological intensity.  Thomas Mann's lengthy sentences and complex grammatical structures severely complicate the task of translating Death in Venice. I have read two excellent and yet substantially different translations. The most faithful translation is by Stanley Appelbaum (Dover edition, 1995). This new translation tries to be as literal as possible, carefully preserving the comparative length of the original sentences as well as the internal sequence of each original German sentence.  Contrastingly, the H. T. Lowe-Porter translation is considered the most delightful and readable version, although at the expense of subdividing many of Mann's lengthy sentences. Lowe-Porter's version has been the standard translation for many years.     The Dover edition provides an excellent 10-page commentary, including footnotes 
 The book I read was Michael Jordan written by Sean Dolan. I thought it was a very good book because it tells a lot about Michael Jordan. The book tells all about his high school years, to his college years, and his NBA career. I also liked the book because it tells how dedicated he was to basketball and how he loved the game. The book tells about all the awards he won, like three championships in a row, the MVP Award, and best defensive player of the year. He also won a dunk contest with some amazing dunks. I think this book is for all the basketball players and all the fans of Michael Jordan 
 James Foley has written an excellent book!  Most books covering business topics are dry and boring.  This book has kept me interested in the area of global business.  Good explanations and it flows well from subject to subject.  I'm an engineer and this has helped me understand our international dilemmas in our company as well as helping me in my travels and dealings with foreign suppliers.  I got this book through my MBA class and was so impressed I went to one of Mr. Foley's lectures.  A must for your collection

 It's a very well written self-contained yet compact "QUANTITATIVE" risk management book. Just as the title, it gives a comprehensive and in-depth coverage of the concepts, techniques and tools, applicable in modeling equity, credit, or operational risk. The writing style is clear and rigorous; it serves a good reference book.

 I went over the backpacking cookbooks offered on Amazon using the extremely useful viewable pages, and selected the three I thought were best. Of the three I purchased, the Well-Fed-Backpacker is notably more informative. It is in that class of books known as perennial favorites, first published in 1976 and still a very strong book today in its third edition. If you are buying one or three as I did, be sure to include this book 
  This is an easy-to-read and straightforward review of the basic principles of Pilates. It is by no means comprehensive, but it is practical and specific, giving cursory info about anatomy and biomechanics. It also evaluates common choreography on the mat and machines, to show how this info applies in context. Cool!  
 This book of humorous snippets is at least selected by Frank Muir, which makes a change from John Carey. Frank Muir is an elegant and extremely witty and ingenious virtuoso of the English himself, but I still have to wonder what the possible purpose can be of a farrago of miscellaneous excerpts from different authors. I could have understood collecting a nosegay of the witticisms of some particular writer or of some specific school of writing, but this lengthy tome takes in Smollett, Goldsmith, Poe, Jerome K Jerome, Dylan Thomas, Evelyn Waugh and Beryl Bainbridge, to name but a few. The most astonishing absentee is Oscar Wilde, but some of Bernard Shaw's musical, theatrical and artistic reviews are here. I welcome those thoroughly, as I do the excerpt from a review by Macaulay, but where, I wonder, is A E Housman, whose excoriations of his fellow scholars surpass either of them not only in forcefulness but for sheer hilarity. Otherwise the roll-call of the humorous includes many who are predictable, in no adverse sense. I would certainly have expected to find Dorothy Parker, H L Mencken and Mark Twain, for instance, and so I do. Not all the items chosen are from specific authors - the satirical magazine Private Eye is represented, partly by Auberon Waugh under his own name but also by the spoof diaries and letters of the prime ministerial spouses Mrs Wilson and Mr Thatcher, which are anonymous and may be co-operative efforts. Certain other press series are officially under nicknames, but we all know that Beachcomber in the Daily Express was J B Morton, and that Myles Na Gopaleen of the Irish Times is Brian O Nuallain (aka O'Nolan). The authorship of the Peter Simple column in the Daily Telegraph changed from Colin Welch to Michael Wharton, and not to its advantage in general, but the excerpts here are actually the funniest things that I spotted in the whole book, and I imagine they are the work of the former. His maverick right-wing politics are not my own, but I used to find his stuff irresistible. Other contributors are not household names, possibly not even in their own households, but I would certainly have expected such eminent men of letters as Muir himself and the syndics of the Oxford University Press to have known among them that Humphry Berkeley spelt his first name thus and not `Humphrey'.   In general don't expect to roll in too many aisles. This is an anthology of good-quality humorous prose, not a book of gag-lines and one-liners. You may spot here and there, as I did, the occasional piece that is to your particular liking, whether a treasured recollection or even, if we are lucky, something new to us. I was never much of an enthusiast for Punch in general (except when it was edited by Muggeridge) nor of Basil Boothroyd in particular, but I applaud heartily his scathing comments on the programme-notes of a classical concert he attended, and the poke in the eye he administers not so much to Beethoven himself as to his hagiographers who have done so much to distort people's view of music in general. This was a lucky find - I do not pretend to have read the whole massive book nor do I ever propose to do so, nor indeed can I imagine who ever will. I still fail completely to envisage the readership of a work like this, and I would guess its future belongs mainly on the shelves of the more traditionally-minded libraries and in the hands of browsers in second-hand bookshops searching for curiosities.   Alas, Muir probably had no option but to contribute a preface devoted to the doomed enterprise of trying to define and categorise humour. I find such stuff virtually unreadable, but for all I know it may have value to earnest students of Eng Lit and their instructors, if that is any word for them. I hope they paid Muir well for it, because if they were going to set about such a fatuous project as this in the first place they were lucky to have him. It is all good quality, I make no bones about that. I make a whole ossiary of bones about putting out such a ridiculous publication to begin with, but making allowance for personal prejudice and individual temperament I can, and perhaps ought to, award it four stars 
 I read a lot of books on religion and faith, and most leave me without much to chew on. This book is quite different. You might not think celebrities would have much to say of interest about faith. But these interviews drew me in. Even celebrities I could care less about say something thought provoking.  Maybe it's the author's choice of subjects, or more likely it's her interviewing skills, but this is a must read for people on a journey of faith.  
 I'm an Irish music snob and tend to shun any band that gets too much attention. So I avoided Altan for a long time until I finally picked up this collection. I couldn't have been more wrong about them. Traditional  and high-spirited without being too pop. Highly recommended 
 This book is not heavy-duty reading, on the history of the dark art of Black Magick.Personally,i'm a 'White Witch' and probably deemed 'fluffy' by many head-bangers.This magickal modern classic ,by Richard Cavendish, was intended to be a introductory primer ,when it was published in 1967.There are many interesting areas of the dark side of the Black Satanic Arts covered here,such as numerology and ritual magick.Donald Tyson wrote ,'Ritual Magic',in 1981.Which would seem redundant,if you had read,'The Black Arts'.(-Tyson's book did have many good antique photos though.)- If you are a student of Magick history,with an interest in the darker side of witchcraft,you will enjoy this book.It was republished in the original type-set.So many classical re-prints have such a sterile ,computer-print look to them,that it removes the pleasure of reading and absorbing the literature.For folks who are looking for weighty material from this paperback,will have to look into hard-cover works from the magicians of yesteryear .Yet,this book explains well the basic foundations that today's earth-magicians look to for ritual guidance.  
 I remember the movie from way back, and this book by Thomas Harris convinced me yet again (As if I ever doubted it) that the written word is far more entertaining and enjoyable than the big screen.  The book took me in straight away and the evil face of Hannibal Lector portrayed by Hopkins in the movie, climbed into bed with me each night, as I flicked off the light switch.  A compelling, yet at times disturbing read, that makes it hard to put the book down. If you enjoyed the movie, the book is an absolute must!   
 This book of short essays provokes you to think about what motivates your own life, to formulate a statement of the beliefs that sustain you. When read in a class, it elicits meaningful discussion by introducing a wide variety of perspectives presented in clear and concise prose 
 Anyone interested in the Doors will love this book. As the title says, it has stories about each song-- how they developed, who wrote them, who they're about, etc. Plenty of good pictures as well. Plus a chronology and discography of the Doors 
 Do you like books about survival? Well if you do then "Hatchet" is the book for you.   In it you learn how to survive and the will to survive. For example when Brian crashes he needs get things sorted out,like he would need to know when to set up camp and get food. An example of when he needed the will to survive is when the rescue plane had flown over him he had lost all hope, but he kept going with the will to survive.   By CJ and Brocky, 5th Grader 
 One of my favorite tarot books.  Has wonderful spreads that really pin point answers to the most asked questions.  Very easy to follow and enjoyable 
 I have two children now, and I wish this item had been available when my older daughter was born.  I have tried everything to keep my babies' heads from slumping over in the car, and nothing worked 100% of the time.  This however does.  It is one of the best things I have ever purchased for my child and it's very inexpensive 
 If you like cats, this book is for you. It discusses cats in every area of our lives!  Cats in folklore, cats in theatre, cats and the law- the list goes on! I enjoyed this book 
 I must admit to being a little disappointed with the first book in James Morrow's "Godhead" trilogy, Towing Jehovah. It wasn't as deep and complex as I expected, and it wasn't particularly realistic or effective as satire. This, the second book in the trilogy, however, is absolutely a great masterpiece. One of the best theological satires I have ever read - this ranks up there with Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle, Twain's Letters From The Earth, and Heinlein's JOB. Morrow obviously put a TON of work and research into the writing of this book, and he should be commended for it. Not only does he posit - and offer a counter-argument to - most of the major theories for and against the existence of God, but also those of theodicies, and tackles such uninviting, thankless, and complex questions as the root of evil, the benevolent Creator, the problem of existence, among other such savory topics. It is almost incredible the amount of information that Morrow is able to cram into this book's 300 pages - you'd have to read several volumes worth of philosophy, theology, and fiction to come close to enduring all the topics that this book touches upon. It is very, very well written as well. Morrow has obviously matured much as a writer. Whereas Towing Jehovah was filled with screwball characters who were hard to follow and relate with, all the characters in Blameless In Abaddon are very well sketched - and many of them are simply hilarous. The book is great satire. It's one of the funniest books I've ever read, as well. It's very, almost astonishingly, well done. This book is everything that Towing Jehovah wasn't. I strongly, strongly reccommend it - my highest reccommendation 
 Interesting, profit to the beginners and the experts,manageable, good explanations, very beautiful!  
 Current hip-hop looks like an iceberg. 10 percent is visible above the surface, where it floats safely with limited sounds, styles and subject matter. Meanwhile, 90 percent thrives beneath the surface -- a dense mass encompassing everything from virtuosic old-school to abstract new flavors,  usually delving into parts of life not involved with bringing pain, getting  paid or getting laid.  On its most basic level, The  Unbound Project is a money-and-awareness-raising benefit for death row  dissident, convicted cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal, so politics will largely  determine who buys this disc. But on an artistic basis, these meditations  on freedom -- many of which don't mention ABu-Jamal -- present a scenic  view of hip-hop at its most accomplished form. Here, with the top and  bottom in solidarity, the synergy's enough to melt the polar caps entirely 
 The cover photo of an alert non-Gerber baby.  An old family photo topping each chapter.  These help set a whimsical tone skillfully followed through with words only a mother could love.  From tufted-head to stubbed-toe, this book celebrates the spunk of youth with countless recalls of which our inner tot can relate.   We could long for a Dad like hers--who loved his third child enough to casually coin her Zippy.  Through her eyes, this family doesn't take itself too seriously. How Zippy organizes and rationalizes daily undertakings is felt as youthful, reads as youthful.  The flightiness of friendships, unnerving nature of neighbors and natural distancing from parents are all taken in stride and delicately expressed.  She's a child with shameless pride in plainness.  Any precociousness is thankfully not odious.  This folk-child character seems too clever to be actual, too enlightened to be real, but we're more than happy to play along.   The book's subtle intrigue--all well told with a perception that belies its naï¿½ve charm.  Haven Kimmel has pulled off some retro-realism with finesse.  A delightful and amusing read.  
 Truly a "House of quality." As the author stated, it is a basic book to introduce the user on this important concept. It is easy to read and meets all my expectations. I especially enjoyed the links with other areas of quality management. The book could have been made bigger with more examples but it is very cohesive as it stands. It is a must read to all interested in quality function deployment especially starters like me 
 Usually biography of a person like Buffett would be dull and slow, but not this one. Although there are no usual "Warren Buffett Way" tips on stock picking, the book uncovers various aspects of Buffett's life, which has great implications on how Buffett grew into what he is today.  Two thumbs up! Another great great book by Roger Lowenstein.  Did I mention it's the only Buffett book you'll ever need 
 This book is a great reference for any owner and is so easy to use. It has saved me a couple trips to the emergency animal centers in the middle of the night. It is written simply to help you know what you can handle and what is a true emergency to take to the vet. If your looking for a more indepth explanation to different diseases and illnesses this isn't an encycolpedia of information, but if you want something that you can easily look up a symptom or multiple symptoms in chart form with a simple solution this is it! It is also wonderful that it tells you what breeds of dogs are prone to what problems to give you a better picture of what could be happening to your dog. Just last week my dog was sneezing very labored and constant and after 10 minutes he wouldn't stop and you could clearly see he was starting to panic but I could see nothing was in his nose but he kept on. After 15 minutes we knew something was wrong he was pacing, and wouldn't calm down and since it was 11:00pm we would have to drive a 1/2 hour to the emergency animal hospital so we had decide something quick. My husbend remembered this book and he looked it up and he had what was called reverse sneezing and it said to give him wet food. We did and he stopped sneezing almost immediately. Just this morning my friend called me to say her dog was lame and had a fever and asked me to look it up and see what this book had said about it. I can't tell you enough how wonderful a book this is!   
 I loved this book.  I couldn't put it down.  It brought to life that era of art.  It is obvious that this "fictional" book was thoroughly researched and based on the true story.  I recommend this to all my art students and to my friends who want a spicy read on artists and that time period 
 I purchased a microwave plate cover 20 years ago. It was perfect, but finally cracked up and needed to be replaced this year. I purchased this Nordic Ware Microwave Plate Cover and am satisfied. My 20 year old plate cover had a larger circumference than my new one. This new one may be smaller, but seems sturdier. Let's see if it lasts 20 years 
 If you were to own only one sock book forever; this would be the one. The 'golf' socks are the equivalent of instant gratification in that they are simple and knit up quickly. Plus this pattern was my first foray into using charts, for the little motif on the back of the heels.   Well, from there you can move on slowly or dive into the gloriously colored Travelling Socks, and you'll never fear color work again!  My copy is so worn already; I never travel without it. Plus, you can take pieces from each pattern and come up with your personalized "vanilla" sock pattern 
 This book is comprehensive. I have learned more about Win16 and Win32 API in 4 chapters than in several books I have read thus far. As you are probably already aware, Win API adds power by extending Visual Basic programming. If you want to understand Visual Basic and it's  C programming interface, stop browsing for a moment and buy this book. This is by far the best programming book I have read, and I suspect it's just a useful for the advanced programmer as it is to the novice. This book better be in your library

 As a parent of five children and very concerned about their future in America I found this book to be very thorough in what is happening to our culture.  I found David Kupelian did an excellent job in untangling every topic.  I found myself very stressed out after reading each chapter because it is so thought provoking and actually disturbing to have the truth presented in such a way.  I would highly recommend this book

 The name of the book I am reviewing is called Bandit's Moon by Sid Fleicman. The two main characters are Joquin Murita and Anyyrose Smith. In the beginning of the story Joquin ,the bandit,takes Annyrose but he is after another character named Calicos. Joquin and Annyrose help each other out. Annyrose teaches Joquin to read while Joquin helps Annyrose to find her brother Lank. To find out more read this great book

 Refreshingly innovative!  Unexpectedly broad in range!  Alternative at its best!  As you listen, you won't have a clue what the next song will sound like.  Count on stimulating lyrics as well as intriguing musical transportation.  Note that the adult language may not be suitable for all tastes 
 Great illustrations and a fun story for both the reader and child.  Having read this to my son (now 19) since he was a pre-schooler, I can tell you from experience that this one will be a well worn classic at your house.  Get ready to read it 5 times a day

 In THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY, written in 1955, Patricia Highsmith has created a fictional character as memorable as John Updike's Rabbit Angstrom or Arthur Miller's Willie Loman and just as American in Tom Ripley. She has taken the theme used so often by American fiction writers from Hawthorne to Henry James of the innocent American traveling in Europe and turned it upside down since Ripley, who travels to Italy and other places in Europe, is anything but blameless as he murders to get what he wants.   This novel is so much more than a conventional crime novel. Highsmith writes beautiful, to-the-point prose and totally engages the reader is Ripley's exploits. Her writing is reminiscent of both Henry James and Poe--early in the novel Herbert Greenleaf asks Tom if he has read James' THE AMBASSADORS. He has to reply that he has not-- and she can tell as chilling a tale as any writer I can think of. Even though most of us probably have a pretty good idea of how the novel will end, since two films have been made from it-- the French film EN PLEIN SOLEIL (1960) and THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY (1999)--we share Tom's fears and concerns-- realizing we should know better-- as he tells one lie after another to cover his murderous tracks, piling one indiscretion on another but always landing on his feet.  Highsmith presents the classic love triangle with a twist. Marge, whom Ripley detests and describes her figure as "gourdlike," is in love with the well-off Dickie Greenleaf and dislikes and distrusts Ripley, believing that he is, in the language of the times, a "sexual deviant."  Even if you have seen one or both of the films about this most talented character, you'll be intrigued and entertained by the novel.   
 Beautifully written and dramatically narrated, The Grey King is yet another of this fine author's fantasy series about a young boy unwittingly destined to fight the final battle between the light and the dark on planet earth. Will Stanton is portrayed realistically as an untested, frequently confused adolescent Old One who must summon up the courage to persist in this conflict no matter what terrifying threats the Dark conjures up to destroy him and all things good. The Grey King takes place in Wales, one of the most mythic places on earth. Cooper skillfully weaves folklore into this compelling adventure story, full of characters that come alive as loveable, hateful, and most of all, fully human. The narrator's mastery of drama and British accents is a delight. Highly recommended - if you enjoy Harry Potter, try the Dark is Rising series, no matter what your age 
 This is a great film.  The subject of widespread societal panic and the potential for anarchy among the masses has always been attractive to me and this movie delivers (think New Orleans).  the film is scary and gory and over the top but it is also a biting social critique.  Brainless Zombies wandering around the mall beacuse it makes them feel safe. It sounds like the mall near my house!  It's great.  It reminds me of Grand Theft Auto.  You go into the mall and can pretty much murder the public at will.  A rifle shot to the head being the most gratifying.  The shear bliss of having the entire mall and all of if its treaures to yourself.  Looting and killing.  It's so liberating 
 Being vegan can be a chore sometimes - it's the best diet in the world, yet it takes such an effort to avoid the proliferance of animal products in this country!  But Marie Oser makes being vegan easy - and fun - and DELICIOUS!  I have worn out her two other books from use, and I enjoying this new one so much.  Every recipe is so tasty, her books have expanded my menu incredibly!  The Enlightened Kitchen is informative, too - jam-packed with details to help you make good eating choices.  You'll love it 
 This is a great book.  I was given it in a pile and recently picked it up and then could not put it down.  Great characters, detail and story.  My wife stayed up until 3 in the morning to finish it.  Read this book if you get a chance 
 This reference book fills a niche for the secondary music teacher, private tutor, and church music director searching for a scholarly, yet concise definition of musical terms and brief biographical sketches of musicians 
 This sharpner worked so well that I bought a second one to have when I wear this one out 
 In this comic novel, John Cheever revels in the power of the written word. Leander Wapshot, hero of the book, is endlessly browbeaten by his sister Honora and his wife Sarah, but through the journal he keeps, despite his writing in choppy, incomplete sentences, he's able to rise above his humiliations and is even able to give some good advice to his son Coverly at the very end of the novel in a scrap of paper Coverly finds in a volume of Shakespeare belonging to Leander. The novel is also concerned with Leander's two sons, Coverly and Moses, as they leave home to seek their fortunes. Moses' story is fairly complicated, with many different adventures and twists and turns, and both he and Coverly end up in not very promising marriages. Cheever is at his strongest in character development and at his weakest in plot construction; in fact, there's hardly a plot at all. The dialogue is superb, however, and therein lies much of the humor of the book. I regard Cheever a better short story writer than a novelist, but there's still much to admire in this National Book Award-winning novel, his first 
 I've bought it for my mom and tested it for some weeks before I send it to her. Overall It was great buy. I didn't have any music cassette tape so I put in blank tape and record some voices and the quality was fine. Ofcourse It wasn't digital recorder so It has some constant noice of tape running but sound quality was great. It was far better than those in the mp3 player's built in mic recorder. You can adjust the speed of a tape and make some funny sound like cartoony voice. Only concirn is it doesn't have auto stop or auto-reverse so always do it by manually 
 One reviewer said this book was only for people who enjoy religion, but I disagree.  I am very skeptical about organized religion, and I absolutely love and applaud this book.  This story is one of acceptance and teaches that many opinions of God can be correct.  The illustrations are beautiful and so is the story that Wood tells.  I think it's an important message for kids to hear and for parents to remember 
 This comfort meter works very good.  The shipment came in time for a gift for Christmas.  One for us, one for gift.  
 Typical John Grisham...exciting and very fast paced.  One of his best.  A great insight to what Sam is feeling and going through before being executed and the effort his grandson, Adam is doing to save his grandfather's life. I couldn't put this book down.  Highly Recommended 
    This beautifully illustrated book is lovely for reading alone but also makes a great read-aloud selection.  A lady read this to our Rotary Club for a Christmas program and everyone was touched by the poem.  It has a wonderful cadence and the message comes through very clearly without being preachy.    We all need to slow down during the Christmas season and tune into our emotions rather than just rush through our holiday "to do" list 
 The plot of "In the Beauty of the Lilies" is as ambitious as the title itself, and in the hands of a lesser author, I daresay the story would've run out of steam by page 30.  But this is Updike, an author who could write riveting and gorgeous VCR instruction manuals.  The book's scope is grand.  It follows in intricate detail the pulses and patterns of an entire family through four generations, giving us not just a powerful look at the evolution of the family, but of the country in which they live.  The balance between the two is delicate, but Updike's sparkling prose never loses its focus.  Although the details of America's growing pains are ever-present and, even more important, amazingly done, they never overshadow the story of the Wilmot clan, never seem tacked on just for authenticity's sake.  Likewise, Updike's story itself, although it focuses on four individuals from the same clan, effectively utilizes two contrasting symbols that could very easily have become heavy-handed icons: religion and the movies.  In fact, the book begins with two simultaneous incidents: a starlet passing out from heat exhaustion in the middle of filming a movie scene, and a pastor -- Clarence Wilmot -- losing his faith in God with equal suddeness.  From here, Updike strolls through eighty years like a seasoned tour guide, showing us the bits and pieces that matter as this Wilmot family struggles to find its faith again in a world ever more obsessed with the superficial and unreal.  The book loses some steam in the second part, during the story of Teddy, Clarence's clawless son.  This section functions most obviously as a chrysalis, giving the story (and the country) time to mature into something bigger.  Updike's compelling writing keeps Teddy's rather uneventful tale from devolving into something mundane, although there are points where it is a bit redundant.    He moves from here, though, into the life of Teddy's daughter, Essie, within whom the book finds its strongest thematic purchase.  Bred with a "private God" and an insatiable desire for filmdom's fame, Essie grows into a famous film actress who, amazingly, gets everything she prays for, although she doesn't necessarily pray for everything she gets.  One of the latter things is a son, Clark, who headlines the final part of the book, a tale overtly inspired by the Branch Davidian disaster.  In spite of the glaring similarities, the story itself is still well-told (if not, in some parts, a tad hazy) and bristling with import.    Updike's message is not as clear as his vibrant words, but it is certainly as accessible.  Flowing through his smooth, well-pieced narrative is a liquid-crystal meaning, a well-stated (never obvious) point about where true faith goes, if it ever goes anywhere at all.  It certainly isn't a cliched coincidence that the book's most cinematic (and melodramatic) moment is also its most truly soulful.  And for a book with this much spirit (see the last line of Clarence's section), this much tenderness (see the last line of Teddy's section), and this much brutal urgency (see the last line of Essie's section), well, that's saying quite a lot 
 I really love this CD.  It's the perfect background music for a sexy rendezvous.  
 The book "Astrology, Psychology and the Four Elements" by Stephen Arroyo is an interesting viewpoint of astrology that emphasizes an individual's psychological make-up from an astrological perspective.  Published in 1975, Mr. Arroyo divided the book into two parts.  The first part he entitled "Astrology & Psychology", which contains eight chapters.  The second part he entitled "The Four Elements: An Energy Approach to Interpreting Birth Charts", which also contains eight chapters (numbered from nine to sixteen).  What differentiates this book from other typical astrology books is that it is not merely a look-up table for trying to interpret a person's birth chart.  In the first part, Mr. Arroyo compares the works of various psychologists (such C. G. Jung, Sigmund Freud and O. Hobart Mowrer), physicians (such as Alexander Ruperti), philosophers (such as L. L. White, Hans Stossel, Irving F. Laucks and Pascal), biologists (such as Père Tielhard de Chardin) and writers (such as Goethe) with various astrologers (such as Dane Rudhyar, David Hamblin and Marc E. Jones), mythological experts (such as Joseph Campbell) and people claiming clairvoyant abilities (such as Edgar Cayce).  From these (and many others whom I have not named), Mr. Arroyo creates a synthesis to describe a more humanistic and holistic approach to both psychology and astrology, and encourages psychological counselors interested in astrology to utilize tools from astrology to assist in understand their patients.  He also lays the foundation for viewing the zodiacal signs with regard to the seasons of the year in which they fall with their corresponding psychological meanings.  In the second part, Mr. Arroyo describes various astrological components, such as the signs of the zodiac (from a more elemental perspective), the planets (from an "energy regulator" perspective) and the houses.  He emphasizes that a simple mechanistic approach of chart interpretation often falls short when the impact of the elements themselves are not fully taken into account, as well as not taking into account how particular individuals may make decisions that overcome what might otherwise may be misinterpreted as "difficult" aspects, when they might actually be good.  His descriptions of the elements were well thought out, as were his discussions of elemental imbalances.  In the final two chapters, he touches briefly on chart comparisons between people and the houses.  Overall, I found "Astrology, Psychology and the Four Elements" to be a very interesting read.  I rate the book with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning some basics about astrology 
 As a Timothy Dalton fan, I had to watch "The King's Whore" just to see a new side of my favourite actor, and I was completely drawn into it.  There is a lot of fighting and it is rather risque at times, but the plot is memorable.  I loved the costumes and the scenery of Europe--this is a period piece about a king who falls desperately in love with a young married woman.  She feels trapped because every single person she knows and trusts blames her for not agreeing to serve her king--by becoming his mistress.  It takes her own husband disbelieving that she has not yet gone to the king for her to succumb to the pressure, yet she never enjoys his presence at all.  A war erupts with France and she becomes ill, and because of the king's love for her, he cannot concentrate on fighting a war and instead heals her himself.  I won't give away the ending, but it's a superb film with excellent acting.  I definitely recommend it, but caution everyone that it deserves it's 'R' rating 
 I used this book to prepare for FPGEE. clear and concise, very helpfull 
 I got this because the author was at one time affiliated with the Golden Dawn. It is horror that was an influence of H.P. Lovecraft. I liked it because the author maintains an aura of darkness that could be disturbing. This is neo pagan horror that you usually don't see any more. Stehpen King commercialized horror but this is more obscure. A few pages in I already thought highly of it. I thought it was cool that he was such an icon back at the turn of the last century. 
 Once again, Hybrid drops another spectacular album.  Teaming w/the washington orchestra the two boys from wales drop one of their best albums yet.  (i would have to say wide angle is still the best) however, since i started spinning back in 97, hybrid has been at the top of my list for their innovative sound.  Hyrbid steps away from the mainstream breaks movement to deliver a solid, techy, progressive break album with incredible vocals and synths!!! A must have for any break junkie or electronic music lover 
 Let me begin by confessing my bias.  I met Dr. Constable at a book signing  and have since maintained a warm e-mail friendship.  Having said that, I  think any one who is interested in the culture of the Philippines, the  culture of Hong Kong, the Filipino Diaspora, or the multi-variate roles of  women in the emerging cultures of Asia will find a great deal of  interesting material, conveyed thoughtfully and with sensitivity 
  I find it very interesting that so many Christians know so very little about the history of their own religion. Notwithstanding, the same can also be said about the Jews and Muslims, as well as others. This is because religious people are generally taught by religious authorities, and not by historians. It's no secret that, although most Christians have one or more copies of the bible at home, a very small percentage of them actually read it.   From what I can tell, it seems like most Christians know more about their favorite celebrities than they do about the man they worship as God.  Take this for instance; how many Christians are actually aware that Jesus was a Jew? Not just by a Jew by association, but a Jew by practice, a Torah-observant Jew? The gospels tell us that Jesus was circumcised on the eight day, studied the Jewish scriptures (he knew the scriptures very well, throughout the gospels he quotes from the Torah, like when Satan tempted him), attended the Jewish temple, preached exclusively to Jews in synagogues, and celebrated Jewish festivities. He is even called "Rabbi" by his disciples in all four of the gospels.   Furthermore, the gospel of Matthew shows us that Jesus never intended to create a new religion. Jesus tells his exclusively all-Jewish followers, "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill" (Matthew 5:17).   It is also worth mentioning that Christianity did not exist during the time of Jesus, or even decades after his death. If you search for the word "Christian" or "Christianity" in the gospels, you will not find it. Jesus never mentions such words, nor do any of his disciples. The word "Christian" is mentioned a couple of times by Paul in Acts, and once in 1 Peter, but those letters were written more than thirty years after Jesus died.  So the question is, how did this tiny Jewish sect (and mind you, there were several different Jewish sects) become a religion totally independent and separate from its roots? More specifically, how did this "Jesus movement" evolve to become Christianity? Certainly, this transformation did not happen overnight.  To answer this question, L. Michael White takes us on a journey back to first century Palestine - Jesus' homeland - where he examines the social, cultural, political, and religious environment of that time and explains us the effects it had on this "Jesus Movement." There, White also explores the role of the Roman Empire, the beliefs of Judaism's various sects, the influence of Greek culture and religion, and the wars between the Jews and the Romans. By examining the four phases, or generations, of early Christianity, we begin to understand the transition of "Jesus to Christianity."   Besides Jesus and his disciples, many other important figures are mentioned in this book, including their role in shaping Christianity: Ignatius, Clement, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Marcion, Tertullian, Eusebius, and others.  In my opinion, this book is profound enough to enlighten anyone who wishes to gain a clear understanding of early Christianity - from an historical perspective, that is. Mr. White proves to be a formidable expert on the subject and shows objectivity throughout this well-written tome.   I highly recommend it! Five Stars. 
 My Grade 9 English class just watched this movie in class, and the music caught my attention. I'm an ice skater and i thought hey, maybe I'll skate to this. I think this is a wonderful cd, the music conveys the emotion of the movie excellently, and the movie was very good too. I recommend seeing the movie, and buying the cd 
 This is probably one of the most rewarding books anyone can read.  If you care about government and what it does (or doesn't) do to (or for) you, read this book.  It requires patience and concentration, but it's well  worth the effort.  The authors succeed in showing how it is wrong to assume  that government has always the best of intentions.  They put a human face  on politics and explain with impressive reasoning why government and  politics produce unreasonable outcomes.  The explanatory power of this book  is unmatched.  Anyone who cares about what this country is and what it  could be should read it.  Despite what you may have heard, their agenda is  not conservative, it is individualistic, treating each person with dignity.   The outcomes may surprise you, but you can't help but be moved by the  force of their logic 
 I purchased this book because I first read it as a child in 1961.  It was the first time the island of Krakatoa was brought to my attention, and helped spawn my interest in geology.  The book was new and in pristine condition.  Reading it brought back wonderful memorie 
 I found this book to be very one sided. The author is trying to prove his point that the UN is some type of poison being fed to the rest of the world as a form of candy. He accused the UN of wanting to do away with small governments and create a world government. By using examples such as the international criminal court treaty, a treaty in which anyone can be brought to a world trial. Though it did open my eyes to things they don't teach you in high school, i found myself a little uneasy by the time i got to the 2nd chanpter. If all the author is saying is true. well then i think the US needes to make a drastic decision and pull itself right out of the UN. But then again the author could be completely over ananalyzing the world we live in simply trying to unify itself. And i see no harm in doing that 
 'Rescue' carries on the series' tradition of choice excerpts (19) from well-and lesser-known authors.  Therein lies the beauty of this series - I had never heard of Spike Walker (!) but after reading the riveting excerpt in 'Rescue' I ran out and bought both his books.  Two of the selections are fiction, not my taste, but the other 17 tales of peril, shipwrecks, avalanches and plane crashes will have you reading all night.  The stories range from professionals who take one risk too many to everyday folks who find themselves over their heads without warning.  A great gift book for anyone who thrives on adventure and especially if you you know someone in search/rescue or the Coast Guard.  Get all the books in this series - I have and I love 'em

 If you have ever struggled putting furniture such as this together, you will LOVE this item.  I also purchased the hutch and had both together in about 30 minutes.  This company does much of the work for you!  The desk looks great and made very well.  Highly Recommen 
 I can always tell if a movie is good right from the Start, and this one pulled me in right away.  A lot of twists and turns in this movie.  A truly wonderful picture that really tugs at your heart with a great ending.  A very satisfying film!!  Buy it and you won't be sorry!  I'm so thankful it finally came out on DVD 
 I have been a fan of Paul Davis at the age of 15 years old(31yr old now) and i will always love this  artist who can use his musical canvas to make one smile through his art of music.His gift will be cherished by my children and i 
 This book is a sequel to Edwin Abbott's "Flatland" and makes its heroine a granddaughter of the hero of Abbott's book. Some people may find his playing with words excessive (his heroine is named "Victoria Line," combining the fact that she is literally a geometric "line" with the name of a subway line in London) but the book manages to cover a lot of territory in an amusing manner. I can't say I _learned_ a lot from the book, because I already knew most of its subject matter, but I'd certainly encourage someone who wanted to learn about curved spaces and higher dimensions to read it. The ultimate accolade: _After_ I had read it from cover to cover, I bought a copy, just so I'd have it in my own library 
 Bad News in Brooklyn  	Francie Nolan is the kind of person that lives life to the fullest, no matter what the circumstances are.  Francie is a poor Brooklyn girl, living in the early 1900's.  She has many struggles to overcome, and few opportunities.  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, a fiction novel by Betty Smith, is about the battles Francie and her family have to win in order to rise above poverty.   	A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is essentially a biography about Francie Nolan, the fictional heroine in this novel.  Francie is an intelligent and determined girl.  She is a wonderful writer, and has planned to read every single book in her local library.  Unfortunately, though, Francie's life is anything but perfect.  Her dad is a singing waiter, and he is addicted to alcohol.  Therefore, he doesn't bring home a lot of money, so Francie, her mom, younger brother, and dad, all have to live off of only a couple dollars a week.  In order to survive, Francie will have to work hard, and get a job to support her family.   	In this novel, Betty Smith describes in detail all of the characters' personalities, which helps the reader better understand their actions.  She also describes the time period very well, so it feels as if you're actually living back then.  	I really enjoyed this book because it opened my eyes to how different this country was, just less than a century ago.  Few people back then were well educated, and some were even illiterate.  It also made me see how difficult life is as an immigrant.   Francie has to grow up living through all of these hardships.    	I would recommend this book mostly to girls, ages 12 to 15.  Anyone who enjoys reading fiction or historical fiction , or who liked Number the Stars by Lois Lowry, is sure to love A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.  	 
 This book is a good guide for experimented people who has experimented TOC in manufacturing and now needs to apply TOC in service. It sets an outstanding relationship between TOC main concepts, as regarded in  factories, and how to yield results in service organization. The best  chapter is "Let there be light". Anyway, a remark must be made.  Ely ignores the special skills of Toyota Production System in reducing  set-ups. He accepts to stop machines as long as stops saling, rather than  apply TPS "one-touch exchange die" technique in the constraint,  in order to reduce lead-time and reach a segmented market, which would  raise sales and improve performance 
 Laurel and Hardy are the eternal image to many of down-on-their-luck individuals struggling just to get by in this world, and in his book "Stan and Ollie" author Simon Louvish explains why they appeal to us after almost a century has passed since their first film together. In an exhuastive and well-paced dual biography of the world's greatest comedy duo, Louvish provides insights into the two men who jointly comprised a team that was embraced the world over.  Stan Jefferson (Laurel) and Oliver Hardy could not have come from more different backgrounds: Laurel's father was a North England theater manager who dabbled in play-writing, and his son became an actor on the stage just as vaudeville was on its way out and films on their way in. Hardy never knew his father, a Civil War veteran and local celebrity in their part of the state of Georgia. Both men took long routes towards the inevitable pairing, as Louvish demonstrates in what can be felt as a "teaser" of near-misses and almost-rans between the two when they both arrive in Hollywood in the mid-teens. But in 1927, they finally teamed up and started what would become the most celebrated partnership in film comedy.  Throughout it all, Louvish gives us a portrait of the men behind the image that is all the more important to know. Hardy, the jolly fat-man, was actually self-conscious about his weight and struggled to keep it under control. Laurel, the simple child-like companion, was something of a ladies man, and the tales of his multpile marriages (including a series of ill-timed weddings to the same woman over the course of years) make for an interesting glimpse into his troubled private life.  Laurel and Hardy, together briefly during the last days of the silent era, were able to transcend the barrier of sound, and they may well have been meant for the new entertainment form. Louvish details how they not only survived in the wake of other silent performers (Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd) falling out of favor, but indeed prosper and contribute some of their best material in the early Thirties.  Throughout the book, Louvish intersects accounts of the films they made together with some of the personal details that helped to shape their time together. He also addresses the odd fact of their embrace by the gay community, and Hardy's troubled Southern heritage and what it may have meant to the era of the Thirties (when openly racist portrayals of the black race ran rampant and unchecked). Stan Laurel emerges as a particularly harried figure, as his constant marital troubles become the fodder for Hollywood gossip mavens (a precursor of the current swath of "celebrity marital trouble" stories circulating in today's entertainment-obsessed media).  In the entertaining way he critiques their work (first the golden years at Hal Roach's studio, then later the Twentieth Century Fox and MGM films), Louvish comes off not as a grumbling critic but a genuine fan, one who has sat through the dreck as well as the highlights. He can be trusted to give the straight story on the flops as well as the classics ("Sons of The Desert", "The Music Box", etc). Louvish's style is not the dry, bare-bones approach of more "scholarly" approaches to film, but he has the right amount of reverence to make up for any percieved flippancy towards his subjects. After all, his profile is that of a comedy duo, not an auteur like Kubrick or Godard.  Louvish successfully argues, what's more, that the films of Laurel and Hardy (while not meant to be artistic statements) are worthy of close study and even analysis for their place in easing the country through the Depression and the Second World War (a claim that he puts forth for the lesser Fox pictures, though acknowledging their flaws). What's more, the friendship between Laurel and Hardy is genunine, unlike so many comedy partnerships that seem fraught with tension.  The book is probably the closest we will get to knowing the real Laurel and Hardy, as well as understanding their most memorable films together. It will definitely be the first thing I recommend for L&H neophytes, and for diehard fans as well. Put simply, this is the book to read if you want to know about the greatest comedy duo of the film age. 
 This novel grippingly illustrates how money changes everything -- people, in particular -- regardless of how good or amoral they were to begin with.  Scott Smith does an excellent job demonstrating how one simple situation can snowball into a catastrophe and how one small irreversible action can lead an ordinarily good man down a path into the darker side of his soul.  I've always preferred reading a book first, before seeing its film adaptation and I'm glad that's what I did with this one.  I don't think a movie-goer can better see -- and feel -- the moral struggles and the characters' humanity than anyone reading this book.  The author really takes you into the lead character Hank Mitchell's mind and makes you want to stay there until you finish his story.  
 This is not a bad album really. Music is good, songs are well written, good high quality recordings, etc. What I don't get is why Capleton always have Joel and Chris of VP records produce his albums. The sound is still the same from since 'More Fire' -> "Still Blazing" -> now 'Reign of Fire'...I now have all three albums and all sound practically the same ... Capleton, get new producers please 
 To read through the accolades on the dust jacket, I expected miracles, or at least fireworks.  The book was entertaining and a worthy first effort, but not exactly the "most psychologically sophisticated thriller" this reviewer has ever read.  The many interesting subplots kept me up late into the night.  Unfortunately, even the author had trouble keeping track; one or two story lines got lost.  In the end, I found the race to the final conflict more exciting than the ultimate outcome.  Still, it was well worth the three dollars and the trip to the bargin bin 
 One of the most moving pieces of art I know, films, books included. As Dylan said, some of his lyrics he wrote at that time were so gorgeus that it is as if nobody could writ ethem, as if they were written by themselves using him. I mean, you could have an empty room, a boring day but as you begin to listen to this album everything seems full 
 Be sure to catch the Alternate views on Disk 2.  The view from the control booth with the director losing his mind, in a good way, is great.  They also have A Beautiful Day from the rooftop in Boston 
 Kirk Varnedoe gives us, in Gustave Caillebotte, not only a beautifully reproduced compendium of the artist's major works, but an unusually insightful commentary on his place in the Impressionist movement. Perhaps  most importantly, he offers a vision of Caillebotte that allows us to see  him as more than a "minor" impressionist, but as an original  precursor of modernism who remained true to his own unique vision despite  the influences of his better known contemporaries. The importance of late  nineteenth century photography, and especially the new, shorter 28 mm.  lenses of the period, on Caillebotte's treatment of perspective are  analyzed in detail through careful consideration of the preliminary studies  for "Rainy Afternoon in Paris" and "Pont de l'Europe".  While the author is forthright in his views of the "unevenness"  of Caillebotte's oeuvre, he makes a strong case for viewing what Varnedoe  refers to as Caillebotte's "internal personal dynamic" as a  driving force behind the artist's shifting styles and artistic innovations.  The illustrations faithfully reproduce the palette and nuances of  Caillebotte's work, still evolving at his untimely death at age 45. An  important appendix catalogues the gift of Caillebotte's extraordinary  personal collection of impressionist paintings to the French state. These  works by Monet, Renoir, Cezanne, Pisarro and others are part of the core  collection of the Musee d'Orsay, reminding us again of Caillebotte's role  as not only a contributor to the impressionist movement, but as a supporter  and champion of its promulgation 
     The first time I noticed MICHAEL FRANKS was on an awards show-it may have been the GRAMMY'S. He was singing "ISLAND LIFE". It was catchy and I found myself singing along with the refrain...we're just refugees from the island life, and so forth. Then I think he won the Grammy soon after he performed. This may have been around 1987 or '88. The next thing you know it, I see the video of "Island Life" on VH1. Then somewhere down the line I see "Your Secret's Save With Me" also on VH1. Both songs received radio airplay on our smooth jazz radio station here in Chicago. I also remember Michael Franks was in good company at the time as Basia, Sade, Enya, Swingout Sister, Kenny G and Al Jarreau all had hits simultaneously. It was a wave of smooth jazz hits one right after the other.        I recommend this and check out Michael Frank's other albums- you will not be disappointed.                  JULIUS-ALLAN   
 I have bought lots and lots of HTDM books and let me tell you that none of them are as great for a beginner as this one.(they are good dont get me wrong, but if you are just starting to draw manga, you must buy this one!) I have been drawing in the manga style for about three years now, but I find myself still obsessed with these books. I like to see all the illustrations and instructions that they contain. This one in particular I would recommend to all artists who are interested in this style. Even for people like me that have been drawing for some time, it is a nice way to brush up on your skills. I think that the nice thing about it is that it gives you many guidelines on proportion. I think anyone can use this book because its instructions to drawing are sooo simple.  Definetly a good buy!!!  (oh, and it has a really cute section on chibis!!! ^^  
 Puts....essa coleção é perfeita. Simplismente incrível. A diadática e o caminho que Feynman toma para explicar Física é simplesmente apaixonante.  Para quem gosta de Física, é obrigatório 
 Carter's book is not dated for me, but timeless. He has a droll and elliptical way of deflating the fatuous inclinations of book dealers.  Yes, there is no index, and it is tough to find exact terminology sometimes.  But this book is not a mere reference book, it is meant to be read and enjoyed and instruct you in the "what", but also the "why" and "how".  Carter, in his manner and wit, shows a *way* of approaching rare books which I think is very healthy.  His skewering of the term "mint condition" and his hilarious description of "issue mongers" have me revisiting this book for momentary pleasure again and again.  I started in used books in a store about 8 years ago and when I was hired, my boss put this book in my hands.  I have always appreciated that gesture.  Any collector should find both pleasure and knowledge in this tome 
 This highly underrated album is without question one of the best of the last ten years.  Although its popularity pales in comparison to that of its successor, "Absolution", the same cannot be said of its quality.  Every track on this album is adventurous and all are successful in their brave endeavors.  This musical journey through hard rock, art rock, new synth, and even opera-inspired pieces will wow you from start to finish.  An absolute must in any modern rock collection 
 This is one of those revolutionary Bay Area Gangsta Rap albums that blows a lot of that mainstream crap out the water then and now. The music brilliantly blends different eras of RnB, funk, with some hardcore rap beats that sound like devil-worshipping tunes, LOL. 11/5 consist of three members, TaydaTay, Maine-o, and Hennessy. Each of them giving a clever perspective on the street game topics they cover. The only track to skip is #1, the usual repetitive Herm "Keep The Peace" preaching. Despite that minor mishap, this has all the ingredients that make a classic record. Short, sweet, edgy, and consistent. What more can you ask for 
 I had heard about Muhammad Asad from his articles that he wrote on the vision of Pakistan. I was always intrigued by the clarity with which he wrote his ideas (Pakistan is no where close to how he envisioned it). I wanted to find out more about him. This book provided just that. Its a short summary of his prime years as a young man, how the Arab culture inspired him to study Islam and how his logical/analytical thinking guided him to truth. The way story has been laid out it is very captivating and eye opening from start to end 
 The first time I read this book, I was watching it all happen. i'ts like I was invisible. I admire Elizabeth for having the guts to do what she did. I would have fought back, but she did it the safe way, she didn't resist. Reading this book, you feel like you know the Smart family. I pray for all Missing Children everywhere. Elizabeth is the luckiest girl in the world! Mary Katharine was so cool and collected. she is amazing too. read this book 
 Having taught B&F in my early 17th cent. drama class, I can recommend Wit without Money and, to some extent, The Wild-Goose Chase. I would not bother with Wife for a Month, one of the weakest and poorly written of  their collaborations. Nevertheless, this is a handy book 
 I teach special ed with kids with severe behavior disorders. I've read Ghost Boy to or with every class for several years, ages sixth grade through twelfth, and the kids are always very responsive to the story and characters. It's a wonderful book for everyone - engaging, moving, fun and thought-provoking. (And, teachers, there's plenty of material that lends itself to lessons aimed at the visual and kinaesthetic learners- very "sensory" story.) 
 This magazine is absolutely wonderful.  After receiving my first copy, i went to their website and backordered about 10 copies...excellent reading and information regarding ideas on what people are doing to successfully make money off of your land...alpacas,flower growing,chickens, small and larger animal livestock, etc!  lots of neat advertisements too, on things you just didnt know existed.....i will never be without this magazine, it is inspirational 
 This book was written over 900 years ago by a muslim man. It was the first ever book on modern medicine. This book is the one that exposed modern medicine to the then backward western world and whole world. So popular that it was published 35 times and taught in Europe for 600 years. This book is a good ever lasting proof that east ( muslims ) started modern medicine. Muslim doctors were using Hollow needles to extract cataract when their western contemporaries didnt even knew it existed. Excellent work 
 This book brought tears to my eyes the first time I read it.  It is warm and comforting.  A wonderful message for children that their mama will always be there no matter what.. 
 The Witch of Blackbird Pond is Elizabeth George Speare's (1908-1994) second novel. It won the Newbery Medal with full votes in 1959, five years after its publication. Similarly to her previous "Calico Captive", Elizabeth George Speare draws her inspiration for this historical novel for young adults from real events. In "Calico Captive" it was Susanna Johnson's captivity, while in "The Witch of Blackbird Pond" episodes of witch hunting, that had taken place in the Author's hometown of Wethersfiled, Connecticut in 1648 and 1650-51, are the basis for a breathtaking story .  It is 1687, year of fighting of the Connecticut colonies to preserve their Charter menaced by the English, when young Kit Tyler, after the death of her grandfather in Barbados, decides to go live with her only relatives in Wethersfiled Connecticut, one of the many settlements on the Connecticut River. At her arrival  in her new home she finds a colony of Pilgrims of strict confession which reluctantly accept her as long as she "behaves" according to their unwavering rules. Her adoptive family is sincere, but mentally and emotionally closed, except maybe for her cousin Mercy, physically handicapped. Slowly Kit adapts to her new environment, but she cannot renounce her true character, her curiosity, her need of culture and spontaneous affection. She befriends a forlorn and neglected child, Prudence and an old and estranged Quaker woman, Hannah Tupper, two outcasts of society, and because of  her sincere affection and care is accused of witchcraft. Through hardships and real dangers and the help of true friends she finally finds out who she is and what she wants.   Three intermingling love stories make the plot even more captivating and the book is hard to put down once started. All the characters are lifelike and perfectly described and unforgettable, from cousin Mercy (modelled on Elizabeth George Speare's real aunt who was physically disabled), to Nat Eaton, the nicest, most sarcastic and challenging young man encountered in young adult literature, to Prudence the unpromising child who turns out to be Kit's most successful pupil and ultimate saviour.   I learned many years after having read the novel in 1967 that this book is today used as a text in English classes in elementary and middle school. Surely it contains many elements to dwell upon and it is hard to forget that Elizabeth George Speare was a teacher particularly dedicated to the study of childhood in the early days of American history. The historical setting of the novel is absolutely perfect with real characters such as Sir Edmond Andros and the royalist Rev. Gersholm Bulkeley that play the role they had in history. The detailed historical research behind the book is also evident from many elements: the pointing out of religious differences, the anti-Quaker bigotry, the psychological explanation based on ignorance of the fear of witchcraft, the difficulty of living in a Pilgrim entourage for a person with sound Faith but educated according to different models.  Elizabeth George Spear's knowledge of adolescent problems is evident as well in the way she conveys the sense of feeling a stranger in a different world and in the attempt to fit in while maintaining independence. Another very New Englandish emotion one gets from the book is the beauty of the changing of seasons from the glory of autumn, to the first snow that can be understood only by people who have lived there.  After so many years, I ask myself how much influence can a writer have on children. Elizabeth George Speare had an enormous influence on me in particular, but I think she did on many through the development of an instinct of independence and especially of compassion and acceptance. I want to remember that in the acceptance speech for the Newbery Medal for "The Witch of Blackbird Pond" she said.. "I do not believe a historical novel should gloss over the pains and the ugliness. But I do believe that the hero .. should on the last page.. still be standing, with the strength to go to whatever the future may hold."  Another small notation, near the end of the book there is a recall to the poetry of  Anne Bradstreet (1612-1672), the first woman poet of American literature, for a long time ignored and forgotten by many and only recently rediscovered in her actuality. Mrs. Speare's citation of her shows us not only her culture and knowledge of early American history but also stimulates the reading of these beautiful poems that immerge us into the atmosphere of "The Witch of Blackbird Pond". 
 While this book is not the best Rollins one out there, it's definitely satisfying for anyone who has read and enjoyed his other books. While I think his new book Black Order is by far his best work yet, this book is not at all bad and kept me very interested and compelled at what was coming next throught the entire book. With the book's setting and plot both involving  the Arabian peninsula, I was a little hesitant about reading it because I haven't had any particular interest in reading about the area, but as usual, Rollins makes everything work very well and it's just another very good book in the Sigma series.   Returning Rollins readers: definitely get it.  New Rollins readers: because each book stands well on its own as well as in a series, I'd read Map of Bones or Black Order first, but really, anything by Rollins is great 
 This is a very good road atlas. I gave it to my husband as a birthday gift and since then we are on the raod every weekend. It has very accurate maps and so we don't need to get directions before we leave. Also it has a very good feature of scenic drives so that we can plan our trip to cover the maximum scenery. This is a very good buy. You sure can start with this atlas and then probably move on to higher level. Excellent buy. Thumbs up ! 
 This was the second Michael Connelly book I've read (I also highly recommend "The Lincoln Lawyer")...I loved it and highly recommend it to pretty much anyone interested in a fabulous book that is: (1) fast paced; (2) brilliantly and flawlessly constructed; and (3) keeps you guessing until the very end!   If you enjoy Nelson Demille, James Patterson, Steven King, Dan Brown, and David Baldacci you'll absolutely love "The Poet!"      
 A fun romp full of wonderful characters, plus helpful tidbits to improve children's writing.  A multicultural and intergenerational story in an urban setting, in which the soap opera star Saundra Saunderson and the fish  store owner Mr. Chang come together with many other colorful neighbors to  create a community on 90th Street.  Eva, the child writer, records and  participates in all the action and finally comes up with an extraordinary  topic for her school assignment.  A funny, great and useful tale to teach  and read, whether you live on 90th Street, in the suburbs, or in the  country 
 but that was because I read "The Valentine Legacy" first and the main characters were in that book. So it was like revisiting them, only better because this time I got to know their story, which is one of the reasons I like this author 
 Vanhoozer's Drama of Doctrine, is a sweeping reconceptualization of Christian doctrine using the metaphor of a drama. In an age when many pastors believe doctrine to be irrelevant or even divisive and dangerous; Vanhoozer's project cuts like a laser to reveal the importance, purpose, and practicality of biblical doctrine for the 21st century church. According to Vanhoozer, doctrine expounds to the church the divine drama of the canonical scriptures in a way that allows the church to act in that continuing drama. Doctrine teaches us to improvise fittingly in the continuing divine drama. As Vanhoozer puts it, "Canonical-linguistic theology attends both to the drama in the text--what God is doing in the world through Christ--and to the drama that continues in the church as God uses Scripture to address, edify, and confront its readers" (17). While this book is long, it is a great book worthy of a wide reading by pastors, theologians, and churchmen and women around the world 
 This is a wonderful remote that you can get to function exactly as you want it to.  It learns any key you want and if a device isn't in the codes, the company will search for a code or capture the code from the original remote.  This 6 Device remote I bought as a present.  I use the 8 and 10 device around my home.  I bought a harmony remote and the One for All shortly after.  The harmony had to be tweeked several times and never quite worked all the components right.  Also the company monitors and saves all your information and the software is constantly running on your computer.  The Harmony's buttons at first were hyper sensitive then they wouldn't respond at all.  I had to replace the harmony (under warranty) because the screen went out.  The second, although the screen hasn't gone out, has the same problems, it turns off my TV when I try to switch from DVD to TiVo yet it doesn't the other way (makes no sense).  To be fair, my TV wasn't in the data base so I still had to use the original remote and point it at the harmony to set it up.  It constantly got the inputs wrong, I tried several different methods, all but call the company (I hear they have great customer support), but finally I would change the inputs manually.  It doesn't give you that choice at first.  It was a lot of computer to  TV- computer to TV time.  This remote, the One for All, is so much better.  With the harmony you didn't have the option of picking one of the seldomly used keys and reassigning a function that you use more frequently (zoom of the TV or Live TV for Tivo) they decide for you which functions are the frequent and assigned to main keys and which you will have to scroll for.  I would use the the Live TV and the input for SV frequently so on the ONE 4 ALL I could assign any key I wanted to do those function.  The One 4 All remotes are less expensive and the same quality if not better (no screen to go out, buttons push better) than the Hamony. All for Ones customer support will search for new codes and capture your code if they can't find it to upgrade immediately.  You can program any key you want to do what you want.  You want to control the fan in the room, the space heater or a/c, whatever has a remote as long as it isn't Radio Frequency, most are remotes are IR.  If you want RF also you can get the One for All URC 9910 and then you can send signals through the walls and change the channels from other rooms in the house.  Want your Tivo to control two different TV in different rooms of your house, its RF to IR converter would do that.  Personally I only need the IR remote part so this remote, here at amazon under $20 today, is the best.  The One for All Learning Upgradeble Remotes 6 Device, 8 Device and 10 has literally taken the place of all of my old remotes.  I use ONE remote for all the devices in my house with remotes.  I have bought extra remotes of this brand to have at my couch, my bedroom, my computer.  I have bought these remotes as presents for family at this point.    They are great remotes and I'm glad I found them 
 This book was very helpful in our first home purchase.  We had a lot of questions like most first time home buyer.  This book helped us to understand the process and what questions to ask.  Even though you might have already purchased your first home this book will still be a very useful reference 
 As an absolute beginner in Linux, this book has answered most of my questions and took me out of my closed 'windows' based mentality. I warmly recommend it 
 Ms. Gray is a fabulous editor-selecting the most incredible queer youth to represent the community today.  As a queer youth, I too would have loved to read something as powerful as this.  As a queer teacher, it is a resource  for all students to understand the diversity in our state and country. If  introduced into the schools, perhaps our schools will become just a little  bit safer for ALL students 
 Concise small paperback detailing the relatively easy way to achieve impressive results with collage projects using items available at most craft stores. The information and tips are all there without miscellany added to fatten the book 
 I took a long shot at buying this thing because of little or no online information about it.  Hopefully this gives you a good idea of what the bag is like so you don't have to aimlessly search the internet for its product features - like I did.  I wanted a bag that was genuine (Canon) and that held all of my stuff so I wouldn't have separate bags for each individual item.  The CPB-100 case had plenty of room for all my digital camera accessories: camera (Powershot s70), printer (CP-220), cards (3 compact flash cards), battery charger (CB-2LT), all 6 of my manuals, printer cleaner, and printer charge chords.   And all of the items fit into a slot of some sort - they aren't randomly tossed into the bag.  There are 4 compartments:  a very large, extra padded, zip compartment (with large, padded 2 slots) for your printer and some other large accessory (I put my printer chords here); a large, zip compartment with 3 sleeves (I put the battery charger and printer cleaner in the first, camera in the second, and 3 memory cards in the third); and a medium, front, zip compartment for books or flat accessories (I put my 4x6 printer card holder and 4 product manuals in).   There's also a small, velcro compartment on the back which I put 2 more small 3x5 manuals into.  I still have extra room (though not much) to place more accessories.  The quality is very durable water-repellent canvas and the front straps appear to be faux leather - the front straps clip shut with magnet clips.   The shoulder strap has a padded shoulder rest and can extend plenty for your height.   The bottom has 4 plastic plates that keep it upright, and keep it from getting dirty, when placed on the ground.  I fit the bag perfectly with my accessories.  I'd recommend the bag if you have close to or equal the amount of items I did - unless, of course, you want to haul around extra bags for some reason : ).  Good luck shopping! 
 A masterpiece of Teenage Angst.  If you are young, read this to educate yourself at how complicated your emotions really are.  Much in the way Russian novelists create their characters, Goethe does the same, but with German flair 
 This is my favorite show of all time, and I was extremely happy with my purchase!  No one who buys this could be disappointed!!! It's an amazing show for ANYONE!  Thank you 
 This is probably the most realistic book I've read so far. Hemingway's style is very simplistic and here he digs into the trenches of war, the people who figght it, and the reality of life.  The dialogue between the American soldier who is fighting in the Italian army and the British nurse on the Italian front is borderline silly but I guess this is Hemingway's best portrayel of life and love.  A great book and I highly recommend it 
 If you are a fan of New Orleans Music then buy thi 
 One of the best books in the sreies of "Rogues". Francis is rather quiet. Is courting a lovely lady when he sees Serena walking in the road. She is running away from her 2 brothers who want to sell her again in marriage to a man just like her 1st. husband. If she didn't marry they would sell her to a brothel. Mathew Riverton was notorious. He used Serena who he married when she was 15 as a sex-slave. When Francis rescued her she gave him the only thing she could, her body. Well she had been trained to by her husband. Serena soon discovered she was pregnant after being told before she was barren.  A fantastic book.      
 Eric Raymond is widely regarded as the anthropologist of the hacker community. This is Eric Raymond's revised classic with some new material. It is the first comprehensive commentary on the sociology of the Open Source community, and recommended reading for anyone doing business in software development, or running a business that depends on software and the Internet.    Like many of Eric Raymond's colleagues and fellow Geeks, he is clearly a brilliant individual, carried forward by focused effort and imagination. And like many talented people, he is an autodidact; self taught bar some courses in philosophy and mathematics. This is not a criticism. Raymond's career, publications and contribution show amply the intellectual qualities he possesses. However, his lack of training in social, economic and cultural science shows. And, as an insider (he is one of the original tribe of hackers) he is not the best person to make a disinterested commentary on the hacker community.   Great hackers, he tells us, are humble people. A more critical observer would have analyzed the comparative payoffs of styles showing why a loud mouth style - while it might work for some performers or show oriented careers - doesn't pay in this community. This is generally true of communities in which peers are well able to judge the quality of each other's contributions. Faking it doesn't payoff, and looking like you might need to fake it is counter productive. Insofar as the behaviour of chief hackers is humble, we learn more about the social economy of hackerdom than about distinctive individual personalities.  Despite many insights, Eric Raymond is wrong in his principal analysis. Why, he asks, do talented people spend years of unpaid work on projects that benefit others for no pecuniary reward? He characterizes hackers as members of a gift giving community, and attributes too much of the hacker motivation to altruism and idealism.   The central problem is not "why do hackers work for no pay?" Rather, why do people work for money? Or, more fundamentally, why do people work? I take it that readers will agree that we can roughly divide our motives into physiological drives (hunger, thirst, need for shelter, sex) and the "higher" needs (self fulfilment and meaning). After satisfying the needs for food, shelter and companionship why do we continue to work at all? If it is to get status, to get power, to feel good about ourselves and similar, then money beyond basic needs is unnecessary. Onassis once remarked "Without women, all the money in the world is worthless." Some of us work to become wealthy, and we trade that wealth for status, power, respect and admiration, and perhaps we use our wealth to get women, sex and occasionally love. If this is what these motives are for, then even the higher needs are secondary to sex; or, as evolutionary psychologists tell us, are all about reproduction.   Money is a means. If I can earn status, power and respect directly, why waste time with money? Of course, money is fungible. That means it can be traded easily for a great many things; a big house and a luxury car, perhaps. But possessing these is merely another way of obtaining status, power, respect, admiration and sex, if not love.   Why am I writing this review? By my own dispassionate analysis, I am advertising my capacity to say sensible things and I am making a reputation; this is an asset in the social and commercial market place. Amazon might like me for doing this, but they would be mistaken to think that I write reviews out of altruism directed at Amazon; at least not defined in any metaphysical or moral sense. Sociobiologists denote some social instincts "altruism" but these are operational definitions of instincts as Machiavellian as any scheming tactician can be said to possess; in that sense I may be an altruist. Hackers too, for their work is not unlike my book reviews. Hackers trade in an economy that differs not one jot from the money economy, and Eric Raymond, in so far as he supposes it to be a fundamentally different kind of economy, is mistaken.   Likewise the account of hacker commitment to lofty ideals are not any more credible - but also not any less credible - than the mission statements and codes of ethics written by CEOs of major corporations. Among hackers are people as likely to steal code as are others to donate code; to write viruses as to write Fetch Mail. An anarchic disrespect for some of our more widely accepted conventions for protecting property rights is a characteristic of hacker mentality; not one that we should admire. Of course, honourable idealists are found among hackers; Eric Raymond is clearly one of them. Take, for example, the Open Source Initiative that is largely his work. What an outstanding contribution that is! Clearly he is passionate about his beliefs and ideals. But honourable idealists are found among entrepreneurs too, also successful ones, and even among politicians. Let us not delude ourselves about what it is the really motivates us and our fellow travellers. 
 I am a fan of this sort of story, and was pleased to see a whole collection. Usually, you have to go through a book trying to find the ones that deal with back door sex. But every story in this antho featured arousing anal stories. Even cooler, my girlfriend wasn't horrified by the book when she saw it at my house. I think the cover -- which is pretty rather than threatening -- helped. As well as the fact that it was edited by a woman. The stories cover a whole lot of different genres, but the commonality was that they were all very sexy. I think it would be a great introduction to a partner if you're looking to play this way. And if you already do, then it's just a total turn on. 
 First of all I want to confess that I am John Maxwell junkie. I not only thoroughly enjoy his books but they help me in becoming a better person.  This book is written where every chapter is golden and yet able to stand alone. You can simply open the book to any chapter and it will enrich you. Even though the chapters are segmented into 5 logical sections.  I especially liked the chapter entitled, "The Pain Principle: Hurting people hurt people and are easily hurt by them". This chapter increased my empathy and sensitivity for hurting people. It just makes sense that those that lash out are really hurting people.  I gave this book 4 stars simply because his best work by far was, "21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership".  As helpful as this book was I simply tried to read a chapter each evening before going to sleep. Like a nutritious light snack that won't keep you up all night 
 The novel begins a short time prior to September 11, 2001 in the northeast corner of Afghanistan where the Northern Alliance remains precariously in control of territory that includes the Panjshir Valley where the Alliance Mujaheddin are making what appears to be their last stand against the combined forces of the Taliban and al-Qaeda. The main character of the novel, young ill-fated fighter Ahmed Jan, is on the front lines of the see-saw battles that have seen his entire family wiped out. As shaky as the Northern Alliance situation is, it's made all the worse by the assassination of revered Northern Alliance leader Commander Ahmed Massoud at the hands of al- Qaeda in chapter 2. Ironically, in this their darkest hour, the Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington D.C. turn out to be salvation for the Tajik, Uzbek and other groups of the Northern Alliance who are resisting the cruel Taliban domination. Within weeks, U.S. Special Forces, Air Force, Navy, and other military units sweep the Taliban out of Kabul, Taloqan, Kandahar, and other major cities of Afghanistan and put them on the run, along with their al-Qaeda guests, into the Pakistani tribal territories along the Afghan border. Ahmed Jan finds a mysterious communiqu in the coat of an al-Qaeda messenger and, along with ruthless Mujaheddin fighter Mustafa and old, rigid holy man Mohammajon, gets swept into an adventure that spans the globe from Islamabad to Amsterdam to Venice to Seattle to Vancouver to Karachi and back to Kandahar. This engrossing epic story includes CIA operatives and Special Forces soldiers interwoven with three love stories with very different endings. The adventure concludes with a movingly heartrending, surprise finale. I highly recommend this book for both women and men who are fans of international thrillers novels 
 Most everyone knows FitzGerald's translation of Khayyam, but it's good to read other versions as well.  For example, Pedro Ramirez Cueto has published a Spanish translation, and a "FitzHound" has even put out a "doggerel" verision, the Rubaiyat of Rover Khayyam., which is hilarious. What's remarkable here is that the element of continuity is the illustrations by Sullivan.  I think this is a valuable contribution to the Rubaiyat literature. 
 This book is brilliant! For teaching about very large numbers (billions and trillions as well as millions) it is fantastic. Children (and adults) have difficulty imagining just how big these huge numbers are; this book  will help thinkers of all ages. I highly recommend it for teachers of  children or adults of all ages - I plan to use it with my trainee teachers 
 Feynman has given us a fine mess to deal with here. Reading the book requires ones whole being in order to be able to concentrate on and actually understand what he is trying to convey to us in these three lectures. On one side, the things he talks about in, I guess, his own particular way are down right raw in their articulation. On the other side, some things he talks about are, to me at least, brilliant deductions deriving from his observations of the world we're living in. Not all of which I can fully agree with though. I only wish I had paid more attention in my physics classes and read more on the parts of physics Feynman played a major role in during his life, because then I feel I would have been able to deduct for myself where some of his ideas in the present book are coming from. The editors of the book have obviously left Feynman's use of language in tact, which might well be a pro, but I also think one should have been there inside the lecture room with Feynman doing his thing in order to appreciate his genius fully. The present book's three lectures give a glimps, and nothing more, of what the author was all about when venturing outside his beloved field of physics. A tough nut to crack when starting to read, but a delight once one gets the hang of his down-to-earth use of language. Reading some of his other books, as well as some of the books written about him, might be of help in figuring out what he must have been like in person and what his vision on life was. This book by itself cannot do the trick and might even dissuade some generally interested people to read more on Feynman, which would be a true shame 
 I have read almost all of the books by this author and found them to be entertaining as well as instructive.  The plots have a different twist and keep one guessing.  I highly recommend all of Mr. Elkins' books as well worth the money and the effort.  He is a highly readable author.  
 so I decided to pick up this DVD for a little comedy. Although I am not a fan of the spoiled rich girl type, I found it extremely funny and let myself laugh at someone whose problems are so inane.  No worries and not a care other than a broken nail; the world now seems a lighter place. 
 My 5 year old received this game for Christmas.  Although we found the directions to be a little vauge, we have enjoyed playing it our own way.  You definitely challenge your sense of touch, which is so often overlooked. And you can set the rules to make the game harder or easier depending on who is playing.  The game is durable but it would be very easy to lose the little pieces which would ruin the game as the pieces are so unique.  The directions make no mention of ordering individual pieces that may get lost.  I would recommend this game to families who enjoy playing lots of different games together 
 The author tackles a worthy subject and does it very well. The tragic fact that comes across is that the world does not always conform itself to our contingent strenghs & weaknesses.  Shakespeare does indeed tell us how the world works.  And having read him, the world then, is not as before.   Desire for certain knowlege drives us and ignorance is a lot more prevalent than we know.   The mind's concealment is essential to its nature. Shakespear's tragic characters are always coping with their ignorance- the inability to know what they need to know.  These are some of the philsophies simply put that are arrived at through examintion of characters, plots, action, and Shakespeare's  writing itself. And speaking of SELF- that is a crutial element of understanding Shakespeare's philosophy.  He regards the self as interactive and theatrical- the mind subject to hidden & mysterious forces. The self can become divided and fragmented, losing its usual- but superficial- unity.  The self is not always a harmonious whole, running on rational principles, but often a melange of conflicting forces, the source of which is unclear.  We are as much victims of ourselves as we are of the world around us, with part of the psyche in rebellion against the rest.   Also Shakespeare's plays involve themselves with CAUSATION- unruly, unpredictable, unintelliigible, blind, weird and even paradoxical.   Sex also transforms.   Social life is the acting of parts.   Shakespeare's characters inhabit a harsh world, and tenderheartedness is unlikely to survive.     In the end Shakespeare can be compared in his philosophy like a dissappointed lover- one who had great hopes for humanity, but found his hopes crushed.   This is just a small taste of the author's very well done analysis: Shakespeare's Philosophy.    In the end, the world does not behave as one would wish.  Still the desire never dies.  And ignorance remains too well fed.  
 There went another all-nighter spent tearing thru F. Paul Wilson's new book HARBINGERS. This author is so good at laying that trap for his readers. You know, the one that makes you go, "Okay, just one more chapter, really - and then, I'll go to sleep." Well, after the not-as-good INFERNAL, Repairman Jack is back and never better than in this new installment. And, this time out, Jack is run thru the wringer like he's never been before. But, as usual, Jack finds a way to "fix" things. Well, kind of.     About a month has elapsed since the events of INFERNAL. Jack hasn't been himself for the past weeks, feeling lethargic, indifferent, and, well, depressed. He hasn't taken a "fix-it" job in a while, and he still doesn't feel like taking one. But he just can't say no to Timmy O'Brien, one of the regulars at Julio's bar. Timmy asks Jack to look into the disappearance of his teenage niece, Cailin. Jack's efforts lead him to a vigilante-minded trio dressed in black and sunglasses. A game of cat-and-mouse with the trio directs Jack to a warehouse in the Bronx, where he learns of the Yeniceri (Jannisaries), an elite task force thousands of years old. There, he encounters one of the Oculi, which is a group of men and women who act as conduits for the Ally (if you don't know about the Ally, the Adversary, the Otherness, the Sentinel, and the Heir, don't worry; the book lucidly explains all). Jack is asked to join the ranks of the Yeniceri to help combat the Otherness, a malignant, all-powerful presence intent on possessing and remaking our world, and not for the better. Jack is torn between his loner mindset and the lure of being involved in something that could actually prove to be effective against that old evil. But, whichever choice he makes, there are no more coincidences in his life.   Believe me, so much more stuff goes on than what's mentioned above. There's an update on Jack's attempt to legalize his identity (he's gonna be a dad, after all). Our favorite F. Paul Wilson boogeyman makes an appearance and once again wields his seemingly limitless powers and continues to taunt Jack. Another enigmatic woman with a dog shows up. The three people Jack loves most are again imperiled, this time by an unlikely source. Cat and mouse games abound, both on a personal and a cosmic level. And, as usual, Jack gets a chance to get his "fix" on, most especially, late in the book, in the warehouse sequence where he pretty much toys and then disposes of four, highly skilled bad dudes.       Fair warning. Although, in past books, Jack's circle of family and friends have been steadily decimated, HARBINGERS  really raises the stakes in terms of his loved ones being placed in jeopardy. This, probably, is as close to the breaking point that Jack has ever gotten. And the fact that he resolutely refuses to give up hope and keeps on chugging, doing his best to fix things, is one of the many reasons Repairman Jack is one of my all-time favorite literary characters. Not in his normal "fix-it" gigs, but, rather, in the grand scheme of things, Repairman Jack is so much an underdog. He's trapped in a situation he desperately doesn't want to be in and placed in an unenviable position where he's slated to be the champion designated to face off against an all-powerful, malevolent, cosmic awareness. Yet, he remains...plucky and defiant and very human. Man, I love this dude. Like the book blurb said - when the fit hits the shan, you call Repairman Jack. 
 I just finished Rosie's Girl Singer, an autobiography, and found it probably one of the best I have read. I have always been a fan of hers, but didn't realize what a super entertainer she was, given the load she was given to carry. If you haven't read it yet, don't miss it 
 This book is based on the author's acclaimed Personal Creativity in Business class, which he taught at Stanford University for 25 years to the likes eBay entrepreneur Jeff Skoll and Good to Great bestselling author Jim Collins.  But it's not another business management book, or even a book on how to tap your creativity.    Instead, Ray reveals the secret that all the successful people he taught ultimately attributed their success to - living their life connected and committed to their "highest goal."  Essentially, your highest goal is the aspiration that gives meaning to your life, motivates and sustains you.  Aligning your efforts with it will help you accomplish your dreams and find fulfillment. Ray suggests exercises to to identify it, then helps you better integrate it into your life based on your key challenges.  His "live-withs" are simple but powerful tools for shifting your thinking and actions so you can benefit from living with your highest goal every day.   What you should know....to some, the title and cover photo may imply a very "new age-y" type book. While there is a little of that, the book overall takes a very practical approach to the subject.  
 Lee Strobel's meticulously compiled "The Case for Christ," attempts with reason and educated pedigree what the earliest Christians accepted on faith and experience: Jesus' life, death,Resurrection and divinity and, with them, human history's defining moment.  Strobel's writes in an investigative reporter's vice-tight format, pulling grisly examples from years in crime reporting to reveal evidence styles proving his case (circumstantial, historical, psychological, medical). He introduces his forensic, scholastic, and theological experts by listing their degrees, teaching posts, and authored books. He fires challenging questions raised by everyone from avowed atheists like Antony Flew to liberal movements like the Jesus Seminar which consider Jesus' resurrection, death, and much of his life allegorical.  At each chapter's ends, the respective expert testifies to his Easter experience. Craig Blomberg, whose insights grace the book's first chapters on eyewitness evidence, mentions scholars have been converted based on Scripture's physical, historical truth. Philosopher/theologian Gary Habermas finds his students comforting him with Resurrection's promise even as his wife lay dying of stomach cancer. Theologian Louis Lapides is interviewed in Strobel's powerful chapter on Jesus filling the Messiah's "fingerprint" promised throughout the Old Testament He tells how that decision saved him from addiction yet alienated him from his traditional Jewish family roots.  Some evidence will easily convince, from Jesus' documented appearances after rising to Matthew's record of women (whom ancient Jewish custom found unreliable as witnesses) being first to see Him alive. Other, more linguistic attempts (such as the order of blood and water flowing at Christ's side) may confuse, although Dr. Alexander Metherell explains episodes of Jesus' bleeding throughout His passion.   But Strobel and the experts' most powerful testimony comes from lives of the Apostles and early Christians during their early Roman persecution, and how they chose deaths over denial of the One Who they'd seen alive and whole after His grisly, humiliating crucifixion. How many people would change their way of life, let alone die, for One so disgraced and something they believed a lie?  GK Chesterton once wrote, "Theology is only thought applied to religion." So how many could a factual "Case for Christ" convince, let alone convert? Luke, a companion of St. Paul whose terse, detailed Gospel is cited for proofs throughout this book, quotes Jesus' chilling last words of a parable, "And (Abraham) said unto (the rich man), If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead." (Luke 16:31)   But Strobel took his reporter's gift for chasing truth, and the new Christian life he gave his family after his wife's and his own conversion, and used those tools to dispassionately prove his life's passion. This book looks to convert skeptics and cynics not with fervor or flowery language, but with natural logic proving the supernatural. Be the jury having read it, but Strobel's is the most powerful, popular argument yet for Scripture as accurate, historical, definable truth.

 I kept passing by this one in the video store. I figured that I would have heard of it if it was any good, right?  Wrong. It's almost ten years old as of this writing, and I never heard of it, and it's really good. I mean, Really Good, in lots of ways. It's got characters I can really care about. There's Leaven, for one (Nicole de Boer, aka Dax of DS9). She starts out as the stereotypical wimpy, screamy girl. Then there's Quentin, who starts out the take-charge cop, the one you're sure will get our little band out of this lethal labyrinth. Just keep two things in mind. First, everyone changes over the course of the movie. Second, wanting to see some jerk get it is also a kind of caring, just not a nice one.  The way the characters change is another thing to like. This movie borders on the minimalist, and its fair to say they didn't spend a terrible lot on sets and props. The characters carry everything, and do it surprisingly well. This isn't a Great Movie in the sense of literary snobishness, but still a heck of a flick. The actors, plus the script they're given to work with, really make the movie. Another bit to like is that spending thing - they didn't do much. The actors are all good, but not in the gazillion-dollar class. Sets and props are well done, but there's not much to them. Costuming couldn't have cost more than $20 for each of seven actors. All this proves that money doesn't make a movie: artists and artistic vision do. Maybe money helps, but Cube shows that you can still get a big-budget feel on a very modest budget.  What's not to like? The ending. I'll let you get there on your own. Maybe that's why this movie didn't take off and make a boatload of money for everyone involved. But, they didn't spend a lot, so I hope they all went happily to the bank anyway. They deserve every nickel they made from it.  //wiredweir 
 This is a lovely book that definitely contains the 'aah' factor.  The simple words that children say when thinking about God, accompanied by some great illustrations.  I bought this as a leaving present for the school that I teach in - it was well received!  It would also be good to share with a child over the age of 8.  Should have a place on any child's bookcase.  : 
 Since I did not read Three Junes previously, I had no sense of let down that other readers seemed to have. I feel privileged to realize that when I pick up Three Junes I will probably think it is even better if half the criticism here is true. But as a first time Glass reader, I was really impressed. I love her writing style and I did not have a problem with storyline breaks and sections that went back and forth from past to present. If anything it made it more interesting. I do agree that I was actually not sympathetic to the two main characters, Greenie and Alan. I found the secondary characters much more appealing and enjoyable.   When I picked up the book, I did not realize that it dealt with 9/11, which I scrupulously avoid as a general rule. I was shocked to find myself reading about it, however, I do think she did a fantastic job portraying the event and the aftermath of New Yorkers as well as the rest of the country. Of the three storylines in the book, I was disappointed in the way Saga's storyline was wrapped up. It felt like the conclusion was an afterthought and I was dissatisfied by how she ended it. For that reason alone, I couldn't give it 5 stars. However, I am glad to have found a new author to add to my list of must reads. This was a very good book 
 I really hate to give any "Chicken Soup" book less than a 5 star because I am a huge fan.   I was slightly disappointed in the content of this book. I really was hoping and expecting that it would have more stories about giving birth. It says on the cover that the 101 stories inspire and warm the hearts of soon-to-be-mothers but I felt like the subjects were too general.   For example, the contents are 1. We're Pregnant, 2. Nine Months and Counting, 3 Expectant Fathers, 4. Challenges along the Way, 5. Special Delivery 6. Small Miracle 7. Memorable moments, 8. On Motherhood, 9. Expectant Wisdom.   I didn't find many birth stories - in fact, I don't think there was even one.   However, in spite of my need for positive birth stories, I still love the stories that they put in the book.

 I came across the Immortal Yi Soon Shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels. Up to this time I had never heard of it, but immediately I was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing. As I continued to watch (it had English subtitles fortunately) I became enthralled by the acting, plot and historical theme. With a little detective work, I learned that I had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over 100 episodes. I told my wife how good it was, and after we watched an episode together, she and I both became die-hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it. We managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television. Nearly every episode was better than 90% of the Hollywood movies out there. If you like, action, drama, amazing three-dimensional characters with incredible actors, intersting history, and some of the best writing I have seen on television, or anywhere for that matter, check this out 
 I picked up So Others May Live while browsing for an interesting summer read, and found it to be that and much more.  Reading it, you'd think the stories told inside were fiction, but they're not; every tale is true.  Before I read this book, I didn't know much about the Coast Guard and next to nothing about their rescue swimmers, but LaGuardia-Kotite skillfully weaves together the true tale of how and why the rescue program came into existence and how it has come to be the ultra-challenging training program that qualifies only the cream of the crop.  The rescue stories inside So Others May Live is told from perspectives of both the rescuers and the rescued, and they cover events from the aftermath of Katrina to a perilous rescue at Niagra Falls.  LaGuardian-Kotite does a wonderful job of illuminating the wonderful deeds of these heroes, who, without a second thought, would dive into dangerous waters and risk their own lives so that others may keep theirs 
 After being out of school for quite some time, I needed a book to get me back up to speed on trig. This book is great. Highly recommended 
 A memorable book offering concepts that inspire and empower. I love the notion of a daimon that we carry within each of us. It brings awareness on nurturing our own greatest potential as well as those in the youth around us. 
 I am a huge fan of stop motion effects and what better example than King Kong! This is one of my favorite movies of all time and the DVD is nothing short of spectacular! Not being old enough to have seen this at the movies I watched this on my 10 foot home theater screen and was amazed how clear this print is! They went the extra mile on the bonus features too! I bought the box set which includes the original Mighty Joe Young and Son of Kong. You get the same 2 disc special edition of King Kong and two other classic stop motion films 
 This camera is awesome! easy to use, easy to setup, and the program to manage your photo's is simple with a very intuitive interface. Thanks H 
 I bought this product for my 2 year old daughter who is already a Disney Princess junkie and she loves it.  The DVD contains a solid lineup of songs and is a lot of fun for any little girl who loves to sing and dance.  All of the 'princesses' are represented Cinderella, Snow Whtie, Jasmine, Mulan etc.  The best aspect of the DVD is that it does hold the little people's attention for a good 30-40 minutes 
 This book offered a lot of helpful information about detoxification through fasting.  It gave me step by step, what to do to cleanse my body through fasting.  However, I had read more than half of the book before I actually got any usable information.  For such a small book, I thought it would be packed with info and how-to's on detoxification, but it constantly tells you to buy her other book "How to Feel Great All The Time".  If you do lots of research on holistic health as I do,  there is a lot of general information about eating healthy and such in this book, which I already know a lot about.  If you know nothing about holistic health, this book will be an eye-opener 
 According to the authors and contributors, the example of Jesus Christ contains indispensable lessons for leadership. However, in the Gospel, Jesus seems to have commanded disciples primarily to love God and one another. He never seems to have promised success in worldly business affairs or to have offered managerial precepts. On the other hand, in the parable of talents he taught his followers to be fiscally conservative and to invest wisely. To their credit, the authors and editors who compiled this book acknowledge that Christianity never set itself up specifically as a recipe for business success. Regardless, they conclude, that applying precepts they identify will lead to success. The leadership guidelines they quote make sense and do not exclude thoughtful businesspeople of any theological background. The authors illustrate their advice with amusing, instructive anecdotes. The counsel is accessible, ethically illuminating and personally inspiring, although if you usually skip the sermon, it may not be for you. We believe that its primary appeal will be to Christians who seek to serve as servant leaders in their communities and workplaces. 
 This was really my 'practical compilerbook' winner (bought in 1999), until I discovered in 2004 "Programming Language Processors in Java: Compilers and Interpreters" by David Watt, which I like more.  If you're looking for a theory book about compiler design I would recommend 'Engineering a compiler' by Cooper et al.  This book offers a nice compiler (including x86 code generator and debugger!!), for a simple language.   The problem is that the compiler is written in C++, and if you are more familiar with Java you could better buy the book I recommened above.  An advantage of this book is that it also covers rare topics, such as debugger implementation.  A disadvantage is that this book show a lot of code. Actually, all code is printed in the book (as far as I know). That's why it's a big bibble.   The greatest disadvantage of this book is that it doesn't introduce new concepts. It offers a recursive descent parser (difficult to maintain), instead of much faster table driven parsers, or recursive descent parsers made by a generator (ANTLR).  However, this is a great starter for C++ people new to compiler design. Java people would I recommend to buy the book of Watt as recommended above. 
 ...between chemical depression and, um, "perpetual unhappiness".  After reading this book, I feel like word "depression" doesn't even seem to cover the condition.  Read this book if you know anyone who suffers from the condition (or who claims to--they may not) and want to understand it; read it if you believe you might suffer from chemical depression 
 80's romp about a female mechanic Tommy (the tomboy) and her love of cars and racing 
 There is no such thing as the Kennedy Curse, just a family who loves risky acts.  John John - He was died due to the fact that he was an inexperienced pilot.  The list goes on and one...   main point : THERE IS NO CURSE! 
 Joe's approach to networking is so basic and simple anyone can do it.  He articulates it in a way that will inspire anyone to overcome their obstacles and take advantage of their opportunities so they can make the most of what life has to offer 
 i absolutely adore this book! it has amazing quotes that just struck me. it's not so much about the artists that died-that was for the magazine he was writing for, this was about his journey, thoughts, and happenings on the way. it's an awesome book, and it actually makes you think, which is a beautiful thing today 
      Do you absolutely hate it when people trick you?  Then this book is for you!  Princess Elizabeth has finally found her true love. Oh! No! An unexpected, ferocious intruder kidnaps Elizabeth's handsome prince, Ronald and destroys her castle.  Will she ever see Ronald again?  You will be surprised how this book ends.         We liked this book because it was hilarious and it teaches a lesson.  We think this is a knock your socks off story! The author is extremely clever.         We recommend this book for kids who love fairy tales and like to see someone getting tricked in a funny way.  But be careful with young children who might be afraid of dragons.  
 Depending on your entertaining scenario, this book is convenient for a dinner party for two or eight. What I like about it is that there are actual menus planned for the type of meal you're preparing.  I made my New Year's Eve dinner (for two) from this book and I was impressed - as well as my other half. All of the recipes call for fresh and wholesome ingredients. I definitely recommend this for experienced chefs who are passionate about gourmet cuisine 
 I have read this book maybe twenty-five times now and I keep returning to it because what is contained is about as bare bones a relation of perspective as can be given. I admire directness and a concise approach as much as I admire Zen itself. Bodhidharma "tells it like it is" and then closes his mouth. Red Pine is a treasure to the English speaking world 
 A recent work by MacPherson on the battle of Antietam attempts to locate the turning point in the Civil War. Reading this work one wonders if the whole history of abolition is not a series of endless turning points against eternal delays. This very cogent work by someone acquainted with the facts is an invaluable expose of how politics actually works in that scarface Uncle Sam's 'democracy' of equals. Giving the history and gritty details of post-Reconstruction politics dominated by the Bourbon elites, it is essential reading for anyone attempting to decipher the legacy of the Civil Rights movement this period prefigures, and starts to anticipate. Histories of Roosevelt's presidency don't always make clear what was going on, and the obstacles he faced. Nor do we quite assess the effect of the Second World War on the economic context behind Jim Crow in its ad infinitum history of domination, political manipulation, and class and racial struggle. We can see the great tide turning in the thirties and forties, as the struggle begins just to recoup the ground lost in the 1870's and after, Lyndon Johnson's voting rights bill a resurrection of the same failed bill of the Redemption era. Out of many issues in this very useful book is a reminder of how Lyndon Johnson, extremely adept in this Lost Cause dominion, was deftly able at the right moment to get the job done, if it has been done. With this history, keep your eyes peeled. We could be far short of 'done' 
 Being the first novel by Nadine Gordimer I have read, I was immensely impressed with her writing style, her characterization and the number of ideas she can bring to one subject. I was a little disapointed that the  book didn't deal with more of the day-to-day life of the city where the  main characters lived, and I felt that the focus on the inner lives on the  parents and their pain, became redundant after a while. The  characterization of the former exiled black lawyer was brilliant. This  would be a stellar performance for a film. He's a complicated, changing  character and even at the end of the novel it is difficult to be certain  what to exactly make of him. All in all I found the ending kind of bland.  The utopian promise was wishful thinking and the inclusion of the son (the  agressor) thoughts seemed out of place when we know so little of through  most of the novel. It's a great introduction to Gordimer's work, but I'm  going to investigate her earlier, aparthaid period novels to get a better  sense of what she actually writes 
 This book totally captured my interest and held me spellbound.  It is well written, easy to follow, and provides the background of the events surrounding the decision to build, the naming, and the construction of the Taj Mahal.  The author has judiciously balanced the description of the characters and their relationships with the actual historical facts, providing the reader with both a rich literary experience, and a history lesson.  It is a timeless story of love....... deep abiding love of a husband and wife, and a father and daughter.  
 My biggest problem with this book is the title, it does focus on Democracy early on, but by the end it is all about the role of slavery in anti-bellum American politics.  It is a great read; the title just isn't entirely fitting.  Also, so many of the events in the book have their roots in the three-fifths compromise I wish he could have started there.  The first half of the book is a little slow, and the author spends a lot of time on various labor movements without effectively tying them into the greater narrative and providing a payoff.  That and I think he just loves to say Loco Foco.  But there comes a point in the book, around the compromise of 1850, where Wilentz gets into a groove, the narrative gets tighter, and the pages start to fly by.  Overall this is an excellent overview of early American history, especially from a domestic political perspective.   
 A Room With A View is a novel not only about the journey to find true love, but also about the difficult decisions one is faced with when one must decide to either listen to the expectations of others, or their own heart.  In this novel the main character, Lucy takes a trip to Italy with her cousin, and upon her arrival meets the Emerson's.  Lucy belonging to the upper class of society thinks she could never have an attraction to someone of the lower class, like the Emerson's. Love was something Lucy was hoping to find in Italy, but as soon as she arrived back to her home in England she promptly became engaged to Cecil, a man of the same social class as her. Lucy soon realizes that she is not truly in love with Cecil, and discovers that she is in love with George Emerson. Everyone Lucy knows expects her to marry someone wealthy and proper, like Cecil, but instead of listening to what others expect of her, Lucy listens to her heart, and allows herself to be in love with George.  Throughout Lucy's journey to find true love Forster conveys the message that others expectations cannot guide one to the path of love, only one's heart can. I recommend this book to anyone who struggles when faced with making the decision of following others expectations, or following their heart. This novel will teach its readers that what one truly desires is the only escape to genuine happiness.  
 Just a great album! Every cut is outstanding, but  "Black And Blue" is worth the price alone! You will not be disappointed purchasing this gem 
 Great stuff from Shaara.  "Rise" has a different feel than the Civil War trilogy but also is somehow a little less compelling, though hard to figure exactly why.  Perhaps it relates to Michael Shaara's fascinating depiction of Lee in Killer Angels; Jeff is good, but he has not yet topped his dad's work 
 good menu planner, good recipies, good "pink section".  will recommend it to friends & family 
 When Special Effects pioneer Ray Harryhausen received his lifetime acheivement Oscar, Tom Hanks said that anyone who was a boy of 10 in the 1960's will tell you that "Jason and The Argonauts" is one of the greatest movies ever made.  Jason is here, with the living giant bronze statue, the vicious harpies, and of course the many-headed Hydra and its "children." Terrific stop-motion fun for all ages. And without the aid of (yawn) computers, you just have to wonder, "How did he do that?"  Also in this bundle is Gulliver (see if you can spot June Thorburn, the grandmother from Absolutely Fabulous, in an early role), 7th Voyage of Sinbad ('50's-era innocence with the first dueling skeleton on film, not to mention the future Mrs. Bing Crosby), and Golden Voyage of Sinbad (Dance of death with six-armed goddess Kali and Tom Baker of Dr. Who fame).    Eye of the Tiger, on the other hand, is of "so bad its good"/MST3000 caliber--with the Duke's son, Patrick Wayne as So-bad--I mean, Sinbad--and chanteuse Margaret Whiting in her first (and last) dramatic role as the evil sorceress.  And yes, that's Dr. Quinn/Jane Seymour wondering how she'll ever live this one down as a buxom princess with a baboon for a brother.  I'm not kidding.  An extra treat with this set are the scores for Jason, 7th Voyage, and Gulliver by legendary screen composer Bernard Herrmann (Citizen Kane, Psycho). Juicy stuff.  Anybody who likes good old-fashioned matinee fantasy will want to own these treats 
 "Gift of the Magi" is a wonderful story (my favorite by O. Henry), and this little book makes a great stocking stuffer for the little ones.  I recommend 
 After reading this book and experiencing the incredibly well produced and expertly printed visual images it is clear that this book is one for the times.  It is one that can be opened and opened again and again never losing its constant appeal.  Very well worth the price and I highly recommend it to everyone 
 "The Mouse That Roared," directed by Jack Arnold, is an entertaining satire about the fictional Duchy of Grand Fenwick, a tiny European monarchy which may remind viewers of such real countries as Liechtenstein or Monaco.  With his country facing bankruptcy, the prime minister of Grand Fenwick announces his clever plan to declare war on the United States of America; his intent is to lose the absurdly uneven contest and reap the benefits of post-war American aid.  But things don't go quite as expected.  "Mouse" opens with a whimsical animated title sequence that effectively sets the tone for the rest of the picture.  This is followed by a funny faux-documentary sequence about the fictional duchy, and then by the actual story.  The film is a splendid showcase for the great Peter Sellers, who plays three characters, all citizens of Grand Fenwick: the scheming prime minister, the venerable duchess, and the mild-mannered commander of the duchy's pitiable army.  Sellers is absolutely brilliant; he creates three wonderfully distinct characters, and it's especially fun to see the scenes where these characters interact with each other.  His performance(s) alone make the film a classic in my reckoning.  I found "Mouse" to be an enchanting and enjoyable film, full of absurd images and amusing lines.  The marvelous sets, costumes, and props are full of wonderful details that make the film a delight for the eye from start to finish.  And despite its comic tone, the film touches on some very serious issues that remain timely.  I think of "Mouse" as a gentler cousin to the classic "Dr. Strangelove," another military satire that stars Peter Sellers in three different roles; together I think the films would make a great double feature 
 Frank Abagnale Jr. stands as one of the greatest con artists of all time. The story is inflated at times (in the introduction he claims to turn on the autopilot of a commercial jet liner, a task that in fact requires the actual ability to fly the plane to begin with). Still, the Catch Me If You Can is engaging, and Abignale's scams combine inventiveness and good humor. Enjoy 
 "Crime Stories and Other Writings" contains 24 short stories and 3 additional selections, arranged chronologically, which Dashiell Hammett wrote between 1923 and 1934. The stories all first appeared in pulp fiction magazines and span all but one year of the master of detective fiction's career. "Crime Stories" offers three stories which cannot be found in any other volume currently in print: "Arson Plus" and "Slippery Finger", which were first published in "Black Mask" magazine under the pseudonym Peter Collinson, and "Creeping Siamese". These stories all feature the Continental Op detective, an always nameless, stubbornly practical character whom Hammett based on a fellow detective from his days at Pinkerton Detective Agency, Jimmy Wright, and on himself. Nineteen of this book's stories feature the Continental Op, making it the largest collection of Op stories available. Among the best of these are "Zig Zags of Treachery", "The House on Turk Street", "The Whosis Kid", and "The Big Knockover". "The Girl with the Silver Eyes" is a follow-up to "The House on Turk Street", so be sure to read "Turk Street" first. "The Big Knockover" and "$106,000 Blood Money" were originally a two-parter, but were published as a single novella in 1943. As their styles differ somewhat, the stories are more successful when separated, as they are here. The story called "Women, Politics and Murder" in this volume has been called "Death on Pine Street" in other volumes; they're the same story. It's interesting to note that "Fly Paper" was inspired by two real cases of murder that employed the same peculiar method. Among the five stories that do not feature the Continental Op is the novella "Woman in the Dark". It's mediocre, but has often been published as a stand-alone volume.   The three "Other Writings" to which the book's title refers are: "The Thin Man: An Early Typescript", "From the Memoirs of a Private Detective", and  "Suggestions to Detective Story Writers". The early version of "The Thin Man" was written in 1930, four years before the final product was to be published and bears only the most superficial resemblance to the now-famous sleuthing of Nick and Nora Charles. It's a good story that introduces a new detective, John Guild of the Associated Detective Bureau. That it was never finished is regrettable. "From the Memoirs of a Private Detective" is 29 short anecdotes and words of wisdom gained from Hammett's experience as a real detective, first published in "The Smart Set" in 1923. Some of these are very funny. In "Suggestions to Detective Story Writers", Hammett, frustrated by the abundant inaccuracies in detective fiction written by non-detectives, sets the record straight on 24 common errors. This was first published in "The New York Post" in 1930 and is  interesting, if out of date at this point. Editor Stephen Marcus has included a Chronology of the important events in Dashiell Hammett's life in the back of the book, as well as explanations of potentially cryptic slang terms and period references in "Notes", also found in the back.  With 24 short stories and 3 additional pieces of writing, "Crime Stories and Other Writings" is the most comprehensive single volume of Dashiell Hammett's short fiction available. Hats off to the Library of America for publishing 3 stories that are not currently found in any other volume. Unfortunately, you will still have to buy all four collections of Hammett's short stories to get all available stories: this one plus "Nightmare Town" from Knopf and "The Continental Op" and "The Big Knockover" from Vintage Crime. If you don't care to have every story, but would like a sizable sampling that includes some of Hammett's best, "Crime Stories and Other Writings" is an excellent choice. It contains the largest number of stories, presented in an attractive compact hardback volume and printed on thin acid-free paper, making it far more durable than other collections. This is a nice volume for both the casually curious and the addicted Dashiell Hammett fan 
 This is a respectable collection of popular songs by Hank Thompson and The Brazos Valley Boys, with release dates going from the 1940's to 1960. In my opinion, he hit his peak in the 60's, but this collection clearly shows the progression of early country music, in both style and lyric development. I recall Hank and his band as huge, but my view may have been skewed by my rural Texas surroundings. The later songs exhibit the honky tonk influence, which I consider the golden era of country. If you collect vintage country, this is indeed essential. I had all these on vinyl but the years took their toll, so it was great to have another chance at them 
 I'm a huge Alice fan.  Naturally I favor the original group, but this is Alice in top form for the first time in years. He'd become limp and boring after his first post-original band album "Welcome to my Nightmare". Every album from "Nightmare" on had to have the requisite sappy ballad hit single. Then comes "Flush the Fashion". Yes, Alice went new wave....but GOOD new wave.  More in the Cars vein than say, the Vapors.  Really, this is a great rock-n-roll record.  There's a freshness to this album that makes it sound like a debut.  It's so different for Alice that there are bound to be a lot of people who just don't get it.  Believe me, this one blows away pap like "Constrictor", "Brutal Planet", "Trash", etc.  It also blows away the likes of "Alice Cooper Goes to Hell", "Lace & Whiskey" and "From the Inside".  As many have noted here, 'Pain' is one of Alice's best songs...of any era.  It has a dramatic almost early 70's glam feel to it. Bowie almost could have written it in the same batch of tunes as 'Time' from "Aladdin Sane". 'Clones' is full-on new wave and an incredible ultra-catchy single.  'Leather Boots' is an early 80's Rockabilly tune with an S&M Cop theme while songs like 'Grim Facts' and 'Nuclear Infected' are no frills Rock-n-roll. Other songs like 'Headlines' and 'Dance Yourself to Death' aren't quite up to snuff but definitely listenable. I should point out that his lyrics are also top-notch here.  His dark (and sometimes not so dark) sense of humor is working overtime. This album is not a great example of Alice as a whole because no other AC lp sounds like this one. It is simply a fantastic album in it's own right 
 This is a brilliant, deeply thoughtful, open-hearted book, one of the ten or twelve most important studies we have so far of the culture of the United States.  Those who take the time and make the effort to read it carefully will learn a lot not only about American history and society, but also about their own private thoughts and fantasies and the background assumptions of their everyday lives.  The dismal state of American education is the main thing you can learn about in most of these reviews.  This book has limitations.  The most obvious: it's about white/Anglo middleclass Americans.  But the only sensible response to the book is still gratitude.  If you haven't read it, read it. 
 This has some of my favorite actress\actors in it, Demi Moore, Camerton Diaz, Drew Berrymore, Matt Leblanc. Lucy Lei was really good in this movie too! I own this movie and have actually watched in several times in the last 2-3 days. I love this movie and I greatly recommend watching it. 
 CAN'T HELP BUT LOVE LISTENING TO THE BROTHERS MUSIC. BRINGS BACK GOOD MEMORIES. THEIR SONGS PLAYING MAKES ME FEEL A LITTLE YOUNGER AND HAPPIER. 
 Warning: Plot spoilers ahead. Do NOT read if you don't want to know what happens.  This was a really odd book. By the end of the first book, Charlie, his grandparents, his parents, and Mr Wonka are all in a glass elevator, shooting into the sky. From here, they go to outer space where a space hotel is opening and some American austronauts find them and assume they are enemy aliens. They, along with the infantile and incredibly stupid president of the United States contemplate blowing up the glass elevator and all inside to protect the soon-to-be occupied space hotel. With Wonka's gadgets, they manage to board the hotel, find real and very dangerous aliens, escape, and save the foolish Americans from being gobbled up...for the most part. When they return to the factory, Wonka offers a volatile youth potion to his granparents, but only the selfish Josephina gets any...and all of it. She disappears as she becomes uninvented, Charlie and Wonka find her in the mysterious place where negatives live, and that's pretty much it. A series of non-sequitors, but funny nonetheles 
 The suggestion that this album proves that Mr. Veloso is 'suddenly old' is not only insulting to Caetano, but also insulting to anyone who might enjoy 'Livro'.  The same holds true for the accusations that only a Brazilian can possibly have any perspective on the matter.  On the other hand, one reviewer referred to Mr. Veloso as an 'icon' and then, parenthetically, suggested the possibility that Caetano was not an icon but, rather, an 'Iconoclast'.  Well ... he was right.  It is clear that Mr. Veloso is both.  Tropicália, indeed, advocates shattering icons.  However, its premise has always provided for the establishment of new ones; by which we may define tomorrow.  This album is a solid reaffirmation of Tropicália. It possesses all that was ever embodied by the movement.  All of the elements that cross the boundaries of the twilight world that exists between the waking world and the night.  All that is rational juxtaposed against the primitive and emotional.  All of the technological limitations of 1967 São Paulo versus all of the modern wizardry of wherever one cares to reside today.  By definition, Tropicália can never get old.  Therein lies the great hope of Brazil (and, dare I say, the world).  It has often been said that Brazil is a failed nation, but I ask you:  Is it gone?  No it is not ... and so long as it lives there is hope.  Hope for Brasil and hope for the world.  Viva Caetano!  Viva Brasil

This a well written thriller definitely a must rea 
 I must admit that I have not read the precusor to the Dirk Gently series, but do not feel that this put me at a loss in reading this novel.  Douglas Adams has developed an entire world within a world that makes little sense but is smashing fun (if a little confusing to read).  "The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul" is a fast-paced mystery filled with humor, satire, and the kitchen refrigerator.  A mysterious accident occurs at Heathrow Airport in which a check-in desk and its attendent disappear in a ball of flame.  Without any other reason, the occurence is written off as an act of God.  But the question remains as to which god would do such a thing.  It is up to Dirk Gently, holistic detective, to try to uncover the mystery that spans two worlds and gods among mortals.  If only he can figure out what that has to do with his recently decapitated client as he embarks on the most miserable day of his life.  "The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul" can be initially confusing since Adams skips between two characters' narrations and the storyline is far-fetched, to say the least.  But the story all comes together in the end, perhaps a little too quickly and summarily, to solve the mystery and ensure that the immortals are in their right place and not messing in the affairs of humans.  The plot is wickedly brillant; a refreshing escape from the mundane 
 "Searching, I hear it call me Knowing it's you I hear The sweet embrace of you near Spring night descends its sweetness on me This late night stroll leading With one thought on my mind..." ~Kiss to Savor  Sleepthief's "the Dawnseeker" slips into your world like a faraway dream and then it takes over your every waking hour as you find yourself lost in its endless intoxicating dream. At times mythological (Eurydice) and at other times modern (The Metro). The songs can at times sink deeply into an almost gothic romantic contemplation (Kiss to Savor).   "You Did a Good Thing" has an uplifting hopeful quality, while Kristy Thirsk's crystalline vocals are truly angelic and stunning within the celestial textures of "Sublunar." The silky sensual mood remains consistent throughout making this a perfect album to listen to while reading, say a novel. I loved listening to this while reading Broken Paradise.   If you love Lunascape, Balligomingo (Beneath the Surface), Zero 7 or Delerium or Kirsty Hawkshaw - Meta Message (she appears on The Chauffeur) you may find this intoxicating. If you love electronica, you may also want to take a romantic journey with "The Attraction" by Evening Ocean.   "Just say that you love me Alone and silent face to face just say that you need me Those words that swallow this empty space"  ~Just Say It featuring Kyoko Baertsoen (Lunascape)  ~The Rebecca Review  
 Drumming At The Edge of Magic is a truly inspirational book for all people interested in drumming and rhythms. It details Harts cathartic exploration and eases the modern drummer into other-worldly potentials 
 Our son is adopted and we absolutely love this book.  I agree with what everyone has said!  This book also has given me ideas on how to word a little book with his own story in it.  We will definately buy this book for anyone that we know who is adopting 
 This is a pioneering book, which provides a generalist approach to dealing with cross-cultural issues with many excellent examples. Hofstede was one of the first to bring the study of how culture affects human interaction in the field of business. The quantifying approach is very similar that cultural anthropologists use.  As with all pioneering works there is some criticism about conflict resolution as other reviewers have pointed out. Another central criticisms of this model has been that nation state and culture are always presumed to be the same. Local culture does not follow political boundaries.  Some readers might be tempted to think of people in simple categories, which is precisely what Hofstede counsels that we should attempt to avoid. Cultures and organizations gives good insights on how "Groupthink" controls our lives and how we could improve interaction. This is a good book for international managers and students of culture 
 A must read for any entrepreneur or intrapreneur(someone within a company who must innovate). Lewis opens with stories about Jim Clark -- reknown Silicon Valley entrepreneur and innovator  and his boat that 'built Netscape"...the book talks about Netscape which Lewis says launched the Information age (it may or may not have but it certainly ushered in the IPO era and online businesses. Interesting what has since happened to Silicon Graphics and Healtheon that was supposed to turn the health care industry 'on it's head'. The inside cover talks about --- what else-- Paradigm shift in American culture-- from conventional business models (the old economy) to the new economy. Yet in retrospect we know that a mix of the best of both is really probably the way to go. The titles of the chapter are more clever than the chapters themselves. I personally would have liked to see more about different innovators not just Clarke but then I didn't write the book. The chapter titles include "Pasts in a Box" Disorganization Man, Home of the Future God Mode -- How Chickents Become Pork, Cheese Sandwiches for Breakfast, Chasing Ghosts, The Turning Point and The New New Thing... 
 In 2003, when I sat with Lori Silverman over lunch, I expressed my frustration over the lack of documented results companies have experienced by bringing stories as a core competency into their organizations.  At the time, we had several books advocating for the use of story and laying the foundation for how powerful it can be for organizations.  But we lacked the results.  Thank heavens Lori took the bull by the horns and in this new book, documented the variety of results companies have experienced in using stories to address key business issues.  Over 70 companies contributed their experiences, which is an amazing feat. This is NOT a book of consultants talking about their work with clients.  It is a book where companies talk directly about how they have successfully used stories and realized significant results.  Now that the results are in, the next step is to put together the practical tools and processes for working with stories to meet the variety of organizational applications.  Some of this material already exists but it needs to be pulled together.  I hope someone tackles that next step soon.  But in the meantime, we can appreciate this book for finally showing how stories can no longer be considered fluff but a core competency for leadership, marketing/branding, customer service, strategy, organizational change, and the like.  
 Wow!  I can't beleive it.  Dr. Vanderschraaf really gets your attention and never lets go throughout the entire book.  What a page turner!!  I just know that I won't be able to just read this one just once.  It's really amazing, and you won't believe the ending!  I don't want to spoil it, but be prepared for a major surprise.  Kudos to this fine author!  He really takes the subject and delivers it to the common reader.  Great read 
 This debut album of a songwriter, pianist, and vocalist dangles the promising future of an amazingly well rounded artist above the jazz community.  This is one of the young new artists that definitely deserves some attention. I like this album better than his newest one actually, it seems more classic and since its less experimental with style and instrumentation, it's seems to be a more solid compilation than "On the Moon." Cincotti accompanies himself on piano as he sings with a well disciplined voice that's distinctive enough to be easily recognized after just a few listens.  He sings and plays a few of his own compositions that are just as brilliant and classic as the timeless pieces he mixes them in with like "Sway," "Rainbow Connection," and "Ain't Misbehavin'. 
 The more I read about Lincoln the more I realize what an incredibly extrodinary man he was. No one book can cover all of the complex person Lincoln was, nor of all that went on while he was alive.  What this book does is paint a very complex picture of the man and his life. Every page is very well written and very informative. You just can't put this down.  One of the best books, not just about Lincoln, but also about the Civil War 
 There is a revolution going on. The formality of the dining room table is being exchanged for a more relaxed gathering around the coffee table as the new mode for entertaining. ~Jennifer Joyce   From the first page, Small Bites impresses with artistically designed culinary temptations. With minimal effort you can make soups, salads, skewers, wrapped Japanese style delicacies, sweets and even dishes of tempting vegetables.   These dishes are known as tapas, antipasti, mezze or finger food. They are perfect for a lifestyle that promotes social gatherings like book clubs or parties.   Unique selections: Fried Artichokes with Saffron Aioli, followed by an entire section on Latin Fiesta that includes classic recipes for a margarita. For the fried food recipes, you are sent to various pages of interest. Crispy Scallops can be dipped in Wasabi Mayonnaise and Ithaca Zucchini cakes are served with a dill yogurt sauce.   The soups are served in small cups or creative containers. The Red curry Pumpkin Soup is made with coconut milk, chicken stock and fresh pumpkin. Cilantro and shallots garnish the spicy garlicky soup.   The Dips chapter also contains a recipe for Mango crush and a complete menu that includes Lemongrass Beef Skewers and passion Fruit Trifle. Each chapter has a "quick" section with tips on fast foods you can make in a hurry. Roasted garlic with warm bread and Spicy peanut dip are easy to make and have just a few ingredients.   The Salads in this book look like they are straight out of a gourmet magazine. Watermelon and Feta cheese? There is a salty/sweet theme to some of the dishes.   If you love making skewers on your grill then the Citrus Swordfish Brochettes may entice you with the pomegranate dipping sauce. This chapter is filled with luxurious flavors of saffron, dried fruits, fragrant rose water, pistachios, black olives and smoked paprika. The shrimp are even dusted with Sumac. The theme is Middle Eastern Delights and each and ever page is filled with delicious satays for every taste and sauce dipping desire. Whether you are hungry for shrimp, lamb, pork or beef, there is a recipe.   By the time you get to the chapter on Meats you may be a little overwhelmed with all the ideas and rather hungry for recipes like Five-spice hoisin ribs. These are made in the oven and only take 2 hours with minimal preparation and care.   The fish chapter contains recipes for chicken breast bites. There is some mingling of ideas in each chapter and this book doesn't focus on any one food like chicken or beef. There is a good variety of every type of food you could imagine. For wrapped seafood, onward to the Wrapped, Tied and Rolled chapter which also contains ideas for rolling fruit with arugula and parmesan.   If you are thinking "parties," then look for the Wild Mushroom Crostini with Marscarpone and Sherry vinegar. Rent your favorite Bollywood movie and enjoy a spicy Indian feast complete with magenta pink tablecloths, small spice boals and scattered rose petals. The imaginative table settings add beauty to the pages filled with tons of tasty recipes. The "Rolled Zucchini Ribbons" are a stunning presentation and will catch the attention of your guests. The Artichoke Puff Pastry Bites are also easy to make because you can purchase puff pastry in sheets.   The recipes are adventurous, delicious and are made from ingredients that are easily found at your local grocery store. The Sweets chapter includes such tempting delights as chocolate cupcakes with cherry colored icing and rose petals. Is there no mercy? Chocolate Crinkle Cookies would ship well at Christmas and thinking about Figs dipped in chocolate and pistachios is making me feel a bit heady.   An entire section is dedicated to "useful" recipes - mostly sauces and dressings.   Jennifer Joyce loves to travel in search of new flavors and recipes and her book is simply stunning in beauty and overwhelming in creativity.   ~TheRebeccaReview.com  
 I have been interested in the lady, called The Blac Dahlia for many years. Mr. Ellroy wrote a fantastic book about her.The information in the book was written so well, I could not put it down until the end 
 Gore Vidal, as he does throughout the American Empire series, makes history come alive in a way that no pure history text could.  His insights on peoples' motives and character truly are breathtaking and his fictional works, such as 1876, have the quality of a suspense novel despite the fact that the reader already knows ultimately how historical events will unfold.  Vidal brings back the narrator of "Burr," Charles Schlemmerhorn Schuyler, now in his 60s, in ill health and attempting to restore the family fortune for the sake of his daughter after having lost it in the panic of 1873.  Having been gone from America for 40 years, he looks at the America of 1876 as a sort of European Rip Van Winkle, comparing the America of 1876 to the one he knew in the 1830s. It is Vidal's ability to illuminate the details of history through the interaction between historical and non-historical characters and the degree of exquisite detail that his narrative provides that makes him almost unique among writers of this genre.  Through his examination of the U.S. in its centennial year, Vidal gives us insight into our prior history as well as our post-centennial history, as one is able to trace the veins of Jeffersonianism and Hamiltonianism as they course through American and world history.  Those who appreciate the work of Vidal in this genre may also be interested in the novels of Herman Wouk (Winds of War, War & Rememberance) and of Ralph Peters, a/k/a Owen Parry (the Able Jones detective series set in the American Civil War).  Vidal's books take you into the embrace of history and its quasi-fictional backstory in a manner that makes 1876 impossible to put down and that makes you feel a tinge of regret when the book ends, because you wish that it could have gone on forever 
 Is inspirational but much like the watercolor boo 
 A woman I know, along with an Amazon.com reviewer or two, couldn't comprehend how Francesca's boredom could lead her to betray her husband.  Francesca was not bored, perhaps unsustained by her husband's lack of passion, but not bored. Bridges of Madison County hit the bestsellers list for years because just about everyone has parted ways with someone they loved, whether it lasted four days or ten years.  True passion lives forever in the memory and can sustain for a lifetime.  This story is beautiful, one of my favorites.  
 I believe this is a book that every teen should read and that every parent should applaud. Now that I'm well into my adult years, I found myself wishing someone could have addressed these ideas when I was much younger.  What makes this book so special is its practicality. Sean doesn't preach. He offers practical, time-tested advice and solutions for teens struggling with the decisions that are going to make or break their futures.  He warns, praises, inspires, and empowers teens to make the most out of their lives by making good decision.  This isn't just a self-help book.  It's a book that every teen can find worth while 
 I often use this CD in various ways:  my yoga practice, walking meditation, relaxing background music while cleaning or cooking.  And I have discovered that singing along with Deva does wonders for my mood.  :o)  Highly recommended 
 I purchased these books as both ice breaker to guests in my home, but also to give a good reading.  Well the books are a simple read, one a day.  The information contained in these books is absolutly worth its weight in gold.  In fact when put into to practice, you almost immediatly become memorable as one who values certain lost traditions.    As a conversation starter, well, the females in the group will pick one up, flip through and eventually make a remark such as "why don't you ever do that".....     I highly rate this book as it is a truely wonderful (although trivial to certain people) book.  An art that was lost, of on the fall could certainly be picked back up again 
 This was the first book I read that was dedicated strictly to CI. It turned out to be a good starting point since it covers much territory quickly, which is both a strength and a weakness. I liked the layout in that it is easy to read the chapter materials. My only issue with it was that it has a clear European focus and all of my work has to do with American companies and mostly American dominated industries. This isn't the authors fault but more my own as I should have read the preface more closely before purchasing it. Despite my error, I still think this was a good start to my now growing CI book collection 
 I could not put this book down, and LOVED it. Unlike other books that make you feel bad for not having all the "right" stuff,this one really encourages you to express you individuality and make your space HAPPY, not perfect.   The writing is great, and Jonathan shares a lot of his own personal inspirations and story about how he became a "designer" himself. And there are lots of great hints about websites to go to and stuff to look for on e-bay. I'm working on decorating my first place, and this book is a lifesaver. LOVED IT 
 All I can say is, if you are looking for this, this is the best place to get it. I look here for any DVDs before I look any where else 
 Tooth and Nail finds Rebus helping out the London police hunt down the serial killer, Wolfman.  The novel is filled with a lot of local London color, including a car chase down St. Martin's Lane and around Nelson's Column.  I enjoyed this book immensely until the last 40 pages, where killer is caught based on an unsubstantiated "hunch".  Being from NYC I found Rebus's take on fast London city life very amusing.  Several pages are devoted to Rebus contemplating the utter inhumanity of the Tube!  In fact, the only positive comments come from Rebus's would-be partner, George Flight, although Rebus mocks his attitude: "London is bigger, better, rougher, tougher and more important than anywhere else."  It's funny that we would want other people to think our city is rough and tough, because that implies that we are as well, when we are actually victims.  Fortunately, from the novel I learned a new way to cope: just chant FYTP.  Rankin is a master at capturing the reader's attention.  Clues and red herrings fly like nobody's business.  Just keep in mind that this is crime fiction not mystery, that is, don't expect the clues to pan out.  The dialog is amazingly realistic, witty, and edgy.  Ultimately, Rebus's humanity (he describes himself as having "more ambition than talent") and musings on the human condition are the reason why I find this novel, and Rankin's others, so compelling 
 I stumbled on this CD by accident and I'm glad I did.  It was recorded in November of '56 and Coltrane sounds like he felt relaxed and free to really lean into his playing on this session.  As I said it was '56 so his playing is in the more standard style of his Atlantic records stuff (although Coltrane never played a note that was "standard!").  A very, very good CD.  If you like Cotrane, you'll like this CD 
 Having read Katherine, I wanted to get my hands on another Anya Seton novel. Her words are beautiful and her accurate historical references in the Medieval and Renaissance eras are breathtaking. People recommended Green Darkness because of its timeless romance, historical feel and paranormal aspects centered on past lives and reincarnation. So I gave Green Darkness a whirl. This enormous book (a big trade paperback with over six-hundred pages) enthralled me from beginning to end and I wish it had been longer, that the magic hadn't ended. Despite its rather large size and intricate story, the novel ended too soon for me. (I like big books, but you have to make sure that you will enjoy the whole thing when getting a large volume.) I finished this gem in three sittings. The novel's setting begins in the late 1960s (around the year this was first published). Richard Mardson takes his beloved wife, the American heiress Celia Taylor, to his estate in Sussex, England. There he shows her around the ancient castle that had belonged to his noble family for centuries and introduces her to his friends and peers, all respectable noblemen and women like Richard. But something strange begins to happen between them. Celia is experiencing deja vu, as though she'd been there before. This happens the second she enters the castle. At the same time, Richard becomes restless and moody. Celia is bewildered by his abrupt change from the once loving man to someone who isolates himself and avoids her. Their lives and their marriage could be in shambles, and Celia has to go back to her previous life during Tudor England to figure out what had gone wrong in order to salvage their happiness at present time. Her past life is a woman named Celia Bohun who falls for a handsome monk named Stephen (Richard) Mardson. Their forbidden love is timeless and the things they go through are staggering. There are many twists throughout the novel.  I have read few novels that had made me go through as many emotions as this one had done. Celia and Stephen's love for one another was something truly beautiful and tragic at the same time. This novel brought me to tears by the time I finished. The building of tension between the protagonists is almost palpable. Celia is a very complex heroine. She is proud and innocent, but also could be quite the vixen when she sets her mind to it, especially when Stephen is involved. Stephen is a tall, dark and gorgeous hero who has taken a vow of chastity for his religion, but his attraction to Celia is undeniable and it is something that torments him. This part of his personality makes him a tortured soul and he is very appealing as a result. The part in which Celia looks after him when he falls ill is one of the sexiest scenes in the novel. It has a mixture of eroticism and innocence, for it is the first time Celia sees Stephen's nude body. The romance is indeed wonderful, but the historical references make this novel all the richer and more palatable. We experience all of the things that occurred during Tudor England, from Henry VIII's reign passing on to Queen Mary and onto Queen Elizabeth I. I have been reading quite a lot of historical/biographical novels and finding this book was like finding hidden treasure. You feel the time period and the events that took place in those times. The most insightful things for me were those centered on Queen Mary's persecution of Protestants and all the historical things that occur while time passes after the scandal centered on Celia's love for Stephen. The ending is one of the best endings I have read. Green Darkness is a true treasure that all historical enthusiasts should own. The story is quite intricate, not an easy read by a long shot (I find that most novels that center on reincarnation are very complex), but the overall development of the story is extremely well woven and beautifully executed. There are numerous characters in this novel, but I never felt like I had to keep up with them in order to remember them. Each character serves his or her purpose and I loved them (or hated them if they were villains). The one thing that puzzled me was the emphasis on Mabel's weight. I thought plump women were considered prettier in those times. And Celia (the twentieth century one) sounds a little too British for an American who'd set foot in England for the first time. Other than those negligible details, Green Darkness is perfect. Anya Seton was a great author, one of the best in her time. I think I like this novel more than Katherine. I wonder if Anya Seton and this novel inspired Jude Deveraux to write Remembrance (which I read at the same time as this one), which is another romance centered on soul mates and past lives partly set in the sixteenth century. Anyway, Green Darkness is one of the best historical/paranormal novels out there and I cannot recommend this memorable gem enough 
 This is a hilarious play, taped for TV viewing. I have seen the original and on second viewing it was equally funny. While it MAY help to know some Shakespeare, there is so much slapstick and other humour that the whole family will laugh 
 This was my first Silverberg novel.  The overall idea was nice, but I was a bit disappointed with the writing style and characters.  The events involve the unannounced arrival of aliens, who are technologically and intellectually vastly superior.  They do not regard humans as being worthy of communication, except for using humans for labor.  Effortlessly, they destroy all governments and much of human civilization, and enslave humanity for about half a century.  Each time humans manage some act of resistance, they strike back brutally.  They exert control telepathically, and are protected by the same ability from hostile humans.  And finally, one day, the aliens simply leave.  These are "the Alien years".  Throughout the Occupation years, humans continue to try to resist, rather feebly.  The novel is mostly the story of a group of resistors.  First, there are the Carmichaels, a California family, that spends the occupation years breeding in a mountain ranch, collecting information on the aliens and dreaming of attacks, and eventually managing a couple of strikes.  The life of four generations of Carmichaels is the heart of the story.  Added is the story of Khalid, the (...) son of a Pakistani immigrant girl and a rotten Englishman.  Severely mistreated, he learns to hide his feelings and empty his mind, and this allows him to kill an alien without suffering their telepathic reprisal.  Much later, he trains two assassins for the Carmichaels, to attempt to kill the "Prime" Entity, who the rebels hope is as vital to the aliens as a queen bee is to her hive.  The premise and basic science are certainly intelligent.  The aliens don't simply start speaking English after a short period, as in a lot of American science-fiction.  Nor do they behave just like the ordinary Western person, as aliens do in much of science fiction.  They are, truly, _alien_.  The writing style is long-winded and could be tightened up enormously.  This is my first complaint about the book.  Sometimes the style is hideously "cheesy", as young Americans would put it.  On the other hand, the jumps through years is a nice technique that allows exploring the half-century after the Invasion.  In each jump, the characters age, and this is done rather gracefully, the change in the characters as they grow older seems believable.  My second complaint: the descriptions of Carmichael family relationships, their emotions and personalities, were rather boring.  These are some of the cheesier parts of the books.  Reading about the patriarch Colonel was painfully boring and sometimes annoying.  I feel that, if all the world were to be colonized tomorrow, Third-World peoples would be the ones most likely to resist, with a history and culture of resistance.  The story, after all, is one in which all of humanity is made to suffer what the Vietnamese have suffered under American occupation, or what Africans have suffered under Europe's yoke.  In this book, or course, the resistance comes from blond, blue-eyed Americans.  Well, maybe anything else is too much to expect from any Western writer.  This, I would say, is my third complaint about the book.  It's unfortunate that the novel didn't come out of a Third World writer from a former-Colony country.  Such a writer would have understood Occupation much better!  On the other hand, to be fair to the author, I would say he got much of the description of resistance right, except that real resistance might come more conceivably from those who have struggled against Whites in the past century.  I should finish by listing some things I liked.  The Khalid character was an interesting creation, fun to read about but probably not very believable in the end.  Near the end, Andy, great-grandson of the Colonel, runs the assault on "Entity Prime" by remotely directing several rebels.  This was described quite well: a breathtaking, exciting description.  The description of scifi gimmicks are kept to a minimum.  There is a "net" you can plug into using your implant, a now-traditional scifi concept also used by William Gibson, Dan Simmons, and many other authors.  No pseudo-science arguments are given for explaining things.  We learn rather little about the aliens; since the aliens don't bother to communicate, this seems fair.  In short, not a bad read, but it's not spectacular and it has weak points 
 Ever since hearing Ocean Blue's debut album in 80s I have grabbed on to each new release without ever hearing a song...and I've never been disappointed!  The sound is so smooth and uplifting.  I can close my eyes and feel summer!  They are by far my favorite band of all time.  I've seen them in concert only one.  I always seem to miss when they return to my area.  Can't wait to see them again. If you've never experienced The Ocean Blue you've been missing out!  For me, it is true love 
 I bought this as a replacement for a Sony WM-FX788 AM/FM cassette player and recorder. When the 788 stopped working, I looked for a replacement and did not find one that would both play and record cassettes. I have since become much more satisfied with the 290 than I was with the 788 for several reasons: (1) The 290 uses direct mechanical actuation of the tape drive, rather than the electronic actuation of the 788. I regard this as an advantage, since the ultrasensitive switch that controlled the cassette drive in the 788 often resulted in it taking off at high speed in some unintended direction when all I wanted to do was stop it. The direct mechanical actuation of the tape drive means that I am never in doubt about what the machine is going to do when I press a button. I regard this as a desirable trade-off for the lack of an auto-reverse feature. (2) The AM and FM sensitivity is much better in the 290 - almost as good as my table radios. Its weather and TV band reception is adequate and is an occasionally useful feature. (3) The 290 uses a single AA cell, rather than the rechargeable, expensive, and hard to find proprietary battery in the 290. (4) The 290 is much cheaper - I paid about $180 for the 788. (4) The 290 is slightly larger than the 788, but is still a handy size for slipping in a pocket while exercising (my primary use). [To answer a point raised in the discussions: going from the tape to a previously tuned-in radio station takes only two button presses - one to stop the tape and one to turn on the radio.] I have other ways of making recordings, so not having this function in a radio and cassette player is no great loss. Overall, I rate the FX-290 as an excellent value 
 If you're looking for a legal thriller, "Bleachers", neither legal nor thriller, is certainly not the drink for which you thirst! In a quiet, pastoral yet moving style of writing which he was to re-use to incredible effect in "The Last Juror", Grisham has treated his audience to a powerful, evocative novella that paints a portrait of the final years of the century in Messina, a small town in deep south USA.  The story opens, develops and closes with Neely Crenshaw, the all-American quarterback who led his 1987 Messina Spartans high school team to an undefeated season, reminiscing about the life of coach Eddie Rake, who drove his players and teams mercilessly to an unrivalled win-loss record. Much of the team joins Crenshaw - Silo Mooney, the bad boy nose tackle who revelled in hurting his opponents; Nat Sawyer, the weak link in the team; Paul Curry, Crenshaw's best friend in high school; Mal Brown, now the town sheriff - as they wait for the symbolic dimming of Rake Field's lights to signal the coach's death, relive their glory days, replay the miraculous championship game of the 1987 season and struggle with their decision as to whether they love or hate the coach's memory and the effect he had on all of their lives.  I'll admit it ... this sounds like the stuff of one spectacularly boring novel and yet, somehow, even when it is read only on the surface as a tale of small town Americana, Grisham has succeeded in telling a warm, moving tale that I found every bit as compelling as the best of his thrillers. But, perhaps even more important, Grisham has provided the fodder for hours of controversial discussion on the best and worst of amateur and professional sports in North America! The worst - the win-at-all-costs attitude; the adulation and elevation of sports heroes and celebrities to an extent far beyond any real conceivable value in this world; the punishing, physical destruction of the bodies of young people as we force them to compete in contact sports up to our unrealistic expectations; and groupies willing to sacrifice their bodies on the altar of unthinking hero worship! And the best - the colour blindness of physical achievement in sport; the translation of the drive and mental discipline of sport into other life endeavours; the camaraderie and the synergy of a team willing to sacrifice individual performance for team success!  And Crenshaw's conversation with the Cameron Lane, the "good girl" he tossed over for Screamer, the leggy, short-skirted blonde floozy who was all too willing to roll over for the team quarterback, was so sticky sweet but, damn, it was good!  What an enjoyable read! And all over in the too short space of only a couple of hours!  Paul Weis 
 Buy the 1st Edition and save yourself thirty bucks.    It's got the same cover (but a different color), the same number of pages (506 pages) and is as far as I can tell, the exact same book.  I'm tired of "edition inflation."  Buy the first edition and save yourself a lot of money.  
 Has been a favorite of mine since I was just a wee toddler. I love this movie. Every time I watch it, why it just makes me want to break out into song. Wonderful movie for kids and adults of all ages. Hurrah. Go Beauty and the Beast. Apparently, everyone CAN find happiness. Yay 
 My 4 year old son and I are reading it every night. The print is nice and big so my son can easily pick out the words he knows 
 While Christmas shopping one year with my Mother-in-law we came across this book and I said she HAD to buy this for one of her grandchildren.  She finally broke down and lo-and-behold...I got it for Christmas!  This is the cutest "10 Little" book I have ever seen and the googly eyes are a riot!  My 4 month old daughter loves to grab at the eyes and mommy's embellishment of such lines as "No more sharp-tooths munching on a mooth."  This is a great book if you enjoy reading and want to share that with your kids (of any age! 
 Just yesterday I got out to my car to find a tire about 80% flat.  Within 5 minutes the tire was fully inflated. Saved on having to deal with my spare. High highly recommend this item to everyon 
 This wonderful book is now again available for purchase from lulu dot com. The known errors have been fixed and its got a new smarter look and feel 
 Red Lightning does not immediately start where Red Thunder left off.  Instead it picks up with the next generation - and they're living on Mars.  Oh if only we could live on Mars right now!  This story takes a different slant because it's less about four young people having a Grand Adventure and more about Consequences.  Yet I found it captured the spirit of Red Thunder and I proudly display them on my 'favorites' shelf.  Buy this book. 
 Retribution is a beautifully written collection of stories. It has been a while since I have read such lucid prose.  The title story is my favorite, but each has its own flavor and virtues.  I hope there will be another book soon 
 This product has changed my life for the rest of my life. Plain shirts are a thing of the past. This Transfer paper is the most amazing thing since Jesus 
 His duet with Martina was great.  I love Dean Martin's style and voice. So anything he does always sounds good to me.  
 I am a Talking Heads fan and a David Byrne fan. Of David's solo recordings  I find that his self titled cd from 1994 is his best. I think it's because  he moved away from the Latin flavored sounds of 1989's Rei Momo and 1992's  Uh-Oh and back to the kind of music he did with Talking Heads. It's his  music not his music over another country's sounds. It's also David's most  lyrically straightforward. You can sense what David is really getting at  with "A Long Time Ago". "Angels" sounds like an updated  version of "Once in a Lifetime" but with a different lyrical  slant. "Back in the Box" is an excellent song about hiding from  society. "Buck Naked" and "My Love Is You" are nice  humorous looks at relationships. The songs are about subjects that Byrne  didn't elaborate too much on with Talking Heads. I also liked 1997's  Feelings, but I don't think it match's David Byrne. A must have for any  Talking Heads fan and for any rock collector 
 The dictionary is all I expected....selection of topics is very very good and type is easy to read....very comprehensive.  I would reccommend it to any puzzle solver 
 Individuals interested in purchasing an American History book for the sole purpose of quickly researching a specific historical happening need to look no further. Scarcely illustrated, this is a fully encompassing text which provides a brief description of each event. Most descriptions range in length from one-quarter to one-half of a page. For example, it required less than two-hundred words to recount the assasssination of President Kennedy. Lengthy historical events such as the Vietnam War are also discussed in a concise manner. The Vietnam War required seven pages, including the full page map, to educate the reader. Those interested in an American History book that can be enjoyably read cover to cover must look elsewhere. Brief, fragmented event depictions cause the reader's attention to quickly wane. This book is being awarded four stars for its use as an encyclopedia 
 The success of the Novel "The Killer Angels," and its motion picture version "Gettysburg," has made Joshua Lawrence Chamberlin one of the most recognized figures in Civil War history. This books seeks to deflate some of the myth, but nonetheless represents an outstanding gem of small-unit scholarship. Desjardin maintains a ruthlessly narrow focus, recounting exclusivly the actions of the Maine regiment on July 2nd, 1863. He counters the notion presented by Michael Shaara that the 20th Maine's charge was some kind of executed manuver, presenting it rather as a spontaneous rush down the hill. He also de-emphasises the importance of the 20th Maine's actions, suggesting that had the 20th withdrawn, the 83rd Pennsylvania could have held against the exhausted Alabama regiments. He presents Chamberlin as somewhat of a tragic character after the war, suffering from political reverses and a failing marriage-this is in contrast to most accounts that celebrate his actions as a soldier, governor and college president. Desjardin's book certainly makes the battle less glamorous than it appears on the silver screen. Nonetheless, he reaffirms the basic story of a green regiment, and a green commander, putting up a hell of a fight. 20th Maine aficionados will want to read this book to get a new angle on the famous story, while Civil War buffs will appreciate it for its in depth detail about the dynamics of a regimental action 
 As with his other book, Cannabis: A History, Martin Booth gives a definitive guide to Opium!!!!!! This book traces opium to ancient times and follows its progress throughout history... as technology progresses...new discoveries leading to extracting new derivatives from opium are found.... the destructive force of the opium wars and many more are explained... 
 I was a little bored at first, throughout all the history in the first few chapters.  He gave detailed accounts of EVERYTHING and EVERYTHING was extremely well cited, with notes sections at the back of each chapter.  The majority of the book provided cut-and-dry information in almost a journalistic style.  The last 2 chapters, however, tied everything together with brief summaries and profound conclusions.  I would recommend this book to anyone who really desires the 'gory details' from an insider's point of view, but it is also for the 'inexperienced' student of Jehovah's Witnesses desiring to delve into study.  Definitely a worth-while read 
 This is a must-see for Orwell/1984 fans. It is as faithful a adaptation of the novel as it is possible to achieve IMHO. Largely shot on or around the dates mentioned in the novel. John Hurt, Suzanna Hamilton and Richard Burton in his final film appearance are just great. Brings the dense air and thick grime of the oppressed world of Ociana to life without being pushy or preachy. If Orwell had lived as long it is MHO that he would have approved this film adaptation 
 Market Profile is not an easy concept to understand and that is why it has not been adopted by a lot of traders. Most traders want an easy quick fix and are not prepared to take the time and effort to learn an art that will make them stand out above their peers. In this book and through the videos on his web site (www.daltongrouptrading.com) James Dalton clearly explains the concepts and the theories behind Market Profile and combines these with real worlds examples of how The Profile gives structure to the trading day. Everyone is looking for the Holy Grail in trading but very few realize that the Holy Grail is not some magical indicator but the ability to recognize a day type early on in the day and then adapt your trading accordingly. Market Profile gives you this and James Dalton's explanation is the most comprehensive and makes this difficult concept much easier to grasp 
 I enjoyed this novel, and while some aspects and characters were not as well developed as others, I found myself swept up in the building of sky scrapers as a metaphor for achievement.   The historical backdrop was interesting as well, and provided a window into a period and place that few of us know much about.   I recommend this novel.  Jennifer Cameron-Smith 
 Fans Only is really a collection of videos, interviews, and  guest appearances that are woven throughout - randomly it  seems at times - but the structure of it all is still exciting enough to hold your attention, especially if you are new to  the videos.   As far as the interviews went, the dvd begins with introducing the band in casual interviews during their everyday routines. Then, the majority of the documentive material is more of a  here-and-there placement, within the studios and during shoots. There are also a couple guest show appearances and performances.  I have to point out that there were some really nice moments on the dvd with the motion graphics, including a couple pieces specifically during the end. One is a montage where raw photos  and screenshots from various inspirations are cropped in on  to become some of the band's album covers and artwork.   Running time: 136 mins (2hrs 16 mins 
 I have four kids ranging in age from 8 1/2 years old to 2 1/2 years old.  All of them LOVE this book.  The huge eyes are what captivated all of us in the beginning but the story and illustrations were fun with an easy moral included.  I can't wait to find more titles in the Boniface series 
 I bought a first edition of the hardcover The Cuisine of California way back when and cooked so many wonderful, flavorful dishes from it that nearly every page was sprinkled with carrot soup or dijon mustard sauce!   When I saw the new paperback edition in the cookbook section at my local  bookstore, I was overjoyed to see that I could get a CLEAN copy, and that a  new batch of serious home cooks would have a chance to sample from this  sophisticated, but easy and well-organized work.  Members of my family  still ask for "that great pork loin stuffed with apricots dish from  your favorite cookbook!"--and I never tire of making it, since the  directions are easy to follow and not loaded with fat.  To me, The Cuisine  of California has become a culinary standard, right up there with the Joy  of Cooking, The Silver Palate, and all the James Beard cookbooks 
 This is a new style of film for Jet Li. True there is some of the greatest action sceens ever shot in this film but mosst of the film is based on making fun of the Hong Kong film bissness. While Jet's charater Kit Li does have some great fights in the movie the best fight is the fight near the end of the movie involving Frankie Loan(I think that's how you spell it who's played be Jackie Cheung), who hires Kit as a bodyguard, and Kong (I don't know who plays him). Frankie is a parody of Bruce Lee(The greatest martial artist ever) and Jackie Chan (I don't really see the Jackie Chan parody but I can uderstand how some people will.) The final fight sceen also reminds me of a Bruce Lee style fight (Jackie even wears a yellow and black jumpsuit like the one Lee wears in his final movie "The Game Of Death"). This is a masterwork of Hong Kong comedy and action. If you are not a fan of both of these I wold be wary of buying this moive 
 As a child growing up in the city of Salem, known for it's working class backbone, I was the only kid I knew who had been to Symphony Hall more than Fenway Park. Going in to Boston for the symphony's open practices was what I lived for. It gave me a true appreciative, although untrained ear. The one lasting lesson is that while you may not notice good classical music,  EVERYONE notices bad classical music. And this is NOT bad classical.  I have been a reader of the Aubrey Maturin Novels for 8 years (only two a year for dramatic suspense) and while I am a huge fan of Patrick O'Brian's writing, I find that with the addition of the music he scored his work to, I stand in awe. The music is well grounded to the situations and feelings in the book. Either Mr. O'Brian was a very well rounded, or he did his homework.   The CD is a wonderful insight to the author, and the characters he created. Pour a glass of claret, listen to the cd, read the books...  but pay no heed to Killick's "scrape, scrape , scrape..never a song you could dance to.. 
 Wow - this one has been on my "must read" list for a long time, and I am so glad I finally picked it up.  I read it in 2 sittings, and could barely put it down.  The coming-of-age story of Francie Nolan is apparently based on Betty Smith's own life - and she is a magician with the written word. Her descriptions of the deepest poverty of Brooklyn during WWI and insights into the minds and souls of fragile yet incredibly strong people are stunning.  Her observations about the human condition are timeless.  Tree is a real treasure of American literature.. 
 I read the book in middle school and watched the movie shortly afterwards.  A few of the characters were switched around, but I was so impressed with the adaptation. A thriller that still makes me nervous and jumpy - the kids in the kitchen scene and when Mr. Arnold's arm drops on Ellie's shoulder as she's trying to turn the generator back on, for example. There have been countless lines I've memorized and quoted at appropriate and innapropriate times, due to my obsession.  And after watching it more than 25 times, I've come to appreciate it more. Great cast - Sam Neil is my favorite. Richard Attenborough is a little too cute and nice, but I liked his white clothing, the hat, and the amber cane. Wayne Knight was incredible as Nedry, the slob. He's as likeable as ever, though somewhat the villain. I always hate it when he dies. Jeff Goldblum fit the description of Ian Malcom from Crichton's novel well. Crichton sparked my interest in Chaos Theory, sometimes called The Butterfly Effect. I am a firm believer in it. And of course, in the novel and film, Malcolm was right. "Life finds a way..."    (In Chaos Theory, the system is very sensitive to small changes in external conditions, and "random" --unpredictable-- events result from the "normal" equation/setup, because there is never a fixed set of outcomes; the system is unpredictable because of its complexity. Hammond thought his system was without error, that he was in complete control. He believed that the dinosaurs would fail to reproduce because all were engineered to be female, but he was wrong - the dinosaurs evolved because of the replacement amphibian DNA that was used to fill in the gaps in the dinosaur DNA. This DNA gave the dinosaurs the ability to change sex in order to reproduce, "survive," in a single-sex environment. And it turned out that Hammond was wrong about many other equations - things are not as black and white as he thought, and it is problematic to predict long-term behavior of his animals.)  Love the scene where the lawyer is eaten while sitting on the toilet.  We watched the Mr. DNA segment in a high school biology class. I've always thought it explained the process very well for something that is complicated (though I found Mr. Hammond's live speaking lines to be unrealistic...was he really planning to be there for each tour?).  The kids were kind of annoying. I didn't notice this until I was a little older, but Lex ("I prefer to be called a hacker") uses Silicon Graphics' 3D file system navigator to turn power back on in the park. Their logo is on the monitor. If only UNIX were as popular as Windows is now...  Anyway, the soundtrack was classic - it was the first CD I bought, back in the mid-90s.  Tonya Harding skated to the theme at the 1994 Olympics, or some other competition. I only liked her because of her excellent music choice 
 what I'd really like to see is Borges on Wagner. No such essay here. Still, this vol. has been worth it at twenty bucks. Getting a copy where I live is not easy: the libraries dont have it, and its hard to get this volume used, locally. Buy it. This has been some of the best twenty bucks I ever spent. 'A keystone for the home library.' This Borges vol. is one you want to keep on your shelf anyway.  I cant remember the last time I spent such money on a book that was so worth it. My used copy of Oxford Shakespeare, perhaps, or paperback of Toynbees abridged history. (anticipating acquiring more Huxley.  What we need is even more Borges non-fic trans. into Eng. Yet perhaps we are being too lazy, not learning our Spanish in order to read the originals.  A few such volumes together is likely to qualify for the label 'a liberal education.'   . . . within a half hour or so of reading, I extracted much of the gold of the spirit of this book. It was worth it. In fact, I imagine a person would have to be very highly educated, not to extract some great gold from this book. I keep it. It is   a gold mine in many respects. Gobs of well-presented info, and not just on lit. Dont avoid Borges because he seems to present something undefinable, even in his non-fic: It is through being patient with his undefinability that the essence shines through, for many readers. Likeliving with sculpture: you dont look at it once, then forget all about it.  Anyhow, there is plenty of informational material here presented in desirable form, and the bulk of it ought not to disappoint the reader who has no use for would-be abstract/ esoteric dimensions of Borges that others may seek.  I had owned the companion volume Fictions for a time, and actually found them depressing, tho worthy, and certainly 'something new.' ( attempts to read the 'Personal Anthology' in my twenties failed.) Curiously enough, I could not extract the indefinable 'something' from Borges' fiction, or his poetry I have read, that I could from the Non-fictions. The Non-fictions has more than contributed to the value of his Fictions, and enhanced and enriched them ( the reviewer on the cover of the non-fic's who says the beginner aught to start with this 'Selected Non-fic' volume, is perfectly right.)   Non-fic it may be, yet one finds oneself more patient with his stately/nimble, yet mysterious prose with its abstract depth and color, than with a good deal of his fiction and poetry.   I would sum it up by saying none of Borges is deserving of neglect. To own several of his volumes, and consult them at intervals over a thoughtful year's time, may be a more effective way of giving Borges 'the old college try,' than shuddering with disgust or incomprehension, and abandoning him altogether at the outset. True, this is a pricey way to do it: and repeat stories from one collection to another may seem a bad idea. Yet those in the know appreciate a variety of translations of many authors.   Yet I will not say to the newcomer that Borges cannot be overall depressing. Even this volume, however, is enough to make one reach for the Prozac. Yet his non-fic offers so many returns, perhaps even over his fiction, that you will find a way to cope.  Perrhaps also, it is not the subject matter overall; it is Borges style that makes this volume valuable.  yet, like Mann and Auden have, I do wish there was available a few pages of Borges on Wagner! I cannot believe Borges overlooked what Mann said was such significant opera work. The inclusion of such an essay in this collection, would have immensely increased its value - tho unfortunately also its snob appeal, and perhaps the price.   Non-fictions belongs on your shelf right next to Audens' 'Forewards and Afterwords,' another desirable source of intelligent presentation of a variety of subjects, not just lit. Auden will balance Borges perceived bizarre qualities for you, with a calm, encompassing intelligence.   If there's a better duet of quality essays available on a variety of subjects so intelligently presented, and not essays largely devoted to the literary, I would love to know what they are. Eliot is entirely literary. Perhaps Aldous Huxley, for variety, and especially if you choose primarily to avoid American essayists.   
 The first time I read this book, I was in love. I'm a fan of both Ms. Debbie Allen and Mr. Kadir Nelson, so I knew that the story and the artwork were going to be wonderful, but I never expected it touch me as it did. I don't have any children, but I have two nieces who at a very early age showed they were going to carry our family's legacy of being beautifully tall athletic women. I could feel Sassy's plight and I'd wished I had this story during those awkward adolescent years. Needless to say I've brought three copies and it is one of our favorites reads 
 After reading a couple of mixed reviews about THE BOXER, I delayed seeing it, and I probably would have skipped it entirely if it weren't for the sterling reputations of co-stars Emily Watson and Daniel Day Lewis. (The latter plays the role of Danny Flynn, a man imprisoned for 14 years for his role in an IRA bombing.)  More fool me. THE BOXER slowly impresses the viewer with its complex storyline, quiet demeanor and subtle dialogue. Watson and Lewis absolutely nail their roles as lovers who were separated at the age of 18, and now find themselves in the awkward roles of adults resuming a teenaged courtship. In a Hollywood film, the two would ultimately hop into bed with a rousing musical score; not so here.  While Watson and Lewis bring uncanny eloquence to their soft-spoken characters, perhaps most fascinating about THE BOXER is the culture of Ireland, specifically the political etiquette and sectarian hatred that each character has to dance around with.   SIDELIGHTS: This film is only nominally about boxing. Oh, and the Dublin flats that stand in for this movie's Belfast projects have since been razed, and upscale apartments now stand there 
 not the type of books I usually read (poetry and all) and it took me quite a while to "get into it" but it was worth it. the story is multi-layered and interesting and the whole book is wonderfully written. Highly recommended.  
 This was such an awesome movie.  Remove everything you ever knew about the Once upon a time in china series from your head, except for Jet Li playing the serious Wong fei-hung.  Then make this movie one of the craziest and funniest movies ever and stick Wong fei-hung in the middle of it.  What you have is a very enjoyable movie.  And as much as I did like it, the music was the best part for me.  For those of you that know the OUATIC series, you know Tsui Hark was the first ones to put lyrics in a movie to the Wong fei-hung theme song.  Well then Jing Wong was the second.  Great Soundtrack.  All you people trying to stick through it all the way, please wait until the end fight 
 I teach a toddler dance program and the kids really love this CD 
 This 58mm adaptor arrived very quickly in brand-new condition, and works precisely as expected and specified. I purchased 58mm filters locally, and have no problems. I am pleased with the transaction 
 Outstanding book....a real page turner.  You will not want to or be able to put the book down.  A very enjoyable read.  Highly recommended!  
 Just as the pursuit of truth, and ones life in relation to it, is a journey that requires great effort, this book may require a similar  "keep on knocking" approach. To finally absorb this book, and I have read many on the subject, I had to read it four times. I believe that Wayne Marentette had such a long and detailed experience that it took a long detailed book to pass on the experience. This book is not for the faint of mind or heart. Some of the concepts that this book strives to explain seem to have no earthly references or vocabulary with which to comunicate them. Wayne actually coins some of his own words to get these concepts across. Each time I went throught the book, I peeled another layer of earthly mindset away, until I pretty much understood most of what he was trying to get across. I made many many reference marks for further study, and often just stopped reading to wash myself in the truth and new perceptions that were made available. I do feel that the heavenly concepts could have used better analogies to get the ideas across, but because I recevied so much at every reading, it was worth the extra effort to decipher. I could not recommned this book more highly. This book and Return from Tomorrow are books I will read yearly for many years to come. As I grow I can come back to glean more truth to apply to my life. Buy it and read a few times, it will be well worth the extra effort it requires. Gold, diamonds, and pearls are not easility obtained, but worth the endeavor 
 If you'd like to look like you are all fancy and smart then I suggest buying this book. It will give you an air of authority when the conversation inevitably turns to zen things. The chapter on swordsmanship is (as the British might say) spot on. Oh, and get you some of that sweet, sweet haiku analysis from a zenorific perspective. After you read this book you will be prepared to quickly forget all of the knowledge that the tome contained and empty your mind in the style of the zen masters. Really, you must read about the tea ceremony and consider for yourself the zenishness of setting some tea leaves in some hot water. In short, I applaud this book loudly with one hand 
 This book is a must for new owners of greys 
 My daughter likes this book a lot, and it is fun to read and look at, though she hasn't yet learned to say please and thank you 
 This book highlights a key aspect of how companies can leverage global purchasing for direct and indirect goods and services. My experience suggest that companies undervalue what goes on in the purchasing function and the potential impact of the function on the bottom line. However, most companies must use purchasing information from diverse sources to better exploit their cost saving opportunities in addition to managing suppliers smarter. This book makes a business case for targeting this opportunity 
 The discipline of intangible management (knowledge management) has been around for decades; there have been many attempts in better understanding & management of intangible assets, with different perspective (organizational learning, technology, strategy etc). Lev has provided a very concise analysis of intangible management with an economics perspective. His analysis is very systematic, robust, with support of empirical studies; his treatment of the subject is coherent & enjoyable to read. But I find the recommendation part of the book slightly weak; the 'value chain scorecard' does not provide significant enhancement over Kaplan & Norton's balanced scorecard 
 Wow!  I bought this book as a Christmas present for my husband - I haven't given it to him yet, but I love it.  Beautiful photos, arousing photos, artistic photos...  This is a wonderful book of art.  I am in absolute awe  of the beauty of the female form, and the quality of photography in the  book 
 Cars is an excellent Pixar movie. It's a car version of Thomas The Tank Engine with storyline references to Doc Hollywood, but it's easily the 2nd best Pixar movie topping Finding Nemo. The DVD has great special features such as an epilogue and the Inspiration of Cars. I enjoy the animated short films One Man Band and Mater and the Ghostlight. The folks at Pixar have done it again brining in a great story, great characters, plenty of eye-popping computer animated effects. I especially am into vehicles 
 A fine mix of new and old style country music from an fantastically talented young man with a big future. There are some reminders of Merle Haggard and George Jones with some songs and also some of Dierks' own style. My favorite songs are: Cab of my Truck, Domestic light and cold, Modern Day Drifter and Settle for a Slowdown. This album is a must for any country fan. 
 I read this book to my kindergarten class and they loved it 
 The funniest thing about this "musical within a comedy" is that the narrarator (the man in the chair) boasts how the musical (which he is presenting to the audience) isn't the greatest in the world... He explains why quite convincingly... yet makes a wonderful point about why he loves this musical and why we all love musicals... because they help us escape from the world.  Oddly enough - - no the Chaperone doesn't have the most memorable score ever written, but it gushes with such unabashed CHARM it just GROWS on you... In the end, this potentially "unremarkable" musical becomes inescapably addictive... If you are a fan of musicals, the man in the chair is the most endearing charactor to have set foot on the Broadway stage possibly EVER.   As a result, you are drawn into this musical and can't help but listen to it over and over again.   And to make things even better, the Cast Recording in itself is fun to listen to - - straight through.  Pure escapist entertainment? Yes and no...   The cast recording is genuinely funny and does have a message - - but its a fun one, and more musicals like this are needed, especially for those of us who empathize with the Man In The Chair's sentiments about Broadway today ! 
 Bought the book mostly for the spiral turning jig. Very simple solution to a complex turning problem. I intend to build it soon. Also found many other tricks will be usefull in my woodworking activities. The book is a must for routet user, those who do more than straight line routing 
 "Before You Quit Your Job" by Robert Kiyosaki is a book of advice targeted to those thinking about becoming entrepreneurs.  In my opinion, this book was definitely needed after reading Robert Kiyosaki's previous books.  This book is quite good; full of lots of little tidbits of advice.  At times however, this book seems to be disjointed almost to the point of having no flow.  I wonder if this book wouldn't have been better off as one of those 100 chapter books with each chapter focusing on one point for 1-3 pages.    Regardless, the advice presented in "Before You Quit Your Job" is solid.  The whole point of the book is to keep people thinking about the differences in thinking between entrepreneurs and employees.  My favorite quote was the "Employees focus only on their resources.  Entrepreneurs focus on opportunities regardless of their resources."  I often have found myself thinking in terms of my resources rather than opportunities, so this was an excellent piece of advice for me.  In summary, I thought this book was full of great advice.  I just wish it was organized better.  However, this book is definitely worth the read for current entrepreneurs and employees thinking about becoming entrepreneurs.  4 out of 5 stars 
 I think Fences is August Wilson's best. Much meaner than The Piano Lesson, though no less fierce in it's symbolism, depth, rawness and emotional power. Fences is Troy Maxson. In Troy Maxson is every hard scrabble, dis-respected, dis-regarded soul, whose lot in life has been given to them by fools, and who can never let up against the demons and dread of a life unfair and barely endurable. That's not to say Maxson is a downer of a guy. He's a force, and one of the toughest characters I've read in a play.  His family, made up of a younger wife, Rose, an adult child, Lyons, from a previous marriage, a teenage son, Cory, with Rose, and a battle scarred younger brother, Gabriel, all orbit around him. His presence is daunting and secure, his past is too and his struggle with a faultering home life takes all of his considerable might.  What makes Fences so good is the brilliant flowing dialogue, featuring one character after another seemingly attacking the situations they are in, full of spirit, experience and interest.  The generational divide so prevalent a story line is here, and the equally common tradition of a father and son at odds, except in perpetuating their antagonism is too.  The sins of the father have come down, been bequeathed to everyone, as have the forces of a society apathetic to unequality. A classic American play, and the best of a phenomenal writer. 
 Another winner from Kingfisher Publications!I just bought this book for my 2 year old daughter and we love it! the pictures are beautiful. The text is well thought out- it is engaging and informative but still will not overwhelm a toddler. I am going to get the rest of the books in this series in hopes that they are all as good. 
 This is the second "Remington Steele" that I have purchased, and I love it!  It is wonderful to kick back and watch such a stylish show, with its stellar cast.  All of them -- Pierce Brosnan, Stephanie Zimbalist and Doris Roberts entertain me from the time I switch on my television until I turn it off 
 Glynis' insight and knowledge of numbers is amazing!  Her new book, "Glynis Has Your Number" offers practical help regardless of your background and is a great read. She has a great gift for  applying the science of Numerology to every day life. Her expertise and personality make her the most magnetic person in the industry. I love her! She's the best!

 ...which is entertainment.  I do not rely on movies for my factual knowledge of history.  If I want the truth, I'll consult my history books.  Having said that, taken as a film meant to entertain and not educate, "Braveheart" is a masterpiece.  Mel Gibson surrounded himself with an amazing cast.  Not enough credit is given to Angus Macfadyen for his portrayal of Robert the Bruce.  He breaks my heart every time I see this movie.  His character has to live in the shades of grey that exist between Wallace and Longshank's extremes and Angus Macfadyen conveys his turmoil in a way that makes it utterly believable.   Mel Gibson has done an outstanding job at creating an emotionally engaging storyline and bringing it to life.  His entertaining movie encourages people to find out the truth about Wallace and the Scottish fight for independence.  Critics of the lack of accuracy of the movie should give him a break on that score alone.

 While I am a fan of many of Steven Halpern's work, this one is my personal favorite.I never hear the end of this CD if I play it when I'm tired or before bed. Like the title says, this music truly brings you to higher ground. It enhances and deepens meditation, and is a wonderful accompaniment to massage 
 A rare instance of a book on the topic of mind control that is neither sensational or paranoid. Scholarly, yet readable, this is a valuable book that everyone should read 
 I can read three or four Dave Barry books in a row before I need to take a break.  This is another solid hit and his fans will love it.  Highlights include the two-part "Worst Songs Ever Recorded" and the stand-out expose on a UFO situation in Gulf Breeze, Florida 
 Personal reports are the best way to silence those who are not ashamed to deny a genocide, even though it is a proven fact.  Let's read books like "Survivors" and never forget, what humans can do to other humans 
 Terry Pratchett has to be a very lucky man.  He has created his own amazing and humorous little world in which he can engross himself with tales of dragons, murderous villains and ape librarians.  He uses this world as a wonderful foil for poking hilarious and sometimes stinging observations about the world we live in and create for ourselves.  When he's done he can collect his check.  Unlike the fantasy worlds created by Tolkien, Rodenberry or Lucas, Pratchett doesn't obsess over the particulars of his creation.  There are no guides or histories one needs to reference; just a little bit of an introduction in the back of his books for beginners.  For that I was thankful, but I really didn't need the guide to appreciate the storytelling ability of Terry Pratchett.  Guards! Guards! Is a riot.  It tells the story of a man raised by dwarfs who becomes a member of the local law enforcement as that group mingles with magicians, dragons, aristocrats and the palace guards.  My only difficulty with the work was its English accent.  I suppose it's my fault for being American.  I'd recommend this work to just about anybody, and Pratchett has guaranteed himself a lifetime reader with this book. 
 Despite being a woman, I must admit that I love Marc Rudov's book. I have now read the book twice and am going through it a third time, underlining everything I want to emphasize in my head. This book has literally changed my dating life forever, completely "opening my eyes" to all the mistakes I had been making with men and clearing up some of the causes of my failed romances. There isn't another book like this one. I highly recommend The Man's No-Nonsense Guide to Women to women and men alike! 
 these are the coolest little bowls I've ever seen.  I bought them for my mom for Christmas last year, and they are extrememly useful.  I got them in tangerine, which is a very bright, sunny, orange color.  We use them for everything from cereal to candy and nut dishes.  I highly recommend these bowls 
 The Sun and the planets and all the stars revolve around the Earth, which is itself at the center of the universe. Beyond the sphere of the fixed stars is nothing; there is no void or matter or anything, as voids cannot exist in nature. All these celestial bodies that do exist revolve in nice perfect circles. All these statements were once common knowledge to anyone with a smattering of education, even though astronomers were known to make slight variations on the concepts of circular motion. But today every single one of these concepts is demolished, and only fools believe in the Earth centered universe. Why was there a change? It certainly wasn't because of a mass of new information. The old geocentric universe was rejected long before anyone put up satellites and space probes to go zipping around the solar system. Even the invention of the telescope only provided the final blow to the old system. It was a fundamental change in thinking that made up the subject of The Copernican Revolution, Thomas Kuhn's look at the break between ancient and modern thinking on the subject.  Copernicus himself made no observations. He worked only with acquired data and ancient texts. What system did he start out with? This is important, as we can't understand what changed without knowing what was. Kuhn traces the nature of the Ptolemaic system with diagrams but virtually no equations (until the technical appendix at the end) to give the reader an understanding of what sorts of phenomena caught the eyes of ancient astronomers. The Sun and Moon and stars move in their own peculiar manners, and the planets, the wandering stars, behaved in the most peculiar manner of all. The ancients developed rather sophisticated methods to track and predict these movements using their own location as a reasonable starting point. Yet Copernicus had the idea that this starting point was not properly speaking the actual center of the universe. He developed a Sun centered system that qualitatively explained many phenomena (such as retrograde motion of the planets, a notable improvement) without some of the mathematical oddities of the old system, but required so many of its own modifications for accuracy that the final system was no neater than the original.  Yet some astronomers preferred the new to the old. This was, all myth busting aside, still a dangerous idea to advocate in the midst of the Reformation. There was a subtle distinction between advocating a mathematical model and advocating a statement of physical reality. There were many reasons to reject Copernicus, and Kuhn covers them here. There are two main themes: the first is that ancient astronomy was bound up with ancient physics and with theology, and rejecting one introduced many awkward questions about the rest that intellectually honest scholars couldn't ignore. The second is political. Most people know something of the story of Galileo and his confrontations with the Inquisition. It didn't help him that he was arrogant, that he mocked powerful people he called friends, and that politically it was a bad time to make waves. This is also touched upon briefly in Kuhn, but the focus remains on the intellectual revolution, and there Galileo had much to contribute in his new observations. Ultimately, the revolution was as much about insight and vision as about calculations and observations.  Readers more familiar with Kuhn from his later The Structure of Scientific Revolutions will find some of his discussion taking a familiar tone. Indeed, the Copernican revolution fits well with that model; it was a revolutionary idea that marked a turning point in Western science, straddling both the ancient and modern viewpoints. For the reader who is willing to visualize the issues and absorb the history, Kuhn has provided the most succinct and clear explanation of Copernicus's contribution to the Western world likely to be found anywhere. 
 The Fortune-Tellers is an interesting story about a carpenter who wishes he could have more and wants to know about his future and what it holds.  He goes to a fortune teller and asks what his future holds for him.  The fortune-teller on the other hand is a fraud as you can tell just by the first thing he says.  "Rich you will surely be"..."if you earn large sums of money." This is the kind of talk that the fortune teller tells this poor, innocent carpenter. Unfortunately the carpenter buys all this and he goes back to his work.  After thinking, he wanted to know more about his future and goes back to the fortune teller to ask questions.  Waiting for him is a special twist you would've never expected.  This book is great for children 10 an under and even some adults.  It's a great African folktale teaching one about karma in a sense. 
 The Relic is a classic novel for thrill seekers that want a "can't put down" experience.  The story is fantastic in every way and includes a great twist ending.  This story also marks the debut of a host of characters which appear in other Preston/Child novels.  If you've never read Preston/Child before this is as good a place to start as any.  Curl up on the couch and get ready because you won't be doing much else until you finish the last page 
 "Hitler's Peace" revolves around what might really have transpired at the Teheran "Big Three" conference of 1943 among Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin. Much of what took place is still unknown, and there are tantalizing suggestions of plotting and intrigue in the actual historical record.   Germany was seeking a separate peace with one or another of its enemies. Each meanwhile worried about Germany's successfully doing so with someone else. And top Nazis clashed with each other over whether to make peace, as they also jockeyed for present or postwar position. Hovering over all of this is emerging knowledge about atrocities including the Holocaust, the Katyn massacre in Poland and Soviet treatment of German POWs after Stalingrad. This makes great fictional fodder, and Philip Kerr delivers with a maelstrom of intrigue.   Kerr, author of the very fine "Berlin Noir" trilogy of detective stories set in Nazi and postwar Germany, centers the action here on Willard Mayer, an American professor now with the OSS and detailed first to do some research on Katyn for Roosevelt, and later to accompany him to the conference. Mayer discovers their entourage has been penetrated by a German agent.   Mayer has a politically checkered past. Descended from German society on one side, he moves easily into high Nazi circles and works with the German Abwehr in the late 1930s, but only after his philosophical leanings have already brought him into Communist circles in the early 1930s in Vienna, leading him to the Soviet NKVD. And then he chucks it all in short order to move back to the States and, within a few years, get spotted by the OSS.   Is that all clear? It seems unlikely that an American would so effortlessly rise up into a sensitive Nazi position. And in the real world, the NKVD, having enlisted him, would never let him quit so blithely; Stalin's spies would have hunted him down. And the OSS, meanwhile, sends him to the Oval Office with no idea of any of this?  Kerr, with his detective story background, writes Mayer in a first-person private-eye mold, sometimes Philip Marlowe, sometimes Nick and Nora Charles, all wisecracks and martinis. But he's not consistent with it. Meanwhile much of the story is related through other characters' eyes, without the "lishen-shweetheart" style at all, and it's jarring to go back and forth. Nor does it seem to go with the more fateful World War II subject matter. Kerr casts Mayer variously as an elbow-patched philosophy professor, the author of a musty and difficult book; as a swinging sophisticate, as a jilted lover, as a conscience-driven man of action, as an intelligence agent who successfully turns the Abwehr-NKVD-OSS trifecta, none of them the wiser. There are too many ingredients in this cocktail and Kerr never really gets them all to blend.  He's better in his personalization of American leaders like Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins. And best of all is his treatment of Axis bigwigs like Schellenberg, Canaris, Hitler, von Ribbentrop and particularly Himmler. No one writes Nazis in English like Kerr does.  His plot, whirling to a startling climax in Teheran, keeps you guessing until the last page. And he admirably includes - I wish more intrigue writers did this - an afterword noting the many unexplained anomalies of the Teheran conference that might open the door to Kerr's tantalizing scenario. I'm docking him a star for his problems writing Mayer, but the history he brings to bear and the plot he synthesizes out of it are otherwise great reading for the World War II fiction buff. 
 I am a big fan of Nora Roberts.  I love the ones that she writes with a touch of magick in them, and this time she delivers in a big way -- witches, vampires, shift-shaper, time travelers, and of course, romance.  This is the first of a triology centering around Hoyt, a wizard, and his vampire brother Cian.  They are brought together by Morrigan, the pagan goddess of war.  She gives them a mission -- save the world from Lilith, a 2,000 year old vampire who just happens to be Cian's sire.  She tells Hoyt that he must gather four more to complete the circle of heroes who will travel to Geall, another world where they will do battle with Lilith and her army of vampires.  They have a very short time to train and prepare for this war which will take place on Samhain, the pagan name for the present day Halloween.  Hoyt meets his true love, Glenna, in modern day New York City.  She is a witch with tremendous power.  Together they prove to be an indomitable foe of the vamps.  Usually Roberts centers her stories around the romance, but this time, it is more about the situation that they are in.  The first book is mostly about how the group comes together and how they prepare for the mission given them.  I grew a little bored when they were training and such, and that is the only reason I gave this book a four instead of five stars.  I would have liked a little more character development for each of them.  I didn't seem to connect with Hoyt as much as I usually do with the heroes of a Roberts book.  I really liked the description of Glenna's spells, and her belief system.  She prefers the safety of a circle when casting her spells, and Roberts does a good job of describing her magick and the dangers of mis-using your powers.  Being Wiccan and a practicing witch, I am appreciative of how Roberts is careful of how she presents the craft and the old religion.    My daughter is reading the second one, and tells me that it is really good, too.  Hey, how can you go wrong with a book by Nora Roberts?  
 Press, who attended seminary and is well versed in Biblical scripture, hits the nail on the head with his detailed descriptions of how the religious right has used religion to manipulate Republican voters and to try to convince people that being a Democrat is a sin.  Press points out in a calm, literate way how the Republicans have tried to corner religion and what we can do to take it back.  He cites biblical scripture that evangelists use to put their spin on topics and explains what the verses really mean.  (Granted, you can put 50 ministers in a room with one verse of scripture and you will get 50 different interpretations.)  Topics included here range from abortion to stem cell research to homosexuality to the war in Iraq.  There are several more relevent topics covered.  This book is a good tool that Democrats can use to combat right wingers who cite scripture to promote an agenda of intolerance.  It gives plenty of Bible verses, and will allow you the knowledge to stand up and say, "I think the Bible meant this when it says this..."  I liked the hardcover title better, "How the Republicans Stole Christmas," but I think more people will take it seriously with the new paperback title.  This is a very relevent book to read and it contains useful information to remember considering the times we live in 
 There is not one single song on the whole CD that you will not be singing. It is simply one of those rare finds that you end up listening to without skipping a track.  This is a mood alterning CD...you simply can't listen to it and stay in a bad mood.    
 EM Forster's A Passage to India is, at first, a challenging book to digest.  A study in contrasts: Indian and British, Moslem and Hindu, male and female, it offers one final contrast to the reader: near boredom and high intrigue. It is as if Forster intentionally brought his audience to the brink of apathy before springing the event of magnitude upon them.  Startled from languour, Adela Quested's misfortune in the Marabar Caves becomes more pressing, more imminent, more real.  Aziz, the hapless facilitator, finds himself accused of a nefarious plot and, from there, the plausibility of British colonialism is explored in microcosm.  Sluggish for fully one half of the book and paced expertly in the other, A Passage to India is an ambivalent reading experience that provides, perhaps, more of the colonial experience than we first assume.  Given time, we recognize that an indolent, entrenched bureacracy jolted from routine suits the pace of this book to a tee.  I prefer Kipling's Kim when it comes to novels of the British Raj, though, on the whole, I found Forster's "Passage" a very worthy read. 4 stars. 
 This book is fanatastic and a wonderful departure from the typical weight loss book.  The women who contributed are courageous, witty and insightful. As I read this book, I recognized myself in so many of the chapters, but I did not have the eloquence to express myself in the same manner 
 I found the book to be very informative and a definite buy for those wanting protect their servers. The need to have a source to assist in securing our busness' servers is tremendous in this era of hacking. This is a must buy 
 Pay no attention to some of the moronic blowhards gracing you with their vaunted opinions. Simply click the buttons up in the sample section and listen for yourself. Myself, I haven't enjoyed a CD as much as I enjoyed this one since Toy Matinee. I can't tell whether it's good music or bad music. But, I can tell you I love it 
 I bought one of these about two or three years ago and love it.  It still works great and has a terrific sound for such an inexpensive and small unit. It has a built-in equalizer and power booster which gives you a nice selection of different effects, such as cranking up the base and just more volume without getting a tinny quality to the music. There are selections for pop, jazz, rock, classical, etc.  The only negative things I can say about it is that occasionally it skips and gets stuck when playing a CD much like the old phonographs with needles would do. This does not happen very often though and perhaps it is not the machine but a CD that has not been taken care of properly.  Also, it can be a little complicated figuring out how to turn it on and getting the CD to start to play because there are so many buttons. Keep the user guide handy. Overall, though I think it is a great little boombox and would purchase it again. I would rate it 4.5 stars.  
 Pros: Good FM reception good remote functionality value for money  Cons: build qaulity seems to be fragile, it still intact for me. Eqaulizer button is too small to be usable. both ipod dock connector and head phone jack come from the bottom, it would have been better if headphone jack comes out of the to 
 Following A Day At The Races, New Of The World was a change in style. Harder and less experimental than previous efforts, Queen had settled into and anthem rocking style that would see them as one of the best ever live bands. This album was the start of that. It was also the start of John and Roger offering more tracks than their previous one track per album - in most cases.  1.	We Will Rock You was an accidental hit and is one of Queen's signature tunes and perhaps the most recognizable. 2.	We Are The Champions is another anthem rocker. A great song but not up with their best. 3.	Sheer Heart Attack is a great track. Fast and frenzied it's one of Queen's best. Perhaps let down by the whining guitar solo. 4.	All Dead, All Dead is a Brian song and one of the highlights from the album. 5.	Spread Your Wings is a John written song and one of Queen's worst single releases. 6.	Fight From The Inside is a Roger track and one of his lesser songs. 7.	Get Down Make Love is a good track. Not a highlight but has its qualities. 8.	Sleeping On The Sidewalk is another Brian song. It's an OK song but a lesser track. 9.	Who Needs You is one of Queen's worst tracks. It's another John song and is his second misfire on this album. Too soft and corny. 10.	It's Late is one of Queen's best. It rocks hard and long. 11.	My Melancholy Blues is a Freddie gem. A great closer to a hit and miss album.  News Of The World was a change for Queen and while it heralded some classics, there are almost as many forgettable numbers here. The middle tracks are among Queen's poorest offerings.   Ranking wise, it's below A Night At The Opera, above Hot Space.  
 I never saw the Marvel Comics book so I knew absolutely nothing about this character Frank Castle. I rented the movie because I just love John Travolta. Thomas Jane is quite the studly tough man here, but is completely believable. He broods so handsomely throughout the rest of the film. His character is tormented by the deaths of his family and he is out to seek "punishment" not revenge as he calls it. Travolta is fun as the sneering villian and you can tell he really enjoyed his role. He's not an out-right bad villian, but becomes so after the death of one of his twin sons. Yeah ladies, check out the handsome actor playing his twin sons. Plus, he's got one beautiful but vindictive wife in gorgeous Laura Harring. It's a shame that her character was not better developed and had more to do than stand around in sexy outfits. It would have been fun to see her more actively involved in hunting down Castle. Overall, I enjoyed the film as a great action film 
 OMG it couldn't be better. The music is relaxing and seductive at the same time. It is the type of music you can play during a perfect romantic dinner, or the one that you can play while you are working and not get distracted. The guitars are just awesome 
   Sickly fascinating.  A perfectly normal girl living the life and her world spirals into hell.  So easily with so little resistance all of her friends and even family turn on her so that they may benefit.  Jesus.  Definitely a keeper.  I'm still sick to my stomach 
 I was most impressed with this book - the neat layout, the methodical approach of dealing with each film, the lavish screenshots and the impressive knowledge the author has of his subject. Most of all however, i really appreciated the way in which Richie makes absolutely clear all his ideas - even to a reader who had very little knowledge of cinematography or film criticism like myself. This is not to say the content of this book is simple, moreover it is presented in a way which anyone can understand. Richie's style is refreshingly fluid and jargon-free which makes the book very easy to read, unlike many  critical volumes which are verbose and long-winded. There are many films in this book which i have still not seen, but it has really sparked my interest in Kurowasawa and his films. If you wish to obtain a concise but thorough grounding in the critical ideas relating to this brilliant directors work, then this book is ideal for you 
 "The Incredibles", together with "Finding Nemo", "Shrek 1 & 2", "Madagascar" and the "Spy Kids" series, certainly mark a turning point in terms of animated moviemaking. Particularly The Incredibles is a movie no kid (or adult as well) will ever get tired of watching. As for the plot... it is just plainly great. Things have been kind of boring for superheroes since they have been forced to give up their superpowers and adopt a conventional lifestyle. But everything will change for Mr. Incredible and his family when an interesting business proposal will ultimately make him wear his superhero suit again for an exciting new job. My kids just love this movie (and so do I! 
 I bought the 3.5 x 5.5 ruled pocket version. By my standards, the best notebook I've ever used. The perfect size for my jacket or pocket. Acid free paper for long-term archival storage of my notes. Good to use an acid free ink for even longer storage (gel ink pens do not work well with the Moleskine's paper though). Looks professional, and I get a lot of nice comments about it. Much easier to use than turning on my PDA and slowly typing in notes with my thumbs. I also really like the fact that it will open completely flat on a table for easier note writing and reading. When this one is full, I plan to buy another. Price is higher than most, but with this Moleskine, you pay for the quality 
 I saw this movie when I was 11, now I'm in my 30's and it still invokes wonder.  I also have always loved the humor of this tale.  I love seeing Fred Savage become interested in the story as his grandfather(Peter Falk) reads it to him.  It makes me nostalgic because my own grandparents and parent read to me when I was sick.   I love Mandy Patinkin and Andre the Giant in this movie primarily because their characters seem the most vivid and passionate.  It remains as one of my favorite storybook movies 
 The sword looks better in reality than in the picture. It was suprisingly cool. It arrived on time. No problems here 
 'The Thirty-Nine Steps' would probably have faded into obscurity if it was for the success of Alfred Hitchcock's film adaptation.  It is a very short novel, barely a hundred pages.  Not enough space to beef up the prose or the characterizations.  John Buchan is clearly more of a storyteller than a writer.  But in 'The Thirty-Nine Steps' he does spin a nice little story.  The story is set in Britain just before the first WW I broke out.  A bachelor in London is confronted by a man 'with a secret', one involving spies and nationality security.  When the man is found murdered our bachelor is wrongfully suspected.  He flees to both escape the law and carry forward with the murdered man's mission, again involving national security.  The story takes us from Scotland to the English south coast.  Lots of uncanny coincidences make this story wholely unbelievable.  Yet I found myself reading through this near manic-paced story with great interest ... and almost childish enjoyment.  So this is an over-the-top story told with delicious urgency and zest.  Fans of Ian Fleming (..James Bond novels) will find 'The Thirty-Nine Steps' to be dated, tame (no sex, little violence), but otherwise enjoyable 
 This is a  selection of the works of women writers from medieval times.  There is an introductory essay about each woman followed by extracts from their works.  The book provides a good overview of secular and religious works and is an excellent source book for those studying medieval women 
 Anjani sings these songs like they're a part of her life.  She has a beautiful contralto and perfect phrasing for these lyrics.  And the backing music (mainly piano and drums, played by her) is subtle and tasteful -- not too bland, not too intrusive -- just right.  Quite unlike most of Leonard Cohen's own albums, though you can sort of imagine Leonard's voice in the background.  I wish she and Leonard would redo 2000's "Ten New Songs": Sharon Robinson was good as a backup singer but marred it with her incredibly cheesy synthesiser accompaniments... 
 Book was in good shape, however I was surprised by all the highlighting... expected less highlighting 
 Anything that can inspire MatronsApron to write a song about it must be of some merit. A compelling series of mystery stories, each with its own type of clanicity 
 There are not enough words in Webster's Dictionary to describe all the feelings one experiences while reading this book.   Its hero, suprisingly, is Union Cavalry general John Buford, who is the first to ride into Gettysburg in July 1, 1863. If not for his brilliantly executed defense-in-depth of Gettysburg and the surrounding heights on that first day, the Union army would have lost that battle, and probably the war shortly thereafter. This book is worth reading just to learn about Buford, who is almost never historically recognized for his role in the battle, and who mysteriously disappears from the battle after day one 
 This encyclopedia is a powerful resource for everyone. It's my first stop for treating a condition. With all of the harmful side effects of drugs and the state of health care in America, it's nice to know that someone like Dr. Null has taken the time to research and gather all of this information in one - easy to use -place. It makes a great present for anyone you love and care for 
 I homeschool my son who is in the 5th grade, and I started in October.  Compared to the work he was doing in public school he's done much better work at home.  With this book, his grammar greatly improved.  I only gave it 4 stars because he completed it in two months.  I expected it to last a complete school year, but maybe it was because he was able to concentrate better at home and he was able to understand the book better.   Each page he was able to complete at 100% accuracy, where he was having quite a bit of trouble in public school.  I highly recommend this book for any homeschooler, or any parent who would like to substitute or have extra help for their child that needs help with Grammar, it is easy to follow and understand.  The answers are in the back of the book, so any of us parents who have forgotten some of our grammar like pronouns, and adverbs, or other things like that, don't have to worry about corrections, they are all there.  It's a good book 
 Just the book I was waiting for.  Perfect for Mother's Day.  Wonderful stories.  Something for everyone 
 Excellent and neutral analysis with accuracy and clarity. Helps thinking about future of CSR professionnals. 
 For those who are ready, this book can be your launching pad. I found it enlightening and incredibly empowering. Ryan allows his passion to fully shine through and after reading Zero to One Million I have been inspired to find mine in life. I've always wanted to make a difference in our world, and Ryan beautifully articulates how that time is now. He truly grasps how our world is rapidly changing and reveals that is an emerging minority of young entrepreneurs that will make this change in the coming years.

 I highly recommend this sub to anyone looking for a great value in home theater.  I did so much research and reading before buying this Venue 12, and had almost talked myself out of getting it because of some saying that 'if you can't spend X amount then don't even bother', and the X amount just kept getting higher and higher.  I wound up moving my older JBL PB10 into my computer room to anchor my upgraded computer sound system and put the new Venue 12 in the living room with my 'big' system.  The 10 inch sub was great and very solid for what I paid for it, but the 12 has more depth and definition.  I think that there is an effortless quality to the sound that a 12 inch or bigger driver can reproduce that a 10 inch just can't.  Big solid sound, and I don't feel like I was extravagant with the purchase.  The Venue 12, like my older PB10, feels well made and solid.  I especially like the feet on it, as they are big and heavy and 'rubbery' and help it sit very stably on my uneven hardwood floor.  The controls and jacks feel very smooth and solid when making connections.  To me, the design and build quality makes it feel like an inexpensive model from a high end manufacturer, rather than a top-end model from a cheap one 
 I've only recently discovered Jon Waters' movies. I had seen Pink Flamingos last year and loved it. Now, within the last 2 months I have purchased 5 of the movies in this collection as well as the Divine Trash documentary. I will only review the films i have seen (i have not seen Pecker or Hairspray) 1. Pink Flamingos-this movie is absolutely hilarious and is the best in this collection. Waters could not have cast a more perfect group of people-Divine, Mink Stole, Mary V. Pearce, Danny Mills, David Lochary and the unforgettable Edith Massey are all brilliant in their roles as dysfunctional perverts and freaks. The plot is very simple, the sets are simple...but the film is great. watch it with friends! [A+]  2. Female Troube-comes oh so close to being #1. This was the perfect follow-up to Pink Flamingos. It's not as gross though (which isn't saying a lot, it still has it's uneasy moments!). Divine gives a better performance this time around and Mink is priceless as Taffy. The scene with Divine in her see-through wedding dress had me howling on the floor. This is Waters' second best film. [A+]  3. Desperate Living-I had my reservations before seeing this one since Divine is not in it, but it turned out to be really good as well. I'm almost tempted to say that this one is even more gross than Pink Flamingos! It has a lot of laughs, although i do have some criticisms. The Mole characted was really annoying to me, I don't think Susan Lowe should have played the part. Also, the penis-cutting scene was a bit over the top. But on the better side, Mink Stole deserved an Academy Award for the performance, Jean Hill was a brilliant addition to the Waters gang, and Mary Vivian and Edith Massey were great, as always.Third best Waters film. [A]  4. Polyester-This is considered Waters' "transitional" film from underground to mainstream. It was a little more conventional, but still had enough of an edge to be considered a true Waters film, especially with the return of Divine. Honestly though, it wasn't as good as the previous three films. It had some good moments but it kind of dragged on a little bit. I also wish Mary Vivian would have been featured a lot more. [B-]  5. Dirty Shame-I was looking forward to this one since it was heralded as Waters' return to his nasty roots, but it just wasn't that good. Sorry to say it, but Waters' best days were in the late 60's and 70's. I barely even laughed through this one. I really don't see how it was even rated NC17, it didn't even come close to the filth from his 70's movies. [D+]  I recommend that you just buy the Trash trio: Pink Flamingos, Female Troube and Desperate Living-those are the 3 best he's ever done and ever will do. Cemented in stone as the Filthiest Movies Alive 
 This is the first Robert B. Parker novel I have read and I throughly enjoyed it. The main character is a private detective who is both intelligent and resourceful but has a pleasantly sarcastic/cheeky side. Parkers ability to tell a story without making it too detail-saturated and drawn out made for an enjoyable reading experience. I plan on picking up some more of his work and urge you to do the same 
                Hello, fans of Tangerine Dream!  I will reveal the mystery of Russian words in "Kiev Mission"! Of course, I like the album because of this track. The humour of TD is the following: for English or German speaking listener these words sounds as spoken by Russian girl, while for Russian listeners (girl speaks-whispers-sings with the strong foriegn acsent) it sounds as Russian words spoken by friendly foreigner. The words are the following:  Continents Asia, Africa, Europe, Australia, America It`s - the Earth Past tense Present tense Future tense  World is we are  To understand To ask To answer To talk To start thinking Transmission...  To associate (to communicate) with the friends... To exchange opinions... Infinity An intelligent being Talking, dialog Continents: Asia, Africa, Europe, Australia, America It`s all - the Earth.  As you see there were nothing poltical in these words. Only idea of global unity which is close to people of different countries. I think that Russian words were choosen because they sounded exotic for the Western ear and beacuase of their rhythm.  By the way, electronic music by TD and Jarre was popular in the USSR in time of cold war... And still is popular in Russia. As to cold war itself - We lived the same normal usual every-day life as you but with our own problems. For the people in the state which lost more than 20 million lives in the 2WW - nearly every family lost its relatives - every talk and wish of possibility of new world war was a kind of sacrilege. And Chrustchev didn`t told: "We will bury you". He spoke vulgar Russian-Ukrainian slang, so English translation was complete fake (the meaning was lost in translation). He meant that (in his humble opinion:) USSR will win competition with America and would show much better results of development. So don`t think of political stupidity of the cold war - simply enjoy the music!  Also I recommend you best albums by TD: Le Parc (1985) Underwater Sunlight (1986) Goblin`s Club (1996) Try also "Jeanne D`Arc" (2005) and interesting solo albums by former TD members (though music differs from TD sound still it`s dynamic and interesting): Christopher Franke "The London Consert" (1992) and "Celestine Prophesy" (1996), Paul Haslinger "World Without Rules" (1996).  
 BeBe gets wined and dined and cleaned out by a man she was falling for. Now she wants revenge. Only it takes money to get revenge. Or does it? This story had me laughing and rooting on our revenge team. It just kept getting better and better. Who could ask for more?  This book is a bit long, but it sure didn't seem like it. I couldn't put it down and it won't be my last by this wonderful author! Thanks for the laughs 
 The Cobra Event is fiction, but as other reviewers have said, entirely plausible.  Richard Preston writes with great authority on the topic of bioterrorism, yet he also knows how to tell a good story, and that's always important to me because I read for pleasure as much as for information.    The reason that this novel is entirely believable is that Preston is able to inbue his characters with genuine humanity and likability.  From the first page, when lovely young Kate is infected, the characters and the plot line grabbed me.  After that, I read like a demon, and found myself trying to steal time from other activities just to get to "a good stopping place."  And, of course, there is no really good stopping place because with a plot this captivating all you want to do is read until the end.  And then, when the end is reached, you feel let down because there is no more to read!  [One word to the squeamish -- the autopsy scenes are grisly and occur more than once, so if you can't take CSI-style blood and guts, this book may not be for you.]    But for me, this novel is 5 stars all the way.  Great for airplane or vacation reading too, and much better than the usual, ho-hum paperback about serial killers.  Now I've got to go out and pick up The Hot Zone 
 It was interesting seeing Henry Fonda in Immortal Sergeant.  He was young when he played the part of this combat soldier in this movie.  I know years later he played in other war movies like Battle of the Bulge and Midway.       
 Best of its ilk, The Rainmaker surpasses most legal thrillers without a doubt. A quick read; start to finish a great novel. This book as defiantly started me on Grisham saga, that won't end until I've read all his books. I highly recommend this to any one who has any remote interest in the law, or just reading in general. A 
 You should give this book to anyone considering a career in newspaper journalism. If the person still decides to go into journalism, you know he or she is dedicated and belongs in the business!  With both anecdotes and detailed numbers and charts, Meyer describes the 'harvesting' of media properties in the 80's, 90's and beyond. Just as a landowner can harvest trees that have grown over many years, a publisher can pull out greater profits by reducing the expenses that produced quality and reputation over many years (like reducing the number and quality of reporters and editors).   Thus, this book is the equivalent of a VH1 'behind the scenes' docudrama explaining in painful detail the travesties we all saw in 80's and 90's newspaper management. Just as the rock band members look like heck by the end of an episode, newspapers are showing the effects of abusing their bodies. A carefully explained survey and analysis show that as many as three out of five newspaper stories are inaccurate in one form or another (Meyer's descriptions of this whole subject are considerably nuanced and a joy for anyone who has tried to quantify newspaper accuracy).   Much of the talk about journalism, quality and respect has been very fuzzy. We used to say stories were 'good' or 'bad' based on whatever was the criteria of the biggest editor in the room. We had no idea where individual stories or overall patterns of story quality fit into the newspaper's future. Meyer has detailed chapters quantifying whatever can be established about the role of profit and accuracy, profit and and credibility, and profit and the role of the various kinds of editors. To give just one example of the helpful level of detail in the book, Meyer writes that trouble may ensue once copy editors manage more than 14 stories a shift. That and other statistics will be useful for anyone who wants to manage for quality and growth.  The good news is that there is at least some connection between quality and profit. As just one example, an analysis in the book shows that for every percentage point of gain of credibility in the community, newspapers seem to command 2.5 percent more in their asking price for advertising.  That sort of thing matters because newspapers compete with targeted advertising vehicles like Google and blogs and standalone classified advertising sites. For most people, the newspaper is more portable; but that's a temporary advantage. Long term, what will distinguish papers from other advertising vehicles is the public's belief that newspapers are a more useful place to spend attention. Meyer's thesis is that newspapers must embrace this thirst for credible information. Newspapers must manage for both credibility AND for profit.  But keeping newspapers afloat with any sort of quality will be difficult. When everyone seems to focus on quarterly earnings reports, it's not easy to manage with long-term quality AND profitability in mind. So that's why I suggest giving this book to someone contemplating a future in journalism. Perhaps this book will prove to be as true about the future as it is true about the past. If so, the young journalist can go into work with eyes open and brain brightly illuminated. 
 I too have heard "Possibility" at the menu on another dvd. Or maybe it was "tardiness"..one of them plays while the other dvd waits for you to make a selection....Anyone know which other dvd it is 
 I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW JUST AFTER WRITING A REVIEW OF JACK KEROUAC'S ON THE ROAD. AND BASICALLY FOR THE SAME REASON. I HAVE JUST READ A REVIEW OF A BOOK TALKING ABOUT THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF HOWL AND ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON AMERICA. THAT AUTHOR'S ARGUMENT IS HOW THE POEM CHANGE AMERICA. SINCE WE LIVE IN AN AGE OF HYPERBOLE I WILL LET THAT IDEA GO BY. HOWEVER, IN EVERY LITERARY, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL WAY HOWL IS AN INTERESTING POEM AND WORTH WHILE READING.  LIKE ON THE ROAD I DID NOT READ HOWL ORIGINALLY UNTIL ABOUT 1971 SO, AS I POINTED OUT IN THE KEROUAC REVIEW, THE EFFECT WAS NOT AS ELECTRIC AS IT MUST HAVE BEEN ON 1950'S AUDIENCES, ESPECIALLY THAT FIRST ONE IN SAN FRANSCISCO. BUT ANY POEM THAT STARTS OUT - I SAW THE BEST MINDS OF MY GENERATION.... WILL ALWAYS GET MY ATTENTION.  I BELIEVE THAT BEYOND THE THE POLITICAL/SOCIAL MESSAGE GINSBERG WAS TRYING TO GET ACROSS THE POEM HAS GREAT MERIT AS  LITERATURE IN THE MODERN AGE. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE GINSBERG'S LATER POLITICAL /SOCIAL VISIONS GOT A LOT CLOUDIER AND DIFFUSE. CERTAINLY NO WHERE NEAR THE CLARITY OF HOWL ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE EFFECTS OF INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY ON THE INDIVIDUAL. HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT FROM A LITERARY STANDPOINT IT WILL COMPARE VERY, VERY FAVORABLY WITH WHITMAN IN THE AMERICAN PANTHEON.  AND THAT IS HIGH PRAISE, INDEED.     
 I am going to refer to the original text version written by Adam Smith: This was absolutely a brutal read; however, it was more or less a paradox described as painfully interesting. The mind of Adam Smith is incredible, and I encourage an interested reader to duke it out as you'll most certainly come out of the book more informed. I would recommend Wealth of Nations to anyone who has a mild interest in Economics.  Brian Ole 
 If you want to understand the background of U.S. involvement in the Middle East and South Asia, get a copy of Ghost Wars.  Scholarly writing backed up by heaps of footnotes and sources, Coll is exceptionally readable and the material is gripping.  Don't listen to current media and admininstration rhetoric without understanding the past 
 Granted the movie is very different from the book...but that's to be expected because books are always 100x more detailed than what can be allowed for a movie. HOWEVER they do a very good job at trying to keep as much as they could and keep the story strong. I know some people are Jane Austin purists and don't like this movie because it's not exactly like the book. My advice to them is to STOP WATCHING MOVIES! They're probably more resentful that a movie version was made to begin with because naturally not everything makes it into the movie. I have read the book and I still love this movie.  I wasn't sure about seeing it, but I am a fan of Keira Knightley and figured I'd give it a watch as friends recommended it. Well I fell in love with the movie and bought it off of Amazon and I've watched it at least 20 times (that's probably a conservative figure). The story is beautiful, the cast is full of great actors, the scenes are well executed. I'm a HUGE fan of Keira now, she did great.  Great movie...highly recommend for anyone with at least a little romantic spirit in them. : 
 Though it looks quite old fashioned to-day, it is full of sound advice that ar untemporal and international ... Hints are so well related to our human nature that you will appreciate this book whether you are chinese or  from Albion (Michigan), the most beautiful small college in the world 
 While I love the content and the overall idea, it seems they seriously skimped on the packaging. All you get, outside of the outer box, is a cd in a paper envelope. No jewel case, book, insert, etc.......perhaps it's on the cd 
 The Ordo Dracul book was a great read all around.  Gave you a look into those that search for the "Great Works" and life beyond vampirism.  With the new Coils and secretive subsect "Sworns" and new bloodlines, it is a great book.  Definately a good read for those just interested in the covenent or wanting to play a Dragon character 
     The Firm is a very interesting book that will grab you from the very beginning and keeps you going until the very end. Mitch McDeere is fresh out of college with his law degree from Harvard accompanied by his loving wife, Abby. Mitch is recieving tons of job offers because he was ranked third in his class at Harvard. After careful consideration mitch decides to take a job in Memphis that pays a lot of money. What both Mitch and Abby thought was a god law firm turned out to be the place that could ruin their lives. They haved to perservere and try to secretly get out of this law firm without being killed. They are very upset with their decision to work at this law firm but will do anything to get out of this very mysterious firm.      I thought that this was perhaps one of the best books that I've ever read. This book had me reading from cover to cover as soon as I started reading. I just wanted to keep on reading more because it was so suppenseful and I wanted to find out what happened next. I thought that this was a good writing technique because he keeps you reading from front to back. All in all I thought this was a great book and would suggest it to anyone who likes reading suspenseful, on the edge of your seat books. 
 This book is a compilation of nine mysteries involving that likeable sleuth Gordianus the Finder. They are all new stories and anyone who is a fan of Saylor will certainly want to add this book to their collection.   Steven Saylor is right up there with a number of excellent authors who use the backdrop of Ancient Rome as a canvas for their literary works. It is a period of history that holds a particular magic for me, so basically I cannot get enough of them, excellent, good or mediocre. I would certainly put Saylor's books in the excellent category and although in the main not a great lover of short stories, in this case I am more than happy to make an exception 
 More men should read feminist texts.  The world would be a much better place....hopefully.  I'm a man, and I love books by Bell Hooks, Adrienne Rich and Alice Walker 
 An immigrant child's inside view of his own terrifying world is at the heart of this book. The author uses a stream-of- consciousness technique and creates a unique English Yiddish poetic language through which the world is seen. The child's relation to his distant father, the cruelty the child suffers is movingly portrayed .So too his encounters with the world , search for love, meetings with women.  The pains of an immigrant world, of trying to find one's way in a strange land, are also vividly portayed here.  True literature burns through every line of this work. 
 This was my first Andreas Scholl CD, I purchased it immediately after  hearing it played in a store.  From the first listen over a year ago until  now it still profoundly affects me.  Alternatingly slow and brooding to  more uptempo, the beautiful music and haunting voice are the perfect  accompaniment to those moments of pensive introspection 
 Concise, clear and through view of the inner and outer working environment of an aviators life. Very well researched and documented in an easy to understand format, no technojargon to confuse the novice.  Required reading  for any current or aspiring commercial pilots, and a must have for industry  safety affiliates. Good use of informative and entertaining illustrations  and graphs, not stuffy or boring. Up to date with current technology and  encompasses history as well.  This is an excellent book 
 All I can say is WOW!!!  This book is very well done, the pictures are so clear and colorful.  A great book for beginners or professional trainers. Each trick is detailed with easy to follow instructions.   I have been a trainer for 30 years and have never found a book like this one! I am just very impressed!   Kudos to Kyra Sundance and her performing dog, Chalcy! Debbie Abbenante Action Pets US 
 The Vienna Hazelnut Waltz flavor is a delightful change when I'm looking to put some pizzazz into my day.  The flavor is delightful and not too strong.  
 Billie Holiday struck a chord that hasn't really been properly addressed in song since.the Lynchings&Blood still get my full attention.in fact it still happens in some places.this Book needs more exposure.Race is Being  tuned out except when their are Beat downs&other things.a Book Like  this will keep your full attention.very Powerful.you can never speak enough  on the subject or the Impact of Lady Day's Words 
 You Must read this book if you are in or thinking of going in to your own business. Get your mindset right on what you are going into in small business and what is possible. This is not a guide on what to do. It is the concepts of what goes wrong and what needs to happen for you to get it right.  Essential for the small business owner and anyone studying business 
 Although some of the dialogue is rather shallow, I really enjoyed reading this story.  Yes, he is a little preachy, and having senior staff in the department of homeland security neatly sum up the geo-political environment for the reader is rather annoying.  Yet I had a very good time reading this story.  I enjoyed the romantic tension between Alex Ford and Kate Adams, and I was very excited by the prospect of a certain someone having a family reunion with a child thought dead.  Balducci is excellent at controlling pace and keeping lots of variety and tension up in the air.  When a book is that well paced, it's easy to overlook some incredible dialogue.  The accent of the Russian Adelphia was terrible, but oh well.  This is the first Baldacci book I've read, and when I'm ready for moderately smart, somewhat unrealistic but exciting fiction, I'll definitely read him again--especially while on travel.    I've lived in the DC area five years, and his geography's a little incredible--particulary one afternoon where the club strolls from the Smithsonian metro to the FDR monument but still not finding privacy there, ends up at Stone's "home" so they can chat.  That's a trip that would take all day and night (let alone an afternoon walk).  DC's like Las Vegas...objects appear much closer than they actually are.  I really don't expect a life altering or profound experience when I pick up a thriller.  As such, it had great action and thought-provoking "fictional facts" about modern anti-terrorism and espionage, in general.  It made me really want to visit the Library of Congress 
 Every once in a while a little book comes along that, while small in size, carries sufficient intellectual weight to strike the body politic between the eyes, thereby getting its collective attention. This may be one such book. It offers a realistic look at megaprojects - those major infrastructure endeavors that span vast bodies of water, dam natural resources to generate energy and extend rail lines to previously unreachable regions - and compares the promises of these projects to what they actually deliver. The report card isn't very good. Cost overruns are typically 25% to 100%, and sometimes 200% or more. Worse yet, studies show that the public tends to use megaprojects - be they airports or subway systems - only a fraction of the amount predicted. We strongly recommends this book to politicians, legislators and anyone who wants to know the truth behind these huge infrastructure projects, as well as to CEOs, CFOs, project managers and risk officers in the private sector - this applies to your projects, even if there is a difference of scale 
 The person who wrote the review for Amazon has no idea what this film is all about and sadly compares this work of true genius to other films or seems to put it in some catorgory that does not exsist.  This film is ONLY for people who have gone clubbing and enjoyed all the 'treats' that go with that life!  For people who work 9 - 5 and live for the week end.  Enjoy 
 This is an excellent book. My grandson is 7 but due to circumstances is not reading yet.  He loves anything to do with knights and this is a wonderful book for him.  The pictures are delightful.  As an adult I loved the humor of the pictures 
 I learned some great new things about nutrition, food combining, digestion & more. After 8 weeks on the program(eating raw at Breakfast & Lunch & a healthy dinner including cooked fish or meat) I feel so much better, my digestion/intestinal sluggishness is GONE and I lost 2 sizes. Wow 
 I liked the book, HH talked about what are the causes of sorrow.. like... anger, sexual misconduct, etc. And we can eventually control out inner enemy.. by just adhering to his advice. You know sometimes we cannot control thoughts... as to thoughts control us... I found the 4th chapter very informative..and Appendix chapter.. which says Compassion is Key to everything.. It was basically juice for the book for me. I have to confess that I didn't understand the concept of emptiness.. and how that compares to Liberation..maybe in down the line I will.. And sometimes vocabulary for me for little out there.. but Hey that is how we learn. = 
 Brumberg's work details the changes in cultural constructions of the adolescent body in the twentieth century, focusing on how young women create, maintain, and alter body images (and ultimately, body shapes/appearances).  I use this book as the first monograph assignment in my introduction to women's studies course.  Although the book has a strong theoretical framework, the descriptive examples in the chapters help to facilitate discussion in the class, which really sets the tone for the rest of the semester.  College women find the book engaging, and they are very personally affected by the stories that relate so well to them.  I find it an extremely informative, very useful book 
 I have not bought the book as of yet but I was privy to certain things that went into the book. Sylvia was my patternmaking teacher. She was working on this book while I was in school and all the students anticipated its release. Sylvia's teaching style is thorough and concise and so is this book. I recommend anyone interested in learning the right way to make patterns should purchase this book 
 The book is enlightening. Many people feel that we have to choose between freedom and security for our future. The author argues that we can have both - freedom and security. The author calls this "The Open Society Paradox."  The driver's license is the identifying card that almost everyone uses to exist and navigate in our society. The driver's license is the ticket to acceptability in our society. Bailey explains that getting a paper driver's license is too easy and therefore it is too easy to switch identities.  The author argues for a secure biometric national ID card. He calls this the technologies of openness. He downplays the severe loss of privacy that this would cause. Bailey believes that with this secure national ID card we can be both free and secure. I do not think that he makes his case. He believes that giving up one's privacy does not endanger one's freedom. He is wrong about this. He says openness is coming and we can not stop it.  Political Issues (C-Span 354/1) 
 Friedrich Engels' classic "The Condition of the Working Class in England" was written when he was only twenty-four, and had but recently abandoned his Calvinist upbringing for a more critical, socialist, point of view. Yet this book reads as if it were written by an experienced political commentator or a radical sociologist, without actually at any point becoming melodramatic or dense.  Engels' main purpose is to confront the bourgeoisie with the reality of their mode of production and to contrast this with the rhetoric of "free choice" and "civil liberties", as well as the capitalist apologia of the political economists of his day, in particular Andrew Ure. With great insight into both the causes and effects of the capitalist system, Engels catalogues the endless want, filth, despair and misery experienced by millions of labourers every day in 19th century England. He pays attention to housing, to factory safety, to unionism, to the physical condition of the workers, to alcoholism, the state of the Irish underclass, to prostitution and disease; in short, all the ills attendant on industrialization.   What gives this book such power is that Engels on the one hand proceeds in an analytical manner, making use above all of sources from the bourgeoisie itself and from Parliamentary reports, in explaining the functioning of the capitalist system and the competition between capitalists and between labourers. On the other hand, he writes in a particularly readable manner and at no point bores the reader with the mere summing-up of statistics. On the contrary, every analytical truth is accompanied by a vivid description, taken from Engels' excursions into working-class neighbourhoods, of the terrible state of humanity that the economic laws of capitalism cause for a great number of people.  For those interested in political economy, it may come as a surprise to see how much of the functioning of capitalism Engels already understood at such an early point in the development of theory. This gives the lie to the many theorists who would later claim that it was Marx only who worked on economics and that Engels was a mere epigone; this book should be a vindication of Engels. His later sketches of the political economy and of the historical development of capitalism would lay the foundation for both the Communist Manifesto and Marx' economic works. But the core insights that would create the modern theory of socialism are for the first time fully expressed here, and in a most appealing and shockingly effective manner.  In other words, an absolute must read for every person of intelligence 
 Well after receiving my signed copy of Roberts book ( he e-mailed me and asked if I would mind if he signed it and what to who) Imagine me telling him " please dont sign my book ! " it just shows me what a class guy Robert is and why it seems like the hero types are always very humble! The book is too short I wanted to read more ! I really enjoyed reading about Roberts expliots during his endless training and most interesting his actual combat experiences....he learned by accident really that getting in super close to your prey almost guarantees a kill ...so close he flew through a BF109's gycol and oil! I always imagined myself as someone who with the right training and character would have maybe made a half decent pilot in WW2...I guess its ok to dream....I do though know that Roberts book made me experience all the feelings he felt while becoming a real hero and I thank him for his service and for a fine book as well! Buy It and have him sign it! 
 This is a really good family movie! Great for anyone~~especially the Toby Keith fan! 
   This chapter book is certainly a funny genre of African American literature.   This Newbery Honor Book is about a black family called the Watsons (a.k.a "Weird Watsons." Gets funny at the first chapter, such as Kenny's brother's lips are stuck on the car's mirror.    It is Antarctica in Flint, Michigans, so when the Watsons gets an Ultra-Glide, they go south to a warmer U.S.A city, Birmingham, Alabama.    Trip's cool. But also pretty dangerous. Birmingham has some dark moments in American history.    Any 5th grader or up will enjoy it's enjoyable funny "Weird Watson" story, and have a slight chance of wanting to go to Birmingham, Alabama. But maybe not in 1963. 
 This film tells a powerful story, a "Crime and Punishment"-esque recovery of the soul, except without the ending that Dostoevsky had in his novel. After Neel Auguste committs the murder, Madame La (Juliette Binoche), much like Dostoevsky's Sonya, takes on the monumental task of recovering a lost soul and succeeds. Those who suggest this film is unrealistic have no grasp of eternal, Christian values of compassion and those who call this film ideological propaganda have no appreciation for beauty, as the acting (by all three, especially Kusturica and Auteuil, whom I have discovered through this film and who almost eclipse the talented Binoche), the cinematography, and the directing are absolutely brilliant.  This is a must-watch for many different kinds of people, from those interested in St. Pierre & Miquelon (I had to look up the islands on a map and was surprised to learn they are French, not Canadian), to those who would like an illustration of why there is never a soul, lost forever, to those who would just like to receive aesthetic pleasure from a beautiful film.  Finally, some have commented on the character of Neel Auguste, saying that he is "retarded" for not running away. Do not let a comment like that fool you. It would not be made had the reviewer understood the character or even picked up on a direct quote from Madame La, "You are so fatalistic!". Never trust someone who tells you not to watch a movie. Watch it and decide for yourself. I cannot envision that you wouldn't like it 
 I've read many eBay books, and this is by far the best on the market. It's more than comprehensive, it's amazing. Covers everything from the basics of buying items to what the best tools are for sniping all the way through what type of corporation is best for you if you want to sell items on eBay. Not only is eBay covered in more depth and better than in any other book out there, but similar sites and dozens of eBay tools, competitors, and add-on sites are also covered. All you need is here, and I'm not kidding. First rate. BUY THIS BOOK, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!! 
 Where Dickens paints memorable characters with wonderful names, Trollope draws characters closer to ourselves then shows us how they think, behave, and interact.  Another difference between characters in Dickens and in Trollope is that Trollope's are more nuanced. The detestable Mrs. Proudie repels us with her prudish haughtiness but when she upholds the cause of Mrs. Quiverful she does so as much out of charity as out of principle. The odious Obadiah Slope suffers pangs of love that made me want to shake him by the collar and tell him to wake up! The good Mr. Harding is clearly in the wrong in thinking ill of his daughter Eleanor's judgment, and yet Eleanor was also at fault in thinking herself above defense. There are no white hats or black hats in Barchester, only various shades of gray.  Trollope delights in describing what all these people think, and how they express themselves. How the tone of voice is intended to undo the work of the words spoken. How truth can be spun into a spider's web as does the wonderful character of the Signora Madeline Neroni. If anyone in the novel can be called evil it is her. She manipulates people like objects for her own amusement; she's like a cat playing with a mouse which it has no intention to eat. And yet even the reader can't help falling in love with la Signora. And yet, and yet, and yet... No one is simple in Trollope's world.  Barchester Towers differs from its predecessor in the Chronicles of Barsetshire. The Warden is a classic romance tainted with a touch of tragedy all brought down to the scale of everyday life. Barchester Towers on the other hand is a sprawling pageant of people, a long chapter in a comédie humaine that follows Balzac's tradition.   Vincent Poirier, Toky 
 This is Mannheim's best album.  I highly recomend it.  It made me cry from some of the songs 
 These CD's have been the best investment!  It has been incredibly enjoyable listening to the narration after reading the book itself.  I would recommend this method to enhance your understanding of the epic. Fantastic 
 I owned the VHS version of ''The Wild,Wild World'' but decided to get the DVD this winter. WELL..That was a great purchase ! I understand people that could see the documentary of Jayne in Europe,as pretty cheaply made,BUT it is still Jayne,and if you love her (as I do),any film she was in (except The Girl can't help it,and Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter) was done on the cheap,with ridiculously small budgets. 'The Wild,Wild World' gives you the chance to see a candid Jayne in all kinds of very campy situations,and the best scenes are when Jayne pretends to be offended by the goings-on... It shows a Jayne Mansfield who was indeed a true-original,rather eccentric person in the anal-retentive American Fifties.I can't help comparing her to what Anna Nicole Smith has done with her 'career' as a media sensation,BUT Jayne was doing basically the same FIFTY years ago,which was understandbly much more shocking for the common-folks. When Jayne talks about her film roles,you wonder if she is laughing with you or at herself. I don't understand how she can be compared to Marilyn Monroe.MM was looking for privacy,more serious roles,spoke to journalists only if she absolutely had to,when Jayne was waking up her daughter in the middle of the night to prepare drinks for journalists who needed something to write about.Jayne was not too picky about her roles,and the kind of attention she was getting,and it was her undoing.Sad,but she needed the money to keep up that image,all those children,dogs,and...husbands. NOW ,about ''The Labyrinth of Sex'': It is HYSTERICAL !! and a great choice to make the DVD a double-feature,just like the good-old days of the Drive-ins ! When you get over the awful dubbing,the documentary is rather well made,naive to today's standards of course,but well-intentionned.Some viewers will just see crass-exploitation,but if you are into Campy,Kitsch movies,and you see Ed Wood Jr. as a genius...well you will love IT !.The movie trailers are very funny as well,and make you wish you could find them. So my conclusion is that DVD is an EXCELLENT purchase,a must-have for any serious Jayne Mansfield Fan !! 
 Karl Dahl allegedly committed three brutal murders at the Haas home and is about to go on trial for them. When Judge Carey Moore rules for the defense that his prior bad acts are inadmissible, all hell breaks loose for lots of people. She's beaten in the parking ramp after work the day of her ruling, the convict escapes, a police detective looses it and goes over the edge, the Judge is kidnapped, people turn up dead. The list of suspects for the beating and kidnapping is long. Minneapolis police detectives Sam Kovac and Nikki Liska learn more than they care to know about the Judge's family and the Haas family as they try to close this high-profile case.  There are enough twists and turns to keep you interested. Lots of characters, but no confusion about who's who. I hope the author can keep up the good work and give us more stories like this or even better. But keep do keep Kovac in line; I know this is fiction, but he was a tad unbelievable in this one 
 A man is found on a small island called Ile de Port Noir in the Mediterranean, south of Marseilles. He is more corpse than man. A doctor, an Englishman named Washburn who came to Ile de Port Noir 8 years before because of his dismissal from Macleans Hospital in London, saves his life. But the man suffers a memory loss. He knows several languages. He is deadly in hand-to-hand combats. He can use several kinds of weapons. But he doesn't know who he is, where he comes from, whom he works for. He doesn't know his own identity. He is an amnesiac. Implanted beneath the skin on his hip is a frame of microfilm, which contains a bank account number. This account number leads to a bank in Zurich, the name Jason Bourne, supposed to be his, and four million dollars. Is Jason Bourne his real name? Or Cain? Or Delta? Or anything else? He becomes a wanted man of every side. The police want him. His description is on every immigration desk and border check in Europe. His old friends and colleagues want him dead. Carlos, who is the most dangerous assassin in the world, hunts him. He is struggling to kill his enemies, to protect the woman he loves, to find out his past and his identity, and to survive.  I watched the movie starring Matt Damon about a year ago. The movie is excellent. Matt Damon is also an excellent actor. But I am sorry to say that the book is much better. This is the first Robert Ludlum book I've read. And I am sure that this isn't the last one. Mr. Ludlum has done an excellent job in piling plot twist upon plot twist. The pace is fast. The book is full of actions and surprises. I would highly recommend this one to anyone who wants a 5-star action thriller book. 
 The item arrived on time. the item was in very good condition. I would tell all my family and friends to buy from the seller and will buy from them again. I was very pleased 
 Going through school while the Vietnam war was winding down, our history books and classes ignored this event in U.S. history. So for me, the "Twins Platoon" was the first introduction to the Vietnam War that I've read. The first-hand account of Sauro and his fellow soldiers took me to the frontlines, and you felt as they fell or their comrades fell. The timing of this book, though not intentional, is perfect. Vietnam was a war that very few understood, and many didn't agree with, just as the debate stirs around the U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. Though some may not agree with being at war (in Vietnam or in Iraq), this book proves the fact that young men and women are doing the job that they signed up to do, regardless of the consequences and political ramifications. This books tells the touching tale not only of what happens during preparation and actual battle, but also to those who came home. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in the Vietnam War, or any conflict for that matter 
 Okay so maybe it's not a classic...but I think that it should be.  This is a very well written script that stands the test of time.  Watching this film on cable yesterday, the movie doesn't once fall into the campy column.  I can't say the same for the rest of the series.  To tell you the truth I think that they should have stopped at the one movie.  But still, this movie has everything, laughs, lite-suspense, and just an all around good, clean family fun 
 This book was terrific. So sad that Damien's free life ended while he was basically just a kid, but from the weeds he has grown to flower, and it was comforting to know, that he met his wife through this ordeal, that at least SOMETHING good happened from this travesty. On a side note, thought it was odd that there were a lot of misspellings in the book, for a character named Brian, 'Brian' and "Brain' were used inter-mixed as well as a lot of other typo's, not sure if they wanted to keep the original text as written or just really poor editors 
 This is hands down the best star wars game i have played or seen. Just the fact that you can use almost every hero and villian in the star wars movies makes this a blast to play. The addition of the space combat is what really tips the scales on this title. When you're flying through waves of tie fighters and you land on an Imperial star destroyer and begin fighting through control rooms, you begin to realize this game is really special. 
 This play is a very profound character study of a quite extra-ordinary woman.  Hedda Gabler is an anti-heroine.  She is a woman with strong ideals who has failed to find her way in the world.  What an actress is required to play this complex part!  I'm not sure who could handle the part right now, but I couldn't help but imagine Bette Davis in it.  She would have been able to handle the complexity of this woman whose ideals for a perfect life were so unattainable, and who could not bear to live if those ideals couldn't be met.  Hedda found that she couldn't manipulate everyone around her in order to achieve her goals either, so she put a bullet through her head because it all seemed so futile to her.  This play is a definite characterization play, and so is different than a lot of  Ibsen's other plays which were social-problem plays 
 For those serious about growing in the spiritual life, Walter Hilton is a must.  Not everything will speak to every person but there is much to be gained from a slow, careful, and prayerful reading 
 I enjoyed reading this book. Woody writes with a unique perspective and style. This book along with his fictional/ autobiographical-Seeds of Man are must reads to get to know this uniquely american hero (but Joe Kleins biography-Woody Guthrie, a life is the best way to really get to know Woody. 
 Taken for a ride is a very detailed account of all the business endeavors that occured during the time that several companies including Daimler-Benz were competing to overtake Chrysler. However, it is not at all a dry book. The details hook you from the beginning and draw you through the book. It does get confusing at times because there are so many people involved, but it is definitely worth reading 
 Ok, true, this is a bit more creepy than some of the author's other works, and just creepy in general for little kids...but it is still an excellent book! Just don't read it to your kids at night! This book is a brilliant work of art, wiith its horror undertones. Some people are just sick of reading the same old fairy tales and this is the perfect book to pick up if you're looking for something different. And it really sticks with you, too. I haven't read this book in years, but I can still see the pictures vividly in my mind; can still hear the first lines of the book echoing through my head as I write this review. The pictures are extraordinary--they are what gives the readers shivers. I especially love the picture in which the goblins replace the main character's baby brother with an ice baby.  I definitely recommend this book to anyone, even for adults' pleasure, it's just maybe not for really young children.  I wrote this review partly to chastise the readers who can't seem to get past the fact that this story is a little scary and see this book for what it truly is 
 Excellent group of short stories about life after WWII in Japan.  It grasps the pain, suffering, and despair of the people of Japan.  Some were all out for the war and still after the war but many were ashamed of be led astray by their leadership.  If you love short stories then this is a very good collection.  The way she descibes the scenary with vividness is extraordinary 
 If you haven't read Lehane's illuminated manuscripts then stop what you're doing (afer you finish this).  Put your mouse down and click on BUY because you will not be sorry. Lehane is all I ever wanted in a writer (and boy, do I want A LOT!), so if you want everything and more in a mystery, then Lehane is The One.  Just be ready because he WILL blow your mind.  (Isn't that what his name means in French?!  A massive explosion high in the air...) How appropriate.   This guy is no faker.  Dennis is a gift from the gods.  Er.  Wait.  He IS A GOD!!!  He certainly is tuned into frequencies we mortals cannot see.  Thank GOD for Dennis Lehane!    Hey.  Did that sound as fanatic to you as it did to me?  Yes, I believe it did.  Be forewarned.  Lehane's writing is addictive.  You, dear reader, may become assimilated if you start reading his books becauses there are clamoring Lehane fans all over the planet who are literally jonesing for more installments in this series.  They post all over the web, begging for more.  The way Lehane breathes life into his stories, lifts the colorful characters up off the page for the reader and creates a complete atmosphere in a book, it's easy to believe this stuff is real. It's thought-provoking plus it's got some funny moments and the language is artful.  And it really moves so I wasn't tempted to put it down and leave it to get on with living my life.  Nothing boring here.  (I won't sit still for anything that does not have a reasonably fast clip -- unless it's poetry or reference material or otherwise easy to skim.)    Highly recommended 
        An agent for the CIA for some ten years, American author Charles McCarry knows of what he writes.  His spy fiction is head and shoulders above many - it's intelligent, plausible, and totally enthralling.  This writer's  powers of description capture:  "To the west, like a fringed eyelid closed in sleep, lay the dark forested coast of Vietnam."  Kudos to Overlook for reissuing McCarry's  novels.  	First published in 1983 "The Last Supper" held readers spellbound, now it will undoubtedly win another generation of fans.  Many will remember protagonist Paul Christopher; those who are meeting him for the first  time will not forget him.  Wolkowicz is another inspired creation - physically unattractive he has a mind like, forgive me, the proverbial steel trap.  Relentless in finding answers, "...he worried every bit of evidence for hours, sniffing it and turning it in the cunning paws of his suspicion."  	Opening pages of "The Last Supper" describe the death of Christopher's lover, Molly Benson.  It's Paris covered in night rain and she is fatally injured by a speeding car.  From there, readers are taken to Christopher's youth and young adulthood as the author traces the activities of the OSS during World War II, how his parents smuggled refugees, and the heartbreak when his German born mother was detained.  	Throughout the story we are privy to the activities of those engaged in secret warfare and guerilla combat.  It is a spy thriller at its finest as the personalities and hearts of those involved in these activities are revealed.  	McCarry covers a lot of territory yet he does so with skill and erudition.  The author is an espionage writer of the first order.    Don't miss "The Last Supper."         - Gail Cooke  
 Each time I read this novel, I love it more. (And I liked it pretty well the first time.) Each time I end up identifying primarily with a different character--I can see myself in Chip, Gary, Denise, Enid and Alfred. And that's what it's about--seeing yourself, learning who you are and growing up. It's never too late.   The parallel plotlines and references are subtle-but-not-irritatingly-so, and it's possible to enjoy them on each read and also catch a new one every time you go back to it.  My one complaint is that Franzen either does not seem to know how the academic world of higher education works, or simply takes liberties for the sake of the story. But 1) colleges do not hire more than one person at a time for a tenure-track position, nor is there such a thing as a department that is "overtenured." Franzen introduces this device solely for the dramatic tension of having Chip complete for tenure with a female colleague. But this happens only in the corporate world, not academica. 2) No matter how popular s/he was, any professor who claimed to have a degree s/he did'nt have would be fired, not rehired under pressure and "promoted to full professor." Promotion is a process that takes years and involves untold committees. Again, corporate, not academic.   For the record, Franzen never refused to be on Oprah. What he objected to was the corporate "Oprah's Book Club" logo appearing on the cover of possibly the most anticorporate novel ever written. It says something about Oprah's powers of observation that she failed to notice this irony herself. Wonder if she even read it 
 First and foremost, I am a Rex Stout fan. I love his characters Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin absolutely. So when I saw this early work of Stout's, I was interested even though it has nothing whatsoever to do with Wolfe/Goodwin. I can't say it reminds me at all of the Nero Wolfe series. There isn't a character or an action, nor a plot technique that reminds me one iota of the Wolfe series. But that is fine with me - this work stands alone.   Now, first off, the beginning is ploddingly slow and dull. I did almost put it down, but I wanted so badly to see if he rescued the writing, that I continued. The story is quite entertaining. I enjoyed the plot and the twists. But, I think as a new author, Stout called upon too many words that generally live only in the thesaurus. It does read something like a novice writer's work. But since I fancy myself a would-be writer, it gave me courage to see that the greats started somewhere lower in the ranks too.   Don't let my review turn you off from trying this book, please. It really is a sweet and clever little story of love and courage. The characters are colorful and interesting. The main character, Lila is shown to have depths as the story goes on. Although, I do believe he could have rolled several of the lesser characters into one - it was still workable as is.   Give it a try. It is compelling after the  opening is behind you. 
 This book needs to be a part of every CEO and CMO's library. If you are thinking about whether or not to buy this book...don't think, just buy it. It's boils everything down to the most important thing: action. I was in a meeting today with the Chief Marketing Officer of a quickly growing services company and the conversation turned towards the power of word of mouth marketing and this book came up as something we both had read and loved. WE both agreed it's the best book out about the topic 
 There is no more prominent name - American or otherwise - in naval theory and grand strategy than Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840-1914).  The only more enduring name in strategic studies today is that of the Prussian master, Carl von Clausewitz.  Unfortunately, like Clausewitz, Mahan's work is rarely read in the original; instead, his ideas are summarized and conveyed in secondary sources or, worse still, in isolated quotes often extracted out of context and with the express purpose of defending a particular contemporary position.  One might argue that personal interpretation is necessary when discussing Clausewitz.  He never published in his lifetime; his masterpiece "On War" was published posthumously.  The treatise was largely a rough draft and the main arguments were built using the theoretical construct of dialectical relationships, which, almost by definition, are open to debate.  Moreover, from the American perspective, Clausewitz wasn't translated into English (and not translated very well at that) until 1873, which remained the only English edition for nearly a century.  (For more on Clausewitz's reception in the English-speaking world and the transmogrification of his ideas see Christopher Bassford's authoritative "Clausewitz in English").  For some reason, Mahan's magnum opus "The Influence of Seapower Upon History, 1660-1783" is approached in much the same way as Clausewitz even though it suffers from none of these interpretive handicaps (although both books are, admittedly, tough reads).  As anyone who has studied military strategy knows, Mahan and his theories have been distilled down to a few prescriptive policies or actions: the call for an all big ship navy; the positive attributes of imperialism; a focus on a decisive battle at sea; and, above all, the maxim "never divide the fleet!"  In "Inventing Grand Strategy" the distinguished navalist Jon Sumida takes a full view of Mahan and his work, and puts particular focus on Mahan's thoughts on teaching and fostering naval command.  To begin with, "Influence" was merely the first of a three-part series, and just one of eighteen major pieces of history, biography and philosophy Mahan published over his lifetime.  In the twenty-five years after "Influence" first appeared, as Sumida demonstrates, Mahan refined his arguments and, in some cases, changed fundamental conclusions from his first work.  For instance, Mahan came to the conclusion that overseas trade was NOT a prerequisite to building a large navy and he came to doubt that a continental power like France or Russia could ever put the appropriate focus on seapower that an isolate island power like England, Japan and United States.  In closing, this book is a real gem and should be read by anyone with an interest in seapower and strategy.  It provides great background and perspective on Mahan and his ideas, without being merely a redaction of "The Influence of Seapower Upon History."   
 When they delivered this center speaker, I thought that someone, somewhere--had made a huge mistake...the box was huge! It was all plastered with caution-signs warning of the heavy weight of the object inside the big box...Thankfully, it was just that whomever shipped it was being a bit too careful...coz, this rascal only weighs some 6 or 7 lbs, at the most...But, the sound,,,the sound is glorious, and fits right in with my Polk R15's...I could not be more pleased with this purchase! So, thank you Polk and thank you Amazon--you guys rock 
 For various reasons I'm no fan of Simone de Beauvoir, but her All Men are Mortal is one of the ten best novels I have ever read. The book is about a man, Fosca, telling the story of his life, which started 6 centuries ago. Fosca is immortal and has lived through many important historical episodes, such as revolutions and conflict, and he has also loved a number of women in his life. The first thought that comes to mind when thinking of an immortal person is "what a lucky guy". However, as this book clearly shows, without death, life has no meaning. For instance, Fosca goes into battle, but knows deep down he risks nothing and he is not the hero his fellow soldiers think he is. But the most memorable part of the book describes his relation to the woman he has loved most in his long life. Although Fosca tries to hide the fact he always remains as young while his wife ages, she eventually discovers the truth and rejects him because she says his devotion to her means nothing : she is devoting her life to him while he will have hundreds of other wives after her. Without sacrificing our life or part of it, we give nothing. At the end of the book Fosca wants nothing more than to be able to die like every other mortal human in order to give a meaning to his life. Too long as a book, but with profound implications. Unforgettabl 
 What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day.   By Pearl Cleage.  As an avid reader there are times I am desperate for a book to read and yet cannot seem to find one I have not read. It was suggested by a friend that I read this book. Having never heard of the author I hesitated for a moment and then bought it. At first realizing this was a story about a woman who had Aids I wondered if I would be able to read it.  To my surprise  once I opened it and read the first chapter I was unable to put this book down. This is a first novel for this writer and I must say a literary gem. From start to finish the writing is exceptional, the characters vivid and so close you can touch them. Though there is so much sadness, death, drugs, and cruelty the author never allowed you to dwell on these facts alone.  She had you feel only the love, and hope, the goodness of some in spite of the meanness of others. The ending is uplifting, for you also close the book knowing that you have finished a novel well worth reading.  I have bought three more of Pearl Cleage's books and cannot wait to read them. 
 Marc Elliot's Down 42nd Street (Sex, Money, Culture, and Politics at the Crossoads of the World) may frustrate some history mavens looking for exact truth but will be a thrill to anyone who wants to read a book that truly captures the spirit of 42nd Street.  The first part of the book is the historical buildup to the author's main playground, the years of fighting to fix the street from Lindsay to Giuliani (with a wonderful portrayal of Koch, for an added thrill) as the street moved from the Crossroads of the (Porn and Drug) World to a branch of the Disney franchise.  The book does deliver the sex, money, culture, and politics of its subtitle, in very healthy doses.  There are no startling revelations only many, many small thrills, much like the street itself.  An enjoyable read 
 Before reading this short book I had a limited appretiation for Martin Luther King Jr. I only revered him for his social action and not for his theology. Now I realize his elequance as a theologian. This quick-read is life changing and is an amazing perspective on humanity and the nature of his exsistenc 
 A terrific book about the 1960's NASA technology used to build and fly the Lunar  Module to the moon. This book conveys the pride of the workers and company that built these wonderful and unique vehicles. Great mix of photos and text. I have many space books but still learned new things from this book. Highly recommended 
 If you haven't listened to that much jazz before, "Sketches of Spain" is a great place to start.  The music is very accessible and has more of a "pop" feel than most other jazz (although I imagine that that might be a detriment, not a plus, for jazz purists).  I loved the Mediterranean flavor of the music.  This is my favorite jazz album--I like it even more than "Kind of Blue" 
 This book covers aspects of Economics that are only too often neglected.  These aspects include how power arrangements affect market efficiency and the effectiveness of markets in meeting consumer demand and providing for propserity.  The book also provides accounts of different types of market arangements.  In one type of market there is no guarantee other than the honor of the buyer and seller concerning the quality of the product and the terms of payment.  Thus the market tends toward basic short term transactions.  In the market for which property rights are guaranteed by the social structure, however, market arrangements can be much more complex and much better serve the needs of the people in society.   Power arrangements should be studied in Economics.  And this book should be read by all persons interested in Economics.  
 I've had this DVD for about 2 months and I love it.  It is very different from Yoga Shakti.  This is a flowing dancey yoga that dancers or dancers at heart will love.  My favorite sequence is the Creative flow.  Most of the sequences are set to drums.  Other have said that it is the same as Yoga trance dance, but I don't own that DVD yet. It is suited for all levels.  The best thing about the yoga is that it feels like dance and it is circular instead of linear like most yoga.  Your body is meant to move in a circular motion. It feels natural. I do mostly kundalini yoga and this is a perfect compliment to that.  My next purchase will be Yoga trance dance.  Dance is body joy! 
 Based on a true story, THE STAIRCASE is one of those uplifting Christian movies heavy on morals and faith, and thanks to an intelligent script and very good performances, it works. Barbara Hershey gives a smooth and touching performance as Mother Madeleine, a dying nun who wants to see the completion of a chapel in the Santa Fe territory before she dies.  This seems impossible when the architect "forgets" to put in a staircase to the choir loft.  Without the funds necessary to complete the staircase, that dream seems unlikely...until a mysterious stranger named Mr. Joad shows up out of nowhere and offers to build a spiral staircase with no charge.  CSI's William Petersen gives a strong understated performance as Joad, whose mission becomes both a blessing and a curse as the original contractors (David Clennon and Justin Louis) don't want Joad to do the staircase.  It may all play out with predictable results but it's sincerity is so genuine, it's a fine little film 
 I was there for the DVD recording of this concert - Pure Magic - from an era when you had to sound good performing live. These guys still (after all these years)sounded like they were in the studio when live in concert - classic country rock. Lyrically beautiful, instrumentally perfect - it doesn't get any better than this 
 The Green Ripper stands alone. If you are new to the McGee series, start with The Deep Blue Goodbye.  I grew up in the 60's in Ft Lauderdale and knew Bahia Mar well. But I also grew up in Fayetteville NY where John D lived and sold insurance after graduating from Syracuse -- or was it Harvard. Yet somehow I never read him until the 90's. What a treat it has been!   The Green Ripper may be the most important McGee book because of September 11th. Here John D gives us his ideas on terrorism. He gives it a religious basis. He explores its financing and organizational management structure. He gives it an international reach. He explains the psychology of the participants and their training mehtods. He shows the inability of law enforcement to prevent it. Written in 1979, he makes some predictions regarding the future -- that is, now.  Of course, it is a McGee book. Therefore we have a McGee-solution, which he called a Dissat-solution in "A Tan and Sandy Silence", heh. When McGee infiltrates a terrorist training camp, mayhem ensues, putting it mildly.  The book stands alone because of the effect it all has on McGee. Get to know him; read the earlier titles first. Then come to The Green Ripper. The epilogue will be particularly moving. 
 This book gets four stars, because although it is a very well researched and practical book, it is probably, as some other reviews have observed, strong on food preparation, needs and preservation (very important) but a little light in other areas.  I do think, however, this is an excellent book and for anyone who is keen to inform themselves and prepare for crisis management beyond the 72-hour disaster scenario and wants to be prepared for "long emergency" scenarios, I think this book is indispensable.  It is a very serious book and has some indepth and quite complex information. It is by no means something written for the armchair survivalist.  It is not what I'd call light reading, either, nor should it be. If you have a serious interest in crisis preparedness, this is an excellent book to have 
 An uncomplicated work of art. To say this CD is lovely would understate the way it will ooze in and make you feel fine. Absence of too much lead guitar is a pleasure. Voice and accoustic instruments meld togther in a way that relaxes and mesmerizes that moment. A slow, elegant flavor of the deep South runs through the tracks. 
 Tom Browne is Grooving&Bumping on this set.Funkin' For Jamaica is a classic Jam that is still as Funky as it was the first time i heard it.i like the Mock Voice.dig TOm Browne he is one Ordinary Guy.that part alway's had me rolling.thigh is high is wicked as well.this Dude is very talented.this is a Bumping set 
 With Mark Kurlansky's reputation as one of the best food writers today, it was only a matter of time before a collection of some of his selections of good food writing came together.  "Choice Cuts" is entertaining reading, especially for those who are interested in the history of eating and food.  There are few recipes in this book, but this collection is more of a book that you sit down with a cup of coffee or tea after you've finished the dishes 
 Several artists have covered the Beatles' songs "Fool On The Hill" and "Eleanor Rigby" (Sarah Vaughan, Sergio Mendes, Petula Clark & Joan Baez, to name but a few), and very well, but none have done so as beautifully as Bobbie Gentry.  These are just a couple of highlights from this new CD release of Gentry's DELTA SWEETE and LOCAL GENTRY albums, both on this one disc.  Years ago, I wrote to Capitol/EMI and Collectibles, suggesting this same combination, knowing that these two companies specialize in "twofers."  I never expected it to happen, so it's a dream come true, thanks to Australia's Raven label.    Commercial failures at the time of their release, both albums featured here are GREAT, from start to finish. Here we have an original, creative artist at the top of her game, who, somehow, slipped through the cracks in the general public's collective imagination. "Ode To Billie Joe" and "Fancy" are but the tip of Gentry's iceberg, and it was smart of Raven to NOT use these songs as bonus tracks in order to attract buyers.  Masterpieces though these songs are, they're on every Bobbie Gentry compilation currently available, and don't need to be here in order to bolster the release of these albums, presented here in their entire, original sequences.  Instead, two of the bonus tracks are reprised from Capitol's expensive import compilation, THE CAPITOL YEARS:  ODE TO BOBBIE GENTRY.  The first, "Stormy," is a stunning, acoustic rendition of The Classics IV hit, and as far as I'm concerned, it blows the original right out of the water.  Understated and just plain gorgeous! (only Santana's version comes close, but its style is completely different). The second bonus track is a surprising take on Donovan's "Skip Along Sam." The third is a lovely performance of "Away In A Manger" (this one's kind of rare), but I'm glad it's last, as I won't listen to it out of season.  I would have preferred to have "Show Off" instead, from the same compilation, or "Steal Away," which would fit here perfectly, but mine is a very small quibble.    What we have here are two solid albums of wonderful, swampy country-pop music that are wholly unique, sung in a rich, smoky contralto voice that could not be mistaken for that of anyone else (Gentry does have a few things in common with Dusty Springfield:  both singers might be classified as "blue-eyed soul," they each used a rather breathy technique; and both were entranced by the lure and lore of the American South).    The string arrangements used on THE DELTA SWEETE and LOCAL GENTRY have a distinctive flavor that I've rarely heard anywhere else; sweeping, grand gestures that seem to capture the very South itself, with all of its drama, contradictions, humor and very deep sadness. It's not quite "country" music, nor is it Cajun or folk, although one can discern mixtures of all three here and there.  "Come Away Melinda" is a devastating post-apocalyptic scenario depicting the unearthing of an old picture album by a little girl who has survived, never having known the world as it once was.  Spine-tingling.  "Casket Vignette" is a bit of black humor set in an undertaker's office. "Refractions" is a spellbinding description of a beautiful nightmare, and "Parchman Farm Blues" is a prickly cover of a Mose Allison tune, about a man rotting away in prison ("...all he ever done was shoo' his wife...").  Bobbie makes a sassy "Big Boss Man" her own, while her original, "Ace Insurance Man," is a hilarious soap opera about sex and small town gossip, with a slapstick ending, set to a contagious Louisiana beat. "Courtyard" is a sparkling, sun-dappled ballad that is heartbreaking in its beauty.   The oft-covered "Tobacco Road" sums up the quality of both of these albums: mysterious, majestic, melancholy and joyous all at the same time.  For me, it's a definitive reading.   Gentry's career may have been brief, but she rarely faltered, and these are her two best albums, in my opinion, without a single lemon in the bunch. Buy this CD while you still can!!!  (Now, can we please have a CD release of PATCHWORK)?    
 A Rage to Live by Mary Lovell is an outstanding biography of both Sir Richard and the Lady Burton. Burton is about the only person that I have bothered to read multiple biograhies of. He was so complex and his life was just THAT interesting! There are a few other treatments of Sir Richard still in print, and Lovell takes these into account in her own telling. A great deal of data are available for the first time in this book, and the author uses this information adroitly to clear up long-standing misconceptions (and outright slanders) of both Burtons.  Lovell provides a good bit of compelling discussion about the conflict between Burton and John Hanning Speke over the source of the Nile. It has been common for Burton biographers to over-simplify the nature of the disagreement: Burton thought the Nile originated in Lake Tanganyika, Speke argued for Victoria Nyanza. Not so! Speke only really WANTED the source of the Nile to be Victoria (the lake, not the queen), whereas Burton, a Man of Science, argued that the observations at hand were insufficient to decide one way or the other. With the available information, Burton understood that Tanganyika or some as yet unknown spring could still have been the head of the Nile. Lovell explains well the behind-the-scenes wrangling at the Royal Geographical Society by Burton's detractors to back Speke as much out of spite as any other reason.  What really compelled me to read A Rage to Live -- besides what might best be called an obsession of the man -- was my desire to learn more about the Lady Burton, Isabel. She was an independent and interesting person herself, but she has been abused at the hands of other Burton biographers. To them, Isabel was an over-zealous Catholic, the schemer ready to use her influence and Richard's name for her own advancement, and the arsonist of Burton's papers and manuscript of the Scented Garden. Lovell makes the case that this is hogwash, the previous biographers have given too much credit to the bigoted opinions of Richard's spinster niece. Among the new information provided by Lovell's research is the fact that Richard was instructing Isabel what to write on his behalf. She was very much his partner in all aspects of their life together, and Lovell's story does provide some justice for the Lady Burton. Most significantly, Lovell demonstrates that Isabel burned at Trieste what Richard had instructed her to burn, and that many important papers did indeed survive.  A Rage to Live is an enormous volume, more than 900 pages -- my train ride to and from work has been considerably lightened since I finished reading the book. It has the best maps of the recent Burton biographies, but the fewest illustrations. Sources are well documented. Previous reviewers have commented upon the state of the editing of this book; they make some good points. But speaking (NOT speke-ing) as someone who has tried to read everything that they can find by and about Sir Richard Francis Burton, Lovell's A Rage to Live is the best single source on the subject 
 I have read all of Dave Peltzer books, it was wonderful to read his brother Richards account of the abuse Dave suffered and how he came to replace Dave in his mother's Eyes. I do wish he would have not left us hanging at the end of the novel though, I was left with more questions about his life once they moved then I might have been if he would have covered things up to the point of his marriage. I hope that he will write another book enlightening us on life once they moved to Utah. I highly recommend this book to everyone who has read Dave Peltzers books, if you haven't read them first so you understand this book to the fullest that the author wants you to. 
 There's a great deal that's wrong with Disney, and Hiaasen's book is a good, quick, easily accessible introduction. From there, though, you should move on to more in-depth criticism. The most recent thing I've read that I would recommend would be Henry Giroux's The Mouse that Roared 
 Dear Reader,  Unlike previous books in the series, THE HOSTILE HOSPITAL takes place immediately after THE VILE VILLAGE.  The three Baudelaire children are all alone walking across a large empty space when the reach The Last Chance General Store.  The children had just escaped from V.F.D. the evening before and were now wanted by the police for the murder of Jacques Snicket.  Mixed-up and misrepresentations of the deeds were going to appear in the morning edition of THE DAILY PUNCTILIO.  Hungry and without another chance in the world, the children enter The Last Chance.  It's too terrible to describe what horrors are inflicted upon them there.  Somehow the escape and make their way to the Heimlich Hospital where they join with a group of singing people known as the V.F.D., Volunteers Fighting Disease.  It's not the V.F.D. that their parents were members of, but this V.F.D. inadvertently assist the Baudelaire's in finding new information about their parents.  Oh, my.  But that was before Violet was captured by Count Olaf, before she was supposed to have her head removed, and before a major fire.  Oh, those poor children!  I can't write about them anymore at the moment.  Read about them yourself.  I think I'll go buy a heart-shaped balloon to make me feel better because my stomach feels queasy.  Sincerely, Uncle T 
 ...Dawkins never claims his "biomorphs" to bebiological, their sole purpose is to show how small changes over aperiod of time can make huge changes in the end product; no more, noless.  He turns trees (yes, just the shapes) into grasshoppers, and dragon flies, and satelites (yes, satelites, which are never claimed to be biological).  His "quasi-biological forms" (see the forms?) do an excellent job of making his point, and you shall never convince this 'skeptic' otherwise 
 Must say that I did not watch this film in DVD format so I am not sure if the version I have is the full film or the shortened one. The VCD I bought was from [...] which ships direct from Bangkok. My product was intended for home viewing in Thailand, not for mainly export/international audience. I really enjoyed the film, Thai culture is complex and Royal culture much more so. The Prince of Thailand made this film,it is a film not so much a movie, so yes, it can be slow at times and painfully detailed but it should be. This is a film to learn some of Thai history and culture, not just to be entertained. I really loved it. 
 War and Peace is one of those novels you will either love or hate. Personally, I love it. It deals with issues that a shorter work would leave unresolved. Yes, there are a lot of characters; yes, Tolstoy can get a little longwinded. But it remains a powerful work. Tolstoy did to Russian history what Shakespeare did to British history - he took it and made it his own. While he may present the "cast of thousands," the plot follows only a handful of characters. Since you spend quite a bit of time with them, you develop a bond with them. I confess I caught myself flipping ahead several times to find out what happens...something I never do.  I like the Oxford World Classics because they use good editions (usually) and are affordable which means they're good for students or if you're reading the book for the first time, you're not going to break the bank on something you might not like.  If you don't like War and Peace, don't give up on Tolstoy or the other Russian writers. Most of the novels are shorter and many of them wrote short stories that are extremely good 
 We think that John Holt's book shines a clearer light on how children, teachers, and schools fail. He gives great examples on how teachers go wrong and gives even better examples of how they can improve their teaching skills. We recommend this book to all teachers and parents. By reading and understanding this book, changes will be made in the classroom and the outcome will be greater 
 Tierney Sutton is my favorite female singer.  This cd is great as is all her work.  I was waiting for this one to be released as i will be for her next.  I hope i will not have to wait to long. To know that great artist like Ms. Sutton exist, and Pop singers get all the attention is just down right sinful. However, I know that she will be around for a long time. 
 This flash drive is amazing, it is so much better than my PNY Attatche`. It has plenty of space and has a nice sleak erganomic design. Unlike my Attatche` the cover fits on the back even with the lanyard clipped on! It also built sturdily, unlike the attatche` that you could pull the covers off of it 
 And I LOVE R.E.M. With "Document" REM produced back to back classics. "Life's Rich Pagent" was one of the greatest albums ever. "Document" is the beginning of REM becoming more mainstream and more political, with songs such as 'Exhuming McCarthy' and 'Welcome to the Occupation' 'Disturbance at the Herron House' REM speaks on the injustices and outrages they see within both the government and the American people. With the popularity of the song "The End of the world" REM garnered much radio play, the benefit of which is oft debated by REM diehards. Did popularity and radio play ruin one of the greatest bands ever?? Unfortunately, I believe it did. Mainstreaming ones music is NEVER beneficial (except to the bands bank accounts). 'Document" I believe is the last truly great REM album. Every song on here is great, and the production is FLAWLESS. As on "Life's Rich Pagent" lead singer Michael Stipes voice comes throug loud and clear, perhaps even better on "Document" than on "Pagent". No longer is he drowned out by the bass guitar or the drums. Apparently he has decided that yes, he really DOES have something important to say and that we the listener should be able to decipher these little jewels of wisdom. This was my favorite album for about 3 years. With the release of "Green" REM became too popular for me and I felt the quality of their music suffered, radio uber-friendly 'Stand' being a perfect example of this. They even released a really bad "pop" like video. I wanted to vomit. REM videos up to this point were rare (I had to actually purchase a VHS !! tape of them and watch it repeatedly. The name of this tape slips my mind, and it was purchsed back in 1988 or so). If you're a new fan trying to get into REM, I really recommend you buy "Life's Rich Pagent" and "Document" and then work your way around their vast collection from there.  This is a really great piece of work.  
 Here's your chance to find out about life in a rural town in the most rural state of the lower 48 from farm girl turned rebel turned academic turned author Debra Marquat.  A descendant of German-Russian farmers, she grew up as your typical, albeit unusual for that area, rebellious, farm girl.  Through excerpts from other works and a series of ordinary but interesting anecdotes, she enlightens the reader with facts about her native state, her ancestors, farmers, farm life and family - from the lengths folks will go to in order to keep land in the family; to the monotony of farm chores; to "the horizontal life," to an unfortunate encounter with a deer and the predictable aftermath; to a father's failing heart, death, and funeral; to a hundred other details that will ring true to anyone who has spent time in a rural area in that part of the country.  Although one may question the her choice to include information about her sex life in a book which will undoubtedly be read by conservative farmer-types, and her decision not rush home to see her dying father, she freely admits to being a rebel and never professes to always do the right thing.  The references to and inclusion of text from various works of fiction and non-fiction are sometimes welcome, but more often detract from the pleasant flow of her writing, although probably highlight her "academic" side.  A comparison of her great grandfather to "land-hungry father Larry Cook" - from A Thousand Acres, when readers of it will remember his big secret, sticks in my mind as particularly distracting.    
 These days, it's bad legal hygiene to carry weapons, and using them, even in self-defense, can result in compulsory participation in legal proceedings both civil and criminal. Sure, you were attacked, and you defended yourself-- but you had a gun or a knife or whatever, and so you must have been out looking for trouble. And if you fought back with an actually effective weapon, such as a firearm with hollowpoint ammunition, well, you broke the law-- guilty, case closed in a lot of states. It seems as if district attorneys are getting confused about who the victims are. Poor criminals! How are they supposed to get by if citizens arm themselves?  So most of us go around feeling defenseless and hoping we stay on the right side of the statistics column. Others carry weapons and risk getting hassled by cops or facing juries. This book changes all that by making the world your armory, and after you read it, you will never be unarmed again. Nor will you have to put your freedom in jeopardy to give yourself a fighting chance against the bad guys.  What prosecutor could go after you with a straight face for cracking a rapist's skull with a Marksalot? Or for removing a carjacker's teeth with a hair brush? Or for narrowing a mugger's reproductive options with a walking cane?  Be careful, though. This book isn't all about legal hygiene. Mostly it's about all-out scrapping for your life when you have no other choice, and a lot of the non-firearm techniques here could get you in as much trouble as shooting someone. Some of them are pretty disgusting, too.  This certainly isn't a book for ninja fans, martial arts aestheticists, or would-be tough guys. Nor is it a book for the kind of person wants to take some karate classes in order to "feel more confident." It's a book that puts weapons in the hands of nice, ordinary, law-abiding people who might otherwise be unable to defend themselves against the other kind 
 Fast service and product arrived just as described.  Thank you very much 
 As leader of China for over a quarter of a century, Mao Zedong is one of the dominant figures of modern history, one whose shadow continues to fall on his country today.  In this book, Jonathan Spence offers a short introduction to the Chinese leader's life and times, one that seeks to explain how the son of Hunan farmers became the ruler of the most populous country in the world.  That Spence succeeds is a tribute to his command of the subject.  He concentrates on Mao's intellectual development, analyzing his writings in order to shed light upon the key points in his life.  Spence sees Mao's organizational skills as key to his rise within the Communist Party during the hard years of the 1920s and 1930s.  Once in power, Mao consolidated his rule behind an image of himself as the simple, determined leader of a revolutionary movement, an image he sought to impose on the movement as a whole.  Yet his increasingly absolute position fueled a self-absorption that, once in power, contributed to the great disasters of his rule.  One of the leading historians of China, Spence presents the details of Mao's life with confidence and erudition.  While much of the treatment is perfunctory (what else is to be expected in a biography of less than 200 pages?), within the space available he provides a good overview of Mao's life intertwined with coverage of the complex and dramatic history of twentieth century China.  For readers seeking to learn about the interesting times which Mao shaped, this is a good place to start 
 I had never heard Racer X back in the 80s.  I liked some of the stuff that Paul Gilbert did in Mr. Big, but I always felt like he was holding back.  There is no holding back with Racer X, Superheroes!  Gilbert plays some ferocious licks.  Check out Viking Kong, wow!!!  Other awesome songs include Superheroes, track #2, and Godzilla (my favorite).  Jeff Martin does some great singing on this one.  This is metal that one must head bang to.  Buy it, it rocks 
 I'm a big Agatha Christie fan and these stories are just great.  Each one has its own special twist.  Years ago I remember my dad sending me a video tape he had made of "The Witness for the Prosecution" starring Diana Rigg.  I was instantly hooked on Agatha Christie 
 I have only had this book a few days and I jumped right to the "irrational ideas" section. After a short quiz, the book spelled out for me the irrational ideas that cause me so much anxiety. It was amazing. It has helped so much to see everything right infront of me and also helped me to know that other people have these ideas! I absolutley can't wait to finish reading and start putting into practice the techniques in the book 
 I LISTEN TO TREY CD ALL THE WAY THROUGH! IT IS GREAT WITH WONDERFUL BEATS!!!! HE SHOULD BE CALLED TREY BEATS!!!  I JUST LOVE THE SONG Ooo!!! IN THE MIDDLE IS MY SONG!!!! I LOVE ALL THE SONGS!  HE HAS A WONDERFUL SINGING VOICE!  I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE 3 STAR RATINGS! THE CD IS TIGHT!  USHER WHO??????? USHER WHAT???? LOOK OUT BOYYYYYY!!!!  THIS CD IS BLAZIN HOT!!! 5 STAR CD *****  TREY SONGZ IS A VERY HANDSOME YOUNG MAN, I MUST SAY!!! 
 This is a great book to get you started in parenting with Love and Logic.  The whole concept makes sooooo much sense!  Why didn't I think of it on my own?  After reading this book, you will definitely want to try out these techniques and read more on the subject 
 Great tunes on this CD.  Good variety of artists, and every track is familiar from the 80's power rock scene.  If you like guitar-based rock, sung loud, this should fill the bill. There's a ballad or two thrown in for variety, but it's mostly hard rock.  A great CD for cruising down a long, boring Interstate highway, or for livening up a party 
 This book takes a different approach to the packaging development. It has a decent amount of information on the whole process in packaging development from concept to shelf. However, the book does focus more on packaging appearance or graphic. Overall, I believe this is a book that is more suitable for management level rather than for packaging designers or engineers. The book doesn't offer enough details on some subjects that some packaging engineers or designers might be looking for.   If you are interested in knowing the whole process, this is definitely a good book to start up with.  
 Nothing more to say, this is the best book in mobile comm and every wireless engineer should have a copy of it 
 I remember hearing about this staircase when I was a teenager. A staircase built without using nails. It really moved me to tears, but not really sad tears. Barbara Hershey and William Petersen give an excellent performance in this movie. The movie left me believing in miracles and the strength of the human spirit. A carpenters work of art.............. 
 I read this book as part of a graduate class on the "study of the novel" and was absolutely blown away by it. This was my first attempt at George Eliot and though I had been wanting to read her for some time, the sheer girth of most of her works prevented me from adding them to my "leisure reading" list. The character of Gwendolen Harleth is strong and commanding, Henleigh Grandcourt is perhaps one of the best villains ever written into literature, and Daniel Deronda is unequivocally the most inherently flawless character ever created who does not bore the reader with his goodness. This is a big book to be sure, but it reads fast and there is much said about the appearances and prejudices of Victorian society. There are also many recurring themes and parallels to be on the lookout for. This is an intensely "smart" read, and for that reason it is one of my favorite Victorian novels ever---next to Dickens' "Dombey and Son" and "David Copperfield," that is.  I look forward to reading more of Eliot's work in the future. She was a brilliant writer and observer 
 The most beatiful collection of piano music i've ever heard.  Over the years I have bought this for at least a dozen people who became hooked on Yanni.  "In My Time" is my favorite. 
 Products: Sugar, coffee, tea, textiles, etc.  Areas: Asia, the Americas, Europe, Africa, etc. Economic issues: contracts, finance, property rights, information, technology.  I am familiar with a number of the areas Pomeranz and Topik describe and greatly appreciate their eclectic, realistic, universal viewpoint.  Highly recommend 
 I read this book to my first graders today. Although it feels like yesterday, I actually have read it since 1989, or enough years to have a fairly good working idea about which day to use it and how to use it within the learning environment.I recommend when you have passed the point in the year where you are still pulling for meaning. For me this is January, if I did my work now we are making connection, discussing, respecting others thinking and understand we are in a search for meaning making. Such is my room.    Carle creates books with bits of interactive spark, or a "catch", really for young children with a creative turn. It's obvious that he thinks in new and innovative ways even in the world of children's books which can be a field with innovation. At his best the idea reinforces obvious skills such as days of week or number pattern, and at times exceeds this with connection to understandings at a little bit higher level, a stretch if you will, for those students also listening with you who are divergent or visual, or perhaps learning to think in open ended or visioning ways. It might be said primary instruction is easily built around his work. With the right mind-set his work can push your children to think in dynamic ways.  Although currently in Under-performing schools with restrictive basic skill driven directed Instruction you see his pieces less and less as they aren't part of basal readers...really. It's just very strange.  Which brings me to something I really want to say first about this book. I really think it's better to buy the hardback version. As you read you will be exploring the color construct of ghost images and after staring a long while at a color image moving your head to see the after image on a white page, the next page. This is so much more sturdy and easier held and handled in the hardback. It's important to know this going in, if buying this for teaching or working with students or your child. This one I'd spend the money for sure.. I am using it as a piece in After-School arts programming so I thought I should start speaking to practicality.  The book looks at the color wheel. Often as a child I thought about color, liking to draw and finding I had a capacity to make images and respond in this manner to my world. I wondered how the color wheel, which teachers I thought then always dragged out to start the art year was so rather academically and boringly just their lack of insight into what to say...I hold to that.....(then of course they always started hounding  in on perspective)...well you sat learning opposites in colors. It's useful in color mixing (often they even forgot to tell you that)but long color wheel dialogs are dull. Kids don't retain it, it's purely "about" rather than 'is'. Carle gives you a taste of what American colorists and physics of light and color classes can bring to you.... science can bring.   Some lessons about how the brain and eye work.Wow. That's cool to do.    Just yesterday my husband spent hours discussing and presenting for me sophisticated material on how the brain perceives relative to light and where the 2.0 web is taking us artistically/perceptually or how it is "envisioned" in the new century...this shows children the 'rightness' and sourcing for these color pairs. How did we create the color wheel. Here is an answer. One having to do with how we work biologically.well at least for the young a start.. As each animal comes to a birthday party they are called by their opposite color name. A dot mid animal is stared at for some ten seconds, eyes are shifted to the opposite page where indeed the animal is now 'seen' as ghost image in the opposite color. It was fascinating to my students and they recalled the pairings after reading which frankly surprised me. At the start of the year after mixing colored waters they did not recall later which two made which color requiring many, many varied and rich experiences to 'get it" and kind of worrying me frankly about what kind of year this was going to be.  I have two things to say. It can really tire the eyes. It causes eye strain. I'd say its a fantastic book and way to do this with a warning you will tire their eyes. And you need to understand this isn't a really natural thing to repeat this many times. I go into this saying after they really do get the point they can stop if their eyes are tired and often they do self select that. We are obviously all different. It's an unusual experience and I think worth it. Magic eye posters used to do this to me, but I never saw those images having vision really just in one eye, so it's kind of like that...  The other thing I wanted to say was that I think this is best presented quietly, calmly and I like to follow it with painting. I have a Picasso project I use which talks of primary and secondary colors, too long for this to describe, but excellent for children to expand the color wheel concept. For me Joseoh Albers really turned me around about the use of color, the process one is using in making. There is often more applied science, more math, more calculation and more logic systems at work in creating than is understood by someone looking at a visual artist who additionally is conveying the "message", there is simply in color alone several physics courses of dialog taking places between the artist image, material and viewer tho I know many prefer to talk of artistic impulses, moods, mental states. Later as art evolves into perspective and into representations of symbolic meaning one again is really seeing as we look at master work such as Picasso the pictorial equivalent of the constructs and conceptions of Einstein. And interestingly as I now understand our medium to move to the images of media-screens in rooms lit in cyberland, as I hear of chips implanted in brains to alter the brains understandings of what's seen, I understand the functioning of light and brain in much richer way...... as taught in my math and science and immediately relate to the artistic implications. Some of us, as Carle does so well, relate idea through this construct. It is actually a thinking tool. Buckminster Fuller understood that very well. I don't think artists then "struggle for their art" except we struggle just exactly like everyone and to pay bills,  and to see and create these relationships what they often additionally struggle with is being understood in process of mind and brain....by those without the connection.Those who are in a sense idealizing them, projecting boheme on them. Additionally as Carle relates of his childhood when a teacher told his parent of his talent,changing their world view and changing his understanding of his validity over pathology,  the intelligence of the being if found in this form, in a world of few and fewer makers, is needing those who work with, or who surround these individuals to respond with some level of understanding of their gift.And my God the training they will undergo. It's enormous. It really seems to me using his work with students as a body of literature plugged into the school days broadens the experience and for some few students is an essential link to someone who 'sees' a bit differently.  My students were amazed by this and really ready to move into discussion of how the eye and brain work. We then looked at Escher and at Pop art-at the Talking Heads album cover-the red and green one from about 76 that danced perceptually to talk about visual field.Listened to music doing that too. Pretty extraordinary discussions for 6 year olds and much richer than ...this is "red". Thanks to Carle you have an artist teaching you about the science of his world and the practical daily understandings one is applying in rational decision making in work that some often discount as "art" or expression of inner demons or irrational process.  Okay I'm a first grade teacher and artist. If you are just a mom or pop, buy the book. You'll love it with your young child. 
 This book is a timely, fascinating and important read about the  common ground between Albert Einstein and members of the African American community of Princeton, NJ in the 40's. This book should be a requirement in every public library and recommended reading in many college & high school history curriculums. The example of fearlessness of Einstein, Robeson, DuBois and others in their activism against racism in America and abroad is one that needs to be emulated in today's society... if change is to come. The authors, Jerome and Taylor have produced and excellent literary work. 
 After switching from Mac OS to Windows a few years ago, I needed a PC-oriented magazine to get me well versed in the new vernacular.  I took a look at PC Magazine and was disgusted by the number of errors and the dearth of useful content; man, I thought, this is why Mac users laugh at PC guys.  Then I picked up PC World at the suggestion of a friend and, wow, within minutes I filled out the subscription card and sent for my subscription.  PC World is good because it's informative and useful.  It covers things you want to know as a PC user.  It does not slant toward hardware (like the modders-only Maximum PC) or software, and it doesn't waste space telling you why you should buy a Mac G5, which, oddly enough, PC Mag tries to do.  PC World is a well-balanced, informational magazine for general PC users.  If you want more expert-oriented stuff you might want things like Windows Mag or other more specific magazines, but for general computing, PC World is the best.  Each issue is packed with stuff you can use, either in your daily computing or to impress your friends at the new year's party 
 Although this album has gotten bad reviews in the past, I found it to be awesome!!!  Some of the songs aren't as satisfying as their original versions, their still awesome.  The covers aren't the best, but still pretty cool.  I highly reccomend this CD to anyone who likes ballads 
 I had never read anything by Anna Quindlen before so this was my first book.  I will be picking up more of her books as she proves to be a good author.  The story was on an excellent subject although it did jump back and forth quite a bit.  I am married and have never been in a situation like this character but the author easily made you feel the panic, fear and heart wrenching decision making in a way that made you understand the subject matter at hand with a more attentiveness to the real world.  
 As I said above the french NEO publishing dvd has a better transfer of cannibal ferox its enhanced (anamorphic, the black bars on the top on botom stertch when you play it on widescreen tv's) for 16:9 tv's for one theres no grain it has decent colors its a little bright but not too noticeable but unfortunately the audio is off-sync but with this movie it doesen't really because the lines and acting is crap anyway just make sure you have a multi region player before you bu 
 Author Nick T. Spark hit a home run with this one! The author's dogged detective work rewards the reader with a story that has more layers than my Italian grandmother's famous lasagna.    The story of Lt. Col. John Paul Stapp alone is worth the price of admission.This incredible man put his life on the line each time he strapped into the rocket sled to test the effects of enormous G forces on the human body. Eventually breaking the land speed record at 632 mph and loading his body with a staggering 46.2 G's. This fascinating story is enhanced with a healthy smattering of historical photo's...Great stuff!!    Using these legendary feats as a foundation, Mr.Spark unravels the mystery of the origins of Murphy's law. With the zeal of a test pilot groupie, Nick massages information from the living members and relatives of the rocket sled team who first coined the phrase "Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong". Of course after 50 years... fact and myth often collide, but that makes the story even more intriguing. I give this one a full five stars, truly a riveting read 
 I must say that the New Hermetics is a really fantastic Book. It's a shame that some people seem to mistake simplifying the mysteries with being too basic or even confused. This book is anything but basic. It teaches you all the necessary steps to take on the inward journey to enlightenment in a clear and concise way. I recommend it completely. So many other books waste time with verbal mush and arbitrary non-essentials. The New Hermetics cuts through all that and just delivers the specific mental strategies for getting to transcendent consciousness and balancing your life along the way. This is the soul's journey, laid out in an easy to understand way. If anyone thinks these exercises are too basic, they are probably looking to create confusion and complexity for themselves, rather than real self-discovery 
 that you will discover them very soon - buy this disc!  Seriously, I had vinyl of both of these releases in college and as CD's took over replaced my vinyl with this.  It's pure psychedelic power pop done right, combining sing along hook happy elements of the Beatles, ethereal layered guitar work with background electronics that really put it "out there".  Front man Mitch Easter of course played a hand in putting REM at the forefront of college radio and it's unfortunate that his excellent work with Let's Active never really made it into the mainstream consciousness.  Those who have heard it know.  Buy this, love it, and then move on to Big Plans for Everybody 
 This is an amazing story of one man's experience during the battle for Iwo Jima.  Jim Craig was a young lieutenant in charge of a platoon of Marines, commanding and protecting his men throughout one of the bloodiest battles in history.  Unlike in FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS, this book doesn't waste time on the story of the famous flag-raising episode.  That happened a few days into the battle.  Jim Craig continued his fight until the end of the month-long campaign, and never had time to notice a small event like a flag-raising.  This is the true story of Iwo Jima in all its ugly brutality--this book spares no punches.  You'll never look at war the same way again 
 As a current Weight Watchers member, I was interested in reading this book to see how the program "used" to be - what types of foods people used to eat on this program.  This is a collection of Weight Watchers recipe cards from the 1970s.  My Weight Watchers leader joined the program in the 1970s, so I bought the book for her, thinking she might recognize some of the recipes and get a kick out of seeing how much the program has changed since then.  I read the book quickly and plan on giving it to her soon and now I want to buy a copy for myself.  The pictures and commentary are absolutely hilarious!  I was literally LAUGHING OUT LOUD!  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is or has been on any kind of diet.  Really makes you realize what stupid things we will do to "lighten up" a recipe!  
 What has been perceived to be Mexican cuisine in this country - tacos, burritos, enchiladas - touches only the tip of the iceberg that represents the fulsome epicurean delights that await lucky visitors to that country. Fortunately, Lonely Planet saw fit to add Mexico to their line of World Food pocket guides, which have become almost as indispensable as their main country tour book titles. Author Bruce Geddes, a Toronto-based Mexicana aficionado, provides useful information about the surprisingly complex food culture south of the border, though with less emphasis on a historical perspective versus other entries in the series. I don't think he has as comprehensive an understanding of the culture he covers as others have displayed in the series.  Nonetheless, he spends an ample amount of space on Mexican staples and specialties, as well as the highly distinctive regional variations from the moles and chapulines (grasshoppers) of Oaxaca to Veracruz's incomparable seafood. The sections that resonate the most are the detailed descriptions of the expansive markets located in the major cities, including invaluable advice on what to look for and what to buy; a personal profile of Laura Esquivel, author of "Like Water for Chocolate"; the components of a Mexican banquet; and the city maps highlighting his favorite eateries. There are interesting thumbnail inserts on nueva cocina mexicana (new Mexican cuisine), a visit to a sleepy town called Bustamante famous for their breads and mezcal, and a history of the traditional watering holes called pulquerï¿½as.  I was fortunate enough to take lessons from chef Iliana de la Vega at her superb restaurant, El Naranjo, in Oaxaca, so I was able to use this book to guide me through the ingredients she had us use to prepare our specialty dishes. The book is truly invaluable for its definitive culinary dictionary, quick-reference glossary and the lengthy list of useful phrases necessary when ordering food and drink there. As with the other World Food books, there is an abundance of wonderful photographs to help you visualize the food, locales and people. In short supply unfortunately are truly distinct recipes. Regardless, this is a fine guidebook to have when exploring the best that Mexico has to offer for the palette 
 Instead of saying I liked this book, I think it would be better to say that I thought it was interesting. There were places throughout the book that I started to forget that this happened and think that it was fiction, or exagerated. Then I would remember that this is the story of Susanne Weksler's life when she was a little girl. This book also gave me a better understanding of the Holocaust and what went on because before we started the unit in school, I didn't even know what it was. It also helped me understand just how much these people went through 
 First of all, I would like to say that The Zone Diet has changed my life! I have clearer focus, and can think better, sleep better, and I'm happier. I bought this book thinking it would help me cook faster meals. Lynn Sears understands the dilemma, but the book doesn't really address how to eat quick Zone meals, and they are VERY expensive. So far I haven't been able to make one recipe because I can't afford ALL of the ingredients! However, the ideas, the advice about eating out, and everything except the recipes is extremely helpful. Borrow the book from someone first 
 This excellent book was written by psychiatrist Alexander Lowen in 1967.  It is one of the first books ever written that deals with body image from a psychological point of view.  Eating disorders and distorted body images have been prevalent for the past 20 years.  In this book, Dr. Lowen emphasizes that the body has its own wisdom and thus should not only be accepted, but respected and embraced as it is as well.  Topics such as the relationship between eating and sexuality and subjects' real and actual body images are discussed.  This book is a must read for anyone interested in improving their relationship with their body 
 This is a nice love story, a little dumbed down, but with a great message, the money may be the root of all evil, and what is important is the human heart.  This is a message that is badly needed in a very materialistic world.  Nicholas Cage is one of our finest commercial actors.  He proves is versatility in this picture.   What ever happened to Bridget Fonda??  J 
 I've read the book and the information is amazing. Backster never claims "proof" - but does use controls.  Here is an excerpt from a fact sheet available on his website: See Primary Perception Chapter Four  pages 64-70 Failures to Replicate CB: The AAAS symposium presentations by John Kmetz and Arthur Gasteiger revealed problems in their approach.  They made it obvious that they were not following proper automation procedures. The plants were in a holding room seven days in advance of their intended use. They then bathed the leaves with distilled water.  Any kind of experimenter contact with the plants prior to the actual experiment usage can compromise the experiment by allowing prior attunement between the plant and the researcher rather than the more subtle stimulus provided by the death of the brine shrimp.  John Kmetz had visited my New York City lab in October, 1973, and had ample opportunity to personally observe spontaneous events of biocommunication.  Upon his return to San Antonio, rather than to work out the problems involved in total automation and to eliminate human consciousness from his attempted replication of the plant-brine shrimp experiment, it appears that he found information concerning his then current failure in demand.  He was invited as a participant at the 1975 AAAS symposium mentioned earlier.  Rather than constructively pursuing biocommunication research, which I believe was the original function of the Science Unlimited Research Foundation, Kmetz apparently chose to capitalize on his failure to replicate.    Skepdic: "Backster clearly does not understand why scientists use controls in causal studies."  Anyone who has read either of Backster's published reports knows the opposite is true.  Biocommunication observations do not fit into the Scientific Method because they demand spontaneity in order to be authentic. He has always taken a great deal of time and trouble to demonstrate  that these recorded responses are not caused by "spurious electric signals within Backster's electronic equipment, amplified and recorded by a system not shielded for such spurious signals."  As Cleve says, You should not be down on what you are not up on. I say you should read a book before you try to review it! In this case, pass the information of Primary Perception on to the next generation.   
 Loved the book.   I'm now hooked on Nelson Demille's books. John Corey is the best character.  I hope they make this book in to a movie, and I'd like to see Tommy Lee Jones play him.  I think the ending was just perfect for the story.  Book was hard to put down. 
 this movie is most notable for being ripped off by quentin tarantino when he made 'his' film reservoir dogs. quentin=hack. this movie is much better, but don't watch it if you like reservoir dogs or quentin tarantino because you'll never view him or the movie the same way again 
 Alfred Jarry is the grandfather of modern day surrealism, and the Ubu trilogy is a great, twisted work of genius.  It reads like Shakespeare crossed with a slasher film.  It's also a great parody of anything you can  think of, and it is quite hilarious.  The Ubu trilogy deals with the epic  rise and fall of Pa and Ma Ubu, as they become Kings of several European  countries, get involved in murder more than once, fight in wars, have  deadly encounters with bears in caves, and even voluntarily become slaves.   Great stuff!  If you like Samuel Beckett, then you have to check out Jarry  too 
 Scott Barrie is absolutely incredible.  This book is precise, complete, and can help anyone thoroughly understand the commodity and options markets.  This is, by far, the most "user friendly" futures book I've ever read.  Great information.  Also, I had the fortunate experience to see Scott speak at a seminar and I discovered some highly profitable trading information that has made me quite a bit of money.  Scott is highly recommended 
 For those of you who have read the book you will understand what my title means. The wonderful laugh that is ready to send terror through the heart of the agent of the French Revolution, and chills of excitement and happiness through yours. And a song bearing despair and hope.  This is a wonderful book! I started and finished it within a day. The first chapter is a little gruesome but not overly so, seeing that it is set in the  French Revolution. If you keep reading though, you are caught within two chapters. The entire book is an emotional roller coaster. So if you don't like books that will keep you up till all hours of the night reading, this book is not for you. The Scarlet Pimpernel is one of the most wonderful men that ever didn't live. And so let us all break out and ask, "Is he in Heaven? Is he in Hell?" "That demmed elusive Pimpernel."  - 
 Chinese painting is full of wonders. While three thousand years in one volume seems quite ambitious, this book provides an useful introduction to the subject with clear historical outlines and good selection of images. I would think that the texts sometimes might appear lacking of details and thorough researches to students and scholars of Chinese art, but they would still appreciate large and good quality color reproductions and well-organized structure of the book 
 Historical coverage by a man who was there and reported as though he was a reporter. Covers events and decisions from the Reagan era, in the mid-east to the year this book was printed from the view point of a man in the White House familiar with the CIA, NSA the military leaders and their political/military decisions of that era. Hard to put this book down as each page is packed with action! A must read for those tired of current day biased reporting by the media. This "report" seems more "fair and balanced" than the reporting in the news we hear everyday 
 If you love the music of Jeff Lynne in ELO, you will LOVE this CD. I am a very picky fan of The Beatles and Jeff, and this CD has been a constant in my player since its release. "Blown Away" is a fantastic song, and sums up the "Armchair Theatre" experience for me...gawd, I love Jeffy... 
 Return to Sodom and Gomorrah, recounts the volcanic eruption at the major Minoan port on what is now known as Santorini. The shear power of the blast, the wide distribution of the ash cloud and the tsunamis that followed, were of "mythic proportions" and engendered myths. According to another of my favorite books, When They Severed Earth from Sky (E.W.&P. Barber), myths are the result of oral histories being compacted and altered in predictable ways over millennia. In trying to decode the events described in them, it is important to adopt the viewpoint of the participants. Noah's flood, for instance, need not have covered the world known to us. As Pellegrino points out, the disaster probably covered the Fertile Crescent, the world as known to the original witnesses.  There are accounts of the Thera eruption encoded in the Greek story of Atlantis and in Egyptian writings as well as in the Exodus story in the Bible. Unfortunately, there haven't been enough early Minoan writings uncovered to help in the deciphering of Linear A. It is hoped that as the extensive city on Santorini is excavated, more writings will be discovered. Linear B is related to early Greek, but they don't have a clue as yet what Linear A is related to.   What impressed me most was that the Minoans, protected by the sea and engaged in widespread trade on it, did not seem to have to fight to have influence in the ancient world. They prospered and developed a superior culture in peace. They had art that inspired the Greeks and plumbing rivaling our own.   (They had flush toilets and showers with hot and cold running water.) Unlike their successors, they apparently did not relegate women to an inferior position. Pellegrino makes the connection with their veneration of the bull and the older Catalhoyuk culture in nearby Turkey. Perhaps future excavations of the even older city, below that destroyed by the giant blast, will illuminate that possibility further.   After the volcano destroyed much of their territory and undermined their economy, the Mycenaeans, the Indo-European ancestors of the Greeks, took control.  Minoans scattered and some became the "sea people" of the Bible, the Philistines.   Because they were the enemy of the protagonists in the Bible, the Philistines have had a bad press for many years. There are some excavations going on that paint a more realistic picture.  That brings me to another point that struck me in the Pellegrino book. Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed; therefore they must have been wicked. From the point of view of the witnesses, it had to be the wrath of God therefore they had to have sinned. Pellegrino suspects that natural gas deposits in that oil and gas rich region may have exploded causing the destruction as described in the Bible.   
 The most frequently performed opera in history, Gian Carlo Menotti's Amahl and the Night Visitors introduces a widowed shepherd woman and her crippled son Amahl, who are out of food, wood for the fire, and oil for their lamp, and will have to go begging the next day.  Suddenly, the Three Kings, who are following a star to Bethelehem, arrive at their cottage needing a place to stay for the night.  Though Amahl (Robert Sapolsky) is delighted by the excitement, his mother is in a state of extreme stress.  Unless she gets help, she and Amahl may starve.  In a powerful duet, King Melchior (Giorgio Tozzi) describes the child to whom they plan to give all their gifts, while the agonized mother (Teresa Stratas) sings about her own child, just as worthy and perhaps more needy.  In the ensuing scenes, the first Christmas miracle occurs.   For someone unfamiliar with the story, this video beautifully captures the dynamics of the opera--the emotional tensions, the gap between the poor and the very rich, and the social milieu into which the Christ Child was born.  The protectiveness of the mother, the enthusiasm of Amahl (a child who is constantly excited by life), and the lives of the shepherds are clearly portrayed.  The problems with the video are a result of its age.  The colors have faded, the voices are fuzzy, the sound quality, after thirty years, lacks the depth which newer recording equipment provides, and in the shepherds' ballet, the choreography does not fit the small screen.    For anyone who knows the opera or who may have access to the libretto, however, these are problems which are more than outweighed by the sheer drama of the live performance.  Menotti has created a story with which mothers, fathers, and young children can identify because he succeeds in capturing the humanity of the characters--the child who exaggerates and does not come when he is called, the mother who will do anything to save her child, the kindness of one of the kings.  Directed by Arvin Brown, and starring Teresa Stratas, Giorgio Tozzi, and Nico Castel, all of the Metropolitan Opera, Willard White of the New York City Opera, and a young boy soprano, Robert Sapolsky, the cast brings opera to life for families who love music.

 I like Cottonelle, but I prefere the packages that fill one container each, rathar than these larger packages 
 What I really enjoy about this cook book is the simplicity of some of the recipes. It makes you wish you had thought of them. Many do ahead tips that will get you out of the kitchen fast with a meal that seems to have taken far longer to prepar 
 It's not often a book can make a person laugh out loud, but if there was one book that could guarantee it, it would be Steven Appleby's Encyclopedia of Personal Problems. Mr. Appleby is a creative genius. If you are a fan of Gary Larson (The Far Side), Matt Groening (Simpsons, Life in Hell), or have a warped sense of humor at all, this book is indispensable. The illustrations are brilliant, and the book is penned competeley in freehand. It's written like an encyclopedia, so you can look up a specific "personal problem", or just pop it open at random for a good laugh. I don't know if one could survive reading it cover to cover. It made my sister laugh to the point of tears after only one page. I warned you 
 Christmas gift for my elderly neighbor - he was happy with the selection!  Easy order process and quick delivery 
 It's a story about three women getting back at their husbands for dumping them for younger (and blonder) models. They were friends in college, but drifted apart and had a reunion on the funreal of the fourth friend, who comitted suïcide after her husband left her - for a younger, blonder model... The three women decide to get back at their husbands and Cynthia's too. I read the book in one big haul, it's really good. OK, it's light reading, it's no Kundera or Marquez, but it's well written and it made me laugh out loud (so it's not recomended to read it on the train: you'll get funny looks). It's ten times better than the movie, which was nice, but they really changed the story, due to the limited time they have in a movie. The real story is far too complex to cram in a 100 minute movie 
 I loaned this book to one of my friends who was a lawer.  I never got it back.  Nuff said 
 The Art of Computer Programming is a classic from Professor Knuth.  this is required CS reading and should be required for every programmer 
 I just thought this book was flat-out funny, for kids and adults.  Although most of the humor is in the pictures, there's a little bit mixed in with the text as well.  Before reading this book, I didn't know that most dinosaur skeletons in museums were actually copies of real-life skeletons.  But when you think about it, it makes sense.  I mean, how many complete authentic T-rex skeletons are out there?  Not too many.  Got to have copies if you want people to see skeletons.  I kept looking for the author's last name in this book but never found it.  And you know, I always thought I'd be a paleontologist when I was a kid, and even though I don't want to be one anymore, it's still fun to read great stuff like this 
 This book was very interesting. I loved the way this book shows how Mexicans suffer, struggle and work hard to get what they need to survive. This book has a good way of showing the different types of experiences the family goes through. It gets to a point where you get so into the book that you get frightened of what could happen to the family next. You don't know if the family is going to get caught by the border patrol or if you're going to be able to find a job for the next season. You just don't know if your going to be able to survive the only thing you have in your hands is hope and faith. 	There was nothing that I could hate about this book the only thing that I hated was to read about how bad this family suffered. It hurts to see how your own people gets discriminated but, it's ok because this family like many other Mexicans have still succeeded after all the things they have to go trough, like being discriminated. Other than that there is nothing to dislike about this book. 	I would definitely recommend this book for everybody especially for people who like this family is an illegal immigrant in this country. I would like for the anti-immigrant people to read this book so they can see that no matter what they do to try to stop the immigrants from succeeding the immigrants will never stop trying no matter what they do to try to stop them. This book is a great book I am sure that this story has repeated itself many times by other Mexican families. I am also sure that it will keep repeating itself for many years, but there is always a limit and the day will come when the Mexicans will be treated the same as everybody else in this country. There are many illegal immigrants that have been more successful in life than the people that are legal in this country, and it kills the anti-immigrants to know this is true. 	 
 I just loved this entire series as did my 7 year old daughter.  The story revolves around three girls who are living with their aunt while their parents are overseas.  They play, create and have lovely, lighthearted adventures.  Each girl is given her own unique personality, her own style.  The illustrations are so sweet, so detailed.  My only regret is not having bought this series in hardcover as my daughter has read and re-read it so many times 
 I purchased this video monitor based on the reviews to help me care for my elderly mother who is under hospice care.  It has been wonderful to be able to check on her without staying constantly at her bedside or running back and forth from one end of the house to the other.  The picture quality is great and the sound is amazing - I can detect changes in her breathing from the other end of the house! I would highly recommend one to anyone in a caregiver situation or for parents to watch over their children.  It will definitely be put to use when grandchildren come along 
 This was probably one of the best books I've ever read. The way the writer had the character going through all the problems that we as teenagers have to deal with every day is really awesome. As Max transitions from the uptight person he is in the beginning of the book to the laid back sort of party guy he is near the end, it all makes perfect sense and its not like in your face about it. 
 Freitas book is a nice, cheap, and handy reference to war films.  Each film is rated on a standard scale of 1 to 5.  Each has about five inches (about two paragraphs worth) of commentary on the film and one inch of what the critics said.  Freitas's rating does not always correspond to my own, but then he has his opinions and I have mine.  He is never very far off the mark on the opinion of a film.  His list of the 25 best has a lot of overlap with my own list and gives me some more good films to look for.  The book is from a publisher I had not heard of and the proofreading in the book leaves a little to be desired.  There are spelling errors the editor should have caught.  And speaking of spelling errors, every place the book has been listed, including Amazon, seems to misspell the author's name.  He is Freitas, not Frietas 
 This quote begins Irene Gut Opdyke's tale of heroism and courage.  The quote comes from the local minister after he learned the story of the family dog saving a young Irene from falling into the river.  The priest's proclamation could not have come more true.  As a young adult in Poland, Irene's childhood ended with the Nazi invasion.  Relocated from her family for her nursing skill, Irene was well traveled by the war's end.  In the most unlikley of circumstances, Irene found herself as the housekeeper of a German officer.  Just before this promotion, she had begun illegally sending food to the Jewish ghetto.  So while working in the German officer's house, she took a bolder step.  She hid several Jews in the cellar of the house.  If she was caught, her execution would have been certain.  She sacrificed dignity and humiliation in order to preserve the lives of those she protected.  In a twist of fate, it was many of the same Jews that she helped survive the war that helped her to settle after the war.  It is often forgotten that many Germans and Europeans did not support the Nazis.  With this in mind, many Christians were hiding Jews and helping them to survive until the fall of the Nazi regime.  Because my own grandmother kept several Jews on her farm during the war in Poland, this book struck a personal chord in me.  This is a side of the Holocaust and World War II that is not often told.  For her bravery and her book, I commend Irene Gut Opdyke.  Her story is so good, it is almost beyond belief 
 A collection of the best Muppets songs.  Kermit and miss Piggy in duet. What I don't like is Fozzie interrupting the music. Just skip those tracks 
 This book is scary, classical, fun, and one of the best books. It's anything you would want. This book is the best!!!  Joe, Wishbone, Samantha, and David go on a scavenger hunt to win a $100 gift certificate for Oakdale sports and games.

      Brett Pulley pulls together one of the most in depths pieces ever written on a black businessman, not just any black businessman, but the man behind BET. Brett pulls all stops on getting the nitty gritty on BET from the first scandal to Bob Johnson's billion dollar deal with Viacom. Pulley reaches into the black community, along with the media world and close personal friends of Johnson to get the story of a lifetime.  Robert L Johnson is an even-tempered businessman with his heart set on making a deal as cheap as possible. He started BET with a $ 15,000 loan and thus paving the way for many up and coming African American entertainment moguls. Those who know Johnson personally would say he put the E in BET, which stands for entertainment. According to this book, Bob pulled out of business deals at the last minute, because he didn't want to put up a bulk of money to front the cost of production or any thing else he felt that was considered unnecessary. But Johnson always stood by his word and made powerful decisions, as he felt necessary. From the day he met his $15,000 obligation he built his way to a billion dollar deal with media powerhouse Viacom and went on to buy the Charlotte Bobcats of the NBA and the Charlotte Stings of the WNBA.   This book fits any American who understands what its like to have a dream and sit down and make the plans to achieve this dream to its fullest. The book itself allowed me to look at someone else go through the trial and tribulations of building an idea into a multibillion dollar situation it allows anyone with dreams to see hope.  
 Peter Drucker, the father of management science, serves up another multi-layered delight. ``The New Realities,'' published in 1990, is a book acknowledging the arrival of ``the knowledge society.'' Don't be put off because the book is at least 14 years old. Any person who wants to be better informed about the Information Age circa 2004 would do well to read this work.    Drucker brings so much in his writing. Just reading his definitions makes one pause and think. Try this one on knowledge (page 251 of the paperback edition) -- ``Knowledge is information that changes something or somebody -- either by becoming grounds for action, or by making an individual (or an institution) capable of different and more effective action.'' Adding...``And this little of the new `knowledge' accomplishes.''     Provocative chapter headings include ``The End of FDR's America,'' ``Now That Arms Are Counterproductive,'' ``The Post-Business Society,'' and ``When the Russian Empire Is Gone'' (yes, he saw it coming.). Drucker is provocative but he's no partisan. Can anyone tell if Drucker is a Republican, a Democrat or neither? I can't. Perhaps one day he'll tell us.     The greatest thing about Drucker is that for all his conceptualizing he doesn't forget the human dimensions of what he's writing about. Here's an example (p. 206) -- ``And still the knowledge society -- with a social mobility that threatens to become rootlessness, with its `other half,' its dissolution of the ties of farm and small town and their narrow horizons -- needs community, freely chosen yet acting as a bond.''     The book's conclusion is not what I would describe as a grand slam. Yet the last paragraph is, as one might expect, a thought-provoker. It is Drucker pointing out the need for a new philosophical synthesis.      An excellent book. I recommend it.  
 Great book for any Porsche entusiast.  Excellent coverage on the engines types, changes to body, suspensions, etc.  If you want to get technical the infomration is also there.   If you love Porsche this is a book to have 
 I loved the first edition of this book, and this revised edition is even better, incorporating much new archaeological evidence. As a historical fiction writer, currectly writing a novel about the Vikings, books like  this are invaluable to me. This is my #1 reference book. Not only does it  contain a tremendous amount of information, Roesdahl has organized it  exceptionally well, such that it is always easy to find exactly what I'm  looking for. As a read-through book, I also found it captivating and not in  the least bit dry. Replete with maps, diagrams and photos, it is an  invaluable learning tool for anyone interested in this time in history. One  of the aspects I particularly appreciate is that Roesdahl has a  Scandinavian perspective, viewing the Vikings as a legitimate Norse  civilization, with a vibrant, artistic, agricultural and exploratory  culture, more than as pagan invaders of the rest of civilized Europe. Yes,  there were some ruthless invaders amongst them, but many writers are too  focused on that aspect. The book starts with a look at the sources of  information we have about the Vikings, the written sources, place names and  archaeological evidence. Knowing the sources on which our knowledge is  based is extremely important, so we won't be so readily hoodwinked into  believing faulty interpretations. Roesdahl then looks in excellent detail  at Scandinavian geography, people, language, history, religion, art, etc. A  wonderful feel for the times and culture is gained. The next focus is Norse  expansion, their conquests and settlements in Britain, Russia and the  Baltics, and west to Iceland, Greenland and North America. Finally, she  concludes with the lasting significance of these Norse peoples and the  so-called Viking Age. I would highly recommend this book to anyone  seriously interested in Viking history 
 A handy book that includes timesaving techniques from microwave oven jams to quick pickles, classic recipes such as Strawberry Jam and Canned Tomatoes as well as exciting new recipes including Christmas Conserves and Four Citrus Marmalade. Recommended.  Janet Sue Terry - author of "A Rich, Deliciously Satisfying Collection of Breakfast Recipes".   
 As an incurable trivia nut, this book helped delve into areas that are normally avoided. There is a lot of fascinating information and the author does a great job of looking across more than just Christianity to includee Judiasm and Islam, emphasizing the common roots of all three. Every so often I would come across one part and find myself saying "wow, I never knew that." Soemtimes, well you have to take the author's word on things; I would find his explination reasonable just not what I thought to be true. My vocabulary expanded as I finally learned what a number of things are called. It is a good book to peruse in bursts - reading a bit here, then putting it down to return a day or two later. A welcome counterpoint to the more dense or philosophical writings about religion 
 In the last few decades historians --following sociologists such as Durkheim-- have turned their attention to the ways in which new technologies have altered people's experience of space and time.  Schivelbusch's small piece is a pretty good (but light-weight) example of  this genre. He reveals some interesting trivia along the way: he tells, for  example, how padded upolstery was invented to assuage the fears of  first-class passengers brought about by the roughness of new speed; he  shows that compartment design in passenger cars reflect the contrasting  social values of Europe and America. But he is at his most interesting when  describing the ways in which the railroad created new conceptual forms of  geographical distance by obliterating the spaces in between destinations.  Furthermore, by creating the need for standardized time-tables, railways  nurtured a standardized/homogenized conception of time. Local  idiocyncracies became less important. Doubtless true national identities  could never have emerged without revolutions in transportation and  communications. A book that takes these ideas much further is Stephen  Kern's excellent work "The Culture of Time and Space." If this  genre interests you, Kern's book is an important read 
 It's so nice to see Jackie McLean's "Jackie's Bag" back in print via Blue Note's RVG Series.  I had the good fortune to pick up this fine disc in its original offering back in the early 90s.  "Jackie's Bag" combines material from two sessions -- three songs from 1/18/59 and six songs from 9/1/60 -- on one disc. The tracks "Appointment In Ghana," "A Ballad For Doll," "Isle Of Java," "Melonae's Dance," and "Medina" are from the 9/1/60 session featuring Jackie, Tina Brooks, Blue Mitchell, Kenny Drew, Paul Chambers, and Art Taylor.  A sixth track from that date also included here, "Street Singer," is also available on Tina Brooks' "Back To The Tracks," a limited edition Blue Note that is most likely still in print.  These six previously mentioned tunes are the highlight of the album -- what a magnificent band!  The disc's first three tracks, "Quadrangle," "Blues Inn" and "Fidel," are from the 1/18/59 session featuring Jackie with Sonny Clark, Donald Byrd, Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones.  While I'm a huge Sonny Clark fan, these three tunes have always left me a little cold -- maybe that is why Alfred Lion stopped the date after only three songs.  Despite this, this is an outstanding CD, and with improved remastering and new liner notes, no Blue Note fan should be without it 
 As gifted a story teller as he is a veterinarian, James Herriot has the rare ability to bring out every emotion known to the human race with a single magical flick of his pen. Every Living Thing is without a doubt one of the crowning achievements of a master, and is possessed by a single, true trait that is difficult to find in many commercial books- every single tale is told straight from the heart. You will never fail to laugh at the hilarious tales and cry at the most poignant moments. If you're an animal lover, or even just have a passing interest in animals, this is a book you will hold on to and re-read until the end of your days. Kudos, James Herriot, you are very much missed 
 This is a wonderful album of Gaither hymns sung with T. E. Ford's deep, rich voice. A must to own 
 this book has made me stop wasting my time with secondary new things and try to focus onthe top books. i thank rexroth for getting  me to read f m ford's "some do not..." , a really great  novel. his remarks on  homer are great,and his comments make wonderful reading 
 Though the pagecount may seem misleading considering some pages only contain a line or two of text, the book is a 7 x 6 installation piece as well as a good read. The text seems to act as a character throughout the book due to it's continuously interesting style and placement as well as it's ability to mimic the emotion invoked in the poem. A must have for anyone who enjoys new art and isn't afraid of deep thoughts 
 The novel moves rather slowly in the beginning, but when the character R.P. McMurphy arrives, it begins to move more quickly. Kesey succeeds in describing the scene and the emotions of the characters and the events that take place in the novel. The descriptions are so vivid that it makes the reader feel as if they are there with the other patients looking on. The reader is also able to feel what the characters feel through the descriptions. The Big Nurse's emotions and expressions are especially emphasized. Her coldness, fakeness, and domination over the patients are conveyed throughout the novel and are really brought out when she is provoked by McMurphy.  The novel is narrated by one of the patients in the asylum, Chief Bromden.  Because he is a patient in the mental institution, it is vital for the reader to realize that and not believe everything he says. Bromden is in the institution for a reason and so reality and his imagination are mixed together to form his reality.  The main theme of the novel is the struggle for power between authority and normal people, between woman and men.  
 Colorful large portraits of Smallville Cast. After you're done with the calender, photos are suitable for framing. Great for any Smallville Fan 
 The Savory Way is a wonderful vegetarian cook book without being noticeably vegetarian. I have been working my way through the cook book since I received it as a gift in September '99 and have yet to discover any  bad recipes. Some I've even made twice. The recipes are easy to follow and  don't require very unusual ingredients. I would recommend this cook book to  anyone interested in cooking good food that is not ordinary 
 A book with nearly everything going for it...animals, young people, science, fantasy, humor and a love story.....and written by one of the great authors of the 20th century.  Lewis, the trumpeter swan without a voice, is very real to the reader,certainly this reader.  It is a joy for adults, young and old.  This is a book I read once a year, and one I delight in giving as a gift 
 I purcheased this book for my son who needed it for his photography class in college. He has found it easy to understand and very imformative 
 After the Academy Awards were presented for the films of 2001, I happened to notice that PEARL HARBOR was passed over, ignored and generally disregarded. I had a violently negative reaction to this film when I saw it in the theatre. I just remember saying to myself that it will probably earn an award for Special Effects and that's about the extent of it. However, when PEARL HARBOR got trounced at the presentation it just somehow seemed like an injustice to me. I watched it again at home. The half-hour or so of the actual Japanese attack was generally impressive visually, dramatically and emotionally. A lot of research and technical work went into recreating the attack. It is so much more moving now than when I first saw it, not just that sequence but the whole film. It is apparent now that I was very wrong about this film. It is touching, poignant and inspiring. I liked the inclusion of the Doolittle Raid showing America's response to strike at the heart of our enemy. Even though it was strategically a token retaliation, the message of America's will and determination to bring the fight to the enemy will never be deterred.   After 5 years have passed one wonders what all the negative fuss about this film was about in the first place.  
 Originally written edited April 14, 2005:  There is no other like Mariah. It's like listening to an Angel sing. Her voice is unique from all the other power house female vocalists. It's powerful but at the same time has an innocence, softness, clarity, beauty, and tranquil quality that is so completely mesmerizing. She is unparalleled. This is why no contestant on AI has ever attempted to sing one of her songs. Mariah is simply untouchable. She is an amazing talent that can sing, but can also write & produce her own songs and has done so from the start of her career. She debuted at #1 her 1st week on billboard. As for all the haters.... screw'em....it's not worth wasting my time. I just skip over their reviews, because obviously they need hearing aids. First, I think this is the best album of her career. It's hard to decifer because I love them all, but MC has really hit the jackpot with this one. It's a real work of art that offers an assortment of beautiful ballads and addictive dance/club/R&B tracks. Her next single should be either "Mine Again", "Get Your Number", or "Stay the Night". As always her genuine & sincere lyrics are well written, mature, articulate, and conveyed with pure emotion. I also love the angel-like look of the cd cover. She looks absolutely beautiful. As I previously mentioned, I have alot of respect for Mariah because she is the only superstar songstress that utilizes every aspect of her talent in writing and producing her songs (w/ the exception of Christina[Stripped] who is beginning to). This cd is magnificent. GO BUY THE CD & LETS CONTINUE THE #1 REIGN ON THE CHARTS. GO OUT & GET IT NOW!!!!! YOU WILL LOOOOOOOOVE IT.....I'M BACK.... SHE HAS SLIPPED TO #2 ON THE BILLBOARD THE 2ND WEEK, WHICH IS STILL RESPECTFUL.... BUT WE NEED TO HELP HER REBOUND BACK TO # 1.....PASS THE WORD....WE HAVE TO SUPPORT HER.... Update: You must get the Platinum addition, whihc includes 4 additional tracks.  If you get it at Target it includes an additional track that is inclusive to Target stores.  The track is "Sprung"....I cannot understand why this track was not included with the Platinum addition.  It is one of my favorites.  The beat is so funky, smooth, and is completely off the hook.  I recommend getting the Platinum addition at Target to get the "Sprung" track.  Believe me you will be "Sprung" out of your seat and onto the dance floor. 
 The Way of the World, a classic example of comedy of manners, did not immediately appeal to me. My first reading was the Crofts Classic edition (published 1951, reprinted 1985), edited by Henry T. E. Perry. On the plus side the introduction illustrates how William Congreve adroitly uses dialogue to reveal much about the personalities of his characters. In addition, there is a valuable section titled The Argument of the Play, in which Perry summarizes events that occurred prior to the beginning of the play.  The major drawback to the Crofts edition is that the stage directions are limited, sometimes making it difficult for me to recognize the intent of the dialogue. More than once I lost track of the shifting relationships, romantic and otherwise.  However, my second reading - this time an edition published by Barron's Educational Series (1958) - proved more enjoyable, largely due to the plentiful stage directions and indications of expression. Pluses include a lengthy introduction by Vincent Hopper and Gerald Lahey, a 5-page note on staging by George Hersey, and illustrations by Fritz Kredel.  Indications of expression - essentially guidance to actors on the proper delivery of the dialogue - are inserted in parenthesis as the dialogue switches from one character to another. Example stage directions include: "somewhat sourly recollecting the rebuff of the previous evening" and "using frankness as a bait to draw equal frankness from her companion" and "too preoccupied to pay serious attention".   The Play:  The first three acts involve little action; the scenes focus on introducing and contrasting characters, highlighting witty dialogue, and slowly revealing details of prior events through casual references. Polite, formalized language disguises selfish motives, rivalries, deceit, and deviousness. The action - certain steps to overcome obstacles to a marriage - does not occur until the fourth act.   The resolution in act five is not wholly unexpected, but may be unsettling to modern sensibilities: the marriage between Mirabell and Millamant proceeds only after both are assured that their financial situation will not be jeopardized. Love is a secondary concern. Similarly, the unpleasant situation of Mrs. Fainall - a marriage without any pretence of love - remains unchanged.  It may not be easy to find a copy of the older Barron's edition, but it will be worth the effort. Better yet, try to find both the Barron's and Crodfts editions as they complement each other. I give The Way of the World a four-star ranking 
 I've been through a lot of salt and pepper grinders over the years, and was never happy with any of them.  Most required too much effort to use and hurt my hands.  Then I found this wonderful grinder, and have never looked back!  It is so easy to squeeze that my arthritic fingers have no trouble with it!  I just love this grinder!  I'm buying a bunch more as gifts for friends and family 
 This book was an end of year gift June 2006 given to our underperforming elementary school staff in Oxnard,California in the Hueneme School District.  I have invested 21 years in trying to bring to my job the attributes and kinds of integrity the book calls for in teaching children. In my career, I've been given one book on what we're here to do (this is it), and I've given many books to staff, principals, and friends on our school site with the hope we might enter into more dialogs on public education and our role in educational leadership. That kind of discussion often feels risky to leadership; it has yet to occur enough at Hathaway, my site--it's pretty top down in the real world. And so the gift of a book oriented towards an "internal reflection on teaching" is a very good sign in a rather dark time for educators of children in poverty. Teachers need these starting points to think about what we do.  The first thought I had receiving this book, besides thank you, was that I "could" read it, having been told by our principal that it would probably be too hard and that we should "stick with the text." I suspect that as a staff we are not viewed as desiring to synthesize texts on education in our daily lives. That perception is not really a good fit, the staff is very able to read to meaning. They are also teaching in very difficult times, with difficult language/societal issues falling on their shoulders and with difficult issues confronting them from NCLB and the requirement that students produce results,and most teachers lack connection often times to their student successes. This causes a ho-hum at such a book at first..   The second thought I had after a first read was how the text might be reshaped considerably by a person who actually taught in public schools for 25 years and who has encountered legislated reform within their walls and what that has done to affect the kinds of teacher empowerment that is recommenmded here.   At this point in my career, I need inspirational works, stories of success and the "why we are here" in part to offset the difficulties teaching within failures of systems, within peer groups that act out of self interest and self involvement too much of the time, and in times where it's hard to drag a leader into the position to lead--much less have them lead towards educational improvement and use reform to wisely shape the school. We seem to lose our leadership every three years. There are many fine and inspirational points made and many lecture circuit head nodding happy characterizations to be gleaned.There is much to help you feel less alone in a teaching world often a Catch-22, reset in a CA. public ed setting. Teaching in my world knowing daily you are asked to do that which is not exactly the right thing and told you are not the right person to do the thinking in the model about what might work better.    The text talks to courage and it is also possible that fundamental educational shifts to disadvantage the poor guised as Standards based education have been closing the mouths of teachers fearing rightly the times we are in. To my mind it is not courage we lack, or character, we lack individuals who fundamentally are able to understand the bigger picture and who can be our Rosa Parks. Hiring is not looking for individuals of quality. One need only apply for teacher work in Orange County to encounter a Gallup survey to initially screen applicants in which "I plan to write a book" is one of the qickie disqualifiers to keep on going towards getting in to an interview irregardless of your ability or background. So teachers right from the get go who are there to "make a difference" may well not be hired to do so.  To understand the ground as it is right now for a teacher who might enter the field value centered around a desire to help the less fortunate.....well you may need to see what Personnel offices listen for to get through the door.So courage is just a piece of the puzzle.    Then too, I'm watching fantastic peers early retire in droves. Escaping.      While I acquire an inner voice and refine teaching praxis and center on self and my capacity to connect and make meaning for students.... my District, as are many, are completely scripting our voice, removing my ability to make meaning, dictating what occurs today, taking literature decisions out of teacher hands and doing so to "improve instruction". I believe  many use their courage to remove themselves from these choices , they leave the profession, and these kinds of fundamental issues are pretty down and dirty. But I do appreciate a book talking to the spirit of the job I once was able to do and once proud of being involved in doing. Public education is /was a calling of the heart 
 It is a really enjoyable and good book. This book is all about one of my favorite holidays. I really like the illustration of the king goblin. I like how the words and the illustrations match 
 I watched this movie not knowing all that much about about the whole Mothman phenomenon, so fortunately wasn't in a position to have my expectations dashed.  I guess that's the thing about movies based on real or alleged events, and there's not much that can be done about it if you've already read up on the whole incident.  The movie should be taken for what it is, a good, spine chilling paranormal thriller.  The Special edition includes a 50 minute documentary on the 1960s Mothman sightings on which the movie is based.  Very interesting in its own right 
 Besides that outdoor temperature and relative humidity, I use the base station inside along with three remote wireless monitors to measure temperature and humidty in my crawlspace, attic and outdoors to monitor possible water intrusion issues and if there are freezing temperature concerns for the pipes during cold weather periods 
 Although I keep my Amazon.com profile location as being in Hawaii (I used to live there), I currently work in lower Manhattan. Pete Hamill's book was a joy to read. I was able to read a chapter in the book and then take the subway to the location Hamill described so beautifully and view the area through a different lens. Downtown is half New York City history and half autobiographical. Yet, because Hamill has spent his whole life in New York and has come to know it so well, the autobiographical parts of the book become a history of New York described by one of the City's most respected residents. This book is excellent and should be read by those interested in New York City as well as those merely looking for a fascinating story. The history and story of New York City is largely the history of the United States. And for that reason, this book is for everyone. 
 Some people would criticize this book for not being the historical end all analysis of Hitler's relationship with his niece.  I don't feel that's important.  No one should base their opinions off of one book.  This is  just one of the many you should read on the subject.  Ronald Hayman takes  an approach that many others haven't by concluding that Hitler's abnormal  relationship with his niece may have spawned the genocidal impulses latent  within him.  That's one man's opinion.  And it's an enjoyable one to read  as the author is very articulate.  But don't leave your research here.   Continue on.  Others have written on the subject (who are just as biased as  the sources Hayman uses).  One must find their own opinion of what's out  there and to do so you'll need to read this book 
 This is a warm and readable book about a fascinating subject: What happens at death, or near death? It is written by a world renowned and respected scholar and medical doctor. And, in spite of the fact that I am a Christian, with conservative beliefs, and even though I maintain my faith carefully focused on God, I do nevertheless give the accounts in this book some credence (along with its companion, written subsequently, "Life Beyond Death").  I invite you to read it and see why 
 This book contains big color photographs of interiors; reference guide at the end of the book detailing resources of Arts and Crafts literature and furnishing 
 Okay all you Buffyheads, if you liked anything you ever heard by Steve Merritt and friends, you'll find this witty, sometimes poignant, unexpectedly tuneful song collection a CD you'll play more and more as time goes by. I know I have.  It's not all about vampires, but many songs are, and most of the rest touch upon time passing, death looming, and, of course, love. Like a lot of Lou Reed, sometimes these songs are as musically sweet as ABBA, and yet they're edgy, sometimes dark, and mordant. "Losing Your Affection" still has the power to make me smile after two years of regular play. But behind the exuberant word play, the underlying bittersweet sentiment remains true for anyone who has ever been deeply in love and had it returned. "Thousand Lovers in a Day" just seemed perverse on first hearing. On rehearing, it became a mournful and defiant response to the recognition that youth is rushing by way faster than we want. One or two tracks remain a bit weak, but for me (an admitted Merrittmaniac and Buffybrain) this CD remains one that sometimes I just have to play right-this-minute 
 This controller is great. You are able to play games much easier with this one than with the first manifest. This controller should be considered better than the dual shock because it is more comfortable and for people like me who play games for long periods of time that is a plus 
 I think John Dufresne's first work -Louisiana Power and Light- was a fabulous read.  I think anyone who doesn't like the book is from the North and doesn't understand it.  This book is about people we KNOW down here in the South.  It touches on our own family members and that is why it is so poignant.  Truly a good book... I found myself laughing out loud several times.  Looking forward to reading all Dufresne's works 
 I received this book as a gift at Christmas, and I thought it was great!  I will grant that I do still have questions regarding my first pregnancy, but I did find this book quite helpful.  As for the complaint that the book is too religious?  Well, I enjoy reading a book that takes my religious and ethical viewpoints to heart.  Whether you are a Christian Mom-to-be or not, this book is a fantastic read.  Very funny and enjoyable.  Full of practical advice and humourous anecdotes.  I can't wait to read Lorilee's new book about baby's first year 
 Firat of all there is actually no meaning to the story but to say that a woman by the name of Claire Dolan sleeps and earns money from men he came across and give the money to the high class Pimp(whom receieve the money) after her mother died. The taxi driver whom she slept with thought that she was not a hooker at first and have been staying around with her ever night and there was once that he found out from the Pimp(wearing suite) that she is a hooker when he went on a private investigation by himself. He ram home on her hard and before she left for Chicago, she had a strong sex with another man. She found that she already had a baby boy(without father) after she settles down in Chicago and the taxi driver himself married and formed a happy family after the wife is expecting his children while he was talking to the Pimp he met him on the street. This movie contains LOS and the scenes are not sustained for long unlike the movie forbidden, which contains hot sex or even sexual intrigue. I would rate that story as 3 star and the sexual acts in the movie as 4 stars. This is one of the very good movie to watch and collect(to those out there still considering) 
 The product shipped great.  Only problem was that one lid did not come with a seal on it so it had to be returned.  The colors are great and the storage is good.  
 Stop the comparison between Oasis and the Beatles. The Beatles are the greatest band ever. Noel Gallagher will tell you that. Fact Oasis has released six albums of new material, 1 live album, and 1 b sides album of previously released material. Oasis has released eight albums. Oasis has six number 1 albums on the UK charts. The poll of the greatest albums of all time was conducted in the UK not the US. Get your facts straight before you bash Oasis. This is a very good album! Please listen to the CD before you review it 
 This is a great book to add to your library if you are interested at all about the way evolution cheated us from the truth.  I once believed in evolution until I gained more knowledge and discovered the weak basis and lack of evidence that evolutionists teach students through textbooks, periodicals, and scientific books.  It is always been a one sided viewpoint in the scientific circles, anyone who is not an evolutionist or a supporter of Darwin's belief is an outsider.  If you raise your questions against the teachers of evolution, you will be attacked or labeled a name to try to discredit you.  It's time to wake up and hear the truth that this book is presenting.  Don't allow those evolutionists to silence you and keep you blinded forever.  
 A really fun, well orgainized book. My 6 and 9 year olds loved it and so did I (Mom). We have been back to it many times, looking at particular sections. I am now ordering other titles in the series 
 This book was the first to describe the class differences  which determined in large part who fought the war and who found some way or other to not go. These same differences are now being played out in our politics and cultural  life, as the author brilliantly points out in a new introduction. A must for understanding the U.S. today, and an excellent text for courses about this perio 
 Nox Arcana never fails to impress its fans and this Cd is the great example. I'm also using this for halloween, and also, this album can also be used as background music for reading a Lovecraft collection of horror stories. Highly recommended 
 The book included in this set describes the effort those who worked with Bing went through to obtain the original recordings and restore the sound to original broadcast quality.  the care really shows...and the excellent performances by some jazz giants really shines through.  they were having fun, and really knew how to sing...   
 I'm normally not one to laugh out loud very much, but with THE MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK I couldn't help myself.  I laughed so hard that not once but twice I had tears streaming down my face.  Norval Jones who's 4-F due to "the spots" is tragically in love with Trudy Kockenlocker.  She knows of his love, but is more interested in the poor boys going off to war.  One night after using Norval as a cover to get out of the house she goes partying with some soldiers, drinks too much spiked lemonade, bumps her head on a disco ball and ends up married to some guy she can't remember except that she thinks his name was Ratzkywatzky.  She's also pregnant.  Broken hearted she tells Norval and after a screaming fit he agrees to help her.  Hilarity and some of the craziest knee-shaking you've ever seen ensue.  Why is this movie not out on DVD?  Or even better yet a Preston Sturges box set!  D: Preston Sturges (HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO, THE LADY EVE) W: Preston Sturges (HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO, THE LADY EVE)  Norval Jones - Eddie Bracken (SUMMER STOCK, HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO) Trudy Kockenlocker - Betty Hutton (ANNIE GET YOUR GUN, INCENDIARY BLONDE) Emmy Kockenlocker - Diana Lynn (THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR, THE KENTUCKIAN) Constable Kockenlocker - William Demarest (THE LADY EVE, HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO 
 The explaination of each individual element of the scientific paper  is very well presented. I would give 5 starts if it include some examples 
 I assigned this book for an undergraduate course I teach, "Diversity in Psychology."  As a faculty of color who teaches at a predominantly white college, I often struggle in talking about these issues with my white students in a way in which they can truly "get it."  Dr. Malcolm's book helps my students grapple with such critical issues as racism, sexism, heterosexism, and all the other -isms that plague our society.  He does this by sharing his own journey of dealing with these issues.  His book reaches out to these students in a way that I will never be able to.    Dr. Malcolm's book is truly an inspiration, not only to me, but also to my colleauges, those who are of color and white.  What I like best about this book is that the author doesn't sugar coat anything.  He clearly communicates the message that in order for our society to live up to its egalitarian ideals, we *all* must be willing to engage in difficult dialogues with one another about each of these issues.  We all must get comfortable with being uncomfortable in order to overcome our fears of one another.  These types of dialogues are truly necessary if we are to deal with our society's unfinished business.   I will keep Dr. Malcolm's book as assigned reading for many of my courses and I'll keep it close by me because I have drawn so much encouragement from it.  I would like to thank Dr. Malcolm for sharing his experiences and taking me along on his amazing journey.  His book has given my students, colleagues, and me new hope that we can come to a much better understanding of one another in this society.  That is Dr. Malcolm's greatest gift.

 This is a play where worlds collide. It is a play about sibling rivalry and sibling compassion. It has tender moments and harsh moments that brilliantly capture human emotion in its myriad dimensions. At the end of reading it, I was nearly in tears.  This is a play about the death of the old south and the illusion and dellusion of domestic Post World War II. "Desire" in this play is defined as the opposite of "death." Blanche is running from death and seeking a new life but drowns in the sea of chaos that surrounds her. She is a displaced person, a vestige of the old south, forced to fight an uphill battle for survival against poverty and madness.   Blanche embodies the struggles of the south, a place which has been portrayed time and again by authors such as Faulkner and, more recently, David Hill as never seeming to have recovered from the blight of the Civil War. The antebellum prosperity of slavery is alive in Blanche -- e.g., her refined manner, her white clothes signifying purity -- but the claws of madness and disorder tear her in every dirrection.   A modern reading of this work might try to focus on the fact that it is set in New Orleans, and apply the themes stated above to the before and after effect of Hurricane Katrina 
 I read The Blind Assassin: A Novel as it was my book club's selection.  Therefore, at the end I'll share group feedback.  I really enjoyed this novel for two reasons.  First, the plot moved along at a pace that kept me involved.  Second, I was able to discern sociological and psychological themes, which give insight into the main characters' actions.  Especially with book clubs, these criteria are important for discussion.  Atwood constructs an intricate plot within a plot within a plot, which deftly moves between the contemporary storyteller and her past. This can be confusing in the beginning, but Atwood's storytelling skill kept me wanting to know more.  Atwood's insight into her characters minds, placed in the historical and sociological setting of early 20th Century, is what makes this book shine.  Read the newspaper articles closely, which are part of the novel.  Now, for the book club experience.  I was dismayed that many members thought that the book was depressing and hard to follow.  I think that if you just want a quick read with not much depth, look elsewhere.   
 I must admit that I never really payed any attention towards L while he was alive but when his unfortunate death occurred, it made me curious to check him out considering how critically acclaimed his only album was. I bought it and I discovered a very talented MC. By the summer of 2000, much anticipation was built for this posthumous release and with good reason.   For the diehard Big L fan, they may have heard some of the material that appears here. "Ebonics" has circulated as a single in the streets and "The Enemy" has appeared on the D.I.T.C. album. But not everything is new. For those not very familiar with L, this will obviously sound fresh to you; but plenty of verses have previously appeared on freestyles but now it's provided with a new backdrop in an attempt to make it sound better. And they succeed.  Primo produces top-notch material for the three tracks touched, particularly "Platinum Plus" which Kane destroys. Pete Rock & Ron Browz do wonders for "Holdin' It Down" and "Size Em Up." Injected for the casual listener is "'98 Freestyle," which is often lauded as the greatest freestyle of all-time. L also shows diversity and impeccable storytelling skills as displayed by "The Heist" and "Casualties of a Dice Game" (despite its weak beat).  What I like about this better than other posthumous albums in hip-hop is that this actually sounds like the style of production that he would rock over. It's a great album and it only supports the claim that he is the "King of the Punchline." The 'ask Beavis / I get nuthin' Butt-Head' has become legendary. He's amazing lyrically. He raps the way he talks and raps with a swagger that Jay-Z would later inherit. He is dearly missed and it's unfortunate that he was only alive for one album to master. 
 Good book for beginners and for those who have reached a place of discovery, but much too repetitious for me.  Don't listen to the audio while driving as Tolles voice is a monotone.  Rayna Gangi, author, "Forget The Cures, Find The Cause." and "Mary Jemison, White Woman of the Seneca. 
 Preservation or desecration of certain architectural styles and decorative heritage goes in and out of fashion the world over. It's not only Morocco that wanted to demolish the old and over-value the new. How much of the beauty and culture of the East has been lost in the name of "progress"? The situation is not simple, however. In the latter part of the 20th century there was an urgent need throughout the Mediterranean for affordable, modern housing for quickly expanding populations and growing economies strapped for cash, skills and resources. Unfortunately aesthetics and the traditions of artisans often got trampled in the rush. Lisa Lovett-Smith's sumptuous Moroccan Interiors reminds us that embracing preservation has so much to offer the present and the future. While she focuses on the homes of the rich, ex-patriate and famous and could therefore be accused of being elitist, she also illuminates the beauty of the simplest of objects that could be found in any home, rich or poor. Lovett-Smith has divided Morocco into regions and cities and celebrated the best of each, appreciating the exquisite, ornate beauty of Islamic art and the colour schemes reflecting the dramatic terrain of the Mediterranean: desert ochre and blistering reds, turquoise, azure, sapphire, gold, saffron and cinnamon to name a few. Lovett-Smith is aware that a picture tells a thousand words and her accompanying text in several languages is brief. The photography is faultless and the lighting of the interiors unobtrusive. This is not just an ornate coffee table book. It is a valuable archive, a celebration of great style and a treasure trove of inspiration for interior architects, artists and designers 
 As one can see by the quantity and voracity of the commentary on this book, it is an important and controversial work that deserves a read (though from misstatements in their commentary, I question whether some of the critics actually read it, however).  Nearly two decades after its first publication, Chomsky and Herman's "Manufacturing Consent" stands the test of time surprisingly well in spite of the myriad far-reaching geopolitical shifts that have taken place.  This is largely due to the open-ended nature of "Consent's" market analysis which rejects the notion of a large, unwieldy body of conspirators or the notion that the media is monolithic.  Chomsky and Herman readily concede that exceptions to their theory can and do occur.  "Manufacturing Consent" is an academic exercise, so it lacks much of the flair and pacing of popular current affairs literature.  It is, at times, droll and tedious.  What it lacks in style, however, it more than makes up for in substance as a critical lens with which to frame the behavior of the mass media.  As an academic exercise, its assertions are well-sourced and it adheres closely to the standards of intellectual honesty.  Chomsky and Herman begin with a thesis; that the behavior of the media can be understood (and even predicted) within the context of a "market analysis" of five "filters";   "(1) the size, concentrated ownership, owner wealth, and profit orientation of the dominant mass-media firms; (2) advertising as the primary income source of the mass media; (3) the reliance of the media on information provided by government, business and "experts" funded and approved by these primary sources and agents of power; (4) `flak' as a means of disciplining the media; and (5) `anticommunism' as a national religion and control mechanism."    The latter, "anticommunism", has since been revised slightly (noted in this edition of the book) given the fall of the Soviet Union, as Herman has elsewhere noted;   "the fifth filter - anticommunist ideology - is possibly weakened by the collapse of the Soviet Union and global socialism, but this is easily offset by the greater ideological force of the belief in the `miracle of the market.' There is now an almost religious faith in the market, at least among the elite, so that regardless of evidence, markets are assumed benevolent and non-market mechanisms are suspect."  The rest of the book serves to provide examples that bolster this thesis as Chomsky and Herman illustrate the various ways in which the "Propaganda Model" plays out in the "agenda-setting media."  They cover well-established paradigms in the social sciences like "worthy and unworthy victims."  Some have criticized "Consent" as being "selective".  This is certainly true; however it is not selective in any sort of deliberately manipulative way.  "Consent" could easily be a 60-volume set - but the demands of concision require that the authors be selective about what examples they cite lest their work turn into the phone book.  Anyone who has read Chomsky's other works knows how voluminous his body of work is and how many additional writings he's penned since 1988 that serve as still more evidence for the basic thesis of the Propaganda Model.  Ever the skeptic, I used Manufacturing Consent as the basis for my Master's Thesis to test its application in the modern era; a content analysis of US media coverage of the simultaneous conflicts in Kosovo and East Timor.  After pouring over 6,000 articles in print - my research provided me with another compelling example that corroborated the Propaganda Model.  Those interested in broadening their understanding of the concepts Chomsky and Herman present would do well to also read "Propaganda" by Edward Bernays and "Public Opinion" by Walter Lippmann (from whose writings the title of "Manufacturing Consent" was derived) 
 Major Henri Scobie is deputy-commissioner of police in a war-torn state in West Africa. A highly principled officer, he is forced to borrow money to send his despairing wife Louise on a holiday in South Africa. In her absence he falls in love with Helen Rolt, a young widow, and his life is transformed by the experience. With a duty to repay his debts, an inability to distinguish between love, pity and responsibility to others and God, Scobie inexorably moves to his final damnation. The novel pictures a man who realises that despair is the price he has to pay for setting himself an impossible aim: to be just. He soon reaches the point of knowing about his absolute failure and of never being able to reach the heart of the matter. Because of his weakness Scobie is forced to tell so many lies that even for a Catholic like himself it is no longer possible to kneel down at the confessional. He knows that he is desecrating God because he loves another woman. There is no hope anywhere he turns his eyes: the dead figure upon the cross, the plaster Virgin or the religious representations of events which happened so long ago that they no longer seem relevant. Finally Scobie resigns himself to love failure because he can't love success. Even his promotion to commissioner means nothing to him anymore and he feels resigned to death because he isn't resigned to life anymore 
 One of the soviet poets said:'' I would learn Russian because of Lenin, who spoke this language'' I would because of Pushkin.I admire so deeply his courage, rebel spirit, patriotism and his incredible capability to conquest the women just with few words. You can feel his soul in ''Eugene Onegin'' I've read it in Russian, but I'm sure that Pushkin will sound beautiful in any language. Many people compare Pushkin to Byron. I don't agree, I think Pushkin is unique. If you are really care for Russian literature you will not miss this passionate and touching poem 
 In my opinion one of the best brands of recordable media, that U can buy in the market 
 I must admit, I didn't really like this book that much at first.  I felt as if Mishima's depiction of Toru (the 'incarnation' this time around), with all the hyper-intelligent, will-to-power stuff, was teetering on the brink of self-parody, especially in an extended first-person section taken from his journal, in which he comes across as a more malevolent version of the narrator of Temple of the Golden Pavilion.  And then too the fact that he's just so over-the-top demonic didn't make it any easier to take the narrative entirely seriously.  Honda, elevated to the lead part in this and the previous book after supporting roles in the first two, is still an indelible character, but it wasn't really enough, and I was all prepared to give it a rather sour three-star rating.  However...however.  In the last thirty or so pages, Mishima, in a single blinding burst, turns the entire text upside-down, and ends up by undermining the foundation of the entire Sea of Fertility.  I know that seems like a narrative clich-big plot twists in the end that force one to re-evaluate the entire work-but this, I think it's safe to say, is unlike any other instance of the device that you've ever seen, and Mishima pulls it off brilliantly.  I cannot overstate the awe in which I was left.  Small wonder he ritually disemboweled himself afterwards-how could you write something like this and go on living?  I may not buy into his brand of cosmic nihilism, but that's not important.  What matters is, this is the work of a genius at the top of its game.  I don't suppose it needs my recommendation, since if you've read the other three books you're not likely to just leave it at that, but I will nonetheless put all my powers of persuasion behind it.  Not to be missed. 
 Price was high but lower at amazon compared to other retail store,  travel pack contents and the most needed to bring your Zune around and secured with padded carrying case, very good earpriece with astonishing sound quality and of course outlet charger and the splitter to share your sounds to anybody,  I recommend another premiun earpiece for this,  overall I am satisfied with the purchase 
 I read this book for an assignment in my english II-C class. I liked this book but I have some complaints. I think that Anne Tyler should have went into a little more detail about Ben Joe's father.  And I also think that  she should of wrote more about Ben Joe and Shelly's life together. I liked  how Anne used very specific details about how his family acted. It was a  great bok I would recommend it to someone who likes a little of suspinse  and a book that has a lot of thinking involved 
 Just a brief note to our customers. The Super Pogo clamp (the piece above the spring)is now shaved down on the sides. This modification is not shown in the photo. The sides of the clamp are now even with the square chrome plated tubes... no more knee bumping! Because of your feedback the Super Pogo is better then ever. Enjoy!

 The routine on this DVD is so easy and yet challenges your muscles in a great way! Kathy is an expert and I love this video, and trust me, I'm no fitness guru, just a regular housewife who wanted to add weight lifting to her walking routine in order to firm my upper arms, and all I can say is, Wow! This video works! 
 Dear Readers, This is a very good book for any animal lover(especialy dog lovers).  it has amazing stories of dogs that have done some amazing things and won some amazing awards!!  It even has some very ineresting info on some of the things that the author talked about in each story.  As I said before this a good book! 
 There is an unfortunate and unfair stereotype about Poles not doing enough for Jews during World War II. This book helps set the record straight by first showing that Poles were also victims of the Germans. In addition, unlike in other German-occupied countries, Poles were given the death penalty for the slightest aid to Jews. Despite all this, the heroine of this historical account risked her life every day to hide a group of Jews right under the nose of a German officer whom she was forced to serve. Absolutely thrilling! 
 This kitchen is reasonably priced with lots of kitchen accessories. My 2 1/2 year old daughter has fun playing with it when she's in the mood to play kitchen. It has most of the "kitchen" things you'd think of: sink, dishes, pots, pans, oven, mixer, etc. The food has RFID chips built in so when you put them in the pan/pot on the stove, it speaks and says things like, "mmm, eggs... and... bacon, you're a great cook! (frying sound)". This mostly amazes adults.  The biggest gripes are the oven is unnecessarily small (like they were trying the RFID in the oven as well and it didn't work) and the refrigerator door has HORRIBLE fit and won't close.  Overall, for the price this kitchen satisfied and has lots of accessories. If you can live with the bad fit and finish, this is one of the more bargain kitchen toys available 
 While the book has beautiful photos, it is hard to use as a reference. Unless you know what the piece is exactly it is very difficult to locate in the book 
 Think Le Guin meets Goblin Market meets Tolkein and you get a little bit of the effect of Cloud's End.   In the world of the book, the Mist hangs at the edge of all things and calls to people who live in the more solid world. The spirits of things can take human form, and while occasionally helpful are always dangerous. There are oracles and seeings and journeys and predictions and heroes who fight with living fire. One of the best things about this book is its emotional complexity. The characters may have the feel of myth, but they do not think like myths. I appreciated the psychological realism quite a bit. Real toads in imaginary gardens, and all that.  So why not five stars? This is the second Stewart novel that I have read, and while I enjoyed both of them I have also felt like they were missing something. In fact, despite liking it so much while reading it I find myself wondering if I even want to keep the book. The lightness of it is one of its main virtues, but it also keeps it from having real emotional weight. I also was not crazy about the ending, but that is more of a taste issue.  Do not let my minor quibbles dissuade you from reading the book-- it is still better than most of the fantasy out there. I will certainly keep reading Stewart and looking for his perfect book 
 If you like Jack OFF Jill, this is a must. Maybe their lightest work but 'tis really a worthy album. They show a lot of maturity in the lyrics compared to their previous releases, actually in my personal opinion this is the most mature album in their history. Songs like Cinnamon Spider, Rabitteen or Vivica are really amazing. Try this ; 
 A great, classic, "girl power" movie. But it's interesting to know that in reality, Mulan ended up committing suicide because the emperor wanted her to be one of his concubines 
 I've only had a CD-R of this album for the past year or so as it was out of print and I wasn't able to find a moderately priced copy.  So I was very happy when I found out that it would be released as a RVG (along with Andrew Hill's Black Fire and Joe Henderson's Inner Urge this has been a great summer).  As for the music "Jesus F*****g Christ" is the first thing that comes to mind.  This CD has some of the most intense music I've ever heard.  Wayne Shorter's solo on the title track is unbelievable, him and Blakey are absolutely ferocious.  The title track, in particular, just feels like it towers over you.  You can hear how much Blakey leads and inspires the group with his playing.  The recording quality is also stellar.  The details and overtones of Blakey's cymbals are captured especially beautifully.  I think that this is one of those albums when there was some kind of magic throughout the session and everything that could have gone right seems to have.  I have no reserves in recommending this album and I can't imagine anyone being dissapointed with it.  Take advantage of this rereleased and remastered masterpiece 
 Rupert Sheldrake is renowned for his theory of morphogenetic fields. These fields are species-specific collections of experiences individuals have, which are available to all members of the species. These fields provide information on knowledge and behaviors that are helpful to the species, such as migration routes and other learned behaviors. For instance, mice have learned paths through laboratory mazes, and members of the same species who were not direct descendents of the original lab animals subsequently learned the same mazes much more quickly.  In this book, Sheldrake has gathered several hundred reports of dogs, cats and other pets that evidence telepathic and precognitive communications with humans. These occur most often with the animal's primary caretaker, but may also occur with other people who have close bonds with them.  The evidence is presented engagingly, with many examples from the very broad spectrum of phenomena reported in Sheldrake's survey. Pet owners describe not only dogs and cats who show clear alerting behaviors prior to their owners returning home, but also intuitive anticipations and acknowledgments of death of someone close to them; intuitive homing behaviors; and applied/ trained assistance to owners who are blind or have epilepsy or diabetes.  Sheldrake's hypothess that morphogenetic fields explain all of these phenomena is an interesting variation on the themes of intuitive/psychic awareness, collective consciousness, and spiritual dimensions of reality.  Sheldrake's book is highly recommended to anyone interested in animal communications that extend beyond the ordinary physical world of visual and auditory channels. 
 The previous reviewer's reference to this song having the sound of Giorgio Moroder is right on the money.  I loved Moroder's work in the 80's and that's what attracted me to this song.  The rest of the album though is boring.  This song makes up for that.  Bring on the video!!! 
 In America is a near perfect movie dealing w/ grief and learning to live again after tragedy. It is also about hope.  The characters are engaging and each one is dealing with grief in their own way. They are all trying to find a new life literally in Amerca and figuratively w/ in themselves after a variety of tragedies and set backs.  The only real downside I can note on this movie is that I would have liked a little more back ground on Frankie and Mateo but I think the movie tries hard to put you in the midst of these lives without arbitrary flashbacks.  Besides, a great story the cinematograpy is well suited with its combination of views through a child's camcorder and closer scenes of the city and family life. I especially liked ths subtle way the camera shows the changing of seasons.   If you want to enjoy a good story and a bit of tear jerker thent his is a must see. If for nothing else than the performances of "Mateo" and young "Kristie." Just amazing. 
 As an occupational therapy student currently assigned to a physical dysfunction site, I have found this text to be the most valuable.  I advise any student taking the NBCOT exam or begining a affilitation in physical dysfunction to purchase this text! 
 Von Mises' "The Theory of Money and Credit" is a great work in theoretical economics. Its key insight is that money has an influence on the real economy.   Monetary financing of deficits leads to inflation, but this inflation is never proportional, that is variations in the money supply produce variations in relative prices and therefore have distributional consequences.   MV = PT is an identity. The 'V' reflects the money demand of individuals for whom a $ has a subjective value. What happens to PT is dependent on who how the new money will ripple through the economic system. Every change in the amount of money is different. Apart from subjective factors the velocity of circulation will depend on trends in population growth, the division of labour and financial innovation all of these tending to accelerate it over time.      A key price in any economy is the real interest rate. Within a stable monetary framework these would reflect time preference and the (perceived) profitability of investments. By artificially reducing the rate of interest investment booms are provoked by making longer processes of production seem more profitable than they are and when finally because of a intolerantly high rate of inflation the monetary growth is halted a sharp recession occurs, in which firms go bust and the some investments are liquidated. Hence business cycles.  In essence it a manifesto for sound-money which in Mises' view amounts to adopting the gold standard. Inflationary deficit finance is dishonest and arbitrary on people's incomes and should be replaced by explicit taxation.            
 Whatever you think of the man, Bono is something else. Here we get some genuine insight into what makes this extraordinary individual tick. The series of dialogues between the Irish singer and old friend French writer Michka Assayas covers just about everything you can think of with intelligence and humour. At one point they discuss that these conversations themselves may be some kind of therapy for Bono since the relatively recent death of his father.  From his troubled adolescence and the death of his mother, to his recent first-hand experiences of international economics and politics, to his relationship with God and Christianity, Bono reveals all. Meetings with the Pope, George W. Bush, President Gorbacev calls round for Sunday lunch, there are some fascinating bits and pieces! Just as he appears on the point of pomposity or pretentiousness, out comes a quote from Monty Python, or a self-deprecating U2 story.  For a millionaire rock star, Bono comes across as remarkably in touch with reality and with his feet firmly on the ground. In fact it is astonishing that he appears to be so in touch with so many different realities, and still have a healthy sense of perspective. One senses a clear-headed ambition to achieve an ongoing balance between idealism and realism. 
 This movie is thought provoking and has very good character studies. My husband and I loved this movie! We saw subtle humor throughout the entire movie. I would agree with the reviewer who told those who did not like this movie to "lighten up". This is not an ordinary movie that follows the typical Hollywood formula. Expect something different, have an open mind, and enjoy 
 I can't really find the words to describe this book. It's not only well researched, well organized, and well written, but it's also an incredible reading experience. I felt that I was traveling on the author's journey right along with her, and I truly didn't want the journey to end. I usually skip around different books, skimming them for interesting facts, and dropping them if I become bored or disinterested. I can honestly say that this is the first book I've ever read that captivated me right from the very first sentence and kept me turning the pages right to the end. It opened not only my mind, but also my heart and soul. I was a hardened skeptic and expected to find a lot of information that I could dispute. However, by the time I reached the end, in light of all the profound and varied evidence presented throughout the book, I had become a believer. I'm now ordering a copy for a friend, as I don't want to relinquish mine! This is one of those books that you never forget, and once you've read them, your life is never the same. Highly recommended 
 I have bought multiple copies of this book for gifts. It is a huge hit with all ages - from teenagers to youthful adults. Buy several to keep on hand. You won't be sorry 
 This book was great.  It helped to make sence of my budget.  I am more  comfortable budgeting my money 
 Bloodline has a gothic aura that the other hellraiser movies didn't really have.  Also Pinhead shows up in this movie more often than any of the other movies. The plot is intricate and interesting and it goes into detail about the making of and the history of the puzzle box.  There is gore and blood for all the horror fans and there is suspence and chills.  Some parts of this movie has an Anne Rice feel to it and other parts remind me of the second hellraiser movie.  If you are a hellraiser fan then you should buy it. If you like horror or suspense then you should at least rent it.    
  Is it just me or is 1989's "Pump Up The Jam" among the most innovative dance records that I've ever heard even listening it today. The title track is universally popular even today and it's clear why! It is just an incredible and powerful jam for the dance floor. Other songs are the spunky "Come On" as well as the similar track "Rockin To The Beat". Get this CD today! 
 Robert Frost has a world-wide admiration. And in this book, you can find all his poems grouped neatly in sections connecting them to the place they are written in. So to put it in a nut shell, it is just what you are looking for if you want to buy something you won't regret.  
 ....about the possibilities of becoming fully human.  This was one of the books that inspired me to study psychology.  An eminently sane look at the "higher reaches" from the psychologist who dared to wonder why we  study sickness but not health 
 I have found Mr. Peters book excellent. I am no mathematician and still I found it easy to read. I was interested in learning about fractal market analysis and I found what I needed in this book 
 I thought the parts of this book that described some of the different, difficult personalities was very good. I actually really thought it had something to offer and the strategies were practical. The insights though didn't stick and I think that you have to read this regularly to keep reminding yourself that all these people exist in the world (including you) and you are going to see them every day. Thats kind of a depressing thought actually. With all the other books I need to keep reading to remind myself about various insights I want to stay home. 
 Mary Hunt know what she is talking about when she talks about Living Financially Free. She talks about how the credit card companys are in it for the money,not to make your life easier and how to use credit cards wisely.She goes over credit reports and scores and how to pay them off early.There is a chapter on Student Loans and Student Debt that every college student should read.  She has a chapter on Investing and which route to go there. She has a Rapid Debt Repayment Plan Schedule and how to start a Emergency and Contingency Fund.  A must read book.  Every parent should read this with their children before sending them out into the world.  
 I think the songs have an interesting and good mix of the kind of music people liked about 50 to 75 years ago. You can hear how Gene changed and even got better as he changed with time. I hear a lot of Jimmy Rogers in  his songs and singing early in his singing 
 Great book with some very useful as well as interesting ideas. Amazon got this book to us in 2 days at the height of the Christmas season and at a great price! Kudos to Amazon 
 If applied, the information in this book can help imporve your lifestyle... 
 This is the perfect companion to ACIM. Everyone who studies the Course should have this little book - and read it often 
 I have always enjoyed Deh Ta-Hsiung's recipes. They are simple to follow  & difficult to get wrong, even for a novice cook like me! The recipes  he shares range from tasty family dishes to making your own Peking duck or  roasting your own barbeque pork which are difficult to come by in most  Chinese cook books. Mr Deh also takes time to explain how different types  of ingredients come together, and offers to the uninitiated, methods of  preparing an ingredient, and photographs which makes me want to dog-ear all  the pages with the recipes I plan to try! Most of all, Deh's cooking leads  to the most authentic tasting Chinese food!I'm glad the author has finally  released an US edition!My only complaint is there just aren't enough  recipes 
  When are these people going to put a full concert version of 'Carry On' on one of thier DVD's - I'm tired of waiting.  And when are they coming to the United States? (Southern (Orange County) California).   [... 
 All thinking persons need an advisor about HOW to think, and D.Q. McInerny is the best candidate for that position I can think of. McInerny, in Being Logical, becomes to thinking what Strunk and White have long been to writing. A voice of common sense, a voice  reminding us what the essentials are.   Some poeple, of course, (and oh how many there are!) want to engage in discussion for the purpose of listening to themselves. Some expound on this or that without concern for genuine argument. For such persons this book will be worthless--even damaging.  Consider the following McInerny reminder: "The whole purpose of reasoning, of logic, is to arrive at the truth of things. This is often an arduous task, as truth can sometimes be painfully elusive. But not to pursue truth would be absurd, since it is the only thing that gives meaning to all of our endeavors."   What a breath of fresh air to read this! And to be reminded that argument is rational discourse, and not to be confused with mere quarreling.  "There are," McInerny tells us, "any number of folk who, though happy to quarrel with you, are either unwilling or unable to ARGUE with you. Do not waste time and energy trying to argue with people who will or cannot argue."  So be it.  And if you're looking for one of the best indexes of slipshod reasoning, half-baked arguments, weak ideas and fallacy--here, at last it all is in a usable, clear package.   This book is small enough that you can carry it around with you in your back pocket and quote from it to point out the fallacies and weaknesses in an opponent's argument--though I wouldn't recommend doing so on a crowded bus or subway, nor with your boss in the workplace. It might be better to read this book carefully and practice it on all your own arguments for a considerable period before using it as a weapon against an opponent in argument.  And how about "Laughter as a Diversionary Tactic," being listed under principal forms of illogical thinking? This is priceless--and oh, so accurate, so reflective of the kind of arguments one gets into nowadays--about politics in particular (I don't even remember reading this one in my undergraduate logic textbook years ago where all the logical fallacies were categorized and discussed). And then there's "Tears as a diversionary tactic."   I do believe all of this was covered somewhere in Cicero ("If you can't defeat your opponent's argument--then ridicule your opponent").  One big reason few people can distinguish between argument and polemics is that the core knowledge about how to think straight contained in McInerny's little book--a knowledge which goes back to the Greeks--is seldom taught, seldom learned, and seldom applied when it has been learned. If Being Logical can make even one small dent in the armor of irrationality, then it does a great service.  McInerny's advice is the same as Emily Dickinson's:           Opinion is a flitting thing          But Truth outlasts the Sun          If then we cannot own them both          Possess the Oldest one.      
 John Cheever is the poet of mid-century suburbia.  He stings as he sings, gently criticizing a lifestyle that he at the same time embraces and loves.  "The Swimmer" is a tour-de-force; had Cheever been South American, the story would have been labeled magic realism 
 Why Did They Kill?: Cambodia In The Shadow Of Genocide by Alexander Laban Hinton (Associate professor of Anthropology, Rutgers University, Newark) explores the cultural and political underpinnings of one the most heinous holocausts of the twentieth century, perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia from April 1975 to January 1979. Approximately twenty percent of Cambodia's population died due to starvation, malnutrition, disease, and outright execution due to the drastic policies the Khmer Rouge implemented trying to transform the nation into a purely agrarian state. The Khmer Rouge regime was unusual among genocidal states in that, though it did target muslim, Chinese, and Vietnamese citizens, much of the killing was ethnic Khmer exterminating ethnic Khmer, a perplexing feature that sets it apart from many ethnicity or religion-based genocide situations. Indeed, the Khmer purged so many of its own cadres that its destructive ways weakened itself and contributed to its downfall when Vietnam invaded. Why Did They Kill? strives to answer its title question drawing upon the author's extensive anthropological study and expertise, and includes numerous interviews and testimonies, as well as insights into human psychology and sociology. Why Did They Kill? postulates that societies can be "primed" for genocide when saturated by certain features such as severe class distinctions, the absence of an international response, moral restructuring, socioeconomic uphevals and more, and then "activated" into mass killing by various triggers, especially idealogues who spread a climate of fear to induce violence. Chilling yet meticulous in its search for answers, "Why Did They Kill?" is an absolute must-read for scholars and lay people alike striving to understand genocide in Cambodia as well as the horrific underpinnings and workings of so-called "idealogical genocide" in general. 
 Beyond the Blues is an absolute read.  I've suffered from depression for several years and have been on an antidepressant.  Wanting to become pregnant,but knowing I was on a antidepressant was a very confusing time for me.  After reading the book, I knew there were several options out there for me.  The book is easy to understand and is full of helpful information 
 Fantastic Book!!! I bought this for my wife as a memento of our 25th Anniversary trip to Venice. It was perfect. I highly recommend it to any armchair traveler who wants to "visit" the world's most romantic city. Davi 
 Pablo Picasso's was one of the most innovative, experimental, prolific, influential, and controversial painters of the twentieth century. In The Ultimate Picasso, Brigitte Leal covers Picasso's formative years from 1881 through 1916 (including his invention of Cubism with Georges Braque). Christine Piot explores Picasso's productive period from 1917 through 1952. Marie-Laure Bernadac surveys the artistic vigor of Picasso's later years from 1953 until hi death in 1973. The Ultimate Picasso's informative, engaging text is profusely illustration with 1200 magnificent reproductions (720 in full color) document-ing Picasso's phenomenal range of artistic expression throughout his life. The Ultimate Picasso is an essential, core addition to any personal or academic art history collection, and is a very highly recommended "Memorial Fund" acquisition choice for community libraries 
 This has always been my favorite MJQ recording; why it took so long for this to come out on CD is one of the great mysteries of the CD world.  Now that it is here, anyone who has ever heard it will probably want it; anyone who hasn't heard it should get it immediately.  This is the best amalgamation of classical and jazz forms that has ever been recorded by anyone.  The composition and performance are both superb. It is a rare chance to hear John Lewis, Jimmy Guiffre, and Gunther Schuller, all unsung heroes of latter 20th century music, collaborating to produce an infinitely interesting and beautiful work.  The second cut on the album, Fine, is cute, beautiful, and totally swings!  Get this CD 
 This is a great baby book. It has very durable pages, lots of room to write, great storages envelopes, and very cute designs. It's not hokey or overly cutesy-just right 
 I bought these for my 5 year old son who is a huge Car's fan. He was using matchbox cars and pretending that they were Lightening McQueen and friends, but when he recieved the set of these he was so excited. These cars are larger than matchbox cars, and are heavy for their size, good quality!! Great for the Car's fan in your life 
 This little book is very direct and to the point. It goes over alot of main topics which are very essential to Asatru: what Asatru is and is not, the Nine Noble Virtues, ethics, Orlog, Frith, oaths, a basic introduction to the Gods and Goddesses, the Blots, ceremonies, and even a little bit about the runes and different types of magic. He gives very good modern day examples, focusing less on abstract concepts and more on how one can apply them and really "live" Asatru, as the title says.   I didn't agree with some of what he had to say, but he clearly stated that the book contains his own interpretations and opinions. The author encourages the reader to learn more about Asatru through different sources.   That said, I'd recommend this book to anyone. It's a great introduction to Asatru and it's well worth a read 
 I always have to chuckle when I see the phrase "atomic clock". I am sad to report that there is nothing about this clock that is "atomic" except the name (well, it's made up of atoms, so I suppose that is worth something). However, it does receive the WWVB radio signals from the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Boulder, CO. On the bright side, if this clock is typical, WWVB receivers have improved over the years. The last "atomic clock" I bought before this had some difficulty with reception. This clock does very well. I've owned it about 3 months, and I have placed it in several bedroom locations and gotten the "strong signal" indicator in all of them. The external temperature feature also works well. Some external sensors and receivers I have owned have had difficulty connecting. This one has done perfectly at all locations where I have tried it (my sensor is located in the frame of a bedroom window, and is currently about 15' from the clock). The clock is, to my mind, easy to use and set. I like that it has battery backup, and I like the ceiling projection (my wife loves that feature, BTW). The projection is bright enough and large enough that even a nearsighted geek (20-200) like me can see it without glasses when I squint. I also like the tasteful level of the alarm. The clock we threw away when this one arrived had all the subtlety of a nuclear power emergency alarm annunciator. Overall, I like the clock and gave it to my wife after much hinting. It now sits on her side of the bed. She got it last week after saying "I thought for sure I'd get one of those for Christmas after all the hints I dropped." I'd buy it again. In fact, I may end up buying another one. 
 Wonderful end of the trilogy. Did not disappoint. I'm just sad to be finished with the series. Look forward to the next. Definitely recommend. As usual very gripping storyline, hard to put down. 
 I have been subscribed to this mag since before PS2 came out, and it has always proved to offer reliable, well explained and accurate reviews, as well as early previews and interesting articles.  Not only is it good to read, but it comes with a demo disc, which is packed with demos, video previews, game files, and other helpful and interesting features.  If you are trying to choose one mag to subscribe to, this is the one you want 
 This is not a poignant love story, nor is it a sad haunting tale. It is simply a silly story told 99 different times. It explores language and expressions so well, it amazes me that it is a translation. If you read it out loud to an audience you will get the joke and discover how truly funny and clever this book is 
 My wife and I enjoyed the stories because they dealt with real people overcoming obstacles in today's world. We have 4 sons and some of the situations were very applicable to what they could face in their lives. For them to find out about how a younger person dealt with difficult circumstances is much more powerful than for a  parent to lecture to them. I am a practical person who knows that you must live in the real world, and this book provides solid lessons on how various people have done that 
 This book has really helped me to define boundaries in relationships and also given me a workable knowledge to help someone with where they are at in any given situation.  I am now able to console someone without taking on their problems as my own 
 If there is only one business book to own, this is it!   Doug Hall lays out a straight forward, highly logical, and common sense means to communicate with your customers.  Using his approach of communicating through overt benefits, dynamic difference, and real reason to believe, your business is sure to grow.  This is a keeper 
 I got this because I wanted to understand the beauty and grace of the calculus, and I was more than satisfied. Berlinski gives the approach that I needed - which is not that of a mathmetician, but it is pure nonetheless. The imaginary cabbie's monologue explaining a function of the calculus is worth the price itself, funny and illuminating and perfect. One of my favorite all-time books 
 I keep a supply of these books on hand to share with people experiencing one of the life situations dealt with by the author -- hurt, loss and grief.  Practical, usable help caringly given 
 I can't think of a better word that everyone else hasn't used yet.  This is the master of Horror at his best 
 The book organized by Macedo discusses a classical in deliberative studies: Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson's Democracy and Disagreement (1996 is the key year in this area, the same year when Public Delibration, by James Bohman, was published). What I most like in this book is how different authors examine Gutmann and Thompson's ideas regarding the promises, advances and failures in deliberative theory. You will find authors who agree and disagree with Gutmann and Thompson, and in the end a response by Gutmann and Thompson, considering each of the critiques in a heuristic process. In a word, essential 
 These days I'm sufficiently old and jaded to find it harder to find a book that finds me (I think that makes sense, but no matter).  I picked this up in a bookstore, was instantly hooked by the very talented humor of the opening pages, bought it and loved the entire thing.  It's a sweet combination of often laugh-out-loud humor, delightfully whacky characters and an underlying poignancy that eventually translates into a fractured warmth, but warmth nonetheless.  Evidently (from some other reviews here) some people don't get Davies' humor, so it's all a matter of how it strikes your neurons.  So I recommend that you read the first few pages and if you find the opening - as I did - a delight, you'll likely love the rest of it 
 I had the pleasure of taking a course in Riemannian Geometry from the author himself, using the Portuguese version of this book. Do Carmo managed to cover the whole thing in one semester without breaking a sweat; I don't know how he managed, or how we did. The fact is that the book is extremely well-written. It provides geometric insight but doesn't avoid computations. Also, the choice of topics is great, and they are ordered in a way that enhances the logical unity of the whole. The English translation seems to be every bit as good as the original. For a first course in Riemannian Geometry, this book might make a geometer out of you 
 Amazingly deep, dubwise production from Sly & Robbie plus the great singing from this edition of Uhuru plus their strongest set of songs. I've heard people complain about the mix, but to me this still sounds state-of-the-art 18 years after 
 Nancy Anderson's approach is practical and inspiring. I read this cover to cover in a weekend while faced with a career change decision.  It was a wonderful guide for me.  Several months later I picked  it up again and began to work through the assignments chapter by chapter. It was truly an exceptional book. I have probably given away more than a dozen copies of this book, and plan to buy and give away even more in the future 
 I first saw this movie when it was released back in the 1980's and I didn't  like it then and I still don't like  it now. The purpose of this movie seems to be to reassure  everybody that Aliens from Outer Space are all cute and friendly so you won't get an anal probe as reported by so many Alien Abductees selling their story to  newspapers as they have done over recent years.This movie is only redeemed by the presence of Ms. Dee Wallace-Stone who is a very Classy and Talented Actress 
 Rich Merrill knows what he is writing about! His details regarding various garden crops are totally on the mark. I am an avid gardener, and I consult this book weekly to assist me in gardening decisions. The food part, with the recipes from Joe Ortiz, is absolutely the  best if you're a gardener, with a huge harvest of anything from your garden. I love this book, and and consider it a true text for anyone who really wants to succeed at gardening and at eating 
 This item was something that was needed in my collection.  It was shipped promptly and it was received in the condition that was described 
 I bought this CD because I figured I couldn't go wrong with Isaac Stern.  I was right.  The playing on this CD is taut and powerful, crackling with  energy.  At the same time, though, the players keep a superior sense of  musical precision, and manage to make the music sound energetic without  sounding heavy-handed.  As Gramophone would say, it was not without irony  that *Felix* Mendelssohn composed works of such *felicity*, and these  performers keep that felicity intact, which sets this CD way above the  myriads of other Mendelssohn Piano Trio recordings.  For ten dollars  especially, you can't go wrong.  This is a CD every Mendelssohnian should  have in his or her collection 
 Previously I bought several 'no name 12Mpixel' camcorders that whould produce great stills but left a lot to be desired when taking movies. The Sanyo does it all, excellently. With an excellent mic and image stabilization this camera is well worth the price 
 Brown is able to establish the foundations for anyone interested in late antiquity with clarity and scholarly depth that is unparelled in the field.  This book, although taking a broad picture of the period, and focusing on a shallow over view, rather than taking an indepth look into any perticular aspect of the period, is still scholarly enough to interest even the most particular historian, but will catch the interest of the beginer also.  Browns conclusions are well thought out, and are based on an extensive, and acurate picture of the period.  The documentation is incredible, hundreds of documents are quoted, and carefully indexed, in a book under 200 hundred pages, so the most nitpicky readers can see exactly where Brown is comming from.  This should be the model for broad view scholarly work, this is truly an excellent work 
 This is the one of the best movies I've watched.  A lot of men, not all, are like these women's husbands.  I say good for these gals.  The actresses are outstanding and I think they had a great deal of fun filming this.  Especially the end part where they sing all together.  Did they all really sing or just Bette Midler?  I wonder.  Great movie, I watch it over and over again! 
 This book was loaned to me by a girlfriend, little did she know the impact it would have on my life.  I was so relieved to finally read about others facing the same emotions/struggles that I've been experiencing, both the author, her friends, and characters from the bible.  It gave me peace 
 although i have to admit that i'm a bit biased towards any book that paints scotland in a flattering light, this is a great read.  i found it especially helpful when i was writing a thesis about the ebbs and flows of scottish power within the united kingdom. since this book covers everything from the act of union to the recent establishment of the scottish parliament, it was extremely helpful.  it's one of the few books of its kind.  if you are curious to know how exactly the UK works (ie how can england, wales, northern ireland, and scotland be seperate countries and the same country) this is a good place to start, and it's a compelling read 
 I'm a Scot history buff as well as enamered by tales about our founding fathers.  Lots of good background information, however it didn't seem to have much of a plot and if someone didn't know anything about Freemasionry you would be left very much in the dark 
 Do you want to read an adventurous, dangerous book about monsters?  The Lightning Thief by Rick Riorden is the book for you.  This book is about fourteen year old Perseus Jackson who finds out he's the son of Poseidon, the sea god.  He fights tons of monsters including the Minator, Medusa and a hell hound.  I though it was funny when he said "On the fall of that building, I wasn't scared, but my only thought I had was: AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!"  I recommend this book to people who like ancient Greece and that's why you should read the Lightning Thief. 
 Jim Hightower is just AMAZING. YOu must read this book. Jim talks about the environment, about the wage gap, about corporizations taking over schools and even about the conspiracies the parking meter people have schemed up to take away our money. I have learned more from Hightower than i ever have in any government class i've ever taken. Learn WHY our government isn't always the greatest. Jim includes quotes, examples, and jokes. He uses real life stories. Best of all, Hightower is [DARN] funny!!! YOu won't find an eyeopening book about politics anywhere else that is this funny (though Carl Hiaasen comes close). Enjoy!! 
 Air Supply is one of the best contemporary artists ever; and although their popularity died in the mid 80's, they never stopped making great music. This album pretty much proves that fact. The first half of the album  is awesome, with "Stronger Than The Night" and "Speaking of  Love" being the best. The second half, however, is not so good.  Nevertheless, Russell Hitchcock's vocals are fantastic, and Graham Russell  is also good. This album is definately worth a listen 
 This book is about how the concept of time is conceptualized, used, and measured in various cultures of human history both past and present.  The cultures include the ancient Chinese, ancient Greeks, Mayas, Incas, and African tribes.  The author examines archaelogical and literary records to show the various instruments humans used to count the passing of time.  The author also shows that the concept of linear time is actually quite unique to the modern Western world, and that this is not coincedental.  Many earlier societies that lived more in harmony with nature had a more cyclic view of time, as befits a lifestyle that depends on daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal and yearly patterns.  More advanced cultures such as the ancient Chinese had a cyclic view of time, but their cycles were in the millenia; possibly reflecting their knowledge of astronomical and geological phenomena that occurred over these time frames.  All in all, a very interesting book and highly recommended for anyone who likes the social sciences. 
 I actually decided to read Borg's books after reading some of John Crossan's books where Borg was referenced. I thought the set-up of this book was extremely helpful in illustrating what Borg was discussing. However, I think I had hoped this would be more of a "heart-felt" novel. I understand Borg had to get in all the historical information about Jesus (and he did an incredible job at that) but I had hoped he would speak of Jesus on more of an emotional level. I felt as I was more of an outsider looking in on the life of Jesus rather than a comrade right next to him. And perhaps that is the effect Borg wanted. All in all, a great book with great information. What I found most interesting in this whole book was the link between Jesus and Sophia (wisdom). Borg makes an excellent point to contrast the "Son of God" image of Jesus by saying Jesus was personified as Wisdom- a feminine term in Greek. He does this to stress the many metaphors used when defining Jesus and says we must not take them literally. All in all a great read with great information. 
 A fun Sunday afternoon read.  I would read it after Cetaganda but before Brothers in Arms, as recommended by Amazon, even though one of the stories technically takes place after Brothers in Arms 
 My Brazilian friend living in New York with an American family bought this book for her "host" father as a Father's Day gift.  Out of all of the books on Brazil she could have chosen, she selected this one because of  its nice graphics and wide-variety of information about her native country.   She recommend it so highly, that I bought one for myself 
 Dracula is a book anchored in the Christian tradition. It portraits the battle between good and evil, black and white, sexual lust and love, between the Christians and the heathen.  Dracula is the devil in disguise, the personification of evil in nature, the enemy of the Christian God, 'who commanded nations and intrigued for them and fought for them.' The book is an attack against rationality ('the unexpected always happens'), as the basic Christian dogmas are also not rational. However, its Christian precepts are to be taken 'cum grano salis': 'And to superstition must we trust, it was man's faith in the early, and it has its roots in faith still.' More, the end justifies the means: 'Thank God! This is the country where bribery can do anything ... Judge Moneybag will settle this case.' Finally, 'euthanasia ia an excellent and comforting word.'  As critic Davis Rogers pointed out: 'Dracula is reactionary ... the group of manly men (who destroy Dracula) represent the restorative powers of traditional patriarchal rule.'  But the book contains such classical scenes as 'the beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw out sparks of hellfire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of the flesh were the coils of Medusa's snakes, and the lovely, bloodstained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of the Greek and Japanese.'  All in all, 'even the sceptic who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter truth in anything holy or emotional, shall be melted to the heart.' Highly recommended, not only for horror fans.  I also recommend highly Gustav Meyrink's, more rational, masterpiece 'The Golem' 
 This book is very good for finding name brands, but it does not concentrate on a wide showing of each type. It is a helpful book for newer jars 
 In my view, Peter Robinson is one of our greatest writers of detective fiction: in his Alan Banks' novels, he has created a complex, interesting man struggling with his issues.  I am reading all of his Alan Banks novels chronologically, which I recommend because he refers to prior events in Banks' life, events that will not be as meaningful to the reader if he has not read the prior novels.  In "Playing with Fire" Robinson intrigues us with a series of fires that have claimed lives.  Are we dealing with an arsonist or could these fires be cleverly planned attempts to murder the victims?  As Banks pursues his investigation, the reader is swept up in exciting events, one of which almost costs Banks his life.  Robinson is in top form here as we join him in unravelling a fascinating mystery and in further developing the pains and pleasures of Banks' life in Yorkshire. 
 Really fun to read, great pace and highly entertaining. The thrilling and complex story has great characters and ample twists and turns. I stayed awake for long hours to read the book and the story kept me guessing until the very end. Unfortunately I cannot say that the solution for Web London's misery is completely convincing or really believable for me. Therefore I could not rate the book with the full 5 stars. Nevertheless I really recommend to read the book - you wont regret it 
 I watched this show when it was on in the 70s and I've been a big fan.  It just goes to show you that "there is nothing  new under the sun...".  The concerns and problems the Evans family dealt with then are mostly the same ones we have today.  The surviving cast should do a reunion movie 
 This is a wonderful book.  It is part cookbook, part food background.  Although not all of the recipes are macrobiotic, a good deal of them are, illustrating just how tasty this style of food can be.  I've only tried two recipes so far due to the fact that I just bought the book.  I made the brown rice gravy, adding mushrooms for Thanksgiving and it was a taste sensation as well as an all around hit.  I also made the oden, a five root japanese stew which was hearty and delicious.  It was great paired with steamed kale and brown rice.  Overall, this is a great book.  Another thing that makes it good is that the binding is sturdy enough to stay fully open while cooking, which does not happen too often with soft cover books 
 Shane is a good book.  Shane stands up against the bad guys and helps a family on their homestead in the west.  I wish I had a friend like Shane.  He was willing to give everything up for good reasons.  You will like Shane, too 
 If you're Catholic or interested in exploring the Catholic faith, the Compendium should be on your bookshelf and will quickly become one of your regularly consulted resources.  The concise question and answer format lends itself to quick answers to those complex questions that may arise.  For greater exploration, catechetical citations are provided.  I particularly enjoyed the lovely color illustrations and the addition of common prayers in Latin.   I would not say that the Compendium is a replacement for the Catechism, but rather an effective companion to the original and a wonderful resource for anyone looking to grow in knowledge and faith 
 Wow this is refreshing I don't have to dredge through all of the reviews professing that " LIMP DISKETTE ARE THE BEST BAND EVER!" or something like these guys suck because MTV doesn't play their videos. I have all of the Melvins albums and this one is probably my favorite, I don't know if it is their best but my favorite. I don't usually go into detail about certain aspects of songs or music. To me it is good or horsesh*t. That being said you can't go wrong with any of their records. I think for someone starting out this might be the one you want to get, so that you can kind of get the feel for how these guys like to create their own brand of music. Plus I think it has one of the more accesible songs in REVOLVE. Don't get me wrong I fu*king love the track but it is probably one of their most radio friendly songs. Ofcourse I have never heard it on the radio. Don't know if that's good or bad, guess that is for another discussion 
 David Fromkin's "Europe's Last Summer" is a murder mystery writ large;  Who ended the long peace Europe had known since the Napoleonic wars, and caused the great tragedy of the first world war, that seminal event of the twentieth century?  In my mind, Fromkin offers two mutually exclusive answers to this question.  The largest portion of the book is a history of the background, personalities and events of the pre war world, and a day by day countdown from the serving of the Austrian ultimatum to the German invasion of Belgium and the British declaration of war.    The last section of the book is Fromkin's theoretical analysis, in which he introduces a fascinating conception of the July Crisis:  that there were two wars being raged at the time, not one:  Austria's War against Serbia, and Germany's War against Russia, France and Great Britain.  Austria triggered the former, and Germany the latter:  "It was no accident that Europe went to war at that time.  It was the result of premeditated decisions by two governments" (p. 293).  Allegedly, Germany found that the Sarajevo crisis was the perfect pretext for war - it was initiated by the Hapsburg Empire, and thus committed Austria-Hungary to fight along with Germany, and the assassination of Franz Ferdinand made the Serbs, and not the Austrians or the Germans, seem like the perpetrators.  If one man could be said to be the criminal it is German Helmuth von Moltke, German chief of staff, the man who had wanted an all out European War all along.  "To the extent that any individual did so... this rather ordinary career army officer started the Great War".  (p. 305)  But Fromkin's account suggests a more complex answer; although German's Military leadership did plan the Great War, neither its Civilian Government nor the German Kaiser Wilhelm the 2nd wanted it, and even Moltke was ambiguous about it.  The War broke out because two German-Austrian plots had failed; with the second failure, and with the Russian mobilization, moderates in Germany and Austria Hungary failed to control the events.  The War was only partially premeditated; The Germans had played with matches, but they wanted a local, contained burning.  The wildfire that erupted was neither planned not wished for.  I have previously read three of David Fromkin's books.  His "A Peace to End All Peace" is a superb description of the origin of Modern Middle East, and of its transformation during the First World War.  Based on original research, it is one of the best, and best written, history books I know.  Fromkin's "The Way of the World" and "Kosovo Crossing" were less impressive, although every bit as well written.  Not based on original research, they were less enlightening and ambitious in conception, even if not in scope (The Way of the World is literally a history of everything - from the Big Bang to the end of the Cold War and beyond).    Fortunately, Europe's Last Summer is closer to the Former than to the latter two.  Although it is based primarily on secondary sources, Fromkin is very well familiar with the events.  The narrow focus on the breaking war adds tension, and the character portraits - particularly of Franz Ferdinand and his wife - are nothing if not spectacular.   Although the writing is not as flawless as in previous efforts (the book is occasionally factious and too often repetitive), it is nonetheless a page turner, and Fromkin is capable of prose that will put any novelist to shame:  "Denizens of the revolutionary underground tend to be thought of as belonging to the political left.  But terrorists often occupy a time wrap of their own: sometimes they look not forward but backward.  They seek to restore kingdoms long since crumbles into dust.  They rally to the banners of forgotten causes.  They hearken to prophets who preached to the people of a by gone age" (p. 118)  Following the terrorist assassination of Franz Ferdinand, Germany and Austria Hungary hoped to use the crisis in order to achieve a "fait accompli" - an invasion of Serbia that would end its existence as an independent power, and end the risk to the Hapsburg Empire.  But the attack had to be done, and be over quickly.  This was German policy which was expressed by none other then Moltke the younger, whom Fromkin holds to be the chief perpetrator of the War: "Austria must beat the Serbs and then make peace quickly" (p. 156).  But the Austrians could not be made to move fast enough.  Not Wishing to appear the aggressors, they drew up an ultimatum that was bound to be, and was, refused.     But the Serbian reply was compelling enough for the Kaiser to pronounce that "every cause for war has vanished".  Wilhelm decided to mediate for peace, while "safeguard[ing] Austria Hungary's honor and self esteem" (p. 218).  The great mystery of the War, and the one that Fromkin does not entirely explain, is why the events deteriorated from this to the German declaration of War against Russia on August 1.  For this, there are partial explanations:  Wilhelm no longer controlled German policy; The Austrians, fearing that their accomplishments were robbed from them, pursued on regardless; The Russian mobilization was misinterpreted by Wilhelm, who thought that they were ahead of the Germans - and the military plans of Germany, which forced it to fight against France BEFORE fighting Russia, had a logic of their own.  Amidst this, the German Junkers, headed by Moltke, did wish for a European War, believing that one was inevitable, and that 1914 was the right time for that war.  But their desires were not unambiguous, and it is not clear that they had to triumph over other forces in Germany.  Fromkin is correct in centering on Germany and Austria as the key to understanding the war's outbreak; but pointing at the culprit is much more difficult than he makes it out to be.     
 I love buying movies that no one had heard of, just by reading the box. This one was a true find. Very sweet hidden love story and an all around wonderful movie 
 When I sat down and told the kids to listen to the first chapter I got some grumbling but by the middle of the first chapter they were engrossed with me and begged for another chapter!  Very lively and entertaining--we had to stop and laugh several times!  A pure enjoyable read and great for kids! 6****** from us 
 The cartridge is just fine, I use it for printing cards and like the quality of my prints, but Amazon is acting like they are giving us such a bargain. I'm disappointed by this. You can buy this same cartridge at regular price directly from the folks who make the printer for a whole whopping 70 cents more than this supposedly 20% mark down sale price.  That is not a sale, it's highway robbery.  Now the price for the regular sized cartridge IS a sale, it's cheaper than you can get it directly from the people who make the printer for this cartridge or any other place I've seen so far 
 As a newer student of history I'm fascinated by all of the research and reconstruction that goes into putting together biographies of some of our early leaders.  This book is no exception.  The story at times becomes a little bogged down in details that can distract, but overall the reading is easy and the content stays with the reader 
 unbelievable tubist who MUST BE HEARD.. hard to keep your feet stil 
 How can an IMAX presentation in HDTV + 5.1 sound be ? Just great.  And when its about sea, sun, dolphins, narrated by the warm voice of P.B. and sung by Sting, its more than this.  Either to entertain children or stun friends, this one is just perfect, like all the Mc Gillivray Freeman series.. 
 This cat is the best guitar player working today.  Maybe the best of all time.  No disrespect to Charlie C., Django, Wes, Barney, Herb, Charlie Byrd, George Van eps, Tal Farlow, Johnny Smith, Joe Pass, those guys from the past.  I love 'em all.  The guys working today, Jimmy Bruno, Bruce Forman, Peter Bernstein: awesome! But Howard is from another planet.  Don't even mention Metheny, Scofield, Mike Hearn, Frank Gambale, Kurt Rosenwinkel etc.  These electronic gadget freaks don't even deserve a mention amoung the real players.  If you don't agree, no problem.  I know what I like.  You know what you like.  email me well discuss it 
 It seems that this was the standard textbook for most university opera history courses at one time (at least it was when I took the course in the early 80's).  However, it seems to have fallen out of favor because those  of us who read the earlier editions and are now teaching opera history  courses recall the writing to be confusing, if not outright dull.  In my  opinion this lastest edition, written with Hermione Weigel Williams, is an  improvement, and I think the book deserves a second reading.  After  teaching our opera history course using another text, I returned to this  one because I feel it provides a better narrative: there seems to be more  of an effort to relate the various movements in opera to one another.  This  cause and effect relationship is helpful to the student in their attempt to  retain the information, and as well as understand the significance of each  operatic movement. Give it another chance 
 Hank Nuwer, the author of this book, WAS in fact a member of a greek organization. Although he wouldn't reveal to me which one, it would explain to me how he knew so much about the inner workings of a fraternity. And, incidently, he is not against the abolition of fraternities either - so before you go off on someone next time, do a little research, it helps 
 While reading this book, my surprise and delight went increasing. My surprise first, for discovering Pythagoras represented much more than his well known theorem as he also was a philosopher, a great traveller through space, time, spirits and dimensions. The author Karim, like Pythagoras a seeker of harmony, provided me with great delight as sweet thoughts wandered in my imagination when his book made me dive back into ancient civilisations and traditions described so precisely and so charming, in a state where these two worlds of reality and mysticism brush against each other often and mix with each other sometimes. A great thank to the author and to his thorough and complete research and work in its description of what was Pythagoras life. 
 Gary Larson's The Far Side continues to please.  These are the jokes great greeting cards are made of.  As only the best humorists like Jerry Seinfeld do, Mr. Larson makes the reader smile and laugh the most when making us laugh at ourselves. In his cartoons, the reader will see the idiosyncracies, rigidity, and sarcasm of everyday life.  His cartoons are caricatures:  hyperbole.  So that, in a way similar to Jerry Seinfeld, Larson makes us feel more confident and pleased with the humor of it all because we are not laughing at anyone's expense 
 This album is for ANYONE who likes pop music (Britney Spears, Mandy Moore, etc.)!   1. I Wanna Love You Forever- 10/10-This was Jessica's first single and hit, and among her best. The song is catchy and has a nice slow beat which you could listen to again and again.  2. I Think That I'm In Love With You- 10/10- Her 2nd hit single, but didn't last that long. The tune is very catchy and has a fast beat which is great to dance to.   3. Where You Are-9.5/10- This was Jessica's first (and only at the moment) song with her husband Nick Lachey. The song is slow but very moving and very beautiful.   4. Final Heartbreak-9/10- This song is for anyone who has a crush on someone, or has a boyfriend. The tune is not that catchy. The lyrics repeat themselves a lot but I like the beat and chorus.  5. Woman In Me (With Destiny's Child)- 8.5/10-The song's tune and beat are very catchy. The lyrics repeat themselves a lot but the song is cute and fun to sing along to.  6. I've Got My Eyes On You-7.5/10-The song is okay, but it repeats itself way too much.  7. Betcha She Don't Love You-8.5/10- The song is catchy but repeats the chorus often.  8. My Wonderful-10/10-The beat is great, it has great lyrics and it's good to sing along to.  9. Sweet Kisses-7.5/10- The song is okay; the only good thing about it is the introduction to the song and the background music. Very slow- moving.  10. Your Faith In Me-10/10-The song and lyrics are good and the background music is great. It is fun to listen to.  11. Heart Of Innocence-8.5/10-The song is good to sing along to because it's slow, but it is not really good to dance to. The lyrics are very sweet 
 The Face of Deception revolves around Eve Duncan, a forensic sculptor, who's struggling to live with the murder of her young daughter eight years before. Eve specializes in "putting a face" to the skulls found by police agencies around the world. She is dedicated to helping victim's parents obtain closure to the nightmare she too has endured, yet has no closure with because her daughter's body was never found. Eve feels closure will elude her until she is able to give Bonnie a proper burial so she has become an expert in order to help others with their own, personal horror of missing children.  John Logan, a wealthy computer mogul, hires Eve to help identify a skull he obtained. He's not giving many details about how or where he came to possess the skull and at first she refuses to work for him. He knows which buttons to push to win Eve over to his side and after a large donation is made to her favorite children's charity, she begins. All he tells her is that the skull will be a well-known person and alludes to it being John F. Kennedy. Little does she know that as soon as she sets off on this "easy" assignment, her life is in danger.  So begins the story of Eve Duncan and what a wonderful story it is. The character development was excellent as Johansen introduces us to not only Eve and Logan, but also to Joe Quinn, the detective who's been Eve's friend since he helped investigate her daughter's death. The descriptive passages are so vivid that you can close your eyes and actually see the cornfield she describes, or the lab in which Eve works. The suspense is magnificent and the twists and turns throughout the book are the type that will keep the most avid mystery reader on his/her toes.   The reason I didn't enjoy this book as much as other Johansen books was the loose ends that were left dangling. It was almost like reading an Alfred Hitchcock type book - I had many questions that needed answering before I could let go of the story. Then I saw the description of The Killing Game (her book that continues this saga). Ah, that finally explained why all the loose ends were not tied up in neat little bows. It took two books to tell this entire story of Eve Duncan and her quest to find her daughter and both were highly enjoyable. As I finished The Killing Game I understood much more about The Face of Deception. I had all of my answers and could look back at the tale of Eve Duncan with understanding and a feeling of a story well told.  I'm at a point where I wish Iris Johansen could write faster. She's written excellent, suspenseful, thrillers and I know I'll continue to pick up a copy of her new books the day they are available. I just wish I didn't have to wait so long in between books, but I guess that's the price I have to pay. It's a small price considering the amount of enjoyment from each of her books, so I'll try to be more patient (even though it's very hard). Hey, anyone have any advance reader's copies??? 
 Art Linkletter and Mark Hansen have authored The Bible on living life to the fullest to the very end ... and just may be beyond ...It is a New Testiment to all who follow. This lesson in living is absolutely AGELESS. 
 _The Long Summer_ by Brian Fagan is in essence a follow up of his excellent earlier work, _The Little Ice Age_, a book that explored the effect of a particular climatic episode on European civilization between the years 1300 and 1850. Fagan expanded his focus greatly in _The Long Summer_ as in this work he analyzed the effects of various climatic events since 18,000 B.C. on the course of Stone Age life, early farming societies, and the evolution of civilizations in Europe, southwest Asia, north Africa, and the Americas, covering climatically-influenced human history from the settlement of the Americas to the origins of the Sumerians to the conquest of Gaul by Rome (which was fascinating) through the end of the Mayan and Tiwanaku civilizations (in Central and South America respectively). As in _The Little Ice Age_, Fagan dismissed both those who discounted the role climatic change had played in transforming human societies and those who believed in environmental determinism (the notion that climate change was the primary cause of major developments in human civilization).   	Fagan provided many examples of climatic change affecting human history. Between 13,000 and 8,000 B.C. Europe became covered in forest thanks to warming climates and retreating glaciers. This climatic change - and resulting alteration in the ecology of the region - lead to the extinction of the large and medium-sized herd animals that were the favored prey of the Cro-Magnons (such as the mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, giant deer, and reindeer) and their replacement by smaller, generally more dispersed game like red deer, wild boar, and aurochs. Not only did this change in fauna lead to a change in hunting techniques, it also lead to an increased reliance on plant food and in general a much broader diet that included nuts, seeds, tubers, fruit, and fungi. Other changes included increased mobility - and the end of cave art, as tribes and bands were no longer attached to certain areas - and the development of the bow and arrow, much more effective in dense forest against solitary, skittish prey.   	While Europeans adjusted to a world without megafauna, by 11,000 B.C. a group known as the Kebarans became dependent upon a relatively moist area of oak and pistachio forests that extended from modern Israel through Lebanon and into much of modern Syria. Though not developing agriculture per se, as they did not plant crops but rather relied on wild plants, they nevertheless developed some of the early signs of agriculture, such as pestles, mortars, and other tools to process the seeds and nuts that they harvested, the Kebarans relying on the millions of acorns and pistachios that they collected each year, supplemented by wild grass seeds and wild gazelles.   While the development of permanent Kebaran villages anchored to groves of nut-bearing trees and grass stands was a response to climatic and ecological changes brought on by the end of the Ice Age, their eventual end was also largely brought upon by the onset of a series of intense droughts thanks to a remarkable and seemingly distant event around 11,000 B.C.; the draining of the immense Lake Agassiz, a huge meltwater lake that lapped the retreating Laurentide ice sheet for 1,100 km in modern day Canada and the U.S. The lake rose so much that it eventually burst its banks and flooded into what is now Lake Superior and then onto to the Labrador Sea. So much Agassiz meltwater floated atop the dense, salty Gulf Stream that for ten centuries that conveyor of warm, moist air to Europe ceased, among other things plunging southwestern Asia into a thousand year drought. This drought eliminated the groves that the Kebarans depended upon, ending their prehistoric society, though not before the first experiments with cultivating wild grasses. Eventually villages arose that existed primarily dependent and then completely dependent upon cereal agriculture, on grain crops planted and harvested by the people themselves. In such places as Abu Hureyra in modern Syria full-fledged farming arose by 9500 B.C. as a response to drought, to the end of the oak-pistachio belt and the decline of game.   	Just as drought lead to early experiments with pre-agricultural communities and then to the actual cultivation of grains, it may have also lead to the domestication of wild goats and sheep in southwestern Asia and of cattle in what would become the Sahara Desert. The arid conditions for instance in southwestern Asia between 11,000 and 9500 B.C. lead to a concentration of game and of humans around the increasingly few permanent water sources, an event that would allow hunters to intimately know individual herds, even individual animals, allowing for these ancient humans to learn how to control the few key members of herds, to selectively cull undesirable members to change the characteristics of that herd's offspring, and how to eventually capture and pen some or all of the herd for later consumption.  	It was amazing to me how different the climate and terrain of ancient man truly was. Those who discount the effects of climatic change upon human history should consider how different the world of 6200 BC was. In this year - the time of the famed flat-roofed settlement of Catalhoyuk in central Turkey - farmers lived on the shores of the vast, brackish Euxine Lake to the north of the Anatolian plateau (what would become the Black Sea) and the Laurentide glacier was still retreating in northern Canada. In this year (more or less) began what has been called the Mini Ice Age as vast amounts of Laurentide meltwater suppressed the Gulf Stream, plunged Europe into colder and drier conditions, produced a profound drought in the Mediterranean, and caused ocean waters to rise so that Britain was finally severed from the continent.   	Also quite interesting were the several prehistoric societies Fagan touched upon, such as the Kebarans, the `Ubaid people of 5800 B.C. southern Mesopotamia (they predate the Sumerians), the Linearbandkeramik communities of 5600 B.C. Europe, and the early fifth millennium B.C. Badarians of the Nile Valley, groups I was completely unfamiliar with.  
 I've read this book 3 times.  About once every 2 years, and it's helpfull everytime.  This book provides great insight into what it really means to raise a son who will grow into a man of integrity.  The author writes in a manner that is easy to read and understand.  Using pertinent examples, and advice to fathers of sons or soon to be fathers of sons.  Of all the Christian living books this one is in my top 3.  Great Day All 
 This book is written with the assumption that you will be teaching young people in college or below(pedagogy).  It is great for that.  If you want to get it to learn techniques for teaching adults in the workplace(andragogy), look for another book 
 What can I say about this book???  It was fantasic, superb, a wonderful if sometimes disturbing read.  Anne Tyler captures so well the devastating effects that the lack of love and security and connection in our family can have on us for the rest of our lives.  Her characters are so troubled and so unable to really live in the world, always desperately wanting the family they didn't have, always afraid and isolated from real human connection, detached from their own feelings.  The three children, for all their flaws, are enormously sympathetic -- for how were they to know how to live, how to feel, how to connect, when they were raised by a woman who is so incredibly isolated and rigid and, perhaps, incapable of real love??  I had little feeling or sympathy for their mother, Pearl, which is one of the best aspects of Anne Tyler's novels -- her characters are not universally likeable and sometimes -- most of the time -- they don't redeem themselves in the end.  Like real life, there isn't always a neat little happy ending 
 GREAT book and easy to use, has really helped me with my problems. I have shared the book with everyone I know that needs to know how to help themselves at home 
 When used at least 6 days per week for 15 minutes it does a great job at nearly eliminating breakouts and keeping skin clear for my 14 year old daughter.  I got the light because I had noticed that she did not break out during the summmer months, and hoped that using this light would have a similar effect, and it does.  Much better results than benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid products alone have had.  We have found that she can skip one day, but if 2 days are missed, breakouts reoccur. I think that over time it will pay for itself when considering what I have spent on expensive over-the-counter acne treatments.  We are now getting by with just an inexpensive Equate brand cleanser and a foundation for acne-prone skin 
 An unusually fresh and astringent comic novel that manages to convey the experience of a terrifying and agonizing illness, as expenienced by a teenage girl, without a hint of cliche. The characters are wonderful, the  novel engages the reader on every page. It's sexy and funny and painful 
 I like this movie. Is soft, lil' slow. But I like to imagine iF I was there, with them. To think the situation, trying to know "what's really happened". That's make me stay in the movie without boring. And the music belongs so good, excellent combination between the scenary and the music 
 Cynthia Rylant has done the un-doable.  She's written simple, beautiful, stark little amazing poems describing simple, beautiful, stark black and white photographs taken during the great Depression.  Whoever said a picture is worth a thousand words, didn't know Ms. Rylant.  For instance, next to a photograph of a very tall tree limb stuck in the ground with several gourd bird houses hanging haphazardly from it is this poem:  Birdhouses  People said they were a good excuse for looking up.  That's the shortest poem in the book, but it's perfect for the photo.  As soon as I read the last poem, I wanted to order copies of this book for every poetry-loving friend I have and scream, "STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND READ THIS RIGHT NOW!"    Life is too, too short NOT to read poetry.  It's life affirming, inspiring and uplifting.  If only for a moment, it takes us outside of our selves and gives us a glimpse of pure Spirit.  I've always believed that God can be found in the blank spaces between the words and this book of photos and poems only proves my theory.  In the beginning was the word and the word was God.  He's there in the words and the spaces.  Buy this book and read it over and over and definitely give it to your friends and family.  Even is you don't care for poetry, the photographs will speak to your heart and feed your spirit.   
 My daughter, Rachel, and I  got a kick out of the adventurous Oddkins about animated toys on the loose one dark and dreary night.  We laughed until milk came out of our noses when we read the frightfully funny tale, Santa's Twin about an imposter Santa who leaves obnoxious things like snot in kids' stockings.  In Rachel's opinion the more obnoxious, the better.  So we were excited about the release of The Paper Doorway.  Her favorite poem is Peg-Leg Zeg about a pirate who loves picking at crocodiles and subsequently gets several appendages eaten.  What can I say, the kid has a weird sense of humor which, I suspect, she inherited from me!  My personal favorite is A Cure For Ugly about a man who was horribly disfigured on the outside, but beautiful on the inside.  What a wonderful way for collaborators, Koontz and Parks to get across the fact that books are the doorway to a kid's imagination and so much more. Dean's rhymes were exceptionally witty at times and poignant at others.  Phil's illustrations beautifully complemented Dean's words. They're a winning team as evidenced by their long association, and the quality of their latest project, The Paper Doorway. Wholly delightful 
 I am not a mountain climber but this book kept me spellbound.  The author did a very good job maintaing objectivity, although it was clear that greed and competition between the two climbing groups was the main reason this disaster happened:  neither man wanted to back down from the mountain and give up his quest to be first at the summit, they had become oblivious to the incoming storm.  This cost several climbers their lives.  The author was also quite good at describing not just the event, but also the terrain (trash all over the mountain crevaces), the sherpas, and even a personality profile of every climber on the quest.  In the end we all cheer for all of them to make it, even when we know that some won't.  The hardest part to read was the last chapter, when Krakauer went to interview the climbers after the event.   Krakauer's other books are just as good, namely "Into the Wild."  He certainly does a very good job researching his topics.  I read this book in one night because I couldn't put it down 
 I have taken many courses on differentiation and understand that students are learning at different levels, but meeting those individual student needs on a continuous basis is nearly an impossible task.  Each reading strategy or concept in the book is tiered for three groups, with an organizer to guide the students thinking at their level; introductory, intermediate, and challenging.  These organizers make the impossible...possible. The similar title for writing is just as useful as the reading. Both books have helped me to meet the needs of ALL students and keep me sane. These books reside on my desk; they are in constant use!    
 I tend to be hard on a lot of major motion pictures because, to be frank, they mostly suck. However, this only turned into a "major motion picture" after Fox Searchlight bought it after it's screening at the Sundance Film Festival. Before that it was the vision of fledgling director Jason Reitman to independently bring Christopher Buckley's tremendously smart and funny book of the same name to the screen... and he does a good job. There's a reason why this film is loaded with the (mostly unpaid or underpaid) who's who of Hollywood talent. The script and screenplay are that good. This is not the typical low-brow, fart-joke riden crap you're used to seeing out of Hollywood. There are good acting performances throughout as well. If you are a person of above average wit and have a dry sense of humor, you'll like it. 
 The Ghost and Mrs.Hobbs is a great story for people of all ages. It kept me in suspense right up to the last chapter! I could'nt wait to finish and see how the story turned out! I chose to listen to this book on audio for my english class because I thought that it would be short and I would'nt have to listen to it for that long, I never thought that I would actually like the book, but I did! If I could I would write another paper for it! I really think that you should read this book because I know you'll enjoy it 
 Have you ever wondered how they built the pyramids? Or the Colossus of Rhodes? Or those huge walls, aqueducts or temples? Sprague de Camp shows in a very entertaining and engaging manner how the ancients were as  intelligent as we are today and many a lot more so. They didn't have modern  technology but they did have ample curiosity, ingenuity and derring-do. A  must read for anyone interested in history 
 The authors don't dodge controversial issues and choose sides in this superbly written book. They show profusely that economics is mainly about capitalism and the costs and benefits of economic freedom. One of the essential issues in economics is the tension between the claims of efficiency and justice, between conservatives and liberals. But they draw the line between disagreement and sheer incomprehension. Their cause is the liberal one: the government can add to the growth of GNP. But frankly not in the way the actual government is doing it by 'cost overruns in defense programs' (a massive part of the federal budget), instead of investing in infrastructure, R & D and, most importantly, in education.  They fustigate supply-side economics (serving all wealthy taxpayers, but pulling the rug under the feet of the needy), or Milton Friedman's 'Doing Nothing'. On the Negative Income Tax solution they remark: 'That may accord with our Sunday morality, but not with our workday morality.'  By the way, this book is a clearly explained textbook on economics (macro and micro, money-banks-gold, consuming-saving-investing, big and small businesses, GNP, income distribution, externalities, rationing ...) The index is superb.  It ends with a severe warning: 'Having fallen behind, we will stay behind.'  If you should read one book about economics, this is it: a magisterial course, even for economists 
 This book will provide hours of reading fun.  My toddler and I see something new each time we look at it.  He has learned the names to so many things just by looking at the pictures.  All the animals provide a bit of laughter that makes this book so much fun 
 I am very surprised at the negative reviews for this film. I never saw the Broadway musical on which the movie was based, so I don't have the advantage of having the live performance to compare to the movie. I have to say that the film really touched me, and I generally haven't liked most of the recent musical films that I've seen. All of the songs in Rent have heavy and deep meanings behind them since there's hardly any spoken dialogue. This means that Rent moves forward on the strength of its songs. Each number furthers the plot and reveals another aspect of a character.   Playwright Jonathan Larson was an amazing human being with such a talent for - at the time he wrote it back in the early 90's - being so "out there" and taking the risk of writing about AIDS and homosexuality, and ultimately having his work find its way into the hearts of so many people. If you wrote an actual script in which the young author of such a wildly successful Pulitzer winning musical dies the night after its dress rehearsal after being misdiagnosed by two different hospitals, nobody would believe you, but that is exactly what happened. It is also a shame that the actual reality of life in Alphabet City (now very much gentrified) and the nature of the AIDS crisis and treatments have changed so much that many people might not consider this film's greatness because they will regard it as out of date. I guess I just found the movie to be brilliant because it wasn't supposed to be absolutely realistic, it was supposed to evoke emotion, and that it did, at least for me. None of the individual relationships get that much screen time, yet I really cared deeply about all of these characters, both as a group and individually.   You could really feel the urgency of time pressing on the characters that had AIDS - the urgency to create, the urgency to love, - since, in 1990, there were not a lot of therapies that effectively prevented HIV from turning into full blown AIDS as there are today. Also, if you are not moved by Collins' tribute to Angel in the reprise performance of "I'll Cover You", all I can say is that you have no soul. Jesse Martin does a splendid job of displaying a genuine sense of loss, grief, and love that is the best performance in the entire movie.  Rent is one of those few films that I like to watch over and over just to see if I have missed anything. It does seem like some of the movie's detractors are being a bit snobby about the fact that Chris Columbus, who is well known for directing family films, directed this movie. Unfortunately, Bob Fosse is no longer with us, because I have found myself wondering more than once what he would have done with this material. 
 I must agree with the person who wrote "Reasons This Is My Favorite Jesus Movie".   I saw The Visual Bible's "Gospel of Matthew" and I was sorely dissappointed. This "Jesus" smiled way too much and he was too touchy/feely. When he says to Peter, "Get the behind me Satan," he is hugging him. It felt like more of an apology than a rebuke. Again, when he is teaching Peter about how many times he should forgive his brother they end up acting it out with Peter doing most of the teaching not Jesus. I had a difficult time taking him seriously.   Not so in the "Gospel of John". I must say that Henry Cusick did a marvoulous potrayal of Jesus. It was especially touching when he prayed for the diciples the night before the crucifiction. It really bought the scriptures to life for me.   If you don't own it get it. Your money will not be wasted 
 JUST LIKE I REMEMBERED WHEN I WAS A KID WATCHING ON TELEVISION. THEY UPDATED THE COLOR SCHEME A BIT, BUT EVERYTHING IS AS THE ORIGINAL SHOWINGS ON TELEVISION 
 This book was simply enthralling! It provides a fantastic glimpse of Tibet prior to the vile takeover by the Chinese. I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Tibet, or the role of the United States in Asia during WWII 
 Business Valuation is the single largest niche practice area for the CPA today.  Dr. Pratt covers an extensive amount of material in this text.  No valuation specialist should be without this text in his or her reference library 
 The book is written by management consultants who suggest re-engineering the organizations as the most effective way for companies to remain competitive. This entails starting afresh to devise innovative ways to carry out business processes and serve customers more effectively. Managers, employees, business processes, among other things in the entire organization have to radically change so as to save costs, increase revenue, improve quality and serve customers better.   Business process reengineering requires visionary and competent leaders who exploit the vast opportunities availed by the latest information communication technologies, reorganizing employees into cohesive and productive working teams.  This is a well written book with clear explanations reinforced by case studies making it easily understandable to a diverse readership that may wish to understand the concept of business process reengineering and how they can implement it in the organization. They also make a good attempt to rescue business process reengineering from being just another fad of the 1990s and from the appalling image it had acquired for itself as a pretext to indiscriminately retrench people.  One major flaw I see is the perception that business process reengineering is the answers to all problems that an organization may be experiencing and that it is relatively simple and straightforward to implement. That is not always the case and one needs to analyze to see if reengineering is the optimal solution to the challenges of inertia and lack of customer focus and other ills that an organization may be experiencing. 
 When you read fiction, it's someimes hard to suspend your disbelief for the duration of the story.  This book marks the first time I've had to suspend my disbelief for a work of non-fiction.  Howard Hughes' life is so improbable that it takes conscious effort to remember that you are reading about a real person who actually lived the stories in the book.  Given the magnitude of Hughes' accompishments in film, aviation, and in the development of Las Vegas, not to mention his astounding love life with nearly all of the biggest starlets in Hollywood history and several underage debutantes and his massive insanity, it is hard to believe there isn't more written about Hughes.  Hack's work is very fun and a good introduction to Hughes' life, but it has its critics based on its technical accuracy and its focus on his love life.    It's surprising that there isn't yet a definitive biography on Hughes' life and it is really an amazing opportunity for a talented biographer to tackle.  Until such a thing comes along, however, you could do much worse than Hack's book and I recommend it for anyone interested in learning more about an absolutely fascinating character 
 This is a fascinating look at how an untutored and barely educated frontier man developed an exquisite sense of compassion and empathy when others in similar circumstances did not.  It is sort of a moral developmental history of Lincoln, which does not fail to recognize his mistakes and his sometimes painful failures as well as his successes.  I do not know that anyone can truly chart the evolution of thinking and belief of a person as briliant and complicated as Lincoln, but Miller makes a truly thoughtful and convincing attempt.  I know of no other book on Lincoln that comes close to this 
 This has to be the best short stories I've ever heard!  A must have 
 I like the doll. Now here's the but. My toddler is not enthused. She's 4 and had about 10 minutes of genuine interest. Now I have to egg her on to play with it. The review that said the hand movement gets irritating after a while was dead on. i gave 4 stars because I adore the concept. The doll is well made, the soft legs actually make dancing easier when you hold her hands,and as a big kid myself I do regress and play with her sometimes so she's got appeal. All chidren are different so for the money if you have a "dolly" lover it's a good buy 
 I've never been so bone-chillingly afraid of ANYTHING in my life. When I was six, the TV spots, known to me & my sisters as "The Dummy Commercial" aired during our nighttime television viewing time.  The first exposure left me petrified.  Each succesive airing made me run as far from the TV as possible.  In recent years I collected the nerve to rent the film on VHS, hoping for some kind of reckoning with 'Fats'... but the mood of the film was bland compared to my intensely frightened memories.  Now, at last, the film with all the press material, including that startling TV spot is available on DVD.  My heart thumped in my chest as I brought home this DVD and explained to my roommates the significance of what they would soon watch with me.  I made them leave the room as I cued up the spot, turned off the lights and asked them to be seated.  I started the commercial and watched both of my 30+ roommates freeze.  I confronted that harshly lit face and did not look away.  I studied every detail.  As a 33 year old man, I'm still afraid of the 'Dummy Commerical' 
 The Berenstain Bears give children some of the very best stories they will ever read.  I grew up with these enjoyable bears in the late 80's, and I really think parents should consider buying a few of these books for their children because they are a lot of fun.    One of my favorite moments ever in a Berenstain Bears book is when the bears are riding a bike down a dirt road, and they come across a big mud puddle.  They try to ride through it but instead they sink!  That moment influenced me to go outside during rainstorms as a child and try to find the biggest puddle to see if I too will sink!  Of course walking back inside the house all muddy made my parents angry but that's what being a kid is all about!  I also believe many dreams I've had years later (and continue to have to this day) about setting out on an adventure were a result of my childhood obsession with these books.   
 QBQ! by John Miller is simply amazing. This little book is a grand slam all the way! QBQ strips away all the excuses and reminds us again where it is the buck is supposed to stop. If you're looking for an instruction manaual for leaders, here it is. People don't need tricks, methods, myths or secrets...what they really need is a tool that helps them step up to the plate and be accountable for their own results. One of the biggest weaknesses of the American workforce is the ability to accept responsibility and accountability for our own actions.   Bravo for QBQ 
 Caitlin Kiernan has a beautiful voice and it resonates throughout this dark novel.  Kiernan's descriptions of the South, rock music, and the young outsiders that largely make up her cast of characters are all beautifully fleshed out, and her wonderfully disturbing tale will crawl into your mind and twitch until (and even after) you finish her book.  Speaking of the mind, one of the themes present throughout this novel (and many of her other works) is the question of whether the inexplicable is in one's mind or is based in reality.  She eloquently teases the reader with this theme throughout this work.  This book was one of the first works that I ever read of Ms. Kiernan's, but it was not the last.  I highly recommend all of her novels (as well as her works of short fiction).  The sequel to this novel is "Murder of Angels"

 It's a difficult task to write history that is well-researched, in depth, and factually precise, but at the same time aware of the narrative power of an evocative story well told. "The Price of Glory" is all these things. It's a powerful piece of writing, but also a serious and important work of historiography. It's the first book of Horne's I've read, but I intend now to track down several others.  Horne makes a strong case that Verdun was not only a shocking slaughter in its own right ("It was the indecisive battle in an indecisive war; the unnecessary battle in an unnecessary war; the battle that had no victors in a war that had no victors." -- p. 331), but an event that had massive symbolic and physical consequences across nations and generations.  This explains why Verdun is still relevant today, and why "The Price of Glory" is useful reading even for people who aren't armchair generals. As the title suggests -- and the narrative makes clear -- the simple military objective is only the start of the Verdun story. As the battle progressed, military objectives, and the lives of the men involved, became secondary to (allegedly) larger questions of "national honor." Blinded by the pursuit of pride, revenge, or honor, the bullheaded French insistence on *attaque à outrance* as much as the German plan to "bleed them white" virtually guaranteed a bloodbath -- especially when some men sought the glory while others paid the price.  I think this is a book the reader will long remember -- not only for the lessons of the battle and the price paid to learn them, but also for the skill and elegance with which Alastair Horne recounts them 
 What a well written, inspiring work by Dan Barry. I have lived in the Deer Park area all my life and find it a pleasure to read of places i pass, see, or visit on a frequent basis. Although i was born a few years after Mr. Barry, i found it interesting to see how our area has changed, yet stayed the same from his youth here to mine.  His story i heroic and his lighthearted humor made me not want to stop reading. A winner! 
 We enjoyed reading all of Dave Pelzer's books.  Excellent reading for all 
 In Chip Ingram's God as He Longs for You to See Him, readers are invited to join Chip on a personal journey where the attributes of God are contemplated, moving them from head knowledge to heart knowledge. 	A pastor for twenty plus years, Chip shares his trials and triumphs with winsome and genuine words. There is no illusion of Chip as super-Christian in this book, it is delightfully honest and readers of all ages and stages can relate to the simple yet powerful truths which transformed Chip's life. The book consists of ten chapters, seven of which are devoted to the attributes of God. The chapters are loaded with probing questions about your deepest beliefs. The attributes chapters include: "Tools for Transformation," key passages and scriptures to focus on for the coming week; a prayer to contemplate; as well as a personal insight into Chip's life which draws the reader into an intimate communication with the author as friend. 	Drawing from the Word of God, A.W. Tozer's Knowledge of the Holy, and J.I. Packer's Knowing God, Chip presents solid, intelligent arguments about who God is, and how He longs to be seen. Quoting Dr. Charles Ryrie, Chip's former professor, readers are challenged throughout the book to determine if in fact they really do, as they may profess, trust God. In the appendix is a "Vision Test" which aids the reader in determining their trust/view of God.  	The meat of Chip's message is provided in substantial pieces for readers to really chew on. Some books are difficult to get through because they are wearisome, not this one, I was challenged and inspired by it and did not want it to end. This book is a sound investment for any reader. Buy two copies and study it with a friend. This book would be an excellent Bible study with life changing results. If you only buy one book this year, let it be this one.

 i was looking for 4 stars +..but i decided for 5 stars because it is a real amount of work to produce such a film with such results. The story and the plot is a must in his kind and the 5 stars are deserved because the picture quality is awesome mainly at a time where High definition shows up...and where some  HD Dvd transfer are not realy supï¿½rior to standart enhanced definition(see my reviews) I have to admit i saw this movie in upscaling to 720P via Hdmi which is not standart definition buy i 
 Nothing too fancy, but it has all of the right connectors.  I can't say that I notice any better sound or picture in my home theater because of the line conditioning.  Haven't had any blackouts or brownouts yet, so I can't comment on that.  Was debating between this and a UPS, but I decided to get this because it was a lot cheaper.  We'll see if that was a wise decision. . .  
 Throughout the book, you'll be asking yourself if Francesca truly is the religious icon her community comes to believe she is. Is she carrying an immaculate conception? Can she heal people with a touch? Well told, this story is one you'll find as thought provoking as it is entertaining 
 Carol Kent has a deep, honest walk with the Lord that does not settle for cliches or easy answers.  Her years of study and work as a teaching leader in Bible Study Fellowship probably explains why her book rings true beyond the typical mush that the Christian Booksellers Ass'n churns out.  I don't know Carol personally but I do know a couple of her friends and they know what it means to suffer, to question, and come to the point where what matters isn't the "answers" but Him and only Him. I grieve over what Carol's family and her son's family have had to endure, but I am so profoundly grateful that Carol journaled through the tragedy and put the raw truth and the magnificent insights into a book.  This book will be a classic and should go into multiple printings.  It will be read for decades to come 
 This is probably the best album of Melvins' fairly brief career as major label recording artists. The riffs are heavy, but bright and bouncy rather than mired in sludge, and the 'experimental' elements are always hitched to great hooks. 'Bar-X the Rocking M' has a killer trombone solo, 'Skin Horse' is both hilarious and oddly touching, and 'Black Bock' is probably the most surprising track in Melvins' catalogue.  Less radio-friendly than 'Houdini' or 'Stoner Witch', but not nearly so weird as some other reviewers think. If you want Melvins at their most adventurous, try the excellent 'Honky' -- the next record they made after Atlantic dumped them for not selling as many records as Nirvana -- or the legendary 'Lysol' (also known just as 'Melvins' -- the one with the horserider on the front), the only full album featuring Joe Preston (Earth, Thrones). But there's no Melvins record that's not worth having 
 I use this book all the time at work. It's a great reference. I call it my dirty little secret. It's my cheatsheet for creating good data models. I did purchase the data models on the CD that comes with this book, and one model from volume two of this series, but I rarely use them. I find that I prefer to use the books to create the high level data model and then work out the details for myself. But this book is a real timesaver 
 There are not many magazines specializing in political commentary that are really any good these days. So many of them are geared toward a political party, instead of concentrating on the issues that are most important. "Reason" magazine is the exception, and with its motto that a "free mind implies a free market" and vice versa, it has proven to be a publication that one can count on for objective analysis under the umbrella of that motto. The authors who write for it definitely have their biases, but they are attentive to these biases, and usually anticipate and answer objections to the ideas on which they expound.   Many times this reviewer heard that the authors and editors of Reason are "socially liberal" but "fiscally conservative." This kind of description almost implies that their thinking is a mere hybrid of liberalism and conservatism. But this description is incorrect, for the content of the articles in Reason is a consequence of the general belief among its authors and editors that freedom, and that means first freedom of the mind, is a moral universal, regardless of the place and context in which one finds oneself. The `social liberalism' of Reason, if one is to call it that, manifests itself in the tolerance of ideas that one finds repugnant. The `fiscal conservatism' of Reason manifests itself in the belief that freedom is to be not subject to an arbitrary and coercive government that has no qualms about using deception or actual force to collect taxes, impose censorship, or generally violate individual rights.   There are always many fine articles written in Reason on a diversity of topics. The advocacy of biotechnology is refreshing and reflects a common sense attitude that is very rare in political debate on this branch of technology. One will also find commentary on government waste, propaganda, torture, and the "war" on drugs. In addition, many book reviews are included on books that are relevant to the issues that the magazine wants to address. One can only hope that Reason stays afloat and delivers many more insights in the years to come. The magazine is both a barometer of freedom of thought as well as its creation.  
 This is a fascinating examination of one of the most powerful and (arguably) destructive world leaders of the 20th century. For somebody like me with a very basic familiarity of the history of Communist China, this book is a little lacking as a biography. It offers little detail on Mao's background and nothing about his rise to power. It does provide, however, a unique perspective on the Chairman's life between the years of 1954, when Dr. Li became Mao's personal physician, and Mao's death in 1976. It is the first biography I've ever read to so closely examine the head/body connection in terms of how one's politics affect one's health and one's health, one's politics.  The book has a natural bias, since Dr. Li lived with Mao throughout most of this time and was directly involved in many of the events described.  He seems to strive for frankness, but a reader might sense that his memories are colored by his own attempts to save face. In some respects, it's more memoir of Li than biography of Mao--though that seems a small point to quibble about, since Mao was such a profound presence and influence in Li's life. Those seeking a detached perspective are advised to look elsewhere; this is a purely personal view.  I found it very rewarding. It humanized Mao to a much greater extent than biographies of political leaders generally do. Li seems to want to do justice to his subject, casting blame where appropriate and giving credit where he believes credit is due. The overall picture it presents of the Chairman is of a man with a sharply manipulative mind, but far more power than he could manage; with a much greater love for himself and his image than for the people he professed to serve. But at the same time, though Li may not intentionally have presented the image, Mao also emerges as a prisoner of the system he helped to emplace and so liberally exploited, particularly as he ages and his heath deteriorates. Hounded by his own superstitions and paranoias, he was ill-served by the sycophants he chose to surround him, but so blinded by his own cult of personality that he could never accept a true friend. This towering and terrifying figure is reduced to a querulous, feeble old man with no recourse to privacy or claim to humanity even in death, where his objectification extended to the point that his doctors were ordered to preserve his bloated corpse for eternal display. Sadly, I can't help but think that the Chairman would have approved 
 This is an essential read for anyone who wants a deeper understand of American foreign policy. A year after this book was published, there were over a hundred reviews. Regardless of whiether one disagrees or agrees with the author, finds the author right or wrong, interesting or boring, this book is one of the most influential books, if not the most influential book that affected American foreign policy. In fact, the current Bush Adminstration's policies, George Kenan's containment, Henry Kissinger's policies as well as countless adminstration's policies are shaped or affected by this book. My area of study is the foreign policy of Post World War Two American governments, and never have I understood it with greater clarity after I read this book. It is the thread which runs through the policies of all the administrations, differing on extent. (I studied the policies first and read the book the year after). It is a fascinating book and hard to put down. The author writes in a European style (beautiful long sentences,etc.), which in my opinion makes it more eloquent and in the opinion of my co-students makes it more difficut to read. He tries to give a balanced perspective from which one can think critically. Ms. Rice and Mr. Kissinger were heavily influenced by this book. To understand them, this is a must read. In and of itself, it is an excellent book, a classic, and thousands others significantly more qualified than I have reviewed it. Look even at other reviews on this website or at well known journals for a more accurate assement of the book itself by political scientists 
 I ordered this after reading the other reviews on the product.  It is absolutely the perfect size.  I can put vegetables or main dishes in this dish and it works great 
 This is the version I remember from the 70's, I believe this was Lesley Warren's first movie 
      The funny thing about the soundtrack Jon Brion has pieced together for "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", is that it's so odd, yet it works so well.  The songs and score, for the most part, flow seamlessly together, supporting each other to great effect.  My only complaint is with the two contributions from the Willowz, which doesn't seem to fit the tone of the album in general.  Jon Brion, if he plays his cards right, could become one of the most in-demand names in the film score world if he plays his cards right.  Up to this point, he's done music for films that are highly acclaimed, but just a step or two out of the mainstream.  (Examples include  Magnolia, Punch-Drunk Love, Eternal Sunshine, and I Heart Huckabees.)  His score is odd, strange, slightly bizarre, and surprisingly very touching.  Most of the songs are good choices, notably the two from the Polyphonic Spree and "Mr. Blue Sky" from the E.L.O. (possibly that particular group's most fun song.)  Also, great new recordings from Beck and Brion himself, who performs the wonderful tune "Strings that tie to you."  If you've got something of an open mind musically, I'd suggest soaking in some "Eternal Sunshine."  It's a unique and well-thought-out musical experience 
 A new documentary film that won the 2005 Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival now in nationwide release features a warning from this nation's 34th president about the unwarranted influence on U.S. foreign policy from the nation's numerous military contractors and is gaining praise from civil libertarians across the nation as that influence on world affairs is still obvious to all of us in today's times.  The film is called `Why We Fight,' a title the documentary filmmaker took from a series of World War 2 propaganda films made by Frank Capra.  It opens with the January 17, 1961 farewell address to the country by President Dwight Eisenhower who was about to turn over the keys to the White House to a young newcomer named John Kennedy.   The remarks made by the outgoing chief executive from the Oval Office was the last talk to the nation by the one time five-star Army general before returning to private life.  What's interesting in the speech is the candor he exhibited about what he believed to be the growing cozy relationship between military suppliers and those politicians in Congress who liked to keep the constituents in their districts happy with large contracts for the making of weapons and supplies.  That, in turn, would keep those contractors and the leaders in the military pleased because they would keep getting improved weapons to counter the growing Cold War threat they believed they faced from the Soviet Union.  The phrase Ike used, `the military-industrial complex,' has since become synonymous with the growing influence by military weapon suppliers on eager politicians wanting campaign donations for their coffers and jobs for their districts and the eagerness of those politicians to keep purchasing more and more weapons from these same suppliers.  It's obvious the World War 2 hero who commanded the Allied military invasion of Europe that defeated Nazism knew what he was talking about when he warned his fellow citizens that `we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.' Unfortunately, for us citizens who believe a rising police state has developed in the four decades since.  Eisenhower is considered by many of today's historians as an amiable military dunce who only knew how to operate in an Army setting so let the political experts in his administration make the decisions to run this country in his eight years in office in a similar fashion to that of a highly successful corporate CEO letting his underlings run the show while he spends most of his time visiting stockholders in cheerleading sessions to keep their stock value high.  But it's now apparent that he was much shrewder than originally believed in his dealings with Congress and the military bureaucracy he found in Washington during his tenure and what he felt was a growing threat against the unique political power of the president in setting American foreign policy and what the military need for defense.   The ninety-eight minute film then uses interviews with contemporary figures as diverse as Gore Vidal, John McCain, Richard Perle and William Kristol to showcase the filmmakers opinion that we still have too many Americans believing that the concept of never-ending war is good for the American economy and our nation's foreign policy goals that is transposed with historic footage and material regarding why we are currently in the conflict in faraway Iraq.  Dwight Eisenhower recognized the horrors of war and his farewell warning to the American people and his successors not to be taken in by those who promote the perpetual re-armament of our military so we can always be stronger than our perceived enemies still resonates with great force today.  It's a sad commentary that in the forty-five years since he left office with that dire prediction that so few of our politicians chose to listen. 
 A few years ago when I first heard of the phenomenon called "intentional community" I was introduced to the Communities Directory.  I found it to be the best single source of information on communities in the US -- and the all new edition is even better.  The directory contains information about many aspects of community life in well written articles.  It also provides description and contact information for over 700 communities around the world.  In addition it lists many community-focused resources and contains an excellent recommended reading list.  For anyone interested in finding "their" community, in locating community resources, in doing research -- or simply for the community curious -- this book is a must 
 Why haven't I tried Atomic Rooster much earlier? They are a band I heard of forever, been aware of forever that Carl Palmer was in this band before ELP (he only appeared on Rooster's debut album before jumping ship to ELP), and I even remembered a local Eugene, Oregon radio station (KRVM) playing "Black Snake" and "Head in the Sky" back in 1994 on a prog rock-oriented program called Deep Water Melodies.  OK, so In Hearing Of was their third album with just as many lineup changes. Now the band included vocalist ex-Cactus vocalist Pete French alongside guitarist John Cann, organist Vincent Crane, and drummer Paul Hammond. Many people call Death Walks Behind You as their high point, and while I have yet to try that album if In Hearing Of is anything to go by, I'm going to be in for a real treat for that album.  Anyway, this is a truly wonderful combination of hard rock and prog, certain to please fans of both, as the opening cut "Breakthrough" demonstrates, with some great piano and organ work, and some nice bluesy vocals. "Break the Ice" features some truly guitar guitar riff from Cann himself, and more great organ work from Crane. "Decision / Indecision" is a piano-oriented ballad which is not typical for the album, but works fine. "A Spoonful of Bromide Helps the Pulse Rate Go Down" (luckily not a parody of "A Spoonful of Sugar Helps the Medicine Go Down" from Mary Poppins) is an instrumental piece and by far the most traditionally prog-oriented piece. "Black Snake" is a truly nice mellow number, dominated by Crane's organ work, while the band rocks once again with "Head in the Sky". "The Rock" is the album's other instrumental piece, with some Chicaco or Blood, Sweat & Tears-like horns (arranged by yours truly, Vincent Crane), imagine if those two bands sounded more like Atomic Rooster, this is what you get. The CD reissue also includes their hit single, "Devil's Answer", still an excellent song, even if includes Chicago or BS&T-like horns. Oddly, the American LP on Elektra has this on In Hearing Of, but not the British vinyl, so basically if you own the CD reissue with "Devil's Answer", you got the complete American LP. I guess Elektra wisely knew the American audience was not as likely to buy singles so that's why they tagged "Devil's Answer" to the end of side one of the LP (right after "A Spoonful of Bromide").  What's also interesting is the cover is by Roger Dean, perhaps one of his most down-to-earth covers, it bears so little resemblance to the Yes album covers he's best known for, but then Roger Dean had done covers that looked little like Yes album covers like Babe Ruth's First Base (1972) and Gracious' This Is... (1971).  This is an excellent album and a must have 
 My husband loved this book, he told me that the guy lingo made everything a little easier to understand and made it sound better than what us women make it sound. He commented on the relief of gas in a newborn and how to try to comfort the raging pregnant woman. 
 This is the definitive work on the basics of youth counselling. McDOwell offers solid advice on how to counsel teens through nearly any problem. Frank discussion of suicide, abuse, eating disorders, family life and sexuality help the untrained counselor aid teens. The writing is easy to follow and McDowell makes a point to never get "preachy" or take the Counselor toofar down a path. He offers referal information and soundly tells the counselor at what point to find help in the counselling session. Whether you are a Senior Pastor, Youth Pastor or a volunteer youth leader this book will help you better understand the minds and struggles of young people today while helping you know the best way to help them through 
 This is a wonderful book with plenty of information to help the person leaving a high-control group or cult. The stages of recovery are discussed so the exiting member knows what kind of "head trips" to expect  during the mental detox of cult involvement. I highly recommend it 
 So, you've decided to put in a couple of layers and grow your own eggs.  You need to buy this book.  From coop to care from breed to feed, author Jay Rossier gives you all the detailed information you need to know to become a successful Old MacDonald.  His breezy insights into raising chickens for fun and profit is a delight to read.  But, you say you live in a railroad apartment on the lower East Side of Manhattan.  Then get this book for the terrific photographs by Geoff Hansen.  You'll never look at a chicken the same way again.  In fact, this book might inspire you to leave the big city for a small piece of land in New Jersey.  Now, that's a book 
 Finally, a book that's not only aimed at Wiccans but witches as well! (If you don't know the difference, you might be part of the problem.) It's so nice to read a book that actually equates witchcraft to a *craft* and not a religion.  Anyway, now that that's out of the way, I'll talk about the actual content of the book. This book is exactly what it says it is: a defense manual. While it doesn't go into full-blown cursing, it does present some very interesting techniques of counter-magic. I'll do a chapter by chapter summary now. There are nine chapters in this book, but I'll ignore chapter nine since it's just an epilogue and does not really present any info. Chapter one is titled "Recognizing Attack" and talks about possible sources and symptoms of psychic/magical attack. Chapter two, "Daily Practices," discusses some practices that the author considers to be important, like: meditation, banishing rituals, and offerings (to spirits, etc.). There are techniques offered for each of these if the reader is interested. Chapter three "Personal Protection" and chapter four "Protection for the Home" go hand in hand. The first discusses things such as personal shields and cleansing baths while the latter focuses on protecting the home via wards, amulets, and spirit traps. Chapter five, "Exorcism," talks about "possession" and "obsession" and how to deal with each. It also discusses the dangers of inexperienced (and even experienced) practitioners performing such rituals. Chapter six, "Spirit Guardians and Servitors" talks about working with various spirits and even creating your own (my favorite magical topic!). Chapter seven, "Reversals and Counter-Magick," is the chapter with the most "meat." It shows you what to do when everything else fails. And lastly, chapter eight ("Healing and Recovery") shows you what to do *after* the attack has been successfully averted and how to repair any damage that might have been done.  Another interesting thing about this book is that the focus of its rituals is the goddess Hekate. I've been interested in this goddess for a couple of years now and it was nice to finally see a book with practices focused around her. "Appendix B: Hekate" is excellent and it dispels the myth that Hekate is always viewed as a "crone" goddess. Besides its focus on Hekate, I also like how the book used different traditions/practices throughout, including the always fascinating practice of hoodoo (baths, washes, powders, etc.).  Overall, I think that this might be the most interesting meta/magic book I've read so far (and believe me, I've read *A LOT*!). It's obvious throughout the book that the author actually practices what he preaches, unlike many books on the market today that just repeat the same old info over and over again.  I'm looking forward to this author's next work.  Even if you're not very interested in the topic of protection magic (I wasn't) you will still find this book of great interest and value.  A breath of fresh air, indeed!  Recommended.  -Ate 
 I really love this series and I'm glad it's finally on DVD.  Picture- and sound-quality is good. This set includes 27 episodes, thats really something for the small money it costs.  I recommend this DVD-set, as well as the Ducktales boxes, for children of now and then :-)   
 I like that each book in the series is different -- Each book in this series has had it's own themes, and this one's is *intrigue* !  While the first book was all about discovery, and the second expanded it to others, this one everyone is plotting!  Mariam plots to change the world, Old grandmothers manipulate grandchildren, old spies exploit everyone, young men rebel, lower class foment against the rulers, one nation plans war, and the US Government may invade while they intrigue one agency against another....................................    It impressed me that I didn't see these coming though they were made obvious sense afterwards and that they are making for good story  elements, not just gratuitous plots to have plots.   I thought I could see one that Iris is keeping, but it hasn't appeared -- so either I'm wrong or it's yet to come..............................................   These books also share things that I like -- Each book has strong, deep characterization and good dialogue including internal dialogues.  They also seem to go for an intresting start and bang or cliffhanger finish.   And they all have a rich, intricate plot with unexpected paths.  Only a couple of odd bits that didn't seem to fit (in transcripts and a scene with Henryk), and an improbable letter. ...........................................  I'm going to hate waiting for book 4  
 Apparently the previous rater is not a very organized person. I find this catty perfect for travel to scrapbook parties and more. If you are a cuttered kind of person this in not for you.  Smart crafter 
 I frequently buy this gift for new moms!  I read it and it made me completely rethink my parenting ideas.  More than anything, this book will cause you to question all of the "wisdom" we have here in the West around what babies need and what is right for them.  The author takes a look at how babies were probably raised back when we were all cavemen, essentially - how long did moms breastfeed?  Where did babies sleep? etc. - and which of these things might make a difference to babies today?  The U.S. has one of the highest infant mortality rates of any industrialized nation [...]. If we understood babies and what they need better, maybe we could change that for the better 
 This is one of my favorite in the series so far. The characters are well developed proportional to their respective roles. Also, this book develops the overall series plot well. As usual, Snicket brilliantly contrasts the loathsome adults with the children to create his upside-down world; in this book, the adults are especially unlikable. There is also the beautiful twist at the end for which Snicket is known 
 Part 2 of the holy Renko trilogy finds Arkady stuck in the belly of a Soviet trawler off the coast of Alaska. He again stumbles upon more than he bargained for as he investigates the murder of a Georgian girl. As a sometimes-writer myself, I always rue the time that I spend re-reading my Smith novels rather than something new, but they're so good. The attention to detail and complex characters that Smith fills his book with are just so realistic and accurate, he absolutely nails it. Renko's inner thoughts are golden-whether he's getting thrown across a room by the trawlmaster Karp Korobetz or intellectually sparring with Party slug Volovoi, Arkady never fails to amuse or enchant with his musings. You can taste the salt spray get enveloped by the intrigue. I should stop memorizing these books and go do something productive-but it's just too much fun 
 I love Renee Fleming's singing and her voice, but lately she is becoming a "vocalizer" and not a singer. Her words are lost in the sound, her vowels are distorted, and even though the sound is lovely as always, this ruins what the singing is all about. Firstly, I care less if she sings quietly or loudly, for this idea of Baroque singing being gentle and light is silly, not to mention not supported by any of the writings of the day (were not the castrati noted for voices so full and vibrant nothing could compete with them?). Even the great Catalani was said to have sang so loudly that Spontini when asked if he would attend her concert stated he could well hear her from where he lived (about 40 miles away from where the concert was given), and the writers of the day stated that one was want to put cotton in their ears because her voice was so powerful. Marchesi was noted for his "bomba" where he could sing a scale (even a scale trillant) and end on a super loud full incredible note at the top of the scale and the top of his lungs. No singer, saving the creator of Orfeo for Gluck was noted for singing in some delicate manner with subdued volume (and in this case it was because he was seen as a fourth rate singer at best). Why we persist on thinking Baroque music must be sung in this sweet half voiced sound is beyond me. It is just not supported by the facts of the day. Perhaps their voices were smaller than what we are accustomed to hearing, but they were full and penetrating for their day, not caressing and gentle whispers.   This said, I think Renee would have done better to just sing out in the way she sings for normal singing. Let her voice go, let the fullness and vibrancy of her sound carry. The idea of a small vibrato, or nearly vibratoless sound is also WRONG, and not supported by any of the writings of the day. That is the creation of instrumentalists in the Baroque field who have taken the development of instrumental music and tacked it on vocal music, which was light years ahead of instrumental music in that day (the vibration of the voice is what inspired the use of vibrato in instruments, for it gave a cleaner and more "in tune" sound).   I think all around we would have had performances that were more exciting and more thrilling to experience. Prettiness is fine, but after a while it communcates nothing much.   I rated the recording only a four star, and not because of the orchestra. They are super and the concept of the music, the presentation as conceived by the conductor is wonderfully vibrant. Renee Fleming's voice just doesn't match it (as I said, she shouldn't have held back).   The other problem is her increasing habit of distorting the vowels while singing. She makes words meaningless and stupid by doing so. In "Endless Pleasure" the word "LOVE" is actually sang "LAV", and the vowel changes constantly, not as is often the case because of a vocal cover needed for the passagio, but because of BAD SINGING. As with most of her singing in English, it is sloppy and her diction is very poor. One understood Sutherland better than they understand her. Singing is not vocalizing, it is communicating, and quoting Toscanini when he first heard Callas at the beginning of her career, "What is she singing about, if the words aren't clear nothing has been sung worth hearing." Whether Callas actually ever heard this comment or not, I have no clue, but poor diction is NOT a fault one levels against Callas. She learned at some time that the words are every bit as important as the music, and she respected them completely. That is my complaint with Fleming, including a concert I was at of her singing Strauss's Four Last songs; one understood NOTHING, not one word of what she sang. She is getting worse and worse with her bad diction, and it is being replaced with delicate sweet singing, lovely tone, and dazzling technique, but like Toscanini said, "nothing worth hearing has been sung."   With the great talent Renee Fleming has, and she has been blessed abundantly with talent (more than most ever dream of), it is high time she cleaned up these bad habits that are creeping into her singing. Let us hear your words! Let us understand them! Let us feel something in our hearts because of them! Let us weep inside because we understand the message and the beauty of the voice reflects that message to us and shares it with our hearts. STOP just singing like you are vocalizing.   Other than this complaint, the set is beautifully sung, lifeless in many ways, but beautifully sung. Te Kanawa sings "Let the Bright Seraphin" a billion times better (even Sutherland outshone Fleming by light years, and her diction was sketchy at best); Beverly Sills did the Juilius Caesar arias (especially Da Tempesta) with excitement and with energy, a thing Fleming could learn from. Many of these arias are far better sung by other singers than they are here. Those performances seemed to radiate commitment to the music and the meaning of the words, this recording, sadly, does neither. It is pretty to the extreme, very wonderfully lovely, gentle on the ear, great as elevator music or something you listen to while doing the housework. Nothing about this performance commands your attention and makes you stand up and take notice. Despite the beauty and the finess of the singing, we are left waiting for some reason to listen to it, nothing grabs us and makes us pay attention to what we are hearing.

 This book published in 1950 was Erikson's breakthrough book, the first one by which he became known to a wide popular audience. Certain of the ideas formulated in this book have become part of the language of our general culture, most notably the concept of 'identity- crisis'.  At the heart of the theoretical framework of this work is Erikson's conception of eight- stages of life.  The first of these stages he calls the 'oral- sensory'.It involves the conflict between basic trust and mistrust. The second is called the muscular- anal involving the confluct between Autonomy and Shame and Doubt. The third is the Locomotor Genital involving the conflict between Initiative and Guilt. The fourth is the Latent involving the conflict between Industry and Inferiority. The fifth is Adolescence where the Identity- Crisis comes into play at a time of Role- confusion. The sixth is Young Adulthood in which Intimacy is in conflict with Isolation. The seventh is Adulthood where Generativity conflicts with Stagnation. The final is 'Maturity' or "Old Age'  where Despair threatens Ego Integrity. In this work Erikson brings case - history, comparitive anthropological data in showing how the human personality is transformed during the person's lifetime also through its encounters with Society . A pioneering work of great importance 
 This book, together with only a few others, provides a powerful introduction to the growing field of ecocriticism. The chapters are varied in target study content but share a common rigor in analysis and a common clarity of prose. I have refered my students to this work and indeed found it to be very useful as a background reader when I penned my own recent book of ecocriticsm concerning contemporary nature writing about water - Deep Immersion: The Experience of Water (nominated for top environmetal book of the year). Given its probable widespread usefulness to environmental scholars, The Greening of Literary Schloarship should be part of every 'green' academic's library. 
 "Nanook of the North" has a place in cinematic history as the first feature-length documentary, shot by Robert J. Flaherty near Inukjuaq on Hudson Bay in the arctic part of Quebec, Canada. A former explorer and prospector in that region, Flaherty decided to document the lifestyle of the Inuit, with funds provided by the French fur company Revillion Freres. The result was an early opportunity for people to see a movie that showed that a distant place and a foreign culture, rather than something staged on a set in a studio. Focusing on the title character and his family, "Nanook of the North" showed the traditional Inuit ways of hunting and fishing, building igloos, and other cultural aspects. Consequently, Flaherty's film is considered a prime example of what is called salvage ethnography, which had to do with capturing a record of a culture before it disappeared.   There are questions about the degree to which Flaherty manipulated situations and edited his film. We know that Flaherty picked an Inuit named Allakariallak to be his star because he was the most famous hunter in that area, but we also know that Nyla and Cuanyou, the two Inuit women cast as his wives, were not his wives, any more than Allee and Allegoo were his sons, carried around by their "mothers" in the hoods of their parkas. Anthropologists agree that the way we see Nanook and the other Inuit hunting seals and whales are traditional practices, but there is reason to believe Flaherty would not let his subjects use guns and made them hunt in the manner of their ancestors. Consequently, what we have here could be the recreation of traditional Inuit ways of hunting, which still has to be of some value. Besides, the life of hunting on the ice that Flaherty shows is indeed as dangerous as it looks, where a seal could prove to be as deadly as a walrus, and Allakariallak would die two years later when he was lost in a storm.   We understand that by contemporary standards Flaherty's practices would be considered unethical for someone making a documentary film, but since he was a pioneer in this field he gets the benefit of working at a time when rules did not exist to be broken. Hearing stories of how special igloos had to be constructed so that Flaherty could have his large camera inside to shoot family scenes speaks more to his attempt to show people what it was like than an attempt to just make things up, so overall I am comfortable with the sense of mimesis established here. Only at the end, when we are supposed to believe Nanook's family are desperately searching for shelter, does the documentary really descend into dramatic license that is clearly over the line.   All things considered, "Nanook of the North" might not be true, but for the most part it comes across as being real, which is ultimately more important. I can see elements that might be considered racist, but I have to wonder if that is because the film has the audacity to suggest that the stereotypical view of the Inuit as happy people is more true than false. Then again, lots of people smile a lot more when they know a camera is on them. The 1922 documentary runs 79 minutes and remains in fairly good condition, with a passable chamber music score. There is also a brief interview with Flaherty's widow from the 1950s and a selection of still photographs from both the "Nanook of the North" shoot and some of Flaherty's other trips through the Arctic north. The historic value of "Nanook of the North" might outweigh the artistic, but not by much. 
 This book gets to the point when it comes to the reality of being a teenage girl.  I recommend this book for teachers, mothers and mentors of teenage girls for insight into how to help our girls navigate the choppy waters of adolesence 
 We work, we have families, we aren't in the life (ok, maybe we are, but that's another review...) and so we come to trust others to search through volumes of material and select the best. That's what the Naked-Music label does for me. I love (and own) everything they put out. Deep house, chilled, danceable, partyable, at the beachable. This first compilation CD in the Carte Blanche series set the tone for the others that followed. These are all good. Smart, sexy, lucious. Check it out: do a search for "Carte Blanche" and there it is: 5-star reviews all the way. Follow this label 
 This production of Alice in Wonderland is pretty fabulous.  I loved it as a child.  It has a lovely mix of classic stars (Sammy Davis Junior, Imogene Coca) and flavors-of-the-month from the mid-80s (Pat Morita, John Stamos).  It would make a great DVD set 
 My three grown daughters remember all these songs from having the cassettes when they were little.  Sometimes when we're all together, someone will break into spontaneous song from one of the tapes and we all join in.  It brings back great memories from  our many car trips.  I still have the cassettes, but no cassette player, so it was time to upgrade for my 18 month old grandson.  His mom has been singing these songs to him from Day 1. All these Wee Sing CDs will become a family treasure!  You won't go wrong on any of them 
 Finally a good remake that is a little different. What makes a movie is the scenery, least my opinion. Scenery was beautiful. But the deep was a classic but the updated version is good for the new age crowd which makes sens 
 I reread this recently and I laughed as much as I did the first time I read it.  David Sedaris is quite a national treasure even though most people don't know who he is!  His writing is wonderful, poignant, sentimental and hilarious.  The man knows how to write well and you can tell he continues to love his craft.  I don't think I have read a book that made me laugh as much as this one did.  I think I had to put this book down at least a hundred times and walk away from it because I was laughing too hard.  You know, the kind of laughing that causes mild asphyxiation.    This book is delirious with humor and great story telling.  A must read for anyone who wants to have a wonderful reading experience.  I don't see how you could miss with Me Talk Pretty One Day 
 I was assigned Heart of Darkness as part of my summer reading regiment for my english class.  I usually don't enjoy assigned books because I often try and pay attention to all the details rather than just read it for fun.  However, this book, albeit a bit confusing, is definately good.  It really gets your brain going as you question your own opinions on imperialism.  Plus, it contains explanatory notes in the back, which definately help to understand the context.  However, its MAJOR fallacy with THIS exact publication is its shoddy manufacturing.  I've had the book only for one month and the pages that Heart of Darkness are on are already falling apart from the binding of the book.  And I treated it well - all I have done is placed it in my backpack when traveling to a few places.  Overall, the literary piece is good and so are the explanatory notes, but if you can't stand your book falling apart (trust me, it's really annoying), then search elsewhere for a different copy of this book 
 I have been doing freelancing work on the side for years, but have recently decided to go at it full time.  This book laid everything out as far as what it takes to make it in a situation where what you do directly affects how much food gets put on the table.  It also details exactly how to go about everything from naming your company/freelancing, to how to getting paid for your work.  It's a great book 
 Looks like the 3rd edition will be released very soon.  Probably worth waiting for, since the 2nd edition was released 17 years ago, and the state of the art in electronics is a moving target 
 I read this for a Victorian literature class, and sandwiched as it was between the imposing density of Middlemarch and Dickens, it was a real holiday. "Lady Audley" was written for pure  narrative pleasure, and it delivers big-time. I had no idea Victorian literature could be this tantalizing. It's really kind of trashy, falling into the sensational genre, but don't let that deter you - it'll keep you up at night AND provide the romantic bygone otherness of say, a Jane Austen novel. It's also an interesting window into Victorian femininity, undermining as it does the ideal of the passive angel in the house, and replacing her with a kind of femme fatale anti-heroine. (Everyone in my class enjoyed it, even the whingers who typically bemoan everything on the reading list.) A really good read 
 This is one of the 'Fireside Series Collection', which is a library of teachings compiled from various selections of Ramtha's teachings to students in his school.   This may seem like a small volume, but it is so filled with information, guaranteed to have you contemplating and interacting, for a long long time. One of the subjects that Ramtha addresses in this 'little' book, that left me with much to contemplate, is manifestation.... how to manipulate reality and evolve it. Whether it be manifesting a material something that we want in our reality; changing an attitude; or healing our body of illness; what is it that prevents our manifestation from unfolding, or why does it take longer that we expect for it to unfold into our reality? I found the teachings on this topic very helpful and illuminating.   " In order to have anything, you must melt away the former, and we do that by thinking only of what we wish to be and no longer what we were. And that must be a continuous constant".  "People, places, things, times and events, they are all key to the program of the past. When we create new without any of the above, we are liberating the energy from the past and re-forming it into the new. As long as it is attached to people, places, things, times and events, it will never be liberated. It will always carry the virus of attitude".  Ramtha teaches in depth on this subject, using easy to relate to examples that help us understand our own human pitfalls and stumbling blocks that we have allowed to get in our way. In unique Ramtha style, he packs a huge amount of information into a very few pages. For me it opened a door, leaving me excited and inspired to contemplate and move forward with change. Although you are reading, you cannot help but participate as if you were there in his audience, (and perhaps you really are).    Included in this Fireside Series is an expansive illustrated glossary where you can learn about the seven levels of consciousness and energy in your body; the brain; the Observer effect and the nerve cell; cellular biology etc., so that if you are unfamiliar with Ramtha's teachings or this knowledge, you can still learn and benefit greatly from the information in this book by using the glossary as you go.  
 The New Living Translation makes understanding the Bible much easier for today's readers.  We all should be constantly reading the Bible and this makes it easy, my only problem is the print is smaller than I would prefer.    An easy way to read the Bible through without getting bogged down reading books that are "heavy" in geneology 
  An intriguing tribute to hawaiian waterman Eddie Aikau, "Eddie Would Go" explores the life journey of a true native legend.  From big-wave surfing, to saving countless lives as a lifeguard at Waimea Bay, Eddie epitomized the true essence of Hawaii and the spirit of "aloha."  This book embraces the strong family connection that is so inherent in hawaiian culture, while focusing on the characteristics that made Eddie a local hero, a surfing icon and a dedicated waterman.     Author Stuart Holmes Coleman explores Eddie's lifelong connection to the ocean, while also giving a glimpe of life as it was and is on the ever famous North Shore.  Always the adventurer, Eddie's passion for the water would bring him across infinite miles of ocean over the course of his lifetime, and in the end would serve appropriately as his eternal resting place.  This book transcends all genders, ages, races,  surfers and adventure seekers alike, a thrilling gem of a read for all.  An epic tale, it will stir your emotions and touch your soul.  Eddie was an inspiration to many and a friend to all, and his spirit lives on in this book just as it will forever in the ocean 
 Gidnick's books and videos are the best to start with.  I began by watching his Play Harmonica Overnight video.  It's very good.  This book covers everything in the video and goes way beyond.  That being said, the whole Caveman theme of the book is just plain dumb.  If you can get past it, the content is outstanding, especially the CD.  I'm glad I went through this book cover to cover, but I wouldn't have wanted anybody I knew to see me with it.  The Caveman bit is just that embarassing 
 I thought SQL was dull.  But this cookbook changed the way I thought about SQL.  There were a lot that I thought I can't do in SQL, but Anthony used lively, practical and interesting example to demonstrate the power of SQL, to prove that I'm wrong over and over again.  To me it is mind-blowing. And I definitely do look smarter in SQL now 
 I read and put into practice these 9 steps and they actually worked in spite of all my efforts to make them not work!  The book is an excellent tool and shows very practical and simple ways to get your financial life back in order...Read it, and then re-read it...memorize some passages and you will be on the road to financial freedom before you know it!  I highly recommend it 
 I absolutely loved this book.  I have been interested in macrobiotics for over a year and this was the first book I read that made me laugh and excited to try out this way of life.  Jessica is a lovely author and makes you feel like you are talking to a friend instead of reading about health via the boring route.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more or continuing on the microbiotic path. Cheers to all of our health 
 Often, less experienced investors overlook the big picture topics such as macroeconmics and behavioral finance and focus on the investment book of the month which is invariably trash.  This book was originally written many decades ago and the fact that it is still selling is a testiment to its quality.    When you look at al of the current investment books out in print, how many do you think will still be selling 40 years from now?  Of course, back then, the publishing world was selective.  Today, it focuses on publishing books about investing by big name preachers and sports legends or psychopaths with useless TV shows because they know people will buy them.   If you cannot appreciate this book then you have a very long way to go towards becoming a good investor.  And if you are a good investor, this book is just another step towards your progression into a great investor.  
 I got this for my kindergartener to read to me. He was laughing so hard he got the hiccups. Great early reader because there are a lot of repetitive phrases and the story is silly enough to captivate the little ones 
 As the long time president of the "American Civil Liberties Union," Nadine Strossen is one of my heroes. This book is a powerfully reasoned and completely honest assessment of pornography and why it should be protected as free speech. However, Strossen goes beyond the basic First Amendment arguments to discuss the reality of sexually expressive material and the benefits it can hold for our society, including women who are now breaking free from the chains of puritanism and double standards while expressing themselves sexually. She also provides many examples and comments from anti-censorship feminists such as Nina Hartley and Molly Ivins. Heck, even a writer I remember from my childhood - Judy Blume - provides quotes about the dangers of censorship.   Most of Strossen's arguments are directed towards the anti-pornography feminist fringe, with Andrea Dworkin and Catherine MacKinnon being the two most visible members. Strossen, who is also a feminist, clearly demonstrates the hyprocisy and absurdity of the MacDworkinites. Just to give you an idea of the nuttiness of the MacDworkinite perspective, Dworkin wrote in her book "Intercourse" that all heterosexual intercourse is actually rape. This is because she believes all women are so oppressed by men that they even lack the power to say "yes" to consensual sex. As a supporter of women's rights, I have always believed that the true spirit of feminism is about empowering women to achieve full freedom and equality, part of this being a woman's right to express herself sexually. But, apparently, the MacDworkinites consider women to be weak and childlike, unable to make even the most basic of choices for themselves.  Such ridiculous ideas could normally just be laughed at. But the MacDworkinites have made a hypocritical political alliance with the Religious Right which makes them a real threat in terms of enacting censorship legislation. For example ,they passed censorship laws in Indianapolis and Canada. Of course, their alliance with the Religious Right and other puritanical conservatives should be no suprise. Throughout the world it is the countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, that are the most sexually repressed where women are the most socially and economically oppressed. Those countries, like the MacDworkinites, consider women to be weak and fragile, needing isolation and even public veiling to protect them from men. This is in contrast to sexually liberated countries, like Sweden and Denmark, where women enjoy a relatively high level of freedom and equality. Of course, reality has no place among the idealogically obsessed MacDworkinites.  Hooray for Nadine Strossen and the "ACLU"! Hooray for Freedom and Equality! Read this outstanding book! 
 After Further In, I didn't think it could get any better, but I was wrong.. This is his best yet. Brilliantly witty, starkly sexual, and savagely spiritual, Greg Brown has rocked my world once again 
 Such a wonderful book to read! After seeing his works of art at the museums in New York (MET - MOMA); in Maryland (BMA); and in California (San Francisco), it is a joy to the human spirit to read this biography. This book offers the reader all the underlying events contributing to each of his major works of art. It allows us to better appreciate his extreme and intense efforts to create; it allows us to recognize his unquestionable courage to be himself while many of the art world turned away from him; and one will learn of his life long love of the natural world (birds and plants) and his view of the importance of the spirit of man. Further, this book allows the reader to see his social frustration; one can learn of his powerful drive (so red hot) to create, and one will see in words how he commanded everyone around him to assist him in his zeal to achieve his personal best in art. As the book denotes towards the end even Picasso, the great competitor, stated in a discussion of one of Matisse's later works (the Chapel in Nice): 'Only Matisse could do this!' Read to learn, read to know, and read to be more deeply passionate in love with Matisse as I am 
 Ginuwine's debut album from 1996 was a fresh new start for good ol' R&B/Soul when the perfomers both wrote their own music and actually were interesting perfomers. Not since the late 80's we had seen guys that could actually dance and Ginuwine co-wrote most songs and made them very personal and sophisticated aswell. 21 year old Ginuwine was obviously influenced by both Prince and Michael Jackson (And he also covered them both). Timbaland on the other hand was a relativetly fresh producer that had a very unique sound with, awesome samples and frequently used sound loops of his own voice, the music was a mix of contemporary R&B and Hip Hop that also made the music appealing to a broader audience. As other reviewer already pointed out, this album was not only a bluprint for Ginuwine's upcoming album, but also for many other talented Perfomers/Dancers like Usher, Dru Hill and Justin Timberlake and also to talented songwriters like R. Kelly and later Ne-Yo.  "The Bachelor" Got this very fresh sound all over it, something that the R&B world really needed at the time when New Jack Swing was all over the charts but eventually gotten a little tiresome. Ginuwine was also capable of both singing and dancing and both making catchy uptempo's and seductive slow jams. Simple put, he was the Next thing and the record sold extremly well. First single "Pony" is a midtempo with awesome sound loops and very daring lyrics like "If youre horny, lets do it, Ride it, my pony, My saddles waitin, Come and jump on it", It sounded like nothing else on the charts and reminded alot of Prince's most controversial songs. "Tell Me Do You Want It" is an slow jam right on point, ditto with the seductive "Hello" and "Lonely Daze". Great lyrics and sound, one of his best. "Holler" is another uptempo made for the club. "Ginuwine 4 Your Mind" remind me alot of a slower Pony, the samples are quite alike. "Only When You're Lonely" yet another great slow jam. "I'll Do Anything/Sorry a midtempo co-penned by Missy Elliott. "World Is So Could" also feature a sample simular to Pony, this one is also slow. "When Dover Cry" a 90's version of Prince's classic 1984 hit, Pretty damn good and also a hit. "G Thang" is not so interesting, a midtempo that features Missy. "550 What?" closes the album, yet another good song.  Overall, Ginuwine's debut is almost flawless and not only stands as one of the greatest R&B albums of the 90's but also as the bluprint for many other artists to come. It got uptempo's and slow jams and he can both sing and dance and he writes his own music. Now this is just great!. If you are new to him, start here. His first album is the best. 
 We are about to launch a new business, Clear View Solar. I bought this book to educate myself on all aspects of solar, wind and hydro electric power creation. This is an excellent book for this purpose. By the way, Amazon has the best price. If you are thinking about going off the grid or installing a grid tied system on your home, buy this book...John Hayes, Idah 
 This CD is what is left when all of the preservatives, chemicals, and other unneeded stuff is boiled away.   Ella's voice and the piano weave in and out among each other, complementing one another while supporting at the same time.  Ella sounds clear and unhurried, as if this were the soundtrack for a lazy day in a hammock.   Vibrant, expressive, not taking herself too seriously but emoting 'till the cows come home.  She swings, but it's a subtle swing that fits with the relaxed tone.  An excellent complement to any jazz collection 
  The story serves as a good example of how greed can be harmful to students.  It also demonstrates how pictures may be used to help a reader understand text.  For example, The author never names the crystal, but by looking at the pictures they can determine that it's sugar.  The story is engaging for young readers because ants are small, non-threatening characters.  Also, by using the ants to teach a lesson kids may not even realize they're learning.  It is written in an attractive yet concise manner, and could be useful in teaching kids how to write text to describe pictures 
 This is a wonderfully, deeply textured book that kind of circles around  this inscrutable man.  The image he offers of himself here is that of a very private guy who never wanted fame but just to do his own thing in his own way.  I am sure that is part of the story, and he makes a pretty convincing case in his quirky and vivid writing style - indeed it is so beautfully and sparely written that I doubt he used a ghost writer.  The best parts of this are about his beginnings, before he was lionized as a poet and prophet.  This is the New York scene and even his earliest times in Minnesota, where he was an autodidact obsessed with folk music and blues and 50s rock and did not fit into the more traditional pathways that most chose.  Here he offers invaluable information on his sources of inspiration - how he thought and discovered things, often in personal encounters - and some glimpses of his relationships at that time. It is really wonderful stuff.  This alone is worth the price of admission, as you get a feeling for the scene he entered and how he carved out his early career - the beat generation, Woody Guthrie, and many others I will explore if I can.  Truly fascinating, warmly vivid, and full of historical insight.  The book then fast forwards - actually it is the middle, enclosed on both ends by his origins chapters - to what it was like when he was famous and trying to work and live his life.  These make for much more difficult reading for two reasons.  First, he goes into great detail on his work in music, far beyond what interested me or that I was capable of understanding, such as a long passage on a guitar method he developed based on an uneven five stroke.  Moreover, I never really liked his work once he was done with folk music, though I respected his need for change as an artist and do not wish to judge him here. This got me to think of him as a self-identified musician.  Second, it is full of complaints about his fame, which I strongly suspect he originally craved and yet didn't understand what it would be like if he attained it.  Thus, I wonder how much he is trying to shape his image yet again, as he is a great professional chameleon.  That being said, there are wonderful nuggets throughout about his struggle to create and grow, rather than merely re-play his glory days, which has been the death of many artists, such as Thelonius Monk.  Finally, from what I know of his biography, there is a lot he refuses to address or avoids, such as his divorces, his alleged drug use, and his innumerable and inexplicable bouts of religious conversion.  Maybe he will take these on in subsequent volumes, but it makes me suspect that this book is yet another mask for him, that we really don't know much about his center - maybe, just maybe, he is as hollow and nakedly amibitious, even as commercial, as some charge.  But I did find the person he presents himself to be as wholly charming and deep.  I am a great fan of Dylan and this gave me an entirely new perspective on his work, particularly on the way he observed and absorbed influences.  These, to me, were the parts of the book that rang the most true, and they are a great gift to his fans.  Warmly recommended 
   I'd never heard of Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine, though I am an avid reader of mystery and suspense novels. If this anthology is an indicator of what's to be found in the magazine, then the montly is definitely worth a look.    Most of these thirty-four stories are very well done. There were several that didn't quite hold my interest, but that wasn't because they were poorly written: they just didn't grab me.    There are several standouts in the anthology, including a wonderfully wry short by Ed McBain.    Many of the names in the anthology are familiar. Some stories represent early works, some later.    In any event, any mystery fan will enjoy this anthology. It will provide several evenings of fun mystery reading when you're not up to tackling the latest novel.  Jerr 
 We love this book as first time parents.  It is like having your Pediatrician in your living room!  Even better, I received this book free with a formula sample from my Pediatrician's office.  What a deal 
 Sadly it was not the war to end all.  a loss of 5000 men a day, 10 million total. We call ourselves civilized?  We have tried to annihilate ourselves several times but we can't beat that record. The novel is written in the form of "Winds of War" with many factual men and happenings in a fiction background.  This is the first novel i have read on WW1 and really enjoyed it.  The research must have been phenomenal.  I will surely read more of Mr. Shaara's novels.  They cannot be better than this one. that is my opinion 
 I grew up in a average middle class home 40 years ago and found most of this information to be common sense.  The book did offer some suggestions on how to deal with specific issues, that I found helpfull.  My daughter is grown.  But my boyfriend has 2 small kids.  I benifited most from points such as; teaching kids how to act when they invite a friend over (while the info was, to me, common sense, the book made me realize that I actually have to teach this stuff).  I also liked all the reminders of how adult behavior impacts kids (if you want kids to show respect to adults or people in positions of authority is it smart for you to be disrespectful to our political leaders that you feel are doing a bad job?I know I often bad mouth them).  This book helped me to think about what I want to teach (respect, honesty, caring) and how my daily actions can be seen by young minds.  
 The truth isn't painful at all but quite hilarious in this Leo McCarey film starring Cary Grant and Irene Dunne. Vina Delmar's screenplay adaptation of Arthur Richman's play is a sophisticated look at what happens when two people who love each other decide in the heat of the moment to file for divorce.  It all begins when Jerry (Cary Grant) returns from a bogus business trip to Florida to find his house empty. His wife Lucy (Irene Dunne) arrives late, her singing coach, Armand (Alexander D'arcy), in tow. One thing leads to another and before you know it they are in Chancery Court trying to hash out who gets custody of their dog, Mr. Smith. Once Lucy wins the battle for Mr. Smith, Jerry only allowed visitation rights, the real fun begins.  What follows is a smart and very funny film as Jerry and Lucy trade gentle barbs about their prospective suitors. Jerry gets first crack as Lucy, at her aunt's urging, hooks up with Daniel (Ralph Bellamy), a rich good old boy from Oklahoma. Later it is Lucy's turn when Jerry begins seeing a high society girl named Barbara Vance (Molly Lamont).  Between the sophisticated jabs are some truly hilarious moments. Grant poking Dunne from behind the door with a pencil while Bellamy asks for her hand in marriage is a riot! Another funny moment comes while Lucy is singing at a recital and Jerry shows up and sits down. Perhaps the biggest laugh, however, comes from a fight scene between Jerry and Armand shown totally off camera. It is the most hilarious scene in the film, McCarey letting us imagine what must be going on.  Grant is fabulous here and Irene Dunne, nominated five times for Best Actress, never to win the statue, just sparkles. This is one of the finest comedies ever made and certainly one every film buff needs to own. The truth is, "The Awful Truth" is awfully funny 
 I am not one to really enjoy reading and rarely do it for fun but Vince Flynn and his series of novels are amazing to read.  The books are non stop fun and action for the entire book.  I would recomend this book to anyone who likes spy or assassin stories 
 For anyone interested in Africa's trials and tribulations during the previous century this volume must be the number one must-read. It is both an eye-witness account of apocalyptic events in Somalia and Rwanda and a moving personal story of love, loss and adventure in the line of fire. Hartley manages to keep a morass of complex storylines together without a dull page and without losing the reader. Beautifully written with gut-wrenching honesty and very strongly recommended 
 I received this book as a gift and have spent hours comparing my take on each of the brackets.  The "Marital Agruments" bracket prompted an intense discussion with my husband as I was sure he must have been a contributor -- it was way too funny that the winner was about how to stack the dishwasher.  Seems like they had a hidden microphone in our kitchen!  Also, friends came over and spotted the book which led to so many fun and heated conversations. Great gift, great coffee table book -- loved it 
 Start with the reader having a very very British accent and add the magic that was (is) The Beatles and you have a audio book that often had me staying in my car just to finish a chapter. For the superfan, not a ton of new info on the boys (although the story about Yoko taking George's biscuits was golden) but hearing about the recording sessions from Geoff Emerick's perspective was well worth the price of admission.    
 Emyl Jenkins' Stealing With Style is a highly recommended mystery revolving around an antiques appraiser. When Sterling is called in to examine a diamond brooch found at the Salvation Army thrift store, she uncovers a pattern of relics which leads to a dangerous course of investigation involving one of the oldest families in the small town. Scammers and schemes permeate a rich, involving story especially recommended for collectors with an eye to mystery and treasure. 
 This is much more than a book offering encouragement, or advice or the sharing of the authors' own personal experiences, it is a book that offers practical "hands on, and how to" instructions for loving a woman properly. That includes respectfully loving ourselves as women, while we safely make love to each other. The chapter "Plain Talk About Safer Sex" was eye opening, and while the writing style is humorous, hopefully everyone reading this excellent book will take the need to practice "safer sex" to heart while taking the object of their desires to bed. While sex is important to all of us, other sections give invaluable information on a myriad of subjects, such as knowing what your civil rights as a lesbian or bisexual woman are, as well as a wonderful chapter of recommended movies along with their reviews and where to order them. This book is a must for those recently `out,' as well as those who have been `out and about' forever. It is funny, insightful and simply put, filled with all sorts of useful information that we can all benefit from-not to mention what a great gift it will be to that special woman we all know 
 I enjoyed very much listening to Judith's tapes. I felt I was having a conversation with her, and found I responded to many of the things she said. The power of voice is undenyable. Judith is an authentic person, and  I highly recommend her tapes to anyone interested in the more magical side  of gardening...... :

 This is an excellent book and I would recommend it to all women who are fed up with diets that don't work. I am a personal trainer and I have used the information in this book to help many of my clients, with successfull results. This isn't a quick fix plan - it teaches you good eating habits for life and also stresses the impotance of exercise, which is essential for maintaining fat loss 
 This really fine film deals with itself on its own terms and does not try to answer all of its own questions.  For example -- the death and position of the native boy in the tree reflects the way the father ended at the beginning and suggests the same sexual passion for the girl -- which explains her attitude toward her Dad and perhaps his immolation.  Some innocent nudity toward the end.  Well worth it 
 This is a well written book.  Its basic theme is that democratic societies may have to, from time to time,  suspend certain rights and freedom in order to deal with threats to their citizens or their very existance.   The key presented is that these suspensions be limited by their scope in time and ultimately subject to review by the judiciary, democratic process, the public and the press.      The subject of torture comes up but what I found most interesting was the discussion of how we might have to react to the threat of nuclear or biomedical terrorism.   As the cost of these technologies comes down it becomes more possible for society to be threatened by small groups or radical nations acting directly or anonymously through surrogates who would not be deterred by the threat of mutual self destruction.       Overall the message is that these are ethical issues that we must, even imperfectly, need to work out.  Ignatieff's book does a good job of laying out directions of discourse.   We may not get it right and we may have to even choose to do wrong for the greater good but the fact that we struggle with the question makes us a better society.    
 In a time when you never know if a commercial could provoke an uncomfortable situation in the prime-time TV watching living room (think Viagra), Full House is a refreshing change. I watched this growing up and now my daughter is watching and enjoying the series.  I can't express to you what a major part of her world it is.  She loves DJ for the "Big Sister" lessons, Stephanie for the "Hey, I'm almost as big as her!" and Michelle because "she's the baby".  She adores uncle Jesse, uncle Joey and Danny.  The show has talked about such IMPORTANT character builders like: honesty, integrity, being smart, dealing with bullies, how NOT to become a bully, what it's like to lose your first tooth, what it's like when adults argue, how do grandparents fit into familes, why do some families have one mommy or one daddy or MORE than one mommy and daddy, celebrating special occasions, school programs, choosing right over wrong and a host of other things yet to be discovered.  Thank you to each and every actor, producer, director, writer, editor, grip (!) and staff member involved in doing this show back in the 80's and the 90's - and I thank the people putting it out NOW 
 My mother of all people recommended this book to me and I must say that if my mother and I can both be pleased by a mystery novel then so can you. It does not take long to get hooked on Anna Pigeon and her life as a Law Enforcement Ranger. This is a mystery like I have never seen. Nevada Barr is excellent at bringing to life the vivid detail of the SW United States and uses it wonderfully to spin her mystery. A must read! 
 Boys can be picky readers, so I always take notes if they actually love a book. My 8 year old carried this book everywhere and told be about it every night for a week.  Besides Redwall or Harry Potter, this is the first book he has raved about 
 Very good book. Examined it at the library, checked it out twice and liked it so much I decided to buy it. Plenty of practical advice regarding roses and helping them grow in the unique climate of the South 
 Purchased this book for my husband. Author plays the Sheriff character in "Cars". (Husband's favorite character in the movie.) Book is packed with information and great pictures. Helpful for planning a trip along the route. 
 Ok this set is good if you are a slimer fan.  Im not but I do love the show so im took one for the team and bought it so they sony would FINALY put the show on dvd.  Its good quality and hey its somthing to feel my fix.... lol  
 I love this book! when i was reading it i found myself falling in love with lachlan macgregor. this is one of the most romantic and passionate stories i have ever read. i highly recommend reading the sequel about lachlan and kimberley's daughter melissa in "The pursuit". this one is probably my favorite in my Johanna lindsey collection. It is sooo cute how lachlan and kimberly appear to be like oil and water but deep inside they are two of a kind 
 I've had this album since it was released in 2003 and it REMAINS one of my favorites - front to back today.  I give copies to everyone who will take it.  For comparison sake, this band is reminiscent of (and are as strong as) The Doves.  It is extremely sad to me that they haven't been embraced in the States.  Not marketed properly, no tour support, etc.  I do feel that if more people knew of them, they would have been well received, but... alas...it is the nature of the nasty industry.  I haven't picked up their sophmore release, Angela Test, because it is an expensive import. From what I've heard, it's a pretty big departure.  I guess all the Coldplay & Radiohead comparisons pissed them off?  I really think these Icelanders are talented 
 I find Kathy Smith a refreshing fitness guru, she creates a fun atmosphere in her studio, treats her group personnally and above all is always informing and pointing out what you are working on and the possible pitfalls. She is encouraging and realistic in her approach as to how one keeps on the fitness trail 
 This is a book for those who feel like they preach well but still feel something is missing.  It is for those who can't seem to find the joy in the gospel message.  It is for those who have a bubbling passion for preaching, but feel held back by the way a preacher is "supposed to" preach.  Ward encourages preachers to reclaim the meaning of "performance" from it's current connotation of "fakeness" or "acting" to it's original French (par fournir), meaning "to carry the form [message] through".  Ward shares, "Human beings have an irresistible need to enter other worlds, other selves, other experiences..." (126).  Ward encourages preachers to turn the oral word into aural art to allow audiences to experience the biblical world through the spoken word. 
 This isn't a Sony-brand battery, but it works fine.  The remaining time shows on the camcorder display, just like it does with the Sony brand.  I'm pleased, and the price was great 
 A true love-it-or-hate-it movie: my reaction fits closer with the first group.  This gritty look at the dark side of the drug culture plays like an open wound. The parallel stories chronicle a widow who descends into an addiction to diet pills, while her son tries to make a living dealing, although he, his partner, and his girlfriend smoke and snort a lot of the profits.  The director's jarring style fits the subject matter well, and Ellen Burstyn's performance as the diet pill addict is nothing short of amazing.  Julia Roberts beat her for Best Actress in 2000 with Erin Brockovich, which was a fine role and performance, but Burstyn was in another world.  Those who hate the film will complain about the style and whether the events at the end make any sense.  I can understand the second objection, hence four stars rather than five.  Note: I got this movie from Netflix--I'm not sure if I was watching the director's cut or not 
 British writer Alan Booth decided to walk (he refused any rides!) all the way from the north of Japan to Sata in the south of Japan. He did this in the mid 1980s when Japan was already becoming a powerful economy. Along the way he encounters many odd and interesting people. Being married to a Japanese woman and speaking Japanese he was able to communicate with the natives. I really enjoyed this book because I have lived in Japan for almost ten years and I can relate to most of Alan's experiences. Japan is a country where a foreigner can feel very alone despite being around thousands of people, which is not always a bad thing. So it's nice to share the experiences of other foreigners. One problem that some people may have with this book is that Alan's writing sometimes seems a bit negative or sarcastic at times, but after living in Japan for several years I can understand why. 
 They can't catch him; he's Nathan Bailey: car thief, juvenile delinquent, twelve-year-old boy. Accused of murdering a supervisor, now young Nathan is a desperate fugitive on the run.  As an orphan, he is alone in the world and must depend alone on his wits, honesty, and desire to never return to the misery of the Detention Center.  By breaking into houses and stealing cars, Nathan constantly puts the reader in suspense, as the police frantically search for him.  He desperately calls up a nation-wide radio station to get the truth out, and is eventually nicknamed "The World's Favorite Criminal," due to his manners and habit to do laundry in the homes he breaks into. In this thriller, Nathan must continue his run, and that half the nation, along with the reader can't help but root for him all the way.  The mystery of the murder combined with the nonstop pace provides a complex, yet exciting plot, and a challenge to put down the book.  The real-life dialogue makes this a fun read, and characters that are easy to relate to.  As loveable Nathan runs from the police, angry citizens, and a hit man, the reader tries to piece together the puzzle of the crime. Although not a conventional fugitive story, any lover of suspense and thrillers would enjoy this book.  However, because of the adult language and gory, violent details, it is recommended for more mature readers.  Confusing at times with the constant change in point of view, Nathan's Run is a roller coaster, as it is impossible to predict what will happen next. Nathan wins our hearts from the beginning, and we cheer him on, as he runs and runs from society, while we run with him 
 As an educational diagnostician who works a lot with students with ADD, this book is by far the most comprehensive and helpful. Whether you are a parent or a teacher, do yourself a favor and buy it. Thank you Ms. Dendy! 
 I cannot say enough good about this book! Though there is a great deal of accurate info on nursing, the field narrows considerably regarding nursing while pregnant or tandem nursing, and this well-written book fills that void!   I first read the book while my nursling daughter was 12 months old, right after we discovered I was pregnant again. I did not want to take this source of nutrition and comfort away from my daughter but didn't want to jeopardize the health of my new baby, and this book gave me the information I needed to make a well-informed decision to continue nursing her. Today, we're happily tandem nursing with her 10 month old brother!  I especially appreciated the chapters on nutrition (for Mom, new baby, and older baby), the scientific research provided, and most of all the stories by real Moms who had nursed while pregnant and tandem or triandem-nursed!  I'd recommend this to anyone interested in the subject of nursing 
 Good season I liked it some of the jokes where no where nears as funny as the first two seasons but all in all a good last season.  Attack of the fever heads is a great episode and who can forget marco's encounter with scuba ninja's this does save the season considerably 
 okay this is my first review ever so hang in there with me alright?  Now I purchesed this book "How to Draw Manga: Ultimate Lessons vol. 1" mainly because I like the other HtDM books and I wanted to see what this had to offer me.  When the book came I was expecting it to be as big as the other HtDM books.  Boy was I wrong!  it was as thick as the others but the hight and with were 'shorter' none the less the content of the book itself prooved to be of some help.  The book itself starts off with the begining mini comic or 'manga' if you will then the table of contents, and then the actual material.  The first chapter is all about the basics, starting with "practice by starting with copying" then it moves onto how to go and create your own charatures by showing you the basics of drawing (start with a rough general outline of blah blah blah then refine it and add detale blah blah blah).  First they start with the head and face the move down to the torso, arms, and legs.  In the book they also show examples of expressing emotions, depicting 'cool action poses', a little bit of sceanery, and how to properly hold your drawing tools.  IN the book itself it says these are the goals it's trying to teach you: 1) The Basics of Faces 2) Basics of Figures 3) The ABC's of Tools ans Materials 4) Basic Background and Special Effect Techniques and 5) Producing and Original Draft of Manga  In all it's a pretty helpful book; however it'll do you jack if you don't put it to use.. in other words keep on drawing.  The book is only there to help you get ideas on how you may want it to look.  It's not going to do it for you, or magically you'll be able to draw "manga" the instant after you read it.  Now I gave it 4 stars because for some reason I felt that it was lacking a little something in it.. other then that it's a great refference book for anyone, not just people who want to draw manga/anime, who wants to improve their drawing technique 
 This short book tells the tale of six or seven very courageous people with short commentary by McCain in between.  The people in this book defied the odds and accomplished the impossible.  Each of their stories are unique, and McCain explains how each of them show courage in different ways under different circumstances.  One consistency between all of the stories in this book is that each of the heros had strong beliefs that drove them to act in amazing ways in the face of extraordinary challenges.  Courage is a hard thing to define, but I think McCain has done more than a fair job of it here, using these people's stories as examples.    The one thing I wish this book told more about was McCain's own courage as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.  He really down plays his own heroism a great deal in this book.. 
 Did you know that "Edward Marshall" is also James Marshall?  It's too bad this author/illustrator died so young, because his books are so good.  When I was a little kid, my mom read me all of the books about Fox and I loved them!  This book contains three stories concerning Fox and his girlfriends 
 I did not need to read any farther than the first chapter and realized this was a great book!  As a judge, I am always looking for updated information on horses. This book has great pictures that explain many problems of hunters today.  It is a must have for all judges and trainers and for all disciplines of riders!  Thank you Anna-Jane 
 It's soft and medium-sized.  Didn't pay too much for them so didn't feel too bad when friends would come over and ask if they could take one. Now I don't have any left, but they're an interseting little soft "stuffed animal" kind of thing.  No real practical purpose probably - and I heard it's a horror if it ever opens/spills its contents.  And it's kind of funny - the thing itself is soft - but it comes in a huge box with TONS of air pillows (when you order it from amazon at least).  So if you're moving and need packing material, then here's a 2-for-1 special. 
 If you are interested in why you do what you do to create a dish,this is the book for you.  All of the recipes have been tested many times and in different ways before they are entered into the book 
 "Our Town" is a poignant and powerful legal thriller. This is perhaps a surprising way to characterize a work by UCal, Berkeley policy wonks, published by one of the lesser known university presses, but this book deserves the widest possible readership. It tells the epic, heroic, heart-rending, and true story of the attempt to bring fair housing policy to New Jersey, the most suburban state in the country, and by extension, the most representative of American housing trends. It tells the story of an attempt by the African-American community of Mt. Laurel, New Jersey  - a community whose origins date back to the colonial period - to create affordable housing in what was then, in 1968, a largely rural, white township of southern New Jersey. In response to thier request for the necesary zoning approval, the then mayor of Mt. Laurel (and wealthy farmer and late state senator) William Haines told the black community of Mt. LAurel: "if you people cannot afford to live in our town, then you will have to move." (this is a quotation from memory). The legals battles that followed over the next 25 years were epochal for New Jersey and for the country. This story is an epic (not unlike Jonathan Harr's book about the toxic wazste dumps in Massachusetts, A Civil Action) with genuine heroes such as Ethel Lawrence , the black New Jersey woman who led the fight, and even NJ supreme court justices who saw through the racism of Mt Laurel officials  and the subtler but equally insidious intransigence of NJ governor Thomas Kean, who, for my money, is the worst villain of the lot. (I am, by the way, a New Jerseyan myself).Everyone who care about racial justice in America should find this book worthwhile. For an essentialy academic study, it is astonishingly moving. I read it in hardcover, when it first came out, mainly because I was attracted by its stylish cover, but it is the kind of book I actively recommend to my friends and family 
 During the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis I was living in Boston. One day I was flying somewhere and while taxing out to the runway I noticed several B-47 jet bombers, their wings bent down with fuel, and armed guards with dogs walking around them. I realized that this was pretty serious.   From time to time since then more information has come out about what was really happening. And in very recent times de-classification of materials from the time and open discussion with some the people involved make it clear that this was a much more serious incidend that we thought at the time.    For instance there were some 40,000 Russian soldiers on the island that we didn't know about. These soldiers were armed with short range nuclear missiles. They had the authority to use them if the U.S. invaded. A few nukes set off in the midst of an invasion fleet would have made a real mess.   Some of the intelligence reports of the time were real good. Some of them were otherwise. Admidst the bluster and the threatening, cooler heads prevailed and nuclear was was avoided. Never again would the two superpowers come so close. Maybe the truth of this flight was enough to make the leaders of both powers back down.  This is the most complete, the most detailed  report of what happened. It is a scary book 
 How could the Editorial review from Booklist get it oh so wrong? Pramoedya Ananta Toer is not a Malaysian and his books are not banned in Malaysia. I am from Malaysia and I read his book "Keluarga Gerilya" (Guerrila Family)for Malay Lieterature during my school days sometime in 1985. Pramoedya is an Indonesian and his books are banned in his native Indonesia. Please get these kind of informations correct, as otherwise it would be seriously embarassing. 
 This movie I liked because a great deal of it was shot at the old Hughes tool plant in Houston Texas.I know because I worked there for 16 years.The makers of the movie used the following bldgs-Administration bldg & basement,the lab bldg,and the powerhouse. That is where Mel Gibson got his toes beat one at a time with a machinist hammer.I used to operate all the machines at that location.If you get a chance buy the movie.It is good. 
 This is an excellent film. Billy Bob is a clean-vut barber who keeps to himself. His wife married him because she liked that he didn't talk very much. It is a tragedy of epic proportions, with great performances from all involved.  The only thing for me that holds this back from being a FIVE STAR film is the fact that in EVERY SINGLE SCENE someone lights up a cigarette or is taking deep drags on one. That alone justifies this film's "R" rating. When watching this film, it seems that they are encouraging people to be "cool" and that smoking is a pleasurable thing. The most notorious moment for me is when Frances McDormand is sitting in the bathtub and asks her barber husband (Billy Bob) to shave her legs. He walks in somberly with a cigarette drooping from his lips and she tells him to give her a drag. This is a putrid moment that just drove me crazy! But then, that is just my opinion.   Overall, the film could have been as good and greater if it did not have the incessant smoking throughout. The plot is slow yet intensely emotional. If you don't mind smoking, then you will probably enjoy this dramatic tragedy. If you are as strongly opposed to smoking or have children who are interested in seeing this, you should review the film before letting them see it 
 Yo pienso que este libro es interesante, pero no lo suficientemente interesante como para leerlo para la entretencin de un lector. En lo personal yono le tomo mucha importancia a la poltica cometitiva porque todo lo que se habla es argumentos sin sentido y para obtenerpopularidad y no se ve la energa o el animo de querer ser el presidente de los Estados Unidos si no que solo obtener popularidad 
 Recreating the culture and times here is a big part of McCullough's success in writing this great book.  Earlier histories emphasized the Roeblings' interactions and obsessions, with great drama and effect.  While McCollough plays that card here, too, the book places the reader into the times much more effectively.  Yes, it's still about the father and son, but the people who contributed and benefitted play as great a role here.  Very satisfying read - enjoy it 
 How to Start a Training Program/ Carolyn Nilson  What a great book.  Definitely, a book I would recommend for any training program. A systematic guide on how to start a training program from training policy and standards to needs analysis and delivery and presentation tips.  One of my favorite parts of the book was chapter 9 Delivery options and presentation tips, where it points out several different presentation and training methods and discusses each one.  I also liked the train the trainer section where it gives you all the topics that need to be discussed while conducting the training.  This is a great guide and I am very happy I bought it.  
   Into the second chapter I was weary if this book was going to live up to its reviews.  I was disappointed with the coverage of the explanations given.  So why 5 stars?    As I continued I began to understand what the author was trying to give the reader.  Reil describes guidlines for creating OO software, around 60 to be specific.  This is so what makes the book so fantastic.  Riel has, through much experience, collected a list of specific 'rules' or 'heuristics' that should be applied to your OO designs.  These rules set out to answer the million dollar question, 'is this a good design?'.  The rules are one or two sentences each, and therefore easy to remember, and are all listed in the front and back cover for quick reference.  Each rule is backed by a clear example, as well as sample C++ code in the appendix.    Any reader should be able to apply the simple rules easily as they go through the design process.  This will not only give you confidance in your designs, but something to actually back them up.  For example, if asked "Why did you make a uses relationship between these two classes instead of inheriting B from A?" you can reply, either to yourself or a co-worker, "Heuristic 5.15 - Do not turn objects of a class into derived classes of the class.  Be very suspicious of any derived class for which there is only one instance."    Of course, as Reil makes note, some rules will contradict each other, and he justifies what to do in such cases.    Finally, it should be noted that the book is highly centered on the C++ language, but is easily applied to the other languages of today - Java, C#, etc.  He does make several comparisons with SmallTalk.    If I was working on a design with someone, I would want to know that they have read and understood this book.  I hope it will live on, and will reccomend it to all my co-workers 
 Just for the record, Flesh Gordon was originally release as a Hardcore/XXX movie. What you have here is the edited "R" version. I think that either version is worth it's while, depending on what you're looking for.  I haven't seen the sequel, but, if it's half as good as the original, it's good 
 Alessandro Scarlatti composed over 30 oratorios yet only 5 have been published. This oratorio tells of the last King of Judaea and his punishment by Nebuchadnezzar. There are 5 main characters in this work:Sedecia(alto-Gerard Lesne);Anna (soprano-Virginia Pochon);Ismale(sopraniste-Philippe Jaroussky);Nabucco(bass-Peter Harvey);Nadabbe(tenor-Mark Padmore). All of these singers have excellent voices.  But what really impressed me the most was how very skilled they were in projecting their characters.  I was especially surprised at Lesne's ability to do so.  I've always enjoyed his singing, but have felt that his sense of drama was not always profound.  But this role was absolutely wonderfully done; his voice was outstanding in every way.  One has to mention Jaroussky: his versatility and skill cannot be denied. His aria "Il nitrito dei fieri cavalli" in which he goes one on one with a trumpet at breakneck speed into the stratisphere is phenominal!!!!And one of my favorite tenors Mark Padmore with his warm lush tone quality also is in top form.  "Peter Harvey creates a very convincing  and frightening  Nabucco.  This is a marvelous listening experience 
 Reading Americans reviews of brittish albums really gets on my nerves. This is a great album and Americans need to understand one thing about Mike Skinner : HE'S NOT A RAPPER, so please stop saying he can't rap. Everybody on this side of the sea know that. And why do ye dismiss albums because ye find it hard to understand the accent? Thats just plain ignorance. Time for Americans to open their minds. I'm Irish and we have no trouble understanding any accent, whether it be brittish or american, but Americans seen to always have a hard time understanding people that are not american, I bet most americans wouldn't have a clue what I'm sayin if they heard me speak, I'm from Limerick in Ireland and any american that we meet we have to slow down our accent like we're talking to somebody that speaks a different language or a child 
 I recommend this movie as a most usually high star. The Torch Song Trilogy has done something that no other movie producer has dared to do (I will leave it to you to identify what that is). The torch song trilogy has blended wisdom and humor in a comical theatrical version of the life of drag queen, who is more than what she appears to be on stage. It identifies with what most homosexuals yearn for and the strength it takes to get it. This movie is inspirational, comical, sad, and dramatic. There is no other movie of its kind, and no other movie compares. The movie identifies that love can overcome all- and that if there is one thing homosexuals want, it is acceptance, and if you can not do that then get out. This is a must have. The ONLY five star movie I have ever watched 
 I read it when one of my kids had to read it. A great story and brings up a lot of American history for teaching and learning (about the Gold Rush) 
 This is an example of an overlooked classic and brilliant morality tale. This story is very funny and very perceptive. This is an automatic read. If you see this, just make yourself read it. You will never forget the truths of the human condition in America that Steinbeck relays to us. I'm looking forward to the day that America starts paying attention to the least of us and values diversity. You may say that I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one 
 This was a wonderful book! I am a realtor and believe in giving my clients the best possible chances for the most return on selling their home. I was very pleased with her method. The clients that have followed her ideas have gotten better offers, not just higher ones. I have even fallen into the trance of "I want to buy this house" when I show a home to my buyers that another realtor has listed and had their sellers stage the home for selling. If you watch any of those staging house shows on TV you will see how important it is to have the house look ready to move in. Martha's advice is practical and even has tips on how to keep the house looking great during the period of the listing even when you are very busy and have kids running around the house. I highly recommend this book! 
 In between the poignant sex scenes between two obese amateur thespians (as husband and wife) and between the protagonist (Marcos Hernï¿½ndez), and the attractive hooker (Anapola Mushkadiz) - who so happens to be the daughter of a military official he works for, there are some scenes of deep confusion and contemplation.   The cast are all non-actors, and it is evident. The "freshness" that Reygadas is going for is not really there - what we have in its place is just a sense that something is lacking. I tried to get it, but was left lost.   In the scenes were Marcos walks or drives around staring blankly at things - one gets the sense that either the actor was lost or forgot his lines. The story lacked character development but to be fair the stream of consciousness left me thinking about the complexity of the human mind - but that is where it stopped. Am I curious to see Japon? Certainly - but my expectations have changed... who knows?   Miguel Llor 
 Recently, I bought this Training book w/ CDs. I am amazed! This book contains a lot of practice, practice, pracitce! My English speaking style was tremendously improved. In appendix, 7 languages(French, German, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, etc.) are analyzed and tell us what is the difference.  This book made me more confident in speaking. If I speak with confidence, most American understood me only one time!! This is neither bragging nor exaggerating. THIS IS TRUE STORY!  If you want to be like me, just try this great book. Don' be hesitate, shy!  Let's make an action! 
 An interesting story of a woman's life and her struggle to raise her only son and teach him what is valuable in life.  The Story is set in the late 1800 and early 1900's in rural and urban Chicago.  The author called it "a book about cabbages..." but really, it's a story about Selina DeJong, orphaned as a young, wealthy child, who struggles to make a life for herself and her only child Dirk whom she has nicknamed "sobig".  She marries a dolt for a husband and begins to work on a farm.  Her husband is a small man with a small brain and is afraid of his own shadow which limits and frustrates Selina and keeps her from accomplishing anything for many years.  Fortunately, her husband suffers an accidental death and she is fianlly able to make some necessary improvements which allow her son (who otherwise would have been a cabbage farmer his whole life) to attend college in the city.  He succeeds in college, but when he gets out he sacrifices his dream profession(architecture) to make a lot of money doing something boring in finance, and in doing so, he misses the point his mother tried to teach him about success.  (i.e. that money doesn't equal it.)  This is a really good book with a wonderful and inspiring ending.  If the whole book had been as good as the last couple chapters, I would have given it five stars easily.  Although "So Big" isn't a famous book, Edna Ferber made it big with most of her others... You may have heard of a couple of them... "Giant" from which the Rock Hudson, James Dean film was made, and "Showboat", which was made into a sprawling musical. (My head aches just to think about it) 
 I have his other book for VB 2005, so it is nice to have the other in C#. Additionally, he covers the new extensions in 3.0. It just keeps getting better and better and Troelsen lays it out. This book is an excellent reference and should be on every serious .NET programmers shelf 
 Bonnie Campbell Hill and Cynthia Ruptik have done it once again!  This book is filled with wonderful rubrics, both primary and intermediate, explanations for parents and teachers, and a wealth of authentic assessment  ideas.  I would highly recommend people spending the money on this valuable  book and CD rom. I look forward to the next three books in the series 
 This is only my second read by Ms.Terry {so far,the other's I just watched the movies!} I absolutely LOVED this Book!!! This is one of those rare books u can see and find yourself reading again and again! If u are like me and u are curious but undecided? GO FOR IT! u wont be disapointed at all 
 Peter is the best !!!  He amazes me more and more each time !!! I play this CD over and over again.  I drive clients in my car all day and they just love it !!  I know one has purchased it after hearing it for  the first time in my auto.  Keep up the good work Peter !! 
 Never did I think a book on investing could be so entertaining and funny.  Lynch is a man of blunt common sense.  This is a financial bible in convenient easy-to-digest and often comically-blunt form.  It tells you how to have fun picking out stocks and funds in a common sense manner, always pointing out the bottom line.  Lynch tells you how to make sense out of all those crazy little numbers you see in the newspaper or in a financial report.  As a bonus, Lynch also includes a short history of capitalism.  In it, he proves how investors and corporations are true heroes of our great American Republic.  Corporate-hating people who like to portray CEOs as crooks who spend too much time on the golf courses never point out how many kids got a G.I. Joe with the Kung Fu grip in the Christmas of '82 as a result of Lee Iacocca's skill and prowess in saving Chrysler and creating jobs for these aforementioned kids' daddies.  Or how investors at the Virginia Company of London funded Captain John Smith's mythic trip to Jamestown, where Pocahantas saved him from   her relatives who wanted to bash his skull in.  All we ever hear in our childhood storybooks are lame, sappy stories.  This book is not the masterpiece that One Up On Wall Street is, but one that made me misty-eyed nonetheless 
 In his book Deschooling Society, Ivan Illich explores the diametrically opposite effects of institutions, schools in particular, compared to its progressive intentions. Illich continues to explain this phenomenon of the school and concludes that the institution of school, the keystone of our society, be removed and allow all the manipulative institutions that build our society to collapse. Illich further proposes that society should then be reconstructed with an educational institution that would support the convivial institutions of society and truly use the world as the environment for educational experience. 
 What can I say if you like Clint Eastwood your going to like this movie.  I Have not seen this movie since it played at my local drive-in!  What  memories 
 Overall the DVD was good and very much appropriate for young children. However, after a year or so it had fallen to the back of his preference list. I guess this isn't so different from any other DVD we have.. but it did last a year or more.  I would recommend this for young children. It does have a few concepts that are not appropriate, but are presented in a way that is way over the heads of children adn does have a few scenes that very concervative parents may term violent or inappropriate. The movie is mostly an original concept but there are striking similarities to Antz. Overall a GREAT movie for the whole family 
 This is a must read for just about anyone.  It would be a great gift for your father.  It has a lot of moving stories and some funny ones as well.  I have read it and now I am going to give it to my father as a gift, it is a great book.  I also now will probably buy Big Russ and Me 
 Similar to his work in his previous work "Theories of theInformation Society", Webster offers a perspective on the changesin the contemporary society that is far from celebrational. By no means does he follow the same discours as other writers on this topic do (such as Levinson, Wired Magazine) and critically analyzes the multiple implications of actual virtual life (MUD's), the existing discours on technoculture and the capitalist dimension behind the new global information order. I've found this book to be a good starting point for readers already somewhat familar with the pecularities of the subject that wish to conduct further exploration into realm of cyberscience. The downside of this soft specialism is that Webster and Robins tend to disect the smallest particles which makes it a tough read from time to time. However, their insights are well argumented and left me feeling more educated on the topic. Go buy it 
 Not my favorite book of all time but definitely kept my attention and was a quick enough read that I'd recommend it to anyone. Strong characterization and interesting story. 
 I think the book had good instructions and it helped me understand how to make 4 or 5 new string figures. It was easy to read, and the pictures were  very good. I would recommend this book for beginners who are learning to  make string figures 
 I became interested in this movie after reading the book "Ishmael" by Daniel Quinn and learning from a friend that this movie was based on the book. It was a very good movie and Anthony Hopkins is wonderfully persuasive but all the suggestion from "Ishmael" there seems to be is just that living in nature is better than living in civilization. There was nothing that indicated the precariousness of civilization - "takers" are mentioned but it comes across more as you just don't know what you are missing by being one - not that all of nature has had it. Heck, the movie makers would be shooting their own business in the foot if they were really to try and convince us to head back to the trees. But of course that was the main point of "Ishmael". If we don't give up being takers and go back to being part of nature, then nature has had it and so have we 
 This is probably one of the best cook books for new home makers (just married) or beginning hobbyist cookers (men or women). It is well written and properly indexed 
 This book is right on target. It showed me the reasons for why I've felt the way I have for so many years.  I'm 55 and was adopted in infancy. My adopted Mother never told me anything and I always felt left out and some how all alone in this world. Now I understand why I feel the way I have all these years. It's natural and normal. This is an excellent book for adoptees to understand why their feelings are mixed, confused, and not totally feeling a part of this world.  I'd recommend this book to all adoptees 
 To Lieutenant Eve Dallas' dismay, she once again finds herself on her husband's posh resort planet where they had spent the last week of their lengthy honeymoon.  But this visit to Roarke's domain isn't for pleasure, but business.  Police business.  Her irritation with her commander at being summoned to a police convention only heightens when she is charged to become a keynote speaker at that same convention.  But, even that pesky assignment takes a backseat when she is introduced to a legendary icon in the police world: retired Commander Douglas Skinner.  Eve soon discovers that the retired commander has a violent hatred toward her husband, Roarke, with a secret agenda of revenge in mind.  Together, Eve and Roarke unravel the commander's plans, but not before multiple deaths throw Eve back into another murder investigation.     For those of you who are avid lovers of J. D. Robb's "In Death" series, this episode is a must!  It brings into focus just one more piece of the puzzle of Eve Dallas. 
 Well I dont think my money got wasted!! Cool one shooting great pictures, auto focus is good. Have a 2 GB card and start shooting memories... Recommended!!

 For those of you that are bird lovers, or nature lovers in general, this is a touching true story that highlights the struggle between man and nature. The narrator is an eclectic character who befriends a flock of wild birds in the middle of a big city. He gets to know them individually and so does the viewer, sharing their lives on a personal basis. It is both heartwarming and sad, and leaves one wanting to know what happens after it ends. 
 We purchased the DVD in March 2006 when our daughter was 1 1/2. She hasn't tired of watching it yet. We have other DVDs including others from the Scholastic Video Collection. This is by far the Best and continues to be the most watched. Our daughter wants to watch every story. For those older parents, who remember Parent's Press Books from the 70's, "The Hat" will bring back memories. Highly recommend 
 You have to get this book.  No, you have to give this book.  I received this book as a gift and found it to be much better than I could have imagined.  This book is not filled with your typical touchy-feely self help ramblings.  This book illustrates how you can improve your life by letting go.  The concept is simple, but not necessarily easy.  This goes against much of what we have been taught, but it really makes sense.  The methods are not that different from how we already confront crisis and emergency situations; by relying on intuition, and faith.  This book teaches you how to apply those concepts to the complex situations you face throughout your life.  Then it gives real life examples of how it has worked for people for all sorts of different problems.  Read this book and it might just become your favorite gift to give 
 Isn't that an odd thing to say about a book whose title starts with the word "sex?"    Well, around 1964 one of my parents brought this book home, although neither of them would ever confess to the deed.  Whoever it was, they did me a big favor.  When the folks weren't watching, I swiped the book and devoured it in a single long sitting.  Helen Gurley Brown should have entitled this masterwork "All the Hard-Nosed Things that Young Women in the So-Called Pre-Feminist Era Need to Know about Money, Career, Independence, Women's Rights, and The Way Things Unfortunately Are.  And Oh Yes, Sex.  That."  However, the book would undoubtedly have sold fewer copies if the title had truly reflected the contents, so it's just as well they hyped the sex part.    Under the impression that I was going to get to read some really naughty stuff, I studied Brown's book with the intensity I would later reserve for pre-calculus.  Brown was the friendly, more experienced adult ("Aunt Helen," I liked to think of her) who cut the BS and told you how it really was with respect to a number of important subjects, often contradicting the messages of the dominant 60's culture, as it materialized later in the decade.    Money?  Girl, Woodstock or not, you will need it when you are no longer "pristinely young," so get a career and earn it.  You will appreciate the freedom and self-respect it brings you.  Do the very best you can with whatever abilities you have and the education you can get, and the rewards will carry you through the inevitable bad times that everybody faces.  Beauty?  Even if you are gorgeous, don't put all your eggs in that basket, because your beauty will fade, and then where will you be if that's the only card you ever played?  Love?  It is NOT all you need, no matter what the Beatles say.  Marriage?  Fine, fabulous (Brown herself has been married over forty years), but don't pin all your reasons for living - or your financial survival -- on a guy.  Guys are just fallible human beings.  Don't give up your ability to stand on your own two feet when you fall in love, because there are no guarantees in life, ever.  As Brown eloquently put it, in middle age (or at any time before) a man can leave a woman "like dishes in the sink" if he wants to badly enough.  Exercise and a healthy diet?  Essential to self-respect.  Property ownership (or at least having a fine apartment)?  Also essential, particularly when you get older; living in a garage apartment furnished with orange crates is cute when you're twenty, but pathetic when you're forty.  I came of age in the late 60's and early 70's, when the culture was telling us to tune in, turn on, and drop out.  Don't conform, don't join the establishment, don't become the man or the woman in the gray flannel suit, don't throw away your life working and forget to smell the roses.  Follow your dreams and the universe will magically provide.    This was good advice as far as it went.  It sounded so great, and it really was well meant and idealistic and heartfelt...if only it had been true.  Unfortunately, it should have been taken with a small but healthy dose of skepticism.  Such as, yes, do follow your dreams, but along the way learn some marketable skills, okay?  However, the cultural mindset discouraged us from planning for the future, or thinking seriously about money, financial issues, and practical things.  We might have known with our minds that the Woodstock generation would eventually get much, much older, but we didn't believe it.    I, however, had Aunt Helen whispering in my ear, so around age thirty I finally rolled up my sleeves, quit hanging out in Austin drinking dark beer and swimming in Barton Springs, and got an advanced degree and a good job -- but did plan things so I still had some time to smell the roses.  I couldn't have done it without her advice.  At the end of the day, although Brown was not considered a "real" feminist, and in fact came in for a great deal of scorn on that account, she helped me every bit as much as the rest of them.    She wasn't into rhetoric, ideology, or internecine wars with the sisters, she just gave good hardheaded advice about the way things were, like it or not, that's city hall so just deal with it. She liked men.  They were people, they had their problems, but generally they were pretty nice.  This was quite a relief to those of us who liked them too, even though there were times when it wasn't politically correct to dwell on it.  She just didn't believe that liking men required her to give up everything else worthwhile in life, or her ability to provide for herself.    Yeah yeah, like just about everybody else I take issue with her rather Darwinian attitude about carrying on with married men.  However, as the writer Molly Ivins would say, she had the guts to tell young women how the cow ate the cabbage.  I honor her for that.       
 Accomplishing goals, living a worthwhile life, and getting along with other people are all part of McGinnis' stragetgy for living abundantly. Optimism is an intangible force that has practical consequences. McGinnis describes it as a "can-do" philosophy. A quote he takes from William James brings the theme of individual control out even more when he writes "The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind." McGinnis argues that this mind-set can result in people being elevated to the top of their fields. In part this is because activity results when people are optimistic. Without action entropy causes a system to break down. It is through active involvement that entropy is successfully overcome. Activity is stimulated as optimists create and maintain synergy with like minded associates. Reading is another form of stiumlation found among this group. Even more important than relationship maintainence and good reading, McGinnis stresses the importance of prayer. Optimistic achievers are perpetually young regardless of their chronological years he points out because "regardless of their age, they have a stubborn belief that their personal best is yet to be." More good news is reported in that optimism can be leaded. He says he read almost a thousand biographies and analyzed the lives of many successful people before drawing the conclusions he makes in this wonderful book. I highly recommend it 
 The one thing that I always liked about the series is that the murderous culprits were always "uber-successful" and had much to lose by NOT committing the crime. Of course, the statement is not my endorsement of murder as a means to an end; it was just cool to see those people that we think "have it all" resort to doing away with their fellow man (or woman).  This third season DVD compilation shares the same double-sided disc format of the previous second season's collection. Unfortunately, it includes an installment of Kate Mulgrew's lamentable "Mrs. Columbo." Though the show came after these "Columbo" episodes, it looks more dated, with the filming techniques, as well as the awful scoring and writing.   Fortunately, for the actress, she would achieve greater success as "Captain Janeway" on "Star Trek: Voyager."   The "Columbo" episodes, on the other hand, are some of the best of the show's entire run. Vera Miles, an actress that I have long admired, gets to glamorously chew scenery with the likes of Vincent Price and young Martin Sheen in the wickedly delicious "Lovely but Lethal". Film veteran Donald Pleasance hams it up marvelously as a snooty winemaker that "liquidates" his younger half-brother (Gary Conway of "Land of the Giants") in the cleverly titled "Any Old Port in a Storm". This episode also features Vito Scotti, a friend of star Peter Falk that has appeared in many "Columbo's" over the years, including "Swan Song", also among this compilation.  In "Candidate for Crime" former child star Jackie Cooper plays a politician saddled with a less-than-desirable campaign manager that decides to put a permanent end to their political relationship. Robert Culp, one of television's best actors, returns for a THIRD time as a perpetrator in "Double Exposure," also featuring Robert Middleton and Louise Latham.  Oscar winner Jose Ferrer stars in possibly the "weakest" of the episodes, "Mind Over Mayhem," though it features a sly tribute to Steven Spielberg, the director of the first episode of the show.  Also, the guest star roster includes screen veteran Lew Ayres (the theatrical "Dr. Kildare" series) and a young Jessica Walter ("Arrested Development").   But the most ingenious use of guest stars and writing belong to "Publish or Perish," the previously mentioned "Swan Song," and "A Friend in Deed". Jack Cassidy, another fine actor that appeared in several episodes, is in the first, again playing someone in the publishing field, as he had in the Spielberg-directed "Murder by the Book." "Swan Song" stars the underrated ACTOR Johnny Cash as a COUNTRY gospel singer. Film star and television directing legend Ida Lupino plays his shrewish wife. Finally, Broadway veteran Richard Kiley gets the most inspired role of all, playing Columbo's police commissioner boss that murders his wife.  And composer Billy Goldenberg would provide most of the brilliant scores for the third season.  This is a stellar season, marred by Universal's decision to include "Mrs. Columbo" and failure to offer any other extras that DVD buyers have come to expect 
 I have looked at a lot of references on natural medicines,  and this one is by far the best.  This book is laid out like a huge chart.  It's over 1000 pages.  For all the different herbals, and vitamins, and supplements this database shows all sorts of other names, uses, side effects, cautions,  interactions.  A lot of herbs can interact with drugs and this information  is in here.  It has brand names and ingredients.  It covers all the herbs  and vitamins and minerals and supplements.  Everything I've looked for has  been in it. The book is put together by a large group of pharmacists and  physicians.  They are very scientific, and they list thousands of medical  references where the information comes from. I like the fact that the  various products are rated.  The book tells what's effective and what is  safe, and gives ratings for these.  It shows which prescription drugs cause  the body to become deficient in certian nutrients.  It also says what's  safe to use during preganancy.  My doctor says this is the best source of  scientific information available on this subject.  If you want a good  scientific reference this is the one to get.  Inside the book there's the  address of the book's private website that is terrific.  There are also  charts of interactions and charts showing which supplements work for  certain conditions 
 I do not think the subtitle "The Complete Guide to the most popular Cisco firewall security features" goes to the level of credit that this book truly goes too.  David Hucaby did not only write a guide, he wrote a book that will clearly sit on my quick grab shelf right next to my desk for years to come (or until the next version).  For as the introduction states "the book is meant to be used as a tool in every day activities." and that is clearly what it does.  David wrote for both from the introduction and the structure of the book to the index, a complete guide and tool that deserves ranting and raving.  As you begin flipping through the book the knowledge and understanding of how a security engineers or administrator operate becomes clear.  While the structure alone being designed to support both chapters and sections within the chapters, help to ensure details are easily located and quickly referenced.  Combine with the detailed index in this book, ensure he does not miss a beat.  From the beginning you see the level of both understanding and time that was done when David wrote this book.  Not only is David's book designed to be more than a reference guide.  By going through the step by step process and understanding, but it details numerous features, commands and methods to help individuals understand what they are seeing or expecting.  While exploring the book I found several nice facts including a quick bit in chapter 3 "Configuring Interfaces" where David talks about Priority Queue and the differences between current 6.x and new 7.x code.  As we have learned with PIX code up to version 7.x it was all best-effort, but then has begun to change for the future.  Thus this section while small is an excellent section to show the detail packed and excellent example of why this book needs to be on every security engineers and administrators desk or bookshelf.  Other features in this book is provide us the reader with excellent examples of the evolution of Cisco's firewall operating code as it moves from version 6.x to 7.x platform.  Cisco has begun to introduction new features and support new platforms like the Firewall Service Module (FWSM) and the new Cisco ASA into an already growing product line in high demand.  With the book David spends time showing how the same configuration items behave with each different code level or hardware platform that Cisco has introduced and currently supports.  This alone can clearly help any individual attempting to understand and compare Cisco Firewalls product lines.  Yet while this is another excellent example of why the book is a must have, the final that comes to mind is the detailed Appendix's that David has included from a complete list of error codes for all PIX syslog errors or messages to A "Well-Known Protocol and Port Numbers" section.  At one point I found myself looking from chapter to chapter and spot to spot without realizing I was jumping around.  Cause regardless of where you are in the book you too will find yourself jumping around to either review something or cross-reference an item.  If I was to change anything in the book, it would be the cover cause the material is as perfect as possible considering the length and time clearly spent learning and comparing the differences that the book contains.  Why do I say the cover needs to be changed you ask?  Well I think that as a security engineer or administrator you will be referencing this material so much that the soft cover will become damaged and show the wear and tear that comes with true usage and appreciation of a book of this caliber 
 ...but invest in a soft spongy brush for the carafe and a smaller skinny brush for the tube inside.  The Santos makes the best cup of joe I've ever had and although I was skeptical after several weeks of researching and reading customer reviews it's not that hard to clean if you spend an extra $5 on the right tools. 
 Director Robert Aldrich's "Kiss Me Deadly" is an offbeat production based on the Mickey Spillane novel which in 1955 came at the tail end of the film noir era.  The film is a juxtaposition of the dark moody noir genre with the embryonic atomic age.  Ralph Meeker playing narcissistic, unscrupulous private investigator and Spillane anti-hero Mike Hammer becomes involved in a plot that is beyond his normal scope.  Hammer who generates most of his business through divorce inquests, uses both the charms of his sexy assistant Velda played by Maxine Cooper and his own to embellish his cases.  Hammer is tooling along a deserted highway in his signature sports car when he almost runs over a young Cloris Leachman clad only in a trenchcoat and little else.  He stops to pick her up and soon learns that she's escaped from an asylum.  Driving together they are forced off the road and abducted by a gang lead by a faceless heavy recognizable only by a pair of fancy shoes.  Leachman who reveals some mysterious secrets to Hammer in previous conversation, is tortured to death.  She's then placed along with Hammer in his car and they are pushed off a cliff.    Hammer survives the ordeal but gets the idea that he's stumbled into a scheme that has potential for immense financial rewards.  Using his investigative talents and utilizing an array of associates such as auto mechanic Nick, played by Nick Dennis and Cooper,  Hammer comes into contact with a wide variety of sketchy villains including Leachman roommate Lily played by Gaby Rodgers.  We finally learn that the prize that the bad guys are after is contained within a well insulated black case and apparently contains some radioactive material.  The tastefully shoed head of the gang is revealed to be Albert Dekker playing the arcane Dr. Soberin who is in cohoots with Gaby Rodgers.  In the wild and memorable finale with bullets flying in Dekker's beach house and Hammer wounded, Rodgers is warned not to open the case.  In a scene reminiscent of Pandora's box, her curiousity gets the best of her and after shooting Dekker, opens the case creating an unexpected fiery cataclysm 
 This is an important book for what it reveals about the nature of interrogation. Interrogation, as it is practiced' is not about finding the truth but about creating a set of new beliefs in the prisoner. As the author, Sargent, points out this may be entirely unintentional on the part of the questioner. However the techniques they use to overcome their subject's resistance act to put him/her in a state of heightened suggestibility. The examiner by his/her questions supplies to the subject the substance of new beliefs. The stress that they put the subject under cause distinct and predictable physiological effects that result in the subject losing his/her previous sets of beliefs.  Sargent illustrates this by reference to techniques used in religious conversions and Soviet and Chinese brain washing and re-education. Sargent shows that the same techniques of overwhelming the subject with stress and then offering a way out have been sued for thousands of years in this regard. He describes Soviet era questioning, the evangelism of John Wesley, Chinese re-education camps and shows that they all have the same effect of converting the subject to a new way of belief that is desired by the examiner. The subjects of Soviet show trials did not confess because they feared more pain. They confessed because they genuinely believed in Th charges against them  This puts the current discussion of torture and Guantanomo in perspective. The techniques from there that have been described in the press are not designed to elicit information under the fear of pain. They are designed to convert the prisoners to a new set of beliefs that are compatible with American interests. As Sargent shows, since the fact that the prisoners are people with strong beliefs means that they will, after conversion, hold beliefs of equal strength in the new cause. They will cooperate with the American cause because they will then believe in it with all of their hearts. 
 Renee Fleming is an artist bringing us something new, and beautiful. The poor will always be with us as manifest in those who resent other's movement from their established zones. Renee Fleming is a great female voice with accomplishments her detractors will never have, but in their dreams.  I welcome Renee's elan demonstrated with her recent recordings, Love sublime with Brad Mehldau, and Haunted Heart with Fred Hersch and Bill Frissell. Bravery, fun, and talent combined by artists and for people who are listening. Hearing long time favorites Mehldau, Hersch, and Frissell is all the more sublime. 
 I like this book.  He really argues persuasively about the subject he covers.  The first half is a very quick read, the second half is a bit slowerer going but worth it.  I don't feel that this is a very good presentation of the preterist view.  Ok so the beast is Nero and Revelation was written before A.D. 70, what about some of the other passages in Revelation, what are they about and more so, if that's what Revelation is about then what does the author think will happen in the end.  It's as if you can't really call this a book on eschatology anymore since it's not really anywhere close to the study of last things. But overall it's good on covering those two points.  Now for the important part.  I bought this book on Amazon in Dec 06 included was a card for a free year subscription to Biblical Worldview magazine.  If you go to the publishers website you can get a feel for the magazine, it looks pretty good.  And by calling it in and using another code on the card I got a free no shipping nothing free book by Gary DeMar whom I've never heard of but the book is $18 and the subscription is normally $25. So overall if you buy the book and it has the card (and two of my friends who bought the book around the same time also had the card) You get 43 dollars worth of stuff free.  Made the book really feel like a bargain 
 A concise work on the world of vehicle dynamics ... easily the best book I've bought on the subject.  A must-read for anyone interested in this aspect of automotive engineering.  It only took me about a week or two to get it, even though it said it would take 3 to 5 weeks.  Let me know what you think 
 I have read number of books on this subject. I must say this is one of the best transformational books that I ever read. I read more than once. It was such a blissful experience to read this book. Truely an awakening book to read. Highly recommended to any one who is looking for liberation and true happiness. 
 ICEBOUND is a little different story-line than Koontz' normal style and makes for a very interesting book. This is about a group of scientists in the Arctic working together to help the earth with their water shortage problem. This group must place bombs below the ice surface to get a large piece of ice dislocated from the mass, so it can be floated down to warmer climates, and be used for drinking water. Sounds simple, right ... wrong. Murphy's Law comes into effect. A member of the group turns out to be a psychopathic killer, an earthquake hits and makes returning to their home camp impossible, and after sixty bombs are placed and the timers set, a series of storms hit which make rescue seem impossible. Not only do they have to get off the ice cap, but also they have to figure out which one of them is the killer.  ICEBOUND is a very suspenseful novel and an interesting diversion from the normal Koontz writing style. I found it very enjoyable, and a book even younger readers (pre-teens) can enjoy. 
 A surprisingly good film considering it is the third in the series, Jurassic Park III, provides another take on the well known by now paleontologist and of course... the dinosaurs!  When Alan Grant is contacted by a wealthy couple to act as a guide on an aerial tour over the restricted island of Sorna things are not all that they seem... Sam Neill, Tea Leoni, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well, allowing for a highly entertaining movie. On the negative side, the 11-year old surviving for 8 weeks on Isla Sorna is ridiculous to say the least, not to mention his overly confident attitude throughout the movie!  In addition, Allesandro Nivola's character is not all that interesting and that takes away from the enjoyment.  In the end you kind of wish he hadn't made it... In short, the plot is average, while the setting, the special effects, and the music are EXCELLENT!   Overall, though not a masterpiece, it is definitely a movie worth watching and one to consider adding to your movie collection!  
 An excellent , easy step by step journey into healing, it talks on energy, positive and negative, Aura's, Chakra's balancing, contains step by step instructions, and diagrams on energy flow, I found it to be an easy read and anyone can do it . cover is different on the 1993/94 edition.  Peace love and light.  Nicole (NY) author of rainy day poems and more 1 and 2 . 
 This is a fantasy novel about two magicians (and a nasty thistle-downed-haired fairy) written in the form of a true historical novel, complete with footnotes to clarify the text and/or "refer" the reader to other sources. It is, if it is your taste, a wonderfully droll and imaginative book. I say, if it meets your taste because a complaint could be made that, when those moments of magic-making appear in the "history" they too are done with the writer's option of simply stating an historical fact. Some readers might like the writing at these points to "soar" a bit more than it does with wonder and imagery as the writing would surely do in other more traditional types of fantasy. For instance, when J. Strange brings some corpses to life (to question them) the scene is (to make a pun) almost lifeless, as it would be in a true historical novel. Still that complaint aside, the book is thoroughly readable, very entertaining, and the many pages go by rather swiftly. Oh, one more thing, the type font on the paperback is small and it might be wiser for some to avoid the mass market paperback and obtain another version.    
 Before the reader begins these teachings, s/he must ask, "am I ready for this?" Padmasambhava's terma treasures are as exact, direct and profound as one might expect from the first teacher of dzogchen. There is  nothing in these texts, nothing to be learned. I have never encountered  anything more frighteningly wonderful in any other teaching. The  translation is excellent as well, and the book includes a detailed glossary  that any reader will find useful and informative 
 We had big expectations for Mo'Nique One Night Stand as we feel she is one of the best, if not the best woman comdedians of our time. Mo'Nigue did not dissappoint. You should definitely put the kids to sleep before popping in this dvd, as she is very obscene and curses alot, although its funny its NOT for kids. She is alot funnier on this special then she is on the "The Parkers". Thats because the doesn't have to watch her mouth, and she can say whatever she wants without having to worry about it being bleeped out and she takes full advantage of that privilege. While on stage she gives it her all as you can tell by the sweat pouring off of her face. Several times during the show she got help from audience members in wiping the sweat off. She loves to make fun of skinny girls and even big girls for that matter. She jokes about everything from her divorce and kids to skinny girls and the rugrats. This dvd would of gotten 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that she stayed to long on talking about her ex husband and kids to long. That got a little tiring. The dvd also would been better if there where some extra features. It would of been funny to see her behind the scenes. In the end it is recommended that you rent this dvd as it is worth seeing at least once. Mo'Nigue is quickly becoming one of the funniest comedians around. If you want to get more laughs from her check her out in the movie Soul Plane. Thanks, **Iblazed.com Leader in hip hop movie reviews.**  
 I have always used the metal irons and was concerned about the nonstick. I was afraid the structure would create thicker pizzelles which are more cookie like versus light and wafer. The first ones came out and were sticking to the surface. I was disheartened thinking I am having the same problem as with the metal. I switched to nonstick to avoid this. Oh well, try again....and from that moment on was smooth sailing. I like the light indicator on this model, the easy clean up, storage design.....just everything. 
 The book follows the real-life story of Chris Gardner, a self-made entrepreneuer and investor, as he perserveres over a multitude of personal, social, psychological, and financial obstacles. The book presents Gardner's thoughts, raw emotions, and intepretations as the incidents are revealed from his memory.   The first act was a bit slow but captured the familial themes that motivate him in the latter portion of his life. Chris's step-father was verbally and physically abusive both to him and his mother. His mother was loving yet not always available due to run-in with the law. These circumstances cement Chris's desire to be a good parent for his son later on in his life. The second act presents Chris's self-awareness as a racial minority in California and a stint within the Navy. Throughout the latter  Acts, Chris overindulges in various temptations that ultimately leads him to descend into a situation of being a single, black father living in poverty.  I feel this review wouldn't be complete without a comparison to the Will Smith movie. The movie covers only the latter adult portion of Gardner's life. The movie a good in its own right for presenting a character inspired and determined to overcome a row of circumstancial obstacles. However, the movie suffers from too many Hollywood cliches, too much insertion of grim comic relief (showing Gardner run frantically around San Francisco after thieves who steal his products) and most importantly inserted a messianic portrayal of Gardner as opposed to the real, aspiring but flawed portrayal in the book.   While I acknowledge its difficult to provide this much depth in a 2-hour film, I feel this skewed portrayal of Chris as some sort of ultimate role model waters down the message present in the book. Chris, while a good and decent man and father, admits he has cheated on his wife, has experimented with drugs. Nonetheless, Chris's thoughts exemplify a sharp individual who sees the forest for the trees, knows how to think outside the box, and doesn't allow certain personal or business relationships hinder his own success. Gardner's confidence in himself, his ability to learn new trades and skills under constraints demonstrate qualities that identify Chris as a leader who can inspire others regardless of their own circumstances. I was rather impressed and inspired by Chris's ability to bear and dismiss pessimistic stress-inducing rhetoric from his pampered, sheltered co-workers, manipulative employers, and racists clients in order to succeed as a stock broker.   Many of the readers who rate this book poorly due to the personal decision Gardner made in his own life have missed the essence of the autobiography. Gardner openly acknowledges that he made many selfish and wreckless mistakes in his life from start to finish. Even I will agree that Gardner makes many personal decisions during his ascension to wealth that I would probably never consider. However, the story of this book is Gardner's ability to combine heart, determination, and wits in order to escape the wilderness and pursue a life, vision, and positive sphere of influence within his own community. This valuable message is one I will never forget, which is why I highly recommend this book for others who want to put their own problems in perspective. 
 Coming Home to Eat is easy to read, enjoyable, and packed full of interesting details on a myriad of topics.  This is the type of book you can give to almost anyone, and they will enjoy reading it.  I'm a biologist with a background in conservation, and I really enjoyed reading about the natural history of many of the plants and animals in the book.  I've given the book to two other people, and they both loved it, but for completely different reasons.  One enjoyed all the detailed descriptions of cooking and meals; while the other was more interested by the social and economic aspects of the book.  The author does a great job of weaving together several fairly disparate topics into a very entertaining narrative 
 Most biographers either fall in love with their subject or villify them to the extreme.  Ruth Schurr in this wonderfully crafted biography falls into neither trap.  She lays out the history of this remarkable man and his role in the French revolution and lets the reader decide whether he was truly "incorruptible" or simply a bloodthirsty opportunist.  In doing so, she presents a fascinating portrait of a man who changed the history of France and, in many ways, the world.  This is not an overly erudite or scholarly study of the man.  Much in this book contains educated speculation, but the author doesn't feign to present it as anything more.  It is an eminently readable account of the history of this period from the Revolutionary perspective.  The writing style is engrossing and reads like a suspense novel with twist and turns as Maximillian one-by-one turns on his friends and enemies alike.  I can't recommend this more highly and it is a good counterpoise to a book like "Road to Versaille" by Munro Price, which presents the royalist perspective.  A great initial offering from Ruth Schurr.  I can't wait to get her next book 
 Truthfully I only read this book because my mother-in-law gave it to me when she was done.  I had thought I had heard/read it all and just read it because there wasn't anything better to read.  But I must say that I was surprised at how interesting it was and despite the fact that its several years old, still very relevant.  I am an author of a self-help book for those who step out of their careers to be stay-at-home moms and have seen first hand the way the media, even in the SMALL town I currently reside, has almost but completely ignored both me and my book.  In chapter 11, Mr. Goldberg discusses how the media represses the negative research regarding the institution of childcare and in my case explains why the media ignores the subject of the stay-at-home parent, despite the fact that there are millions of parents at home.  I have researched this topic for years and yet Mr. Goldberg presented research I hadn't seen before.  This is an excellent book and a must read for publishers and others who may be wondering why the media is ignoring their message.  
 This is a decent GPS device and a fine Pocket PC.  I'd give it 3.5 stars if possible.  Pros:  1) It's a perfectly decent Pocket PC.  I've owned several, and this is no worse than any of them except for CPU speed and RAM.  It's perfectly OK and actually pretty decent looking.  Its lights (charging, charged, etc.) keep you well informed.  2) The GPS functions work pretty well.  The software for the PC is quite good.  You can load maps to main memory and/or the SD card (your choice per map).  You get a lot of control with reasonable ease of use.  The US maps seem pretty good (but not up-to-date with the very latest street changes).  3) It's priced VERY attractively.  Consider that you're getting a fully-functional PDA (with MP3 playback, games you can download, etc.) AND a GPS device with a 3.5" color touch-screen.  Amazon is a great retailer and has a good price, but I did manage to pay fifty less on sale elsewhere.  4) If you make a "wrong" turn (intentionally or not), it's pretty quick to recalculate the route and give intelligent new instructions.  5) You can switch among 4 screens while navigating: 2D map (and you can zoom in & out and drag to scroll), 3D map, list of directions with current step highlighted, or a "large" screen of what the next major step will be (and how soon).  To avoid being distracted while driving, that last screen may be your best friend.  You probably don't need the maps much while driving -- just while planning the trip or if you pull over.  DON'T DRIVE DISTRACTED!  6) This may annoy some people, but I like that it gives verbal directions about upcoming forks/intersections, even if you only need to continue going straight.  It's reassuring.  Cons:  1) The mounting hardware is somewhat awkward.  The device needs a pretty good line-of-sight to the satellites, so you really want it close to the windshield (unless you buy an external antenna, which I may).  2) Entering destination addresses is slow because the software tries to anticipate what you're entering as you enter each part.  It has to consult its database, so you must wait until it creates a list of possibilities at each step.  But you only have to do this occasionally (when you enter locations), so it's not a big deal.  It doesn't affect you at driving time.  3) It doesn't speak the names of the streets as it tells you to turn.  Some GPS devices (including the one in my wife's Motorola RAZR V3m phone) do.  Again, not a huge issue.  4) The screen can get washed out in bright sunlight, especially since you need to have it pretty close to the glass (windshield) for it to have a consistent connection to the satellites.  But if you've looked at the map ahead of time, you really don't need the screen that much while driving -- the voice will tell you what to do.  Another side effect of having to mount it so close to the glass is that it's farther from your face, so it can be harder to read.  But, as I said before, if you get an external antenna, then you can presumably mount the PDA anywhere, so it will be more shaded and closer to your eyes.  Bottom line:  If you're wealthy, get a car with a large, built-in navigation system.  If you're semi-wealthy, get a stand-alone, larger-screen, top-of-the line nav system for 3 or 4 times this price.  But if you are on a budget and want a nice nav system and a good PDA for one low price, this can't be beat!  PS: I did NOT experience the crashing or power problems that another reviewer mentioned 
 I cant find anything wrong with this cd except for the fact that redman is on it.  kurt rosenwinkel's compositions are beautiful, im a huge fan of the next step..its a terrific album, i listen to it at least a few times a week.  who was on it? mark turner.  i love mark turner and its not like i want him on every cd ever made, but i think he would have added even more artistry to this cd.  Im positive that kurt asked mark to cut this cd with him, and then redman found out and had turner temporarily incapacitated so that he himself could do the album.  I like this cd when it is just kurt and mehldau soloing, and when redman is just assigned to the melodies, it makes the songs much more nice.  me and a few friends from school drove out to california from texas to go see kurt and his deep song tour.  who was playing with him? mark turner.  why wasnt redman on it? because mark turner had recovered and kurt wanted him back along.  i wish turner was on this cd because it would have elvated it to an even more incredible level.  seriously, why did redman have to go and ruin the end of the next step like that? you think his "heavy blues upbringing" could take a seat for a song or too? he's no mark turner.  mark and kurt really connect with each other and make some of the most heart felt and honest music ive ever heard.  buy this cd, but remember the days of kurt/mark 
 I recommend this book highly for anyone who is losing a close family member or friend to illness or who has lost someone and just are having a hard time coming to terms with why 
 The Stephen R. Covey engine has kicked out numerous books on self-help, and they consult 200 out of the top 500 Fortune companies. After all of those books and years, they have heard enough stories and waded through enough crisis situations to get a good handle on what works and does not work in all of those environments.  Now, if you've read every book they're written, then undoubtedly you're going to begin this book and say "I've read this all before". Naturally, when they begin a book, they have to assume that some readers haven't read the other books yet. They have to catch them up on the background and basics. If you don't need that primer, then skim for a while. It's not a bad thing, it's a normal thing. It's how book writing works :) If you pick up book 5 of Harry Potter, you still have to go through a little bit of scene setting for the .00002% of the population who skipped the other books and lept into Book 5.  So now, onto the key points of this specific book. Time management is good. Organizing your goals is good. But all of these things are only good if your goals are actually valid ones. If you spend all your time creating to-do lists, and carefully plotting out weekly goals ... but your goal is to get a "bigger fur coat" while your children are starving and you're miserable at work, something is out of sync. This book is all about making sure that what you do is what you REALLY want to do. It's about a higher level of time management.  So they're not saying the other time management systems are bad. They explicitly say that each has its place in life! However, if you work very hard every day to climb a ladder, and find after many years that the ladder you've climbed was against the wrong wall, then you'll be very disappointed. You should always make sure you are working for a goal that you really feel is important at a basic moral level.  This isn't a book to just plow through in an hour and see what you remember. It's asking you to really think about why you do things in life. Is it because your parents harassed you when you were young, and you want to get a flashy car to prove you're something? Do you try to out-do your co-workers even if it hurts your home life? Sometimes these answers don't come easily. If they did, I imagine we wouldn't need a book to help us sort them out.  This is a good book to read a chapter, then put down for a while. Go back and read another one, then think about it for a while. The basic concept is easy enough to understand. Divide your tasks up based on what category they fall into -  Quadrant I - urgent, important Quadrant II - not urgent, important Quadrant III - urgent, not important Quadrant IV - not urgent, not important  Sounds easy, yes? But how many of us get sucked into a ton of "urgent" but really not important tasks for all sorts of reasons? It's the planning - the Quadrant II time - that can help fix those issues. But we have to make time to plan. If your life is full of incessant urgent demands, it may seem impossible to do this. But it can be done.  A hard idea to wrap your mind around is that we all only have 24 hrs a day. Leonardo Da Vinci, Ghandi, every one of us has 24 hrs. You might say "Well but I have 3 kids at home". True! So in your life, you made children your priority. You wanted those kids! So embrace that, and accept that as your mission. Put aside other less important things. We all make choices in life about what is important to us. When we make those choices, we should accept that, be happy with that, and find ways to emphasize our time in those areas. You have to choose to spend the time on things you love - not to divide your time up amongst various things that are "OK". That's what the main lesson is here. Focus on what is most important - don't try to do 80 quadrillion things that are all "OK". It can't work 
 an argument. I have 32 cents in my pocket. If you give me a room I promise you I will pay you back as soon as I can."  And if this powerful scene of a battered and bruised Tina Turner from the hands of Ike Turner, fleeing to a nearby hotel - a star performer known throughout the world - with only change in her pocket, doesn't move you, then you just don't get it.  Angela Bassett won Golden Globe and NAACP Image awards for her portrayal of Tina Turner in the 1993 release that was based on the best-selling autobiography, I, Tina. Laurence Fishburne turns in a fantastic performance as Ike Turner.  The movie follows the life of Anna Mae Bullock from Nutbush, Tennessee to St. Louis - where she meets Ike Turner - and to what appeared to be a charmed life of international music stars. But success came with a harsh price for Tina Turner.  As her popularity grew, Ike Turner became physically and verbally abusive. Fueling this cowardly anger with cocaine, he openly flaunted his affairs while being surrounded by a group of enablers, who said nothing as long as the party never stopped.  Tina Turner finally finds the courage to leave the relationship and rebuild her shattered personal & professional life. The final scene brings even more powerful meaning to the song, What's Love Got To Do With It, which streaked to number one in the Billboard Hot 100 chart on September 1, 1984.  A man like Ike Turner who physically and mentally abuses a woman is a sick bully and coward. In the divorce proceedings, though Tina Turner agreed to sign away any claim to future record royalties and publishing rights to their music, Ike Turner - who played a bizarre victim card - also wanted her stage name, claiming, "That name's got my daddy's blood written all over it."  He was so wrong; it wasn't his daddy's blood written all over it. Anna Mae Bullock got to keep the name that she made even more famous as a solo artist, author and - perhaps, most importantly - as a woman who showed the fortitude to leave an abusive relationship and take control of her life.   
 This is one of my favorite Nora Roberts book. I have read it several times. Luke is a great hero (even if he is a thief) and I just fell in love with him 
 My exposure to early REM had consisted of Eponymous during my highschool/college years. Listened to it a lot. But I never took the initiative to explore early REM further. The rest of my REM collection at the time included Green, AFTP and Monster. Absolutely hated Out of Time and only recently picked it up just to attempt to finish off my collection (still have to get Reckoning (great) and Reveal (sucks)). Got Murmur (amazing) a few years ago, followed by Fables (fantastic).  In the past year I picked up Document and LRP and wish I would have purchased them when I was younger.  Great, basic college-rock.  During my early years Green was my ultimate college album (er, well maybe Nothing's Shocking, Ritual de lo Habitual, Gish, Hoist, ok Green).  It would have been great to get Green's sound but in a more raw form, which is what you get with LRP.  First 2 songs are REM's best rockers from their early years - 'Begin the Begin' is amazing.  Then you have 'Superman' - which I had liked since I was 15 -, 'Fall on Me', 'Flowers of Guatemala'(dares you not to space out)... this disc is just packed with great, great, pure college-rock. Do yourself a favor and pick it up. If you like Green or Document you'll love Life's Rich Pagent 
 Terry Grosz was a conservation officer for the California and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for more than thirty years. His first memoir, Wildlife Wars, covered his early life. For Love Of Wilderness: The Journal Of A U.S. Game Management Agent begins with his move from the state to the federal levels, where his cases were bigger and more complex. Grosz's stories are as infused with his love of wildlife and enjoyment of the great outdoors as they are action- packed and totally engaging. In these memoirs Grosz makes a repeated point that our failure to protect our fragile natural resources is the same as stealing from our children, and our children's children. For Love Of Wilderness is a superbly presented, candid and engaging autobiography that will also have immense appeal to anyone with an interest in wildlife and conservation issues 
 The feeling one gets from Michael V. Gazzo's Hatful of Rain is reminiscent of Arthur Miller's work.  The similarity is in the family tension and drama and of course, the writing style.   Hatful of Rain first appeared on Broadway in 1955 with Ben Gazzara and Shelly Winters.   Hatful of Rain is  included in John Gassner's Best American Plays 1951-57.     The story about two brothers takes place in tenement apartment in New York.  A father visits his son, Korean war vet, Johnny Pope and his pregnant wife Celia.  Father doesn't know that  Johnny is now a morphine junkie, in debt to pushers, heading into a violent world, has lost his job and has an unstable married life.    Father accepts Johnny but doesn't have hope for Polo, a bouncer, and holds a grudge against him because Polo doesn't have the $2500 Father was promised.  Father sees what he wants to see, that Johnny is doing all right, but Polo is not.    Polo lives with Johnny and Celia, and, she loves Polo.  The money, we learn, has gone to Johnny for drugs.  Polo has always stepped up for, and hidden Johnny's life from others.    This is an emotional play, lengthy and interesting from beginning to end.  Following that, a 1957 movie, now on VHS, was made with Anthony Franciosa as the troubled brother Polo.         
 If you can find a copy of this book, grab it!  A new edition is coming out this fall, which is probably even better.  But for now, Time Out B.A. is the go-to book for everything you ever needed to know about the history and current happenings in the magnificent city of Buenos Aires. 
 LISTEN UP all you political Junkies out there in America, There is something rotten in the capital and her name is Madam Hillary.  This book should be required reading for any politcal junkie. It exposes the truth behind the most powerful senator in the nation.  This book will make your blood curdle because this stuff is so true what she is doing. I am not a conservative but when you look at who we have running Kerry or Bush. Bush looks more appealing.  The question will she bide her time and run in 08 assuming that Bush wins or will she accept the VP nomination. Whatever the case maybe, this is a must read and it will tell you just how power hungry she really is. All those PACS and what not. She is a real threat not to be taken lightly. Unless you want to wake up one day and say president elect Clinton again.  R. Emmett Tryyell is doing a service to the public by writing this book it is funny and scary at the same time. So for any political Junkie out their READ IT 
 Another Dirk Pitt novel that entertains with lively dialogue and white knuckled adventure.  Cussler does a good job of making each book stand alone so readers can pick up anywhere and not have to search for previous stories to catch up.  
 Fowden does a good job of tracing the orgins of Hermitist to Ancient Egypt. He's able to show and explain the mixing of the cultures of Ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome that led to influences being passed down and around 
 Artwork offers impressive, unusual perspectives which surprise the eye.   
 I Purchased the DEI Viper 791vx security system. I did have it Professionally installed into my 94 Ford Mustang Convertible. I have had the Viper 791vx for one year and three months. First of all if you decide to purchase the Viper 791vx make sure you choose the right professional installer and also figure out if it's in your best interest financially before you purchase the security system. Now what I mean about the right installer is some companies do a better job with installing certain products than others. So if you get a certified installer like they all say they are. With a product that's a bit technical, most (now I'm not saying all) would have a difficult time trying to figure out how to install your product. By messing around with your wiring and other components in your car. You wouldn't know what could get shorted out, crimped, unhooked or damaged in some way.   I do know that installing the Viper 791vx security system is a big job. If you happen to purchase the security system online to get the lower price you may want to revaluate your decision. Because even if you happen to find a qualified installer for DEI products that's a certified retailer for DEI products or just any installer. You have to pay for the install that ranges from about $150.00 to $200.00 for install you get no warrantee. I mean NO WARRANTEE. This also applies to the $150.00 to $200.00 instillation service fee that you just paid to have it installed. They won't even certify their own install. So if you by chance had some problems with your security system. You have no clue if it's the install they did or the security system its self. So you would have to pay the installer to diagnose your security system. This also applies when you take it to a qualified DEI installer. I have personally only had two problems with my system since I purchased it but the warrantee coved it. But this is only two of the problems I had with my security system unit. All the other eight times that I had to take it back to the qualified DEI installer to fix my security system. It always turned out to be an installer error. The main problem I had was the antenna. Sometimes the Viper 791vx wouldn't read the remote. The Viper 2-way remote would just keep beeping telling me that it's not able to talk to the brain of the 791vx Also in some cases it would do what you wanted but the remote is not showing any of the commands that you did. It would just keep beeping because it was sending the signal to the brain of the 791vx but not receiving the signal back to the 2-way remote model 479v. I found that the wiring of the antenna or a loose or bad connection could have caused this from the connection to the antenna over a period of about one month or two.  Also the main problem is the 2-way remotes these remotes require some extra attention. Just think of the 2-way remote (479v) is your first-born. The Viper 479v LCD 2-way remote is very sensitive but they don't really tell you that when you're purchasing it. The merchant just gave me examples like if you loose your remote or jump into the pool with your remote exc. At that time the replacement remotes where only about $80.00 and they had a lot in stock. For some reason the cost went to $150.00 to $180.00 WOW! This 2 WAY remote let's me know that commands I have sent have been received. It alleviates a lot of guesswork. At a glance, I know if my doors are locked/unlocked, if the car is running (remote start) or not. If the alarm is triggered, it even shows me the zone that was triggered when the alarm was tripped (it actually shows which door/window has been opened/broken, or if the car was hit). But to have it double in price why?    For those of you who don't need the 2-way function, its important to know that you can program one-way remotes (much less expensive) to work with the alarm brain too. I strongly suggest having extra remotes for every alarm. You should also know to locate your valet button in case you have to bypass the alarm without a (working) remote. The model number is 472. It totally over priced for what it does and that's just the basic functions. The 472 remote doesn't page you back telling you if the alarm is going off. But the price range is $90.00 for the 472 remote.    I too have found customer service to be a joke at DEI, they are no help at all and I had to solve the problem on my own. The only reason I found out about the 472 remote was from searching on Amazon. DEI and the merchant didn't even offer or suggest it for me as an option. I told them I needed my alarm in anyway to work A.S.A.P. But the alarm itself is great!   I Hope this help you out? 
 this film is very real as it deals with a Prisoner played by Hill Harper who is dying from Aids. Harper is a Very  Good Actor. Billy Dee Wlliams does a very Good Job playing Harper's Father in the film. Phylicia Rashad does a strong job as well. very Good Writing, Directing, Pacing&overall chemistry on a film that is a must see 
 Golding is a deeply symbolic novelist who relies, especially in this novel and in The Inheritors (1955), on ideas from the viewpoint of evolutionary biology and anthropology.  The central symbol of The Lord of the Flies is that of a pig's head upon a stick stuck in the ground, a totem in the making perhaps, but seen by Golding as Beelzebub, the "lord of the flies," the devil, a head of rotting flesh enveloped by flies.  The central idea is that without civilization we will degenerate into predatory animals ruled by superstition, the will to power, and the primordial need to survive.  When Piggy's glasses, which symbolize the tools and knowledge of our culture are broken, it signals the degeneration, the return to the wild in which, as Thomas Hobbes has it, there are "No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."  That a group of English school boys could degenerate so quickly after crash-landing on a deserted island may be seen as a bit fanciful, or more exactly, as the artifice of the artist; nonetheless, the premise of this extraordinary work may well serve as a cautionary note for our times.  Should we, through nuclear warfare, a runaway greenhouse effect, sectarian violence on a global scale, or through the exhaustion of the fossil fuels that power our civilization, regress to the state of savages, we have this warning.  Instead of the noble savage, instead of a return to the Garden of Eden, instead of the Swiss Family Robinson or Robinson Crusoe, Golding takes us step by step from the world of the boy's school to life and death power struggles and a fascination with savagery to the beginnings of tribal warfare.  As in The Inheritors, Golding sees not the good in humans, but the viciousness.  In The Inheritors we homo sapiens murdered the gentle Neanderthal, here we children become gangsters of the island, on our way to becoming tribal chieftains as murderous and vengeful as the God of the Old Testament.  I understand that Golding wrote the novel in part to answer the pollyannaish naivete of R.M. Ballantyne's The Coral Island (1857), which I haven't read.  Clearly cruelty is one of Golding's main themes.  Left to their own devices and without the restraint of civilization's justice, humans will be cruel sometimes just to be cruel and sometimes as a means of gaining power.  The boys Ralph and Piggy naively try to set up a democratic sort of government, but are defeated by the brutality of Jack and his will to savagery.  The loss of innocence that the boys experience is seen as not the loss of something they intrinsically had, but of something superimposed upon them by civilization.  In reality, Golding is saying, there is no innocence in children, that is only a fairy tale idea to which we romantically subscribe.  This is one of those novels that has found its way onto the high school or even the middle school curriculum because it is easy to read and because it is easy for young people to relate to.  But the strength of this novel lies not only in its theme and readability but in the fine characterizations of the individual boys.  As in all great works of literature, it is the combination of character and story that compels us to turn the pages, and invites our admiration.  It should be noted that Golding deliberately left out one of the central drives of humans, probably because he did not want to muddy up his theme of savagery, or perhaps because he felt the task too great or perhaps because he didn't find the task palatable.  I am referring to the lack of sexuality in the novel.  Not only are there no girls on the island, but the boys do not, at least overtly, involve themselves in sex.  We can see that Golding's artistry anticipated this criticism since it can be argued that the boys in this situation and at their tender age are not yet ready to express themselves sexually.  I wonder if postmodern psychology would agree.  Certainly Freud would not.  Bottom line: a great read, a terrific adventure, but not a book in my opinion that should be read by preteens, in other words, you need to be older than the characters in the book in order to read the book without fear of nightmares 
 Very fun and funny; look out for the monkey scene at the beginning and the wedding scene at the end - I almost hyperventilated 
 This book was an amazing account of the Spanish in North America.  Many of  the themes that occur during this time period occur in almost every time  period and place.  Dealing with religious intolerence, slavery, econmoy,  unification, and the influence of all people on one another this book  captures everything.  Themes this book expresses about this time period are  even more evident in today's information age as more people from different  backgrounds and heritages come together on the internet.  This was a good  book to read, and made it easy to see the flaws and benefits of the past  showing what not to, and what to, repeat 
 This book will take you to a place that most people do not want to venture into whether a woman or a man and not just married women or men. It will allow you to understand to some degree how your deepest desires when acted upon no matter how much pleasure and peace they give can still cause more pain than you can ever imagine to the ones you love even though you consider it separate from your every day life. This story was well written and will have you questioning who is right and who is wrong in this situation. The question is 'How much are you willing to lose to gain what your body craves after years of denial'? Will it be worth it in the end?  This is another great book written by Martin Brant and more than worth the read. You won't be able to put it down until you read the last page. A very good read for both sexes 
 After 20 years of wonderful music I can say they still have what it takes to be Entertainers of the Year in my book 
 Theodore Rex, Edmund Morris' conclusion to his two-part biography of Theodore Roosevelt, excellently concludes the very difficult task of profiling one of America's most ambitious, original, and creative presidents. Morris focuses his second book on Roosevelt's two terms as President of the United States, as well as his failed third-party run in 1912 with the signpost Bull Moose Party and ultimately Roosevelt's death in 1919.  At times it seems that Morris is more in love with his own words than the subject matter, and some stretches appear to be written as Morris-applauding-Morris instead of the critical analysis one would come to expect from such a comprehensive study of Roosevelt's time in office. Despite this mild hint of ego, however, Morris writes a supremely readable story that sheds light on some of Roosevelt's lesser-known achievements and political failings. Impressively, Morris manages to temper his obvious appreciation of Roosevelt, unlike his foray into first-third person writing in Dutch, the biography of President Ronald Reagan.  The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt and Theodore Rex ought to be high on the list of any Roosevelt enthusiast or reader interested in American political and cultural history at the turn of the century. The effect Roosevelt had on what would be called "The American Century" can hardly be overstated, and Morris does an admirable job in revealing to the reader just what an exceptional man Theodore Roosevelt was 
 If you have only 10 Country CDs, this should be one of them.  Alan Jackson is one of the best around today, and this CD is a collection of many of his most engaging songs.  They're also great for dancing 
 I wanted it for my collection, however you can sift through all the youtube stuff and end up with the same video for free if you want to do the work 
 This is an excellent publication!!  I read it right along with my Bible.  It offers expressions that compells one to think very deeply about how to use the word of God more fully in one's own personal life.  My sister, Gail introduced me to this book.  I'm forever grateful! 
 Despite his grotesque and faked stage mannerisms, Lang Lang's performance are poetic and thoughtful.  Such is the case with his Abegg variations as well as his somewhat mannered yet full bodied Chopin Nocturne.  As for the Liszt, Lang Lang concerns himself with the episodic details rather than the structural whole (which is fine depending on one's tastes).  Other pianists may have better interpretations (Arrau, Richter), but Lang Lang is growing as an individual artist.   By the way, for those who enjoy more refined stage choreography, try Yundi Li's live International Chopin competition DVD.  On another side note, a reviewer's assertion that Lang Lang's popularity is the result of the chinese government is totally inaccurate and biased.  He or she fails to take into account that AMERICA is the one marketing Lang Lang not CHINA.  
 In this lucid and engaging book, Mr. Ball illuminates the amazing  collaborative process that  theatre is.  His clear vision of the director's  role: the person who must unleash and nourish the creative energy of his  cast and crew.  Anyone interested in the creative process or bringing out  creativity in others will find it hard to put this book down 
 This glib and engaging autobiography is easy to like, hard to put down, funny and sweet, and I wished for more. Palac's lucid recitation of the facts of her birth, happy midwestern childhood, and undergraduate years seem as though she's told them many, many times before. But she's witty and cute and very bright - also adventurous and "fierce" (her term). She's kind, too. But being brought up Catholic - and the grim-to-hilarious results - just isn't enough to explain her unusual and interesting career. The best - because the most heartfelt, detailed, and surprising - chapter is on an explicitly sexual, consensual, and obsessional relationship with a man, "Stephen," whom she met online. She fell in love with him. He was reluctant to meet her, but Palac insisted, and they eventually did meet, and continued their love affair. (She's a romantic, too.) Palac is a spirited, smart, and magnetic person; I just wish she'd slowed down and gone a bit deeper inside herself (no pun intended) in order to write her autobiography, because she's well worth the time 
 Forget Stephan Wolfram's book "Mathematica"  -- Ruskeepaa's Mathematica Navigator is the indispensible book on your desk next to the computer when using Mathematica 
 First of all, this book, even if stretched, is great reading!  Second, the guy Brent who gave the book one star needs to get his facts straight.  In the movie "Gimme Shelter", the guy "scowling so prettily when one of the Maysles sticks a light meter in his face" while in the hotel room with the Mick and Keith listening to "Brown Sugar" is not Tony Sanchez.  It's another author by the the name of Stanley Booth who wrote the book "The True Adventures of the Rolling Stones" while covering the Stones' '69 tour.  Try reading it 
 This book is an inspiration.  Ron Wolfson presents excellent ideas to change the synagogue (or church) to become a more welcoming, engaging and spiritually uplifting place of worship.  Anyone who cares about their religious community can learn from this 
 My 3 1/2 year old got this for Christmas to use in his toy kitchen. It's another well thought out item from Melissa and Doug. We love wooden kitchen toys and this was a great addition. His favorite part was the butter "pats" that have velcro and can be cut off of the "stick" of butter and put on the "toast". We're getting a lot of "soups" with butter in them 
 I picked this up despite my negative memories of Graham Greene from high school & college reading, and I can honestly say that I enjoyed this book.  Although it's not the type of book that you can't put down, it always leaves you glad you picked it up.    The story of boring Henry and his "eccentric" Aunt Augusta is entertaining and might get you thinking about what a successful life is and how to best spend that journey.  All the same, it's a light-hearted novel and not at all suffocating or depressing  in the way it teaches the "lesson."  I checked it out of the library for the first read, but plan to purchase a copy for my next long bus/train/car ride 
 Buy everything you can find that was written by H. L Mencken, this collection is no exception. Mencken was one of the most influential and popular men of letters in America. He covered the Scopes Monkey Trial as a reporter for the Baltimore Sun, and was editor of two literary magazines: Smart Set and the American Mercury. His popularity waned for a variety of reasons. While he teased presidents Harding, Coolidge and Hoover, he gave no quarter when it came to FDR, referring to him "Dr. Roosevelt" and "Roosevelt minor." He had little use for the New Deal. "The New Deal began, like the Salvation Army, by promising to save humanity. It ended, again like the Salvation Army, by running flop-houses and disturbing the peace."  This and his pro-German attitudes didn't go over too well in the depression and war years. But over the last twenty or thirty years Mencken has enjoyed a resurgence or interest and popularity. As a journalist, a wit and a social critic he has no peer today 
 As all John Wayne (Cole Thornton) movies I enjoyed watching this time and time again.  Also, having Robert Mitchum (Sherrif JP Harrah) in this movie added a new twist of actors that co-starred with John.  Robert is a good actor and I enjoy his movies as well.  Other actors that added a twist to the movie were James Caan (Mississippi), Aruther Hunnicutt (Bull) and Christopher George (Nelson McLeod).  I wish there were more authentic westerns and spagetti westerns as there used to be.  Tom Selleck in "Quigly Down Under" is another good one. 
 This book was a fantastic read-aloud book for my second-grader.  We both thoroughly enjoyed it.  I know he would never had made it through the story (because of the difficult language) if he had read it himself.  It was a little tough getting into the plot, but once in, it was hard to put down 
 Having spent several years as a submissive, I have read them all, A through Z.  This by far is one of the better ones out there and certainly hits the nail on the head.  Women will live this one.  Not being a man, I cannot speak for them, but it certainly would not hurt them to give it a try. 
 "Both Ends of the Night" is one of the best of the Sharon McCone novels.  McCone is hired by Matty Wildress, who was McCone's flight  instructor when Sharon got her pilot's license, to find her lover, John  Seabrook, who had disappeared.  Matty does aerobatics and had one final  meet for the year.  Before that she gets a letter from John telling her not  to fly in the last meet. He puts $70,000 into Matty's account and asks her  to take his son, Zach, and flee California.  Matty choses to fly anyway,  and dies in a crash while performing a simple move for her.  Since Matty is  McCone's friend, McCone continues her investigation. because the murder of  Matty and John Seabrook's disappearance, seem to be conected. McCone's  lover, Hy Ripinsky, who is usually a minor character, plays a major role  helping Sharon to find Matty's killer because of his friendship with Matty  from years back.  They uncover corporate corruption, government witness  programs, and people who will stop at nothing to fulfill their dreams.   This novel is very well written.  The characters are well-drawn and Muller  is one of the best at putting the reader there.  I had shivers when she and  Hy were in sub-zero weather in Minnesota.  An excellent novel 
 Most people think that Stephen King just writes stories about monsters and gore, but if any of them actually read all of his books they would see that his work is so much more.  Different Seasons is a perfect example of this.  It is a book with four novellas in it and each one has it's merits. The first and third are Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption and The Body, both which have been praised not only for the novellas themselves but for the films based on them.  Both of these stories are interesting, compelling and a joy to read.  In these the proof that King is a master story teller is evident.  His ability to write characters that jump off the page is inspiring.  The second story Apt Pupil was a surprise for me, in that I enjoyed it so much. The story is about a young boy Todd, obsessed with the holocaust who blackmails a German man who worked at the camps and illegally hid and came to the US.  The great thing about the book is that you truly can't say who is the actual monster, or for that matter the worse of the two, the man or the boy. Excellent reading! The fourth story The Breathing Method is perhaps the weakest of the 4.  It's pretty straight forward, about old men who have a club and they sit around and tell stories, usually of disturbing or weird nature. Don't get me wrong it has its moments, creepy ones at that but compared to the other 3 stories which are fantastic and hard to follow The Breathing Method is so-so. Overall you should read this book, all of the stories are fast paced and interesting. A must read, even if you're not a fan of horror or King. Give it a try 
 Why did I wait so long? After months of leap pad books and their cartridges floating all over my son's bedroom floor ~ finally they all have a home. This handy little storage system will hold most children's leap pad library of books and cartridges. It certainly will hold enough to keep your child happy for quite a while. This is perfect to drag along on an adventure. The price is what kept me from buying the storage container when I bought the system. Silly ~ since I have so much more invested in the system and its books. I finally took the plunge and couldn't be happier. Now when we dash off for an adventure ~ everything is ready to go. It is also great as a tool to encourage your child to put everything away when they are done playing with it 
 Not that I am or ever have been a manager of SDEs... but this book seems to hit the nail on the head in regards to my personal observations.  Mr. Brooks claims that to be a software developer, one must be an eternal optimist: This will be the last bug!  Just one more test cycle, and we'll reach perfection!  Mr. Brooks' way of capturing the essence of what it means to build software resonates with me, and I think it will with you as well 
 this is a good follow up to the collection of hits cd. and she has such a great sound to this album, and her voice is AMAZING, if you haven't heard a song or album by her before, anyone of these songs could catch your attention... she opens brilliantly with "there goes my baby", and continues with the slow-pased "never let you go again".  the tittle song "Where your road leads" is a brilliant duet with Garth Brooks. all in all this is one good cd. with a string of great songs.. 
 Well, I bought this CD because my son, Neil Harrison, loves Marc Anthony & Tina Arena's song "I want to spend my lifetime loving you", which is played at the end of the movie. He heard the song for the first time when he was around two months old, and I noticed he loved it, so I played the end of the movie over and over and over until he went to sleep. I figured it was easier to buy the CD and play it for him at bedtime, so that's what we did, I sing it to him along with the CD and he goes to sleep peacefully.  I think that if my baby liked it, it has to get a great review!  I loved all the other songs too, it's a great CD 
 I won't spoil the ending, but some many other reviewers didn't like the twist.  However, the reader who needs to have everything wrapped up and be 100% happy should read Runaway Jury.  However, like The Firm (another great book) that ends with the characters on the run and in trouble, this book has a very realistic ending that you didn't expect.  This was my favorite Grisham book, followed by The Firm, Runaway Jury, and Pelican Brief.  I found the Broker to be too much of an Italian lesson, the Brethern simplistic, and The Street Lawyer was a giant sermon about helping homeless people - with very little story holding it together.  If you like the Firm you will like The Partner 
 I am 14 and this is one of my favorite books. It's one of the those books that I won't forget anytime soon. It is such a strong book that makes you think about the important things. Even though it is a little sad the style of writing makes it humerous. It's really good and I highly recomend it 
 What I love the most about this 3 disk set is volume III. That disc alone is what made buying this worth it.  To start it off, you have "My little empty boat".  I fell in love with this song the first time I heard it.  I wonder why he never put that on of his regular albums.  It may be one of his best.  The rest of the disc reflects a part of his life that is more personal. It's calm. I haven't liked his last albums that much, but when I heard this, I was like what the f---.  Why was he waiting so long to put this stuff out.  Volume III is mature.  And I don't  mean there is sex and violence in it.  It's sophisticated 
 I do not know if I have too much to add to the outstanding reviews of this book on 'Amazon'. by Peter Reeve and B. Mirsky. However my thought is about the mythic element of the story, the creation of the type of the American hero, strong and silent, and of the 'noble savage.' What most effected me was the story of the noble savage, of Uncas, of the 'Last of the Mohicans' of the individual's dying meaning the dying of a people . In one sense this perhaps symbolizes the triumph of 'civilization'. But in another it suggests a great crime and loss.  Cooper as Mark Twain perhaps too hilariously taught us writes awkwardly. But he also has a kind of strength of invention, a freshness of beginning. And that perhaps draws readers to these works in spite of their stylistic and literary defects.   
 the book is a great source guide for the history of the television series, week by week credits to everyone involved. a fantastic book 
 This is possibly the most addictive Abstract Algebra book ever. Filled with a wonderful selection of problems, Gallian discusses many aspects of groups and rings in a way that is enjoyable to study. The love of mathematics that is shown in this book is reflected by how Gallian eloquently weaves principles of group and ring theory with beautifully selected INTRUIGING problems. I enjoyed this book more than any other math text I have had 
 Best ode to New Orleans I've heard so far. I miss it. we all miss it. especilally those who disappeared with it. There is a lot to this record. Listen and G. D. keep it up  S 
 The Sabbath is an awesome book to read for both Jews and Christians alike. Heschel's discussion of time, space and posessions is inspiring, and transforming. As a Christian, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and found it to be a very enlightening description of Jewish heritage. It challenged me to think about what time I observe with God, and for what reasons; what are my priorities; and how effective am I in living out my faith. 
 I have epilepsy from a head injury ten years ago. I have tried ten different medications as well as the Vagus Nerve Stimulator.  Nothing seems to help.  My doctor recently referred me to an Epilepsy Center.  Knowing this is the first step toward brain surgery, I picked up this book to better understand those who may treat me.    I appreciate Ms. Firlik for sharing her world with those of us stuck in the treatment spiral.  I was ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED by the thought of brain surgery.  I'm now at ease, almost excited to be honest, that this next step may be available to me.    Her book is more valuable than any doctor saying simply 'it's commonplace now' or giving statistics on the success rates.  She's pushed aside my fear and opened my mind (no pun intended) to a whole new avenue of treatment.    For those of you who had a problem with the book, read it from the patient's perspective.  She has not made this book into a self promoting platform.  I found her to be very honest and open about her shortcomings.  It's about the process of becoming a neurosurgeon and it's told from the student's perspective.  It would read like a textbook if written any other way.    I'm recommending this book to everyone I know.  If you have a problem possibly treatable through brain surgery, read this book.  You'll feel more at ease. 
 Under the sensitive direction of James Levine, Placido Domingo plays Don Carlo, heir to the Spanish throne, as close to the edge of madness. I think this interpretation works much better than playing him as Schiller's romantic hero--plus it's more accurate, since the historical Don Carlo was reputedly insane.  Levine's production is a majestic, somber interpretation of Verdi at his most Spanish, and is visually gorgeous.     This 1983 Metropolitan Opera "Don Carlo" is also one of the best cast (except for Louis Quilico as Rodrigo), and most haunting of all my Met Verdi DVDs.  Mirella Freni has been criticized as not having a 'big enough' voice for the role of Elisabeth de Valois, but I think she is perfect:  regal, beautiful, sweetly sorrowful.  Her duet with Domingo in the oft-omitted Fountainbleu scene has a tremulous delicacy, made all the more poignant because we know her page is about to show up and tell her that she must marry Phillip II, not Don Carlo with whom she has just fallen in love.  Even though Sam Ramey is my favorite Phillip II, voice-wise (in Ricardo Muti's 1992 La Scala production), Nicolai Ghiaurov is perfect as the ruthless, morbidly Catholic tyrant.  When he first appears on camera, I thought, "My god, that man IS Phillip II."  What an eerie resemblance.  He even sings with a Castillan lisp.  Ghiaurov commands the stage, whether he is bullying his somewhat wimpy son, tormenting his sorrowful queen, or bargaining with the evil Grand Inquisitor (Ferruccio Furlanetto). When he sings his Act IV aria, "Ella giamma m'amo," his introspective interpretation rounds out his character, not as a haughty king, but as a suffering older husband who knows his beautiful young Queen will never love him.  Grace Bumbry is a haughty, calculating, technically gorgeous Princess Eboli, right down to her historically correct eye-patch.  I didn't find her seductive--becoming King Phillip's mistress seemed to be a business transaction for her.  She was a little too cold to really convince me that she had a change of heart about the Queen in the Act IV study scene, but Bumbry absolutely rips the 'Veil Song' in the garden.  I've never heard it sung better. Her aria of repentance, "O don fatale," was the perfect cap to her character, and deserved its long ovation.  What a performance!  Ghiaurov IS the King.  Freni IS the Queen.  Domingo IS Don Carlo.  The only casting mistake was Quilico's blustering, smirking Rodrigo.  I could not understand what Don Carlo or the King ever saw in his character. Plus he sounded strained and tinny, especially in the duets with Domingo.  I understand this was one of Quilico's break-through roles back in the 1960's, but he does not adorn this otherwise marvelous performance. 
 "Be Gentle!" is the perfect book for toddlers learning the intricacies of proper social behavior.  This book is my two year old's favorite because he knows many of the words.  He has heard the phrase  "be gentle" many times since the birth of his little sister, and  this book helps him to truly understand what that means. He also gets  excited because the book uses familiar objects such as a swing, a red  wagon, and a drum in the storyline so he can sympathize with the  characters.  A great book for new, young siblings 
 Yes, it is possible to feel utter disgust for the subject of a movie - even while acknowledging respect for the excellent performance by Tommy Lee Jones in transforming himself into Ty Cobb, a man who has nothing to redeem him but a talent for tossing and batting a ball. It is, after all, a game, folks.   The movie, in general, is well done. No technical complaints, no complaints on any performance by any actor, no complaints about how the life of this man Cobb was portrayed - may the truth be told. "Prince among men," says Cobb of himself. "A great who is misunderstood." Hardly. I have rarely seen a portrayal of a man with so little to redeem him. His only excuse, achingly lame, is that there was an ugly scene in his childhood, adulterous parents gone mad with rage. Okay. Anyone out there without a dysfunction in your childhood, raise your hand! Thought so. Albeit, Cobb's childhood contains some doozies, but as he himself admits: "I was a prick even before my father was murdered." He begs the nature versus nurture debate, but personally, I don't care. Anyone who so defies any accountability for himself throughout his 72 years, eschews all responsibility, gains no compassion from me. He beat his many wives, attempted rape, regularly frequented prostitutes, abused his children, was racist to the bone, purposefully aimed to injure other athletes on the field, exhibited only brutality and rudeness to others, and topped it all off with an incredible arrogance. At least justice reigns: Cobb has not a single friend in the world, knows only hatred, and must deal with his own demons to the very end.   And he is in the baseball Hall of Fame? Why? I struggle to respect the game if it honors such as Cobb, regardless of his stats.   Yes, that's right, that's five stars I gave this movie. Perhaps we at times need to be reminded of what and how not to be, where to draw the line, and perhaps a portrayal such as this might spur some on to think twice about who we honor in our baseball-adoring culture, and why. 
 Norville Hardy (he added the Oliver later in honor of his father) began his film career in 1914 in Jacksonville, Florida where he appeared in literally hundreds of films. He was known as Babe Hardy because of his babyish face (the famous toothbrush moustache would come later). By 1920 he had come to Hollywood as a member of Larry Semon's stock company. In the early 20's Semon was a big comedy star known for his outrageous gags that were carried out on a grand scale. Two of Semon's comedies on this disc THE SHOW and THE SAWMILL (with Hardy as the principal villian) bear this out. In 1925 Ollie was teamed with diminutive comedian Bobby Ray in a clear precursor to the Laurel & Hardy films. In STICK AROUND they even wear derby hats. In 1927 on loan out from Hal Roach, Hardy made the amusing CRAZY TO ACT for Mack Sennett. But it was with Roach that Hardy would find steady employment and eventual screen immortality when he was teamed up with Stan Laurel. That was in late 1927. In 1926 he appeared with Laurel in 45 MINUTES FROM HOLLYWOOD. Both had supporting parts to star Glenn Tryon (who?). 45 is also noteworthy for the last film appearance of silent screen vamp Theda Bara who has a very brief cameo as herself. There are eight shorts total in this collection and it's great to have these examples of early Oliver Hardy as it gives us the chance to see him develop the Ollie character that we know so well. This is part of Kino's second installment in the SLAPSTICK SYMPOSIUM series (Charley Chase and Harold Lloyd are featured once again in the other two offerings). The prints from Lobster Films are very high quality and the piano accompaniment by Eric Le Guen serves them well. Perfect for fans of silent comedy and/or fans of the duo. Others shouldn't have too bad a time of it either 
 The feel of this disc immediately makes itself known to its listener: Brit-Pop stylings with what can only be described as a minimalist Scandinavian-style backbeat.  The vocalist's voice is in top, sweet form, providing a wonderful contrast to the atmospheric thumping going on behind her.  Extremely listenable whether you're by yourself, or need some background for a friendly gathering.  Track #5, with its reference to being behind the wheel of a "Capri", confirms the credibility of this band's continental origins.  Track #10 (I think) is "Erica America", another of the best songs that harkens to the global image of promise that America provides.  This CD has no mistakes, no missteps, and no regrets 
 If you're looking for a quick drawing book you can thumb through on the plane, this isn't it.  However if you want a classical approach to drawing and painting theory, complete with very opinionated prose that teaches you the fundamentals of how drawing and painting should be - get this book.  On a bookshelf filled with quick fixes and 30-second lessons on the go, Speed's drawing text is a welcome change.  You'll read this again and again, gaining more knowledge out of it each time 
 This book is absolutely amazing.  My first experience with these kind of prints was framed hanging on a friend's wall.  I was thoroughly captivated by it.  By this time, the fad of Magic Eye had worn off, but to me it was fresh and exciting.  So I began searching for more.  Low and behold, here it is.  And for a dollar if used!!!  This is an extremely addictive and entertaining type of art that I wish I could a computer program for to create my own.  If you are as fortunate as I am to be able to catch sight of these images, then this book is a must have.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!! 
 THis is an easy read and great instruction manual.  I've only read the first 2 chapters and I'm excited about reading the rest.  I hope to become a teacher who chages lives.  
 If you're looking for a book with all the facts about pregnancy, this is not it. Jenny McCarthy is telling it from her point of view and in a comical way. This is a great book to laugh about pregnancy and the great and not so great parts about it. 
 Mitch Albom captures a moment in time that is more precious than any other. It is that moment when one generation shares what they know with the next. It is a moment of pure generosity - where Morrie has nothing to gain and Mitch has everything to loose.   This refreshing story gives us a vision for what it would be like if we learned to share what we know with others 
 I've always had the sense that the genre of metal music always had a monolithic representative holding down the essence of metal...That if you were asked "what is metal?", you wouldn't have to describe it, you could just as well say "it's Black Sabbath" or "Metallica" or "Slayer" or "Pantera"...well those were the bands you could, at least at one time, say that defined metal.  I think Mastodon carries the banner of those bands for the genre now and does it well.  What is metal?  It's Mastodon.  This record is an excellent introduction to the band.  If you still haven't gotten into this ridiculously good band, here's where you start 
 There are varying differences between men and women and Mr. Gray takes his time in this book to explain what they are. What I got from it was a new perspective, a new way to understanding what needs to be understood--how to interact with the opposite sex. What's most important is to take the time to actually listen without formualing what you're going to say next. I can see why this book is so popular now. Along with this one, I also recommend "Man Magnet. 
 I agree with all the reviewers here on this work. Excellent and insightful. However, Mark Joyner's review was somewhat ironic. If one took this book to a desert island, on whom would one practice the techniques? If you were alone on the island, there would be no one to presuade. Perhaps yourself, or your soccer ball... = 
 This book is all right for a math book.  Every time I forget something in probability, I can go back to this thing and find exactly what I'm looking for.  I guess it could be more rigorous, but I think that would ruin it's understandability.  It could definitely use more examples, but I say that about every book.  I'm sure it contains its share of typos, but I'm so used to seeing typos in math texts I don't give them a second thought.    This book can sure help you with figuring out how to compute odds in poker, so check it out 
 This is one of the best textbooks currently available in Hyrology and Hydraulic Systems.  I will be using this book in my Water Resources Engineering 
 The great strength of this spaciously recorded disc is  "Rainbow Body" by Christopher Theofanidis. It is living proof that new music needn't be ugly but neither should it be disposable.  Like Michael Torke, Theofanidis builds his compositions on classical forms and remains committed to beauty -- which is why most of us listen to music in the first place.  The Barber Symphony is competitive with the best recorded performances, and while the Copland offers nothing new, it provides little that is objectionalble. "Blue Cathedral" is a challenging, imaginative work, too.  One forgets that this "little" label in Cleveland has given the world so much. What it has given is in evidence here. Don't hesitate to buy this intriguing release.  The SACD/Hybrid has a slight edge on sound quality, so the extra cost is recoupable.  If you're considering an SACD upgrade down the line, the few extra dollars will be worth it 
 Ignore the 5 stars and put 6 stars instead! I am still wandering why it took such a long time for me to review this extraordinary gospel. This is one of the most easy to read and follow gospel within the Gnostic gospels,  and indeed amongst many of the gospels. The language is clear and the  gospel is well structured. Pistis is indeed a rare gospel: it tells of the  secret words that you must say for you to reach the highest God and Goddess  (not the God of creation); it informs you of the many gods and goddesses  that exist  and the levels of space they occupy. Mind you, all these is  said by Jesus himself, that is the Gnostic Jesus. Mary Magdala (Jesus'  partner)  is so intelligent  in her questions and answers, in fact Jesus  tells her that her spirit has been purified and therefore at its best (of  course hoping that this is a genuine praise and not based on partner  favouritism). But yes, Mary Magadala, beside the praises from her partner,  is quite outstanding. She even tells Jesus that she is scared of Peter  since St Peter hates the female race! Do not expect anything canonical or  convetional from this gospel. It is a very disturbing gospel, yet very  powerful indeed. It even explains the difficult parables: "5 will be  in a house and 3 will rise against 2 and 2 against 3..." It also  explains the parable of the coin - give to Caesar that which belongs to  him... This is one gospel, which I must concur, I also do not understand  why it has not received much attention as the other gospels 
 I read this book over a year ago and I still get excited everytime I recommend it to someone else.  The author takes the simplest analogy and creates a birdseye view of our lives... As you read it you start to see yourself, your life... then oh my! you start to see how who you are affects and impacts your life and those around you.  A MUST read 
 After the stillbirth of my baby girl, I was completely lost and devastated.  I felt very alone....like nobody understood.  Somebody gave this book to me, and it was as if all of my thoughts and emotions were being validated and described perfectly.  It guided me through the many difficult questions and decisions that needed to be made, and gave me a true sense of hope for my future.  On my daughter's one year anniversary, I purchased several of these books to donate to the hospital to give to other hurting moms who might also suffer such a tragic loss.  I would highly recommend this book...to help with the hurting and begin the healing!! 
 I bought this book after reading Heart of Darkness, Victory, and the Secret Sharer.  I wanted to know more about the man who wrote such haunting fiction.  The beginning of this book gives an excellent and riveting account of Conrad's parents and their political exile. After Conrad's mother dies he remains with his father in severe and isolated conditions. A detailed account of Conrad's early life helped me to understand how he wrote what he did. Quite fascinating. Also, he did visit the Congo and had experiences there that give great insight into Heart of Darkness. Including marking people he met that are models for characters in the story.  Plus he was a seaman, so we learn how he could write realistically on this subject. And we learn about Conrad's psyche, his strengths and weaknesses. I loved learning about his life, but this bio also goes into some detail about all of Conrad's novels. If you haven't read them you may become lost. If you  have read all his works this bio will definitely increase your appreciation and add to your understanding of this great writer 
 Not only is this book full of recipes for wild plant dishes, but it includes wild animals as well. I like his attitude towards the things that many people won't touch - I mean this dude ate a bobcat and had a buddy there eating it with him. Where do you find these kind of people? I don't know anyone who would eat bobcat unless money was involved. 
 Bill Buford does go analytical about half way into the book, this is a good, make that a good enough book, 4 stars imho but not a great book and I would take a few things he says with a grain of salt; so in other words, I don't always believe what Bill says but it may be so. It is a candidate for one of those books that spurs on reading more books on the topic to see, "what in the world is going on here" and truly, when other reviewers mention other books to read, that is helpful.   The final chapter concerns England's 1990 World Cup campaign and my gosh, I still can watch the footage of the so-called hooliganism leading up to the Holland-England game covered in the book on older videos. And then, compare the newsreports such as tear gas brown clouds to his stories.  I cna not help but add, I like the author, find much of the behaviour abhorrent and shameful. Thank goodness the times have changed some; he gives grand explanations of the terraces and how pretty much they were locked into these to see games.  Howevere, an H2G2 BBC report on the web has an interesting take on problems starting to begin in 1984 at a Liverpool/AS Roma game. The whole history is tragic; but I'm not sure Buford includes details about this. In some ways, I wonder if the book is not anti-British; but of course, hooliganism was certainly a scourge in the UK for a number of years.  Better yet, this book is a downer; Neal Bascomb has written the perfect mile about when the 4 minute mile barrier was broken by a true amatuer athlete Roger Bannister or watch Chariots of Fire. These, among other examples, very much exemplify a fine sporting culture in England. This book has merit but is a bit dazed and confused. 
 The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, although it has a confusing and long title is one of the best books I've ever read. The plot is simple: Four desperate men hijack a subway train and hold sixteen people hostage for $1  million. If they do not have their money by the designated time they will  beging to kill hostages. This book reads fast with short sections that  describe the thoughts and actions of individual characters. The highly  detailed novel points out the flaws of the individuals hijacking the train,  and how this is a very desperate but well planned attempt to get money.  Tension builds as the hijackers have quarrels amongst themselves, and with  the passengers. One may ask, How do they expect to get off of a subway  train and get away? Well they do, at least some of them. The ending is kind  of a letdown since I found myself cheering the hijackers on in a way, but  it still fits the book and the character very nicely. If you are looking  for a good hostage/terrorist story, this is the best of the bunc 
 The minotaur rebels, flush from a great victory over their empire, are forced to turn to the traditional minotaur god to protect them from disease as the god of decay strikes back. But one victory over a legion far from the empire's center, does not make for a successful revolt. When attempts to negotiate with the one honorable member of the enemy empire, Maritia, fail, the nephew of the murdered ex-emperor, Faros, realizes he must strike directly into the heart of the empire--to eliminate the evil temple and control the capitol.   Faros's efforts are helped by the minotaur Queen's decision to centralize all power and goods distribution with the temple. Her fears and religion compell her to create new enemies--out of minotaurs who would be loyal. Still, the sacrifices she makes for her god give her, and her favored son, incredible power--power that Faros seems unlikely to be able to stand against.   Meanwhile, Golgren, leader of the ogre clan, is finally repelled by the Queen's bizarre decisionmaking and breaks his alliance with the minotaurs.   The moral ambivalence that lent interest to the earlier books in this series is now gone as the clash between rebel and empire also becomes a clash between good and evil, and a battle between the gods themselves. Still, author Richard A. Knaak's fast-paced writing keeps the story moving forward, engaging the reader's interest in Faros's battles with himself, with his god, and with the forces of the empire. Golgren plays only a minor role in the story, but he is the most interesting character, ambitious, willing to do whatever it takes to pursue his ambition, but not at all unsympathetic. I'm sure we'll see more of him in future stories of minotaur and ogre.   If you read the earlier novels in this series, you'll definitely want to pick up EMPIRE to see how Knaak brings the forces of rebellion and empire together in a great clash at the capital city's walls. Readers who haven't yet read the earlier stories will probably want to pick those up as doing so will give the reader an appreciation of why this battle matters 
 excellent book for younger children.illustrations are done very professionally and with great energy 
 Juvie Almost fell off the map when he left cashmoney and i even like the fact that he left cashmoney, but all Juvie needs is Mannie Fresh beats and he will be successful in what ever he does. As for the Album "Instant Classic" In my life, Throw up a U, slow motion, and to hoes are for everbody... this is one Juvies greatest albums. I garentee it, a platinium record says it for itself... 
 I'm a big fan of Nora Roberts and I've read some truly great books with her name plastered across the front. Then again, I've read some "not-so-good" novels too. But overall, she writes romance like no one else can. BLACK ROSE was probably one of the best novels with NR's name on the cover that I've read in a while. This is a the 2nd of a trilogy for story line and all I like reading now is Red Lily, which I'll be getting soon. I love a good romance story, but I hate trashy sex scenes. And this book has some of the tenderest and sweetest sex scenes that there is. That's probably another reason for the five-stars. But really, this book flows well with great characters and the paranormal worked in just beautifully. No need to go into what this one is about because there's been too many reviews posted. Just take my word for it. This one is a keeper 
 Microsoft says "the greatest benefit in SQL Server performance can be gained from the general areas of logical database design, index design, query design..." This book will go a long way in helping you improve those areas. I got the APRESS second edition and have not had the problems others seem to have had getting code or having chapters missing. Most of the people in my team are developers rather than hard core DBAs and I am going to get each one of them a copy of this book. I find it well written and easy to understand. I especially like the little nuggets scattered throughout such as why you should execute a stored procedures in the correct case on a case-insensitive SQL Server. Screen prints, flow charts, and illustrations throughout enhance the clarity of the author's text. I am very satisfied with this book 
 I have been enjoying drinking Senseo coffee for a few years now, and having recently tried their new flovor Vienna Hazelnut Waltz, I have a newfound favorite. It is absolutely delicous and uniquely Senseo coffee. I deffinately recommend trying this product 
 It is an excellent book. The author takes enough time to explain in a very simple manner how to adjust data. Great reference 
 This is easily the best single book introduction to libertarian thought.  It is better in this regard than the Boaz book in that it is shorter and more personal/philosophical (although the Boaz book is more rigorously argued). Murray gives general principles first and then goes on to make concrete suggestions for improving and limiting the government.  At a time when "big government conservatives" are running (and ruining) the country, this sets out a coherent alternative for all those who still believe in the Enlightenment principles of individual freedom and personal responsibility 
 Good, basic product free of the stink that some of us don't want 
 I've admired Leah Ingram's other books on wedding-related topics (she's a recognized expert in this area--and I've given several of her other books as gifts to soon-to-be brides!) so when it came time to plan MY wedding, I couldn't resist buying this book. I wasn't disappointed--it's chock full of useful tips that were relevant even if you're planning a wedding overseas. I recommend it highly--don't let the posts from the previous poster dissuade you. This author really knows her stuff 
 I am quite pleased with this little TV. It works as expected and I especially like the "monitor" capability for viewing output from other video cameras. The portability is a real plus 
 Shipping on time, book in excelent conditions, would buy from this seller again 
 On the surface this seems to be a simple story, but once you get into the book you realize this is a case where it is the journey itself that matters most. The main character, Billy, narrates the book in his own voice. At first the conversational style might throw you off a bit -- there are some run-on sentences and odd punctuation, and Billy often addresses you, the reader, directly. Once you settle in for a few pages, though, Billy's words are easier to follow and the occasional odd rhythms only add to his charm. There is plenty of humor and drama, and some the best-written dialog I've encountered. There are some sexy scenes, too, and Billy's enthusiasm for these (well, at least in the ones with the boys!) comes across quite vividly as well.    What also impresses me is how John Fox uses the literary device of the unreliable narrator as a way of depicting Billy's transformation over the course of the book. Billy at first tells a few tall tales about his sexual exploits with girls. We don't know he's misleading us at the time, of course, since like all teenaged boys he is quite skilled at boasting. It is only as he proceeds further into his story -- presumably starting to trust that you, the reader, are going to stay with him despite all the very personal details that he's revealed so far -- that Billy finally starts to own up to what is untrue. One by one he sheepishly admits his lies, until eventually he reaches a point where he promises that he will stop lying completely. On the part of the reader it results in a strange sensation, as if a character in a book is somehow interacting with you, even benefitting from the fact that you have proven so loyal and unjudgmental. Since the matter at hand is that of sexual orientation, it is a technique that carries deep resonance. Essentially, the reader becomes much like a friend who is helping Billy to accept who he is. I can't recall any other book that manages to accomplish this in the same way. I imagine also that a confused youth who is struggling with the same issues as Billy would experience this stylistic device with an added degree of intensity.    This novel was originally published about 20 years ago. Even at that time the setting of the story was in the past, during the Kennedy-McCarthy Presidential Primary campaign, so it is no less pertinent a book today than it was when it first appeared. Quibbles about its setting being out of date are therefore entirely beside the point. (Part of me does wonder, though, if the author chose that particular era to avoid having to deal with the spectre of AIDS, which at the time of the book's first publication had become so much a part of gay literature.) This book is primarily about transformation and self-acceptance -- timeless literary themes -- and succeeds tremendously on that count.     The ending of the story is somewhat jarring but does serve as a reminder that gay youth hesitate to come out for many reasons, amongst them family pressures, career aspirations, and fear of bodily harm. It takes courage to step forward and proclaim who you are, whether you live in today's world or Billy's. Still, despite the air of sadness that permeates the final pages, there is also a sense of hope for Billy and the friend who is with him at the end. The continued journey may not be as easy but you feel that they will have one another.    
 The first couplet of the first song begins "You've got a smile so bright, you know you could've been a candle./ I'm holding you so tight, you know you could've been a handle."  Anyone who has heard of the Temptations knows those lines from their classic "The Way You Do the Things You Do." It is crisply sung, almost doo-wop. It never loses its poise or falls into cliche.  Most of these songs were hits. If the titles don't jar your memory, listen to the samples. Expect to know at least 10 of these.  A couple weak links are present in "Treat Her Like a Lady" and "Error of Our Ways." In these two songs, there's no funk, no soul, and no depth. Both are acceptable, as pop R&B, but are musically pallid when compared to "Papa Was a Rolling Stone" and "Ball of Confusion."   The liner notes provide a puffy history, and credits song-by-song. That's not why this is worth buying. It is the sheer cool class and sway of the Temptations greatest hits. A couple songs might be left off, but most are here.  I fully recommend "The Ultimate Collection" by the Temptations.  Anthony Trendl editor, HungarianBookstore.co 
 Carpenter Dan Lambert is having a tough haul. He's having trouble finding a job after returning from Vietnam, he attacked his son in a terrible flashback episode leading to divorce, and he has creditors on his back. Yet despite losing his cool at a bank meeting regarding the repossession of his truck(his livlihood)and attacking and sccidentily killing a bank employee he remains a sympathetic character. The reader can feel his desperation as he heads south with two colourful bounty hunters, one a "freak", and the other an Elvis impersontor on his tail.  That has always been one of McCammon's strengths the, the portrayal on paper of fictional characters that are believable to the nth degree, and that can touch the reader's hearts and minds. There are no heroes or villians in this slight departure from some of McCammon's well-known works, but rather a collection of anti-heroes colourfully brought to life to drive a powerful narrative.  What a clever novel. Without wanting to include too many spoilers in this review I may say it should be no surprise the title is in fact a phrase with double meaning.   This story is atypical as pointed out above of some of McCammon's works, he is known for sharing a genre with Koontz and King after all but this is no horror story, rather a moving thriller that plucks all the heartstrings of a reader. Hopefully this review does not make this tome sound wishy washy as it is far from that, rather the author's storytelling prowess are at their peak telling a tale about a disenfranchised Vietnam vet, that I would argue was even more powerful than King's Hearts in Atlantis. This book would in fact get five stars, but of course it was not PERFECT, there were some issues I shared with fellow reviewers about the ending that did not diminish however the overall impact of the novel 
 I do not doubt that the world is round, that it turns once a day, and a pendulum at the North or South Pole which was free to continue its motion back and forth in the same plane would seem to return to its original orientation after twenty-four hours.  The strange thing is that in Paris, at latitude 48 degrees, 51 minutes North, the down direction of the pendulum does not line up with the axis of the Earth's rotation, so *it*turns*out*that* it would take considerably longer, about 31 hours and 52 minutes, to get back to the original swing direction, according to PENDULUM LEON FOUCAULT AND THE TRIUMPH OF SCIENCE by Amir D. Aczel.  The two mathematical proofs shown in the Appendix, Proofs of Foucault's Sine Law on pages 241-245, show first the vector additions that break down components of a rotation vector into the horizontal and vertical directions from the point of view of the axis of the Earth's rotation, which would expect the pendulum to go swinging off into space if the Earth did not keep attracting it off course as the world turns.  The second proof has more mathematics and assumes the change depends on the idea that the north part of Paris is rotating slower than the south part, which must travel farther to complete its rotation each day, but we know this rotation, which is called omega, and the proof ends with "because omega = 2(pi)/24 hours, since the Earth rotates a full circle in twenty-four hours."  The diagram on page 244 shows an angle theta (latitude) which lines up perfectly with the string holding the pendulum, for a pendulum swinging north and south, but though the north side of a circle under the pendulum will always be on the north side of Paris viewers, as the pendulum sees the Earth spinning the circle is twisting around below it while the point from which it is suspended keeps pulling it back over the center of the circle.  In this space age, it is easier to imagine the pendulum hanging from an ultralight satellite in orbit high enough to maintain a position above a point on the Earth's equator.  For symmetry, I would prefer a pole long enough to have a pendulum at each end, one of which is at 30 degrees North Latitude, and the other at 30 degrees South Latitude.  The pendulums would have to be long enough so the weights that swing are not in orbit but are trying to fall to Earth.  Like a circus clown on a bicycle on a high wire far above three rings, no matter how fast the clown is riding, he does not seem to move when he is looking down, because he stays above the same place, but the moon, sun, and some planets keep changing places, and the weights on the pendulums rarely swing between the same two stars because he sees they are trying to fall toward the point which is at the center of the Earth directly beneath him.  Because the sine of 30 degrees is 0.5, it takes each pendulum 48 hours to line up with the same direction on Earth as the initial swinging direction.  If the clown started out with the sun over his head, the next time the sun is over his head, the motion might look the same, but only if he can't tell which side of the pendulum is which.  When he is totally in the dark, the sideways swinging might remind him that the stars have turned around from where they were when he started, and the only way the direction makes sense is that an accumulation of continuous steps must go through the opposite of any initial position when things have turned that far around.  Some experiments have been tried and worked, so we don't need the outer space circus clown to prove any of this, but trying to think along these lines reminded me of the song, "Standing On The Moon" from the Grateful Dead `Built To Last' CD in 1989 or the wonderful `Downhill From Here' live concert DVD in the `Live In Concert' 3-DVD set.  Far out can mean so many things that might seem unrelated, but it knocked me out that Leon Foucault also was able to measure the speed of light in air and water by using a mirror that was spinning at high speed.  The key to getting the right answer is in being able to know precisely how fast the mirror is spinning, but I did not understand the deflection of the light beam he was trying to measure.  It does not take long to read this book, but the problems which it covers are intriguing 
 This is a great prayer tool for Christians in their daily devotions.  It encourages people to prayer each day for a different influential person.  A picture of the person and a concise article telling how the person  influences the world is included for each day of the year.  The authors  encourage non-judgemental praying for all individual even those with whom  people may disagree or find offensive 
 Mike Vaccaro brings to sportswriting something most of his statistical, fanatical, factoid spewing brethern forgets...baseball, at it's very core, is about the people behind the numbers. Thats what makes this book so much more interesting than all of the other Red Sox-Yankee history books. This book weaves together such a poetic colorful narrative of quotes, emotions and stories from the all the players involved right down to the dihard fan in the last row of bleacher seats. We all know how the story ends, but Vaccaro takes us on that crazy ride one more time. This time we see it and feel it from all sides 
 If anyone asked me what baby product I would have to have it would be this product!  I love it and it is very comfortable to use.  One negative thing though is that the suction cups do not work very well, so don't let your child use it because they could slip.  I would purchase it again and would give it as a gift 
 Bill Evans' career is usually broken up into two trios, the first with bassist Scott Lafaro and drummer Paul Motian, and the second with Eddie Gomez and various drummers.  Present here is the second trio in one of its earliest incarnations, with Philly Joe Jones on drums.  The recording was done live at the Village Vanguard in New York City.  It has been written that Philly Joe Jones and Bill Evans shared a special relationship.  The musical rapport is evident (incidentally the two were also heroin buddies...makes you wonder), and Jones was really the only drummer to get Evans to play as extrovertedly as he does here.  That aggressiveness lends itself to an excellent performance; not only is the playing more energetic, it is group interplay of the highest level.  The Evans-LaFaro-Motian trio, as touched upon in the liner notes of this album, was really more of a piano and bass duet, as LaFaro was often as busy or busier than Evans, while Motian was largely in the background keeping time albeit in interesting ways.  In this trio, however, Jones interacts with Evans rhythmically just as much as Gomez does, if not more, and of course Gomez and Jones are clearly listening to each other.  The result is a many-layered web of counterpoint playing, the most remarkable of which is on the title cut.  There are so many moments when Evans and Jones line up rhythmically on beat displacements and Gomez fills in the space, or Evans fills up the space between Gomez and Jones, or the three line up hits in succession.  Of course, none of this is worked out; it is the complexity and intricacy of three master musicians really listening to each other.  All of this coming from three guys who had barely started playing together.  Given time they would have become even tighter but apparently Jones had some issues that forced him from the group.  I didn't really like Philly Joe Jones before this record.  I appreciated him as part of Miles' first great quintet but something about the way he uses his snare drum used to bother me.  But he fits in brilliantly here and it's easy to hear what Miles heard in him.  I think the Miles quote was something like "I'd rather have Philly Joe out there with one arm and in his underwear than anyone else."  Bill Evans albums of all shapes and sizes are accessible to anyone.  He is one of the precious few artists who creates completely interesting, sophisticated music which is also listenable to the most timid listener.  There is nothing to fear here for even the novice listener, so buy this and hear three masters at the top of their game. 
 This book is essentially a book of Yermolinsky examining some of his games and game fragments,along with some light chess philsosophy and plenty of humor and frank comments.I love the way he cuts through some of the bull that is prevalent in many chess books,and especially games collections.He almost snorts at the mysterious 'positional chess' comments that many,many chess masters and writers have long used in their writings,and seems to prefer more pragmatic and direct analysis.A favorite section is his look at a famous Capablanca vs. Janowsky game,and his analysis of what *really* happened,as opposed to Capa's (and many other writers) vague comments.I agree with Yermo that it would be extremely naive to believe that a strong player such as Janowsky would not have seen the drawish line,and that he in all likelyhood was avoiding this line and playing for a win,as was his style.Yermo examines this game is a direct,earthy style,and I'd love to see him write a book concentrating entirely on these classic games,through his own eyes.Very entertaining,and enlightening.I don't believe that Capa didn't beat Marshall,or whoever,because he was a more profound strategist,I think he beat him because he was just a stronger player overall,strong though Marshall was.  I also appreciate that Yermo doesn't try to denigrate the older players--he realizes that they played chess in a more sophisticated manner than the general rules they sometimes espoused would imply.  It's also refreshing to see Yermo examine some of his bad games,and figure out where he went wrong,and why.We see this in very few games collections,sadly.His annotations are rich in both verbal explanations and variations,and will be pretty tough sledding for new players.I think this book is more for 1700-1800 and up players,and there are some good tips here for players of that strength.  I'd like to see more books from Yermo,since he's an entertaining writer.We need more chess books like this 
 An excellent, and well-balanced, history on a subject that has (sadly) very current undertones.  I recommend this book to anyone who (as I) felt under-educated about this period in our past and its implications for our future. 
 I found the book to be a fascinating true account by Audie Murphy. It is a story that gives accurate details of what was happening but goes into indebt thought and feelings about his desire to survive. The closeness he and his buddies form during their time together and the feelings that they go through when one gets injuried or killed is spot on. Always knowing that they were fighting for not just personel survival but survival of the free world.  
 This is an amazing, gorgeous little gem of a book, with surprisingly complex characters and shades of moral ambiguity for a YA book (or a lot of adult novels, for that matter) -- which is not to say I don't think YA books can be complicated, but they rarely are in this way.  It's a quick read, and compelling. Medraut, the illegitimate son of Artos the king, returns from his travels in Africa and elsewhere to watch over his younger half-brother, Lleu. Medraut doesn't know if he loves or hates Lleu, and matters are complicated by his relationship with his mother/aunt Morgause. Morgause here is...more of a piece of work than usual, even, possibly the most disturbing literary representation of her that I've ever read -- it's a testament to Wein's writing skills that I even sympathized a little with her at one point.  Goewin, Lleu's twin sister, also warrants a mention -- her interaction with Medraut in particular is fascinating.  In fact, one of the things I liked the most was how even when he was managing to be loyal and good, Medraut's darker qualities weren't magically gone, merely held at bay. I also found Medraut's refusal to lie, ever, interesting.  One of the most unique, beautiful, and compelling takes on the Arthurian legends I've read in a long time. I wholeheartedly recommend it.  It's unfortunate that it's going out of print again.  I would suggest snapping up a copy for yourself and at least one copy to loan out 
 I have read all of The Dragon Mage part of the Deverry series so far. You get really into the characters. At first I liked Prince Maryn, but in this book you see a different side of him. I nearly cried with all the tragedy at the end of that part. I can't wait to find out what will happen to Salamander, as well as Dallandra and her apprentice, Niffa. All in all, it was another great book 
 Ok, I was a climber, sort of, well I climbed some of the easy stuff near Seattle. And I realized that in order to keep the thrill of climbing up, as one gets better, you have to keep increasing the danger level. Hence the risk of injury and death keeps increasing until you decide you've had enough via an injury or your life's priorities change and your ice axe becomes a gardening tool.  Wick, well, he seemed to attract more than anyone's share of disasters and this book accounts for that. Why would anyone climb with him? Yet he keeps going and so do others continue to climb with him. It's the climbers lie, "It won't happen to me", "They made a mistake I would never make."  The other great thing about this book is that it should cause every climber to look at your personal relationships and see whether you are being fair to your other life's responsiblities. Wick did not have the same sense of priorites that I have, but then I quit climbing. It's a very personal choice and no one answer is right.  Anyway most climbing books fall into a routine, "the brave set out on a journey", "A sherpa/weak member gets hurt", "We make it/or not" and come home. "Weather was rough but we were tougher". This book looks also at the human condition of why climb at all and for that Wick should be commended for laying it all out. Like him or not, this book was probably one of the bravest things he ever did. Who among us could stand this close scrutney 
 This is a wonderful collection of philosophical essays relating to Monty Python. It appeals to fans of the Pythons, but also philosophers of every stripe --essays range from analytical 20th century philosophy to Buddhism and all points in between. Well done!  Some of the other reviews here at Amazon, almost read like Python sketches. Totally nonsequitur!  Let me add my own irrelevant comment: In addition to the terrible treatment of Richard Pryor herein, one wonders why there is almost no mention of Eskimo people in the text. Why do the authors hate the Eskimos? The book is an outrage to all decency! Etc. etc.. 
 The item was delivered ahead of schedule.  The product was without defect and in excellent condition 
 There's a lot of shojo anime and manga out there that deal with romance from the girl's point of view but Boys Be takes the unique move of showing romance from the GUY'S point of view. And no, that doesn't mean it's all about getting a girl into bed, so leave those thoughts at the door. No, the guys in this first volume are just as romantic and given to flights of fancy towards the object of their emotions as any shojo heroine. The first three episodes concern a group of three guys who are buddies, with each of them having an episode where they are the star. Kyoichi THINKS he likes his childhood friend Chiharu, or does he, or maybe it's just because she's "sprouting" out as a woman in different directions? Will he be able to work out his feelings and will he be able to admit them? Next up is Makoto who keeps all his female classmate's stats and info on a palm pilot for ready access and thinks about how to bag girls all the time, but really he's just as much a sucker for a cute girl as any of them. When he gets in a moped accident because of his wandering eye and is laid up in the hospital, he begins to fall for his nurse! Lastly is the athletic but contemplative Yoshihiko who, while retreiving an errant ball from baseball practice catches a falling girl in his arms who promptly places a lip-locked kiss on his mouth! Who is this girl?   Boys Be Volume 1 had a beautiful charm to it that just put a smile on your face. These guys and gals aren't looking for much. They're just looking for love or more likely the experience of being near someone who makes you feel excited about life. While some of these episodes don't exactly have happy endings, they have WISE endings, meaning that even if things don't work out, these kids are young enough that they can move on. Their experiences with love are just learning curves for when they get to be adults. This is a great show.  If you want the same kind of stories from a woman's point of view you should check out the excellent Diamond Daydreams which is a bit of a sleeper masterpiece. I would also recommend His and Her Circumstances 
 This book happens to be my favorite book of Pat's.   OK, Lets be real.  Authors rarely write books about normal size ladies.  I have loads of buddies who do not want run of the mill female lead in a book of for that matter movies.  We are starved for a good well-written Romance about a nice guy and a nice girl with curves and I want my friends to read this book and just enjoy it.  Don't try to over think it, just take a walk with two people?  I think is a wonderful cute little book and yes I wanted MORE!!! and check out  Nobody's Perfect 4 star 
 The story begins with the hypergeometric series, studied by Euler and Gauss. This is a power series in x depending on three parameters. It is deeply rooted in classical analysis and it solves a linear differential equation, the hypergeometric equation. Kummer pushed the classical approach to its end by finding the 24 explicit solutions to this equation. These solutions are intricately related to each other; and one solution is defined here, another there, and so on. In short, the situation is clamouring for a Riemann to explain that all of this makes perfect sense complexly in terms of analytic continuation and monodromy relations. This is the way to go. Fuchs developed a general theory of linear differential equations along these lines. Then it's back to the hypergeometric series for more inspiration. For which parameter values is the hypergeometric series an algebraic function? Schwarz discovered that this condition on the three parameters may be expressed as that they correspond to a triangular tessellation. What is this clamouring for if not group theory? Well, that's easy for us to say. Actually, generalising Schwarz's results became a battle between the old and the new. Fuchs and Gordan went at it with invariant theory, but Klein carried the day with group theory and geometry. And the victorious march of these ideas was only just beginning. Dedekind and Klein used them to transform the theory of elliptic modular functions, which old fossils like Fuchs and Hermite had only been able to approach via elliptic functions. Indeed, the basic idea, that of periodicity with respect to a group, "was to prove to be the way historically towards the 'right' generalization of elliptic functions", namely automorphic functions. This is the culmination of the book, and here the story is told with more zeal, through correspondence highlights and so on. Poincare's interest in differential equations lead him to Fuchs's work. Despite "ignorance, even quite astounding ignorance", of much of the above literature, he still immediately discovered the connection with hyperbolic geometry (while boarding a bus, no less). This naturally caught the eye of Klein, who, being "deliberately well-read", felt that he had to inform Poincare about these works and his own perspective "that the task of modern analysis was to find all functions invariant under linear transformations". The famous competition that followed was really "more of a cooperative effort". Eventually Poincare's papers concluded this whole remarkable development, through which solid problems of classical analysis prompted a beautiful theory of complex functions deeply unified with group theory and geometry 
 Frank Stefanko delivers an insightful and sometimes touching look into the creative process that produced the "Darkness on the Edge of Town" and "The River" album covers. With a hearfelt introduction by Bruce himself, Stefanko's book features many images that Frank took of Bruce between 1978 and 1982. The most fascinating sessions were those taken at Frank's home in Haddonfield, NJ in 1978. Bruce wanted to visually capture the feel and theme of the songs he had put on tape recording "Darkness." Stefanko's text narrative that accompanies many of the shots makes you feel like you are in the room while the pictures are being taken. When Stefanko describes his elation at being able to photograph one of his favorite musicians, he does so with the same excitement as a die-hard fan. The book is not only a rare insight into the creative process, but also an inspiring story about a guy with a camera who went on to photograph his idol and have the results appear on two album covers. An essential purchase for any Bruce enthusiast! - Chuck Earlin 
 Pater was one of the most insightful and exacting critics of England, and his fiction exceeded even his own standards for beauty.  Marius the Epicurean is the story of a young man's spiritual and aesthetic awakening  in ancient Rome.  He journeys from Stoicism to Cyrenaicism to Epicureanism,  and finally to Christianity. The book is subtle and profound, and is  written in Pater's characteristically lovely prose.  I do not recommend  this book to anyone who wants a traditional linear plot in which the  protagonist is motivated by external events; rather, I recommend it to all  who wish "to burn with a hard, gemlike flame," to all who make  careful aesthetic contemplation their highest goal 
 The hurricane of 1938 ripped through several states along the Northeastern coast of the US and killed nearly 700 people. It devastated portions of Rhode Island and that is where the author focuses her attention when telling the personal and intimate side of the hurricane's faceless wrath.  The research for this book includes  numerous books, articles and official records, as well as personal interviews of survivors and their families, .. As their perceptions and stories are revealed to us, the author overlaps and repeats certain portions of the hurricane's path of destruction, but from a father's view as he sees his children swept out to sea, as the school bus driver who realizes that those in his care may not survive, as a woman whose husband has just suffered a heart attack after attempting to rescue his son from a runaway sailboat.     The ability to comprehend the incomprehensible meant that any chance of escape was severely limited.The hurricane struck so rapidly and powerfully that people could be up to their waist in the storm surge waters within a minute, long before the reality of  the hurricane's existence could be grasped. The science of the storm is explained flawlessly. The true science of weather prediction would be years away.  The Weather Bureau was still in it's early stages of formation.  While one student at the Weather Bureau believed that this hurricane was forming and heading for New England he was ignored because the other scientists relied not only on the weather patterns but on past events and paths, which led them to believe that the hurricane would head out to sea after passing through the Carolina's. While parts of this book seem a bit hyperbolic, the facts clearly point out just how extreme the circumstances of this hurricane were.The intensity of it's destructive power leaves no doubt that those caught in it's path found themselves and their families and friends, in an unimaginable position, on the brink of life and death. This was an intimate story of the victims and survivors of a storm that arrived both unannounced and unexpected and proceeded to devastate everything in it's path in a precise and  impartial manner, leaving behind death, destruction and shattered lives.    
 This title was recommended to me by our AP English teacher and she was right.   A few simple lessons from each section and my high school students had a much better understanding of voice.  
 This collection has a few of my favorites in it (especially the girls/bugs analogy - priceless!)  Great for any age - I read C&H starting around age 7 and I still read it today!  I enjoy it just as much, though I see it from a unique perspective now.  Every kid should grow up with this 
 It isn't necessary to be a Red Sox fan to enjoy reading this book.  It's good to read of the crazy stunts that some of the ball players pulled. I remember a lot of the older players like Ted Williams and Pesky and more of that era. VERY GOOD READING! 
 The book looks at the fulfilled and soon to be fulfilled prophesy surronding the second comming of Jesus Christ.  It is a very detailed look at the methodolgy employed by God to show his people signs of the miraclous return of His Son.  A must read for any serious Bible prophesy buff 
 This was the first Janette Oke book I read. I was about 13. I adored it. My favorite part was when Josh was deciding which girl he was in love with. I got hooked on J.Oke after reading this one. It is good reading for both preteens and adults. Parents, if you can't get your girls to read, buy them a J.Oke book and watch them change. 
 This is THE best book on the subject with the USMC S/S manual only half a step behind. SOTIC contains a more thorough review of mechanics, ballistics calculation and trajectory theory.  As for the gentleman who wrote a review on 26 April 2000"The real deal folks", I agree with his thoughts on the book. However, Mr. A Reader, I would appreciate you telling me and the world what "sniper" team you operated with in the Special Forces- being that there are no sniper teams in the organizational echelon. You must be thinking of the USMC. There are however SOTIC trained individuals(usually 18B) who can collaborate with the A team(s) and/or operate independently. If you were in fact on an A/B/C TEAM, what might that teams organizational designation be? One more bit of information for all of you RESPECTFUL enthusiasts of Special Operations: the SF, SEAL's, PJ's, or any other USSOCOM units are not considered "black organizations" 
 My grandson and I are just starting to work through this book.  He is really excited about it.  I think it makes sense!  While my grandson is only 12 and this is not a childrens book, with our working together it makes my job of teaching possible.  I had not had lessons myself and am learning as I teach.  I can't wait for our next session 
 Without a doubt, this is the best book I've yet to encounter when it comes to taking an inside look at life in a real maxmimum security prison.    Leavenworth Federal Prison is located, obviously,in Leavenworth Kansas and is the oldest federal prison in existence. Built in the late 1800's, Leavenworth is a maximum security facility    where the sometimes mundane work-a-day-world that most of us have come to know ends abruptly and a new society emerges as a timeless, unslayable demon from the depths of one's worse nightmares. Although this society hidden from the outside world does have rules established by the prison system, there is a sub sub-culture that the prisoners must deal with every day.  This is truly a story of the survival of the fittest.    This book was not written as many others have been, in a biased, sterile, sociological style that would be right at home in the politically-correct atmosphere of a classroom.  This is a no-nonsense, in-your-face, account of what things are really like for those doing hard time. If you're a soccer mom or other politically correct weasel, do yourself a favor and stick with the lofty, fantasy world that you have locked yourself into.  If, on the other hand, you seek knowledge and enlightenment as close as one can achieve without actually being a part of the event, buy this book; you'll find it hard to put down.  The author, Pete Earley, was given complete free and unsupervised access, day and night, to any guard and prisoner who would speak with him.  Although he initially was met with suspicion and distrust from both the guards and prisoners alike, he proved himself to be a stand-up guy and was able to establish a rapport. Pete roamed the yards and cell blocks alone: no weapons, no protection.  He was literally at the mercy of anyone who wanted to harm or kill him.  To his credit, Pete chose not to take sides. From turning down offers from the guards to drink and shoot with them to refraining from indulging in the prisoner's home brew, Pete walked the middle road and reported fairly.  The result of his efforts has produced a book of unparalled interest and value.  Pete focuses upon a half-dozen prisoners and guards to tell their individual tales of life, crime, emotions, frustrations, hatred, fears, and interaction. When one combines these aspects with the bureaucratic nature of the federal prison system, one ends up with an environment nearly too insane to believe. Reality is always stranger than fiction.  While it is perhaps interesting to read the perceptions of those who have already absorbed the book, this is a literary accomplishement that you must read and ponder for yourself. The book is intertaining and describes well the emotional toll inflicted upon both sides. I believe you won't want to put it down.                          
 Have you ever been kissed senseless?  Have you ever daydreamed about a kiss that you could still savor and feel intensely?  For our characters in KISSED, that is exactly what they experience when their lips meld together.  Cheryl Crawford is married to a wonderful man, but after 20 years of marriage the spark seems to have dimmed.  Now that her son is in college, she is ready to fulfill her dreams of teaching in Africa.  When a political opportunity arises, Justin Crawford, an ambassador to Ecuador, finds it hard to turn down.  Yet, Cheryl reminds him of the promise they made that she would be able to pursue her career goals when their son went to college.  Justin finds himself having to choose between his political aspirations and his family.  Will Justin be able to make the right decision?  Can Cheryl abandon her dreams to again follow her husband?  Or will they both give up 20 years of marriage?  Carmen Green has written a wonderful love story.  KISSED illustrates the sacrifices couples make to stay married and how important communication and compromise are to the survival of a marriage.  This was a well written and steamy romance novel and romance readers will enjoy the well placed kisses throughout this story.       Reviewed by Cashana Seals of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers 
 I read Silver Pigs based on the recommendations of someone on a historical fiction book group with me, and I really am grateful to her!  This book is wonderful.  In general, I stick to historical fiction in a fairly limited time frame, rarely venturing out of my favorite niche of Georgian and Regency era England.  However, I have now become a devoted fan of the ancient Roman empire.    Lindsey Davis is so talented at melding little facts about daily life in Rome (and Britain) into her story.  The story is told from the point of view of Marcus Didius Falco as though you are his contemporary, and he assumes that you understand all the "pop culture" references and side jokes he makes about Rome, Roman culture, and the Empire; in this way, you really *do* learn a lot about the history of the period, in a "Daily Show with Jon Stewart" type of way.  It reads almost like a satirical account in a Roman newspaper might read.  I LOVED the way Davis did that, and still managed to create truly sympathetic characters that you cheer for.    I'm excited to learn that there are at least sixteen books in the Falco series- I have added them ALL to my TBR pile and look forward to the pleasure of reading each one 
 	Richard Clarke wrote his inside story Against All Enemies.  This book gave a report on the internal operation of US Government on Terrorism and the watch on bin Laden and company. 	Dick, a dove of Vietnam era joined the government to contribute his talent and wisdom to shape the country course.  According to his book, bin Laden was on the radar watch for a long time.  But the politics and bureaucracy spared him and he is still at large, alive and kicking with frequent pop-ups even five years after 9/ll.  In this book, Dick showed what are domestic and foreign, truth and lie, friend and foe, life and death,  pacifist and fist, and check and balance.  He also warned the trading of security for patriotism, civil right and civil liberty.  For all Americans, who is more fearful, government or terrorists?  The current wars on terrorism, Afghanistan and Iraq make Americans feel more vulnerable, less safe and isolated. 	Many chapters revealed that there are many loyal and patriotic Americans who are faithfully in "For the people, by the people, of the people".   America needs more Richard Clarke who is the dove against the hawk trio.  He hinted that the Iraq War would mortgage the future of our grandchildren generation without an exit in sight.  America again repeats itself in the cycle of involving another civil war in another place and another time. It was a mis-informed, misguided and mismanaged battlefield sunk in the quick sand - a war America cannot win or lose.  It required wisdom to have a glorious leave with dignity and honor.   He felt frustrated when his protection advice for American people was ignored. 	A time line of events will help readers follow the atrocities committed by bin Laden against Americans.  It will be a general American wish to see this man being brought to justice.  Now, the 5th anniversary of 9/11, there are still no answers to anthrax, bin Laden and the various terrorists attack around the globe.  Are Americans safer with all the security means? 	 The last chapter offered a logical, workable, long-term peaceful solution to terrorism as bullets and guns do not win hearts and minds.  It is a soft line approach instead of hard line military might.  History proves the soft overcome hard, weak overcome strong.  His book mobilizes readers to get seriously prepared for terrorist attack emergency and actively participate in politics and democracy to fulfill the pledge "to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of United States of America, Against All Enemies".

 I was lent Deepak Chopra's Cassette version of this book long ago and approached it anticipating little value. I was wrong; I enjoyed it! For someone who enjoys attacking problems from multiple angles, this work gave me a greater spiritual dimension for my ongoing experiments with mind and body integration.  We all have to start somewhere, and I don't understand the malice of those who expect every book they read to have everything they need. We don't often write for the money; you'd be surprised how little an author makes from each book they sell. I write first for the clarity, and I think Mr. Chopra wrote Ageless Body, Timeless Mind for the right reasons as well.  One key difference between Deepak and history's philosophers is that they are dead and he isn't. Those who can, have to speak. As not all men are philosophy majors and those who are, are not so all at the same time, someone who listens will be at a stage in life where they will get something valuable out of it.   As the author of Moral Armor, I'm beyond it now philosophically, but I feel no need to impune his work. His was one of many stepping stones from the self-help eighties for which I am thankful 
 A charming and delightful completion to Doris Day's film career. As always, her supporting cast is full of talented character actors and upcoming stars. I just rewatched the DVD, and found new and interesting tidbits. Robert Mersey composed the score for the film (after doing some research, he was also involved with Streisand's 'Color Me Barbra' TV Special). Of particular interest, there is a recurring musical theme throughout the movie, highly reminiscent of a wildly successful musical which debuted 2 years after the release of this film - not composed by Mersey. I am surprised no one has noticed it before. See the film, listen to the music, enjoy the wonderful Doris Day 
 Poor Charles Darwin - he continues to wrongfully take the rap for Herbert Spencer's theory on evolution; and so you get Spencerites like Dawkins claiming they're Darwinists, thereby adding more confusion to the mess.  Charles Darwinn believed in God and he believed that God is the Creator of creation; Dawkins does not believe in the Creator and therefore is NO DARWINIST!    A Darwinist, in its original meaning, is a person who believes in the Creator but that the God-created species can differentiate.  In other words, you can cross peas and beans until you get a variety of colors.  You can do that with tomatoes and potatotoes too.  You can produce breeds of chickens ranging from Leghorns to Brahmas, but they're all still a chicken!  Darwin was not an evolutionist; Dawkins is. His essay "Darwinism Triumphant" should have been titled "Spencerism Triumphant" because Darwin was never a proponent of evolution; Spencer was.  Now that this historical error has been righted, what does this tarnisher of Darwin's views say in this compilation of his various writings over the years?  Well he certainly parts company with Darwin who believed in intelligent design of species, but acknowledged their differentiation to be a result of biology (which is a human word for God's laws).  Dawkins likes natural selection and likes exploring the ways that genes behave to determine outcomes.  Dawkins is especially excited about genetic engineering and perhaps retracing some evolutionary footsteps as he envisions them.  He also likes to lambast those he sets up as targets - critics and psuedo-scientists who do not share his enthusiasms.  It is clear that Dawkins does not undertand creation or its Creator, yet he then attacks religion as a "dangerous collective delusion".  Dawkins does not come across as having done much reading in the area of creation.  He certainly has read nothing so heavy as Thomas Aquino's "Summa Theologica".  And he neglects any mention of fellow scientists such as Ganges' "Origins and Destiny", or the fact that most physicists and "hard" scientists see physics as simply another term for God's laws.  The physical laws are the way they are because their author made that way and no other way.  The signs are everywhere around us if we would but pause, examine, and ponder them.  Dawkin's emotional response to Anglo-American state terrorism in response to the Bush Crime Family's bombing of the Twin Towers and then blaming it on dead Arabs was good and proper.  It was the first time he came across as a human being in this book rather than a cold scientist.  Until then, he seemed more like a Dr Jeckyll wanting to talk genomes, sequencing, computer power, and the possibilities of finding "missing links" and resurrecting a dinosaur.  If you like Dawkins, you'll love this book of his various writings.  I find him irritating, mostly because he gives Darwin an undeserved wrong reputation and because he doesn't check his premises.  But in all fairness, this book does not provide the format for anything so systematic.  Many of these essays are archived at various internet sites; links can be found at www.world-of-dawkins.com .

Triple H: Oh yeah, she is a poseur and that makes Fed Up a hypocrite! Shawn Michaels: Back to this Rush set, it has most classics like 2112, Closer to the Heart, Fly By Night, Tom Sawyer and many more. Triple H: Also, Rush didn't need MTV to make it big, in fact MTV aired Rush clips in the early days constantly. Shawn Michaels: Then MTV abandoned Rush cos they got older and don't have bling bling or criminal records. If you are not down with Rush or DX, WE GOT TWO WORDS FOR YA(crowd yells "S*CK IT!" 
 Don't Give Up on Me was fine enough, but it wasn't really a soul album and it was far too subdued. On Make Do with What You Got, Solomon really cuts loose, and he's got a band full of seasoned soul musicians (Ray Parker Jr., who played with Steve Wonder and led the soul band Raydio pre-Ghostbusters, Bill Withers' drummer, Muscle Shoals guitar great Reggie Young, and Solomon's own church organist, among others) with him. The result is stupendous.   The lead-off track is a cover of a Coco Montoya song that sounds just like the Stones circa Exile, but with better vocals. It's just amazing. Fading Footsteps and the title track are both stomping soul number with a slightly more modern (like, mid-seventies) feel. The rest is mostly ballads, including scorching takes on The Stones' I Got the Blues, a Hank Williams gospel song.   This is a fantastic album that any soul music fan should love. 
 My son who is 2.5 years old and is very much into fire trucks nowadays, absolutely loves this book.  Everytime when I ask which book he wants to read, he says "Big Frank's Fire Truck!"  He's memorized pretty much the entire book.  I'm now on the lookout for another fantastic book.  He also loves Fireman Small 
 I anxiously awaited the arrival of this book, which is the sequel to Conclave. I felt that the book was very intersting. I felt the calling of a new council was interesting and I also learned a couple of things. I felt that the characters were very interesting. I just love Greg Tobin's writing style. I couldn't put the book down at all. I like the little tibits and the different personalitys that each characater had and I think that is what makes the book very interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone that is interesting to learning what it takes to call a council with all the world's cardinals and bishops 
 Homer Kelley should be commended for compiling a very informational book on the golf swing.  He has, however, presented his theory from an engineering point of view that may cause some readers to recoil.  There is a lot of cross-references that tie all of his ideas together but it takes a fair amount of time to really understand the entire book.  The book is not just about building a golf swing, it helps you understand how you can manipulate your body to perform just about any swing you like, as long as it follows certain scientific tenets.  The serious student of the game should not be without this book in his library, as it is a valuable reference source, but I feel that more people would be benefitted had Mr. Kelley presented his ideas in a more understandable manner.

 My father is in the building business as a structural engineer and my family is originally from The Bronx, NY.  As a history buff and major in school, I adored this book.  It gave me insight as to how the Rich got richer and how they lived in this elegant and grand building.

 Take your great stylists of humor today -- your Molly Ivins, your Bob Shacochis, your Carrie Fisher, some would say your Dave Barry, you get the idea -- take those great writers and know that Dan Jenkins is second to none of them in creating his own universe of language, a convincing land where jocular wit reigns and finely drawn characters live, where the fun is wild but never eclipsed by love. Jenkins shows off best in "Semi-Tough," about ready for revival as a piece of hilarious '70s nostalgia. It's the story of a woman and her two lifetime friends, both Giants stars about to play the Super Bowl. It's told by Billy Clyde, taping some comments for a game-week diary with a hilarious casual honesty and the best eye for detail a reader could want. While the redneck backdrop and the laughing, cynical use of sexist, homosexist, ethnic and especially racist slurs might get hard to read even in this context, the ribald high-life and football hype life are a constant, sly hoot. Most important, though, is the subtly drawn family of friends at the book's center; love has seldom gotten such an affectionate treatment without too much sweetener. Careful readers will find layers of psychological meaning revealed in Billy Clyde's monologues, giving this book a depth to go along with its colorful lifestyles of the studs. If you're a football fan, or if you're a friendship fan, or if you just like to laugh out loud while you read a tightly paced book, "Semi-Tough" has got something for you. Join the readers who know this little book is one of the unheralded gems 
 A must for King fans...I listened to it growing up and just bought the newly released CD....Love it even more as an adult!

 Don't let the name fool you, this is a good book with lots of information on playing and etc. I really enjoyed it and I think anyone will. There is a lot of good stuff in this book and it is well worth the money. It covers a lot of ground and goes beyond just basics. Get it you'll like 
 The murder victim was a barrister, Venetia Aldridge.  It was necessary to change the head of chambers.  Venetia was more senior than Laud.  If a vote were to be taken following Langton's retirement it may have turned out that Venetia had secured the victory, thereby disturbing Laud. Venetia's father had been head of a school.  As a school girl Venetia had learned about the law from one of the teachers at her father's school.  She learned that advocacy could create an atmosphere without scenery, without a curtain, of someone's life.    Langton, age seventy-three, experienced an episode in a trial when words deserted him.  Venetia's last case had been the defense of a would-be country gentleman.  There had been an altercation concerning a protest against fox hunting.  Venetia had a not quite bright and unsuitable daughter, Octavia.  Octavia had a friendship with a former criminal client of Venetia, someone who had been charged with murdering his aunt. Venetia felt the man for whom she had obtained an acquittal felt contempt for her, not gratitude.  He would gladly humiliate her.    There is something very bracing about a P.D. James book.  She writes that actions have consequences.  She does a wonderful job of describing lawyers and explaining the appeal of law, the dream of an orderly existence. A scene with Drysdale Laud and Hubert Langton and Venetia unfolds.  A matter of contention is the selection of two new members of chambers.  Venetia supports male candidates for both of the slots which is contrary to the position of Laud and Langton.    There is a heaviness in P.D. James books.  She writes of tragedy.  Pain in people's lives often cannot be alleviated because they are faced with circumstances not subject to change.  Venetia asks Laud to contact the nearly criminal man with whom Octavia is involved to ask him how much money he would require to leave her alone.  Laud declines to undertake such a mission.  Piers Tarrant, the possessor of an Oxford degree in theology, and Kate Miskin assist Adam Dalgliesh in the investigation of the murder of Venetia Aldridge.  One of the barristers in Venetia's chambers accuses Adam Dalgliesh of a sort of inverted conceit because he is a police officer.  It is learned that that Venetia had been difficult in chambers.  All of the witnesses agreed that she had been a very fine lawyer.    The minor characters are well-described.  For example there is Valerie, a secretary, with a mentally ill mother.  Mental illness is treated in the round from the perspective of the persons who have to live with it. P.D. Jamers is really at the top of her form in this book.  It is certainly understandable that a murderer cannot be prosecuted for a lack of proof.  The story is both complex and deeply satisfying.                 
 I picked this one up and have read it. I did get some good ideas from it but wanted more... I also like that it had pictures because visually it was great.   Some of the excersises were fun and enlightening. But this book helped me write one with added spaces for the reader to make thier own book unique. I found AdmireD Interactive Reading and Writing to be a better inspiration... and gave me away to write as I read!  but this one helped me make it so cheers 
 I loved this book.  It was very uplifting and hopeful with regard to the future we all face.  About 6 months ago, after reading the book and by coincidence, I had the chance to meet Rosemary at her home.  What an experience!  Any doubt I ever had as to her authenticity was completely removed!  She is such a spiritual and sensitive person and I experienced her communication skill first hand.  I can only believe that this book is an accurate dipiction of life and death and heaven 
  Peter Robinson grew up in Yorkshire, and is the author of thirteen previous novels featuring Inspector Banks. He is the winner of numerous awards in the United States, Britain and Canada, and in 2002 he won the CWA Dagger in the Library. As I also come from Leeds the background to his stories is something that I have experienced first hand and because of this I have a special affection for his books. However they would be first class crime fiction wherever they were based.  Inspector Banks receives a phone call from his brother Roy in London, something of a novelty in itself. But the phone call is quite disturbing and has an air of mystery to it. Banks immediately leaves his patch in Yorkshire and heads off down to the big city to seek out Roy. Meanwhile DI Annie Cabbot is called to the scene of a murder on a quiet stretch of road just outside Eastvale. A young woman has been found dead in her car. The strange thing is that the victim has Banks's name and address  written on a piece of paper in the pocket of her jeans.  Meanwhile Banks is staying in his brothers luxurious, but empty house, uncovering more and more details about a brother, that he never really knew and didn't particularly like. Up north Annie tracks down the female victim's friends and colleagues. It seems that both trails are looking likely to intersect at some point  and the consequences could be terrifying for both Banks and Annie . .  
 At the time of writing The Civic Culture (1963), Almond and Verba had observed the second wave of democratization (Huntington, 1991).  As such, the authors witnessed the emergence of many new democracies.   The authors knew, however, that there was more to democratic systems than simply structures and formal institutions.  The authors felt that aside from the creation of democratic institutions, it was necessary that a political culture that supports democratic ideals also emerge.  Almond and Verba defined this necessary cultural subtype as civic culture, a "culture based on communication and persuasion, a culture of consensus and diversity, a culture that permitted change but moderated it" (8). The purpose of The Civic Culture is to quantify the ideals and attitudes which compose the civic culture of "operating democratic systems" (11).  By doing so, the authors believe that the cultural ideals necessary for a stable democracy will be readily disseminated to newly emerging democracies.    In order to quantify democratic ideals, the authors undertook a comparative cross-national survey of five operating democratic systems: the US, UK, Germany, Italy and Mexico. In order to limit the research to the attitudes of individuals, the authors avoided questions about government, and rather posed inquires "about the individual's perception about government in relation to himself" (70).  As testing attitudes of individuals is a complex task, the attempt to do so in a comparative fashion across five nations is especially difficult.   In order to create an environment of comparability, Almond and Verba place respondents into one of three categories of political culture: parochial, subject and participant.  In the parochial culture, the respondent "has neither knowledge of nor interest in politics."  In the subject culture, the respondent is "at least dimly aware of politics and political symbols and institutions (and) he understands that his life is touched by government policies."  Lastly, in the participant culture the respondent "has a keenly developed notion of his own political efficacy and competence as a political actor" (Walter, 1965).   The three categories can combine and change.  They are not mutually exclusive.  Political cultures are not homogenous and each category can be subdivided into a number of cleavage groups.  Almond and Verba believe that the combination between all these orientations (parochial, subject and participant "lead to a balanced political culture" (32).  In order for Almond and Verba to make sense of these combinations and cleavages, they attempt to explore the differences and similarities between variables, and then compare the relative relationships of variables between nations (70).  By evaluating the data collected in the five nations regarding political culture, the authors are then able to "validate inferences...and develop independent measures that can be used to explain other phenomena" (50).  The next section will attempt to illustrate the practicality of Almond and Verba's methodology.   For example, Verba and Almond seek to explore levels of individual political competence among nations.  The authors hypothesize that a democratic system must have a political culture in place in which the citizens believe that they possess the ability to influence government.  In order to validate their hypothesis, Almond and Verba ask respondents in all five nations whether they feel they can influence local, and national government, and at which level their influence is most effective.  It was discovered that the respondents in all five nations felt they were more able to influence local government as opposed to national government.  But upon closer inspection, the levels of political competence varied between nations.    Table 1 Nation			Local Competence*			National Competence* USA			77					75 UK			78					62	 Germany		62					38 Italy			51					28 Mexico			52					38  *Percentage of respondents who felt themselves politically competent    Data from The Civic Culture (1963)   Almond and Verba explain this discrepancy by arguing that in the case of Mexico and Italy, local competence is greater than national competence because "local government autonomy and the accessibility of local government officials is most firmly institutionalized" (188).   From this one section of The Civic Culture, Almond and Verba can claim three assumptions regarding political competence across nations.  First, "local and national competence is related".  Second, "local competence is more widespread then national competence".  Third, "local competence is related to the institutional availability of opportunities to participate on the local level" (188). Throughout the subsequent chapters of the book, the authors continue to explore political attitudes across the five nations using methodology similar to the example above.  For example, in chapter nine, Almond and Verba seek to draw a correlation between political competence and participation, and the influence of these variables on the effectiveness and legitimacy of a political system (230).    Further chapters explore political emotion and participation, political obligation, and a number of other relationships regarding political attitudes and their effect on political structures.  Still, in order for this large amount of data to be used more broadly, it is necessary for the authors to create generalizations regarding political culture that can be circulated to other emerging democracies.  The authors use their compiled data to create a picture of the political culture of each nation studied, then they "attempt to relate these patterns of attitudes to a theory of the functioning of democratic governments" (402).   In order to form a generalization regarding democratic systems and political attitudes, it is necessary to quickly revisit the idea of civic culture.  Almond and Verba define civic culture as a "culture based on communication and persuasion, a culture of consensus and diversity, a culture that permitted change but moderated it" (8).  From this definition, it becomes apparent that contradictions exist in the idea of civic culture.  However, this only illustrates the compatibility of civic culture and a democratic system.  A democratic system, like civic culture, is composed of contradictions.  In a democratic society, elites governing the system must be responsive to the wishes of the citizenry, but also maintain the ability to make "authoritative decisions" (477).  As such, "the civic culture, which sometimes contains apparently contradictory political attitudes, seems to be particularly appropriate for democratic political systems, for they, too, are mixtures of contradictions" (476).   Almond and Verba contend that of the five nations studied, the United States and the United Kingdom provide prime examples of the most developed civic culture.  These nations possess citizenry composed of both the passive and active orientations.  As such, the government is able to address the contradictory nature of its main purpose.  There are those who place a high degree of responsibility on the government, while there exists still more who readily allow the government to carry on its business with little or no interference.   Almond and Verba offer that the political culture of the US and UK has emerged over a long period of time.  Political change came slowly, and with it the emergence of a civic culture.  The question then arises whether new developing democracies are capable of creating their own civic culture without having the extended time frame that characterizes both US and UK cases.  Disappointingly the authors write, "If our study has taught us anything, it is that there is no simple formula for the development of a political culture conducive to the maintenance of democracy" (501).   However, some generalizations can be drawn by the authors' research.  First, education plays a large role in the development of civic culture.  Although not a direct catalyst to democratic stability or the emergence of civic culture, if developing nations can insure an increase in education, civic culture will begin to emerge.   Aside from education, the civic culture can be furthered through the development of a myriad of "channels of political socialization" (502).  As civic culture is in many ways based upon differences in political orientation, by developing a variety of means to further political socialization, the diversity necessary to ensure democratic ideals emerges.   Lastly, with education and channels of political socialization in place, it still remains necessary to ensure an attitude develops which supports a "commitment to the political system and a sense of political community" (503).  This is most obvious in recently created democracies that have not the time to develop a sense of political community.  The authors used the example of the Mexican Revolution as a catalyst to a sense of nationality, drawing individuals into a politically joined community.       
 The Lost World by Michael Crichton is a very fast paced novel. The story is suspensful and very differant from the movie (which I really didn't like).  The story revolves around Ian Malcom (mathamatican), Dr. Levine (dinosaur expert), and Sarah Harding (researcher in preditory behavior) traveling to a privatly owned island off the coast of Coasta Rica 6 years after Jurassic Park closes. This island was the island that made the dinosaurs for the park. The dinosaurs were released from the factory after they recieved a puzzleing disease. The dinosaurs took over the island. After Dr. Levine gets stuck on the island. The other people in the story must find him and, the most difficult part, make it out alive.  The only shortcoming of this book are the characters. They are just a little too unbelieveable.   Overall it is a really good book for a sequel to Jurassic Park 
 According to CBS research (through Nielsen Media Research), released in the summer of 2000, the most watched "summer" primetime series in modern tv history:  1 - "Survivor" CBS averaging 21 million viewers in its first 5 episodes in the summer of 2000.  2 - "Seinfeld" NBC averaging 20.1 million viewers in its 5 episodes in the summer of 1990.  3 - "Totally Hidden Video" FOX averaging 16.1 million viewers in its 9 episodes in the summer of 1989.  4 - "Top Cops" CBS averaging 15.5 million viewers in its 7 episodes in the summer of 1990.  5 - "Sonny and Cher" CBS averaging 15 million viewers in its 5 episodes in the summer of 1971.  6 - "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" ABC averaging 14.3 million viewers in its 13 episodes in the summer of 1999. 
 In "Their Last Battle" author Nicolaus Mills discusses the seemingly endless struggle to build a National World War II Memorial on the Mall in Washington D.C. In fact, it took nearly 17 years to get the job done. What was all the fuss about and who could possibly object to building such a memorial to honor the accomplishments of the so-called "Greatest Generation"? In order to fully appreciate the issues involved here one must fully understand the history of the Mall in our Nation's Capitol. Furthermore, one needs to be familiar with the history of monuments in this country. Mills does an admirable job getting the reader up to speed in both of these areas.  From there Mills takes us on a 17 year journey that commences at a fish fry just outside Toledo, Ohio in 1987 to the dedication in the Spring of 2004. Mills introduces us to all of the important players in this odyssey from World War II veteran Roger Durbin who first proposed the idea to Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH) and former Senator Bob Dole (R-KS) who were both very instrumental in bringing this project to fruition. You'll learn about all of the various governmental agencies who would become involved. Find out about the design competition and meet the eventual winner Friedrich St. Florian, former dean of the Rhode Island School of Design. And finally, you will discover who the opponents were. There were quite a few and at several key junctures it seemed as though the opposition just might carry the day. This book is exceptionally well written and I would highly recommended it 
 Just finished reading this book, finally! As usual, i will give a good/bad breakdown of this novel.  Good: First off, Brown gets the gold star for research. Although im not much of an expert on glaciology or the inner workings of NASA, I will say this boy did his homework. All the info was well researched, well written, and I was surprised all the way until the end. I also liked how the two story lines intertwined.  Bad: Was a bit long and seemed to drag out in some points. Some of the info was technical jargon. It did help the reader understand, but it also made it a little boring.   In all, it was an interesting story, but not as good as Digital Fortress. But it was very well written. Great job

 Classic Book. My son first saw Burt Dow on a videotape of the Robert McCloskey books.  At first, I couldn't find Burt Dow in any bookstores, but was glad when I finally did.  My son loves the book and loves to play Burt  Dow 
 Pretty decent trimmer, easy to use and it pack a punch; but the most amazing quality is how quite it is! And at a very good price, with a very solid construction. Could not ask for a better hair trimmer. 
 My wife fully enjoyed the book. I'm glad Amazon.com had it available as we couldn't find it anywhere. It was received in excellant condition 
 I bought this toy on clearance at a local store for around $12, got it home and after reading the box, realized that I didn't even have to take it out to program it.  The box has a flap in the back that lifts up for easy access to the toy, the software that you use with your computer and the usb cable!  It came equipped with everything you need to download it!  I pulled the cable out, hooked it up to the toy, turned the toy to the "on" position, hooked the other end of the cable up to one of my PC's USB ports, and inserted the CD ROM into the drive.  The software downloaded and the onscreen directions were so easy to follow.  It took only about 15 minutes in all to get it ready for my daughter to play with.  This is a Christmas present, so after I got him programmed, I had to remember to turn him "off" on his box so that once he was wrapped and under the tree, he wouldn't be "talking", etc.  The only downfall I can mention with this toy is that he can only be programed for 3 songs/stories.  You get to select up to 3 songs/stories from the software.  I wanted 3 songs and 3 stories, but had to choose at total of 3 alltogether.  So I chose two songs, and 1 story.  But it was easy to do, and he is ready to go...it was a bargain for me to catch him on clearance, and be able to program him so easily 
 The entire Vorkosigan adventures series is excellent and this book is no exception. Ms. Bujold's imagination and descriptive abilities bring the reader right into a fascinating world of Miles and his family. Any fantasy and science fiction follower would enjoy this 
 One of the things I really liked about this newest collection of Dilbert strips is that they really stay in the office.  Gone are all of the side trips to Dilbert's home, Ratbert's antics, strange dates, and other non-office stories.  While many such have been quite funny, this series goes back to what Dilbert is all about; the office.  Dilbert, Wally, Alice, Asok, Tina and the rest of the staff have to deal with and survive the madness that is management, marketing, payroll and the executives.  They do so with their usual style.  Among the story arcs in this collection are: The Secret Society of Executive Secretaries The cursed and deadly binders The Non-Credible Guy The Prima Donna The New Hire Dilbert and stopped time Bribery The Ultra-Donut  And many, many more in a collection of wit, humor, and an almost scary dose of reality that has you thinking Scott Adams works in your office 
 I love, this woman, this Drama Music, show, how live can be, y how we can live it wiht hope and join every time we are with or friend and familie 
 This book is great and of course there are a couple of parts that can bring tears to your eyes.It is basically with this little girl whom has this power to set things on fire.(great huh)But she is wanted by some stupid organization for the purpose of making weapons of some type.He parents had powers of their own,however,but her mother died early.At one point in time her both parents were part of a "science project" of some sort which left them with the powers.As a result their daughter(the firestarter),was born instead of a normal girl as a result of their intamacy.The beginning of the story is basically with her father trying to get her away as far a possible from harm,but did he succeed??Before you know it the book will start to catch fire in your hands,this book is wonderful...I will definitely recommend it...And while you are at it,try reading carrie,it is just as good....  Here is an additional part of my review(taken from my research)  The title character of Firestarter is Charlene "Charlie" McGee , a young girl with pyrokinesis -- the ability to create fire with the power of her mind. Charlie is a mutant; she was born with her pyrokinetic talent due to her parents' involvement in an experimental drug trial in college. Charlie's father, Andy, is also gifted with a mind-control ability called the "Push", and her mother had mild telekinesis, however, they are weak in comparison to their daughter's talent.  The McGees are harassed by The Shop, a governmentally-controlled organization that was involved in the original drug trials. They wish to study and experiment on Charlie; her parents naturally protest. Eventually, The Shop murders Charlie's mother, and Charlie and Andy flee to New York in a desperate attempt to escape. They find temporary refuge at a lake cabin in Vermont, however, they are eventually hunted and captured by John Rainbird, a Native American assassin and taken to The Shop's complex in Virginia.  Imprisoned at The Shop, Charlie must find a way to reunite with her father while learning to better control her powers. At first she resolves not to use her abilities, but later changes her mind, due to the advice of Rainbird, who pretends to be a friendly janitor. She is unaware that The Shop intends to kill her after completing their series of experiments.  Andy McGee eventually uses his powers to convice a Shop staff member to help him and Charlie escape. The two do meet, but before they can leave the complex, Rainbird shoots and kills Andy. Before he dies, Andy tells Charlie to "burn it all down." She honors his wish and incinerates the entire Shop complex, killing Rainbird and many others in the process.  The book ends with Charlie offering her story to the magazine Rolling Stone. She hopes that revealing her story will make it impossible for The Shop to kidnap and harm her again. ....enjoy....Nigel....

 This is my first perfume "text book" and I find it extremely helpful in learning to understand the processes of making natural perfumes.  The tables, suggestions for getting acquainted with different scents, the details about perfume making are wonderful.  In addition, I was able to get a very fast reply to my email when I had a specific question. This book also includes interesting historical data.  I highly recommend it, specially for the beginning perfumer 
 Like every other book in this series, Invincible Vol 7 really takes you to new places with the young superhero. I love the dynamic & reveal with Eve and the little montage of alternate dimensions! I don't even have to suggest buying this book because if you've made it this far in the series, you're already hooked 
 The bravado of patriarchy and its reliance upon presenting males as strong, vibrant creatures able to take on the world when young, and equally powerful when old has always been a myth perpetuated as the alpha male syndrome.  However, the reality is that, like women, men undergo similar hormonal changes as a result of aging. While the outward appearance of men may remain somewhat similar, both personality and hormonal changes occur along with the physical changes in muscle power that young men discern readily in challenging the older male establishment for power and prominence.  Little discussed, or viewed as the natural aging phenomenon of men and the mellowed perspective in which he sees the world, and operates in it, typical male menopause has focused upon his desire to grativate toward younger women to extend his male prowess, or by making the wild changes of adopting fast cars, and more relaxed lifestyles in an attempt to capture his youth.  That males haven't come to grips with the similarities of aging among women ought to be a concern since so much of society is organized not around the vitality cycles of natural aging, but by the fantasies of aging men who deny their own mortality, and the consequences of aging. Taught to view women differently, men therefore find it more difficult to accept their own aging process because of the enormous differences in how men and women are cultured to be viewed by a male dominant society.  Because men died at somewhat younger ages throughout life, the lifecyle phenomenon of men has never been approached with the legitimacy or credibility that is a part of the natural consequence of being male.  That either men or women are taught to view the aging process as one that is devalued because of its physical changes rather than prized for its contribution to stable and sustainable populations is a social problem that has yet to be taken seriously. When country singers sing that "all my rowdy friends have settled down," they are recognizing this natural tendency of men to settle into a lifestyle that accepts their aging as natural, and normal rather than continuing to idolize the rowdy lifestyle that the constant pumping out of male testosterone helps to create.  The message, of course, is that, like women, men will not live forever, do suffer the consequences of aging, and must adapt age appropriate lifestyles that respects their aging, rather than condemns it. That attitude will work for both men and women to help define the expectations of being human, and mature as individuals, in planning their lives and knowing what to expect from their bodies, and what not to expect 
 Many business books focus on the best practices of 1995 or earlier, which dooms the reader to being constantly behind the curve in developing and implementing best practices.  This book is one of the rare exceptions that  attempts to push the organization beyond today's best practices.  I applaud  the effort and found that the metaphors were powerful, and the thinking  about how to implement the new concepts to be solid.  I was pleased to see  the references to newer ways of understanding customers (such as behavioral  observation).  Most companies are using outmoded ways of tracking and  responding to customers, and this book has many good things to say in that  direction.  A potential weakness of the book is that it does not say much  about how to anticipate customer responses so that you can start preparing  well in advance for significant adjustments.  Not everything can be done  instantaneously as the customer changes.  I liked that the book focused  more on customers than on competitors (the overemphasis on outdoing  competitors is a flaw of many academic business books, especially from  Harvard Business School Publishing).  The greatest strength of the book is  a thoughtful discussion of the organizational consequences of creating more  flexible and successfully adaptive enterprises.  I was not convinced that  anticipating change is as impossible as the book suggests, but this ability  to sense and respond is very helpful when you miss (which will certainly  occur in many cases).  If you want to usefully stretch your mind about the  rapid changes in your market, this book is a valuable resource for you.  It  will help you overcome your stalled thinking about how organizations should  focus and operate.  Enjoy 
 I'm not a huge Woody Allen fan.  I don't know why I don't enjoy his films as much as most people do.  This one however is a gem for me.  The satire and social commentary is so dead on.  Allen himself is so gifted in physical comedy.  I wish he made more movies in which he could have showcased his "Chaplin" like qualities.  This one is a winner 
 My daughter needed the film for her political science class.   She really enjoyed the movie and so did I.  Her professor said she made a good choice in films 
 I picked up this book, in part, because of the several ...[good ratings]... Isn't it great when people you don't even know turn you on to a GREAT book? I have always been a movie enthusiast, but recently, having discovered how great DVDs look and sound, I am starting to re-discover my love of movies. I want to know more about how movies work, and how different effects are acheived. This book has been wonderful in helping my understanding of cinema. From the first chapter onward, I have found insights into movies that help me look at them with a slightly different eye: why are the colors like that in this scene? Why is the shot framed like it is? Although this book seems like it could be used as a textbook in a beginning film class, I carry it around with me and read it, and even re-read parts. Thanks for the great tip. Yes a five-star book! Fun to read 
 Emotional Intelligence and Experience Economy are 'new' ways of thinking about business, but, in essence, they have always been around. Emotional Value shows how these concepts can be applied to the often overlooked area  of customer service. Only read this book if you want your company to  survive 
 This is a small USB speaker.  I was surprised at the sound that came out of those small speaker 
 By far, this is AFI's greatest release, period, if you don't like it, go kiss Raf. "No Dave Party" is an effing great instrumental track, if ya don't know where it is, ya better start looking for it. Every single song on this album is perfect, this is my favorite album of all time. This is the last album with the classic line-up and how fitting that it's their best, no? Geoff went on to play in Tiger Army, he left them and is now in HorrorPops. Geoff's bass playing is superb on this, the Good Stuff to say the least. Mark's guitar playing is pretty good, and Adam's drumming is the fast stuff. Now, good old Davey, the DXH. People will complain and say "He sounds like he's on elium" and that "His voice is too high". Well, the man was 20 when he recorded this, what d'ya expect? The lyrics are really good too, if you look closely, it's got some pretty good straight edge stuff on it. Then it's got the typical outcast, teen fury stuff. If you're a pissed off teenager and dig the real hardcore stuff-7 Seconds, Minor Threat, Black Flag, etc.-not that fraudcore Atreyu, From First To Last crap you should get this. So yeah, best album ever, buy it.   JX 
 I am eleven years old, and I love Miss Nelson Has a Field Day because it was funny and interesting. I liked it when Miss Viola Swamp called one boy, "Smarty".  It made me laugh!!  I think other kids should read this because it is a really good book. I think it is even better than the first two Miss Nelson books. All kids would love this book! 
 Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques  As our characters enter in to the second half of the Tribulation, Satan takes possession of Carpathia, as predicted in the book of Revelations. It took forever in the book for it to actually happen though. The book picks up right at the end of #6, Assassins, where Carpathia is killed, and the entire scope of book 7 encompasses not much more than three days.   As followers stream in from all over the world for Carpathia's over-the-top funeral, his closest advisors try to figure out who killed Carpathia. The authors will take readers on quite a trail as they try to guess who really did it. I figured it out almost immediately, but it was interesting to follow the different threads throughout hinting at different possibilities.   However, it seemed a long book to get through three days if you ask me, but I'll keep reading. I've gone too far to stop now! 
 This book offers persuasive arguments for increasing mathematical literacy, as if we needed much convincing. His case is presented by way of a varied set of examples that drive the point home... eventually. This is because it often feels as if the author is showing off how clever he can be, and the text tends to wander off a bit too self-referentially into the esoterics of the example at hand.  For a more focused version of his ideas, I urge you to read another one of his books: "A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper" 
 Love this comforter...It is just the right weight for what we needed..and fits the duvet cover perfectly...came faster than I expected, which of course thrilled me.. 
 I love this bra ... just the right amount of support.  Order arrived 4 days before expected ... woo hoo!! 
 This comic- excuse me, 'graphic novel' is part of one of my favorite series. The artwork is OK, but some of the characters look a little odd at certain angles. However, the slight flaws in the art disappear form your mind as you get wrapped up in the plot and the new characters- Durge (he's really cool, even though he's really evil) and Asajj Ventress (who isn't technically new because she appeared on Volume 1. This was the first time she and Obi-Wan met) This one also interested me because Obi-Wan was the most featured character. Everyone mostly thinks about Anakin and his turn to the dark side, and not about the other important and interesting characters, like Mace Windu, Obi-Wan, Quinlan Vos, Darth Maul (yeah, he didn't last that long, but wasn't he cool anyway?) and General Grievous. At least Vol.1 had a lot of Mace in it. Anyway, the first story is about the Seperatists bio-weapon, and the first Obi-Wan vs Ventress fight. The second story is about Obi-Wan's mission to find the antidote to the weapon, and he teams up with four jedi legends to do it. We learn about their histories breifly, then a detailed acount of "how their histories ended" anyway, as a lame way to finish this, this is good. Buy it with vol.1.  
 I stumbled upon this title last summer while searching Amazon for something interesting to read. Skipping over it at that point for one reason or another, however, I was again recommended this text as a supplement for a Linguistics course in which I am enrolled this fall. This is certainly no textbook in Linguistics, but it does serve as an interesting, easy-to-read work that makes contemporary, Chomsky-driven Linguistics (especially with regard to Universal Grammar and Cognitive Science) highly accessible. Pinker's writing, while sometimes manic and even unclear, still manages to captivate and seize attention easily in the same manner as other recent nonfiction texts (Malcolm Gladwell's are two such examples). With an intended audience of linguistic-laymen readers, Pinker has certainly succeeded in making boring textbook linguistics interesting, in furnishing his text with pertinent examples, and in bringing contemporary linguistics to the masses. As other reviewers have noted, one should remain skeptical and critical of Pinker's proposed theories (as is necessary with all such writing), but I would certainly recommend this text to anyone even slightly interested in the subject 
 Going against popular opinion but I thought this was a very good Wesley Snipes movie and for me his best since Blade II. It's better than Blade Trinity where Snipes was reduced almost to a side kick and a few steps up from the messy Unstoppable and dreadful The Marksman. If you liked Drop Zone, Money Train, Murder At 1600 then you should have no problem enjoying 7 Seconds. It's a good thriller with Snipes in top form with some good action sequences and 3 nice martial arts fight scenes by Snipes. I can't understand all the negitivity for this movie. Seagals latest movies get better ratings than this and most of the movies he makes these days are embarrassing!        
 Gordon Wood's book is very insightful in that he tackles a aspect of Benjamin Franklin that has been for too long passed over.  Most mass published books on Benjamin Franklin discuss the process by which Franklin discovered the necessity of splitting with the mother country, but Wood's book is the first one that deals with the "Americanization" of Franklin exclusively.  The topic is important in that this shift in Franklin's ideology played a great role in the shift of the country as a whole in its movement towards independence.    I also enjoyed Wood's insight throughout, and especially toward the end of the book, regarding the role Franklin's life played in forming the underpinnings of our society's veneration for hard work and making something out of nothing.  As the book points out, Franklin was determined to become a "gentleman."  However, in that pursuit, he discovered the value of hard work and respect that accompanies finding success amid seemingly insurmountable odds.  This philosphy is one of the many reasons America is great and Benjamin Franklin (as Wood points) out is almost solely responsible.    Gordon Wood's "The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin" is a great read in that it exhaustively tackles a topic that has been glossed over for too long.    
 Tight DVD, that is worth every penny. My only beef with this DVD is that it is missing some videos, HOME being the one I really wanted that wasnt there, as well as get up and get it. Ohh well, the DVD still has 16 others that are all worth the 16 bucks I paid for it of this site. Anyone thinkin about buyin it, do think stupid, just do it. 
 In June I saw a charming group of roses all begin  to droop I pepped them up with chicken soup! Sprinkle once sprinkle twice sprinkle chicken soup with rice  This is a great book to teach children the months of the year. The repetition of the phrases and the funny little stories with accompanying pictures make for an ideal bedtime read. This isn't nearly as good as some of Sendak's other books (like Where the Wild Things are or Pierre: The Boy Who Didn't Care), but it still carries his unique brand of charm.  
 This set is one of the best from tenorman Hank Mobley as a leader. This stellar, hard swinging lineup features: Mobley on tenor, Grant Green on electric guitar, Wynton Kelly on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and "Philly" Joe Jones on drums. All of the tracks are toe tapping straight ahead hard bop, four of which are Mobley originals, with two standards. While all of these veterans solo with verve throughout, "Philly" Joe Jones seems particularly inspired. His hard charging drum work propelling the group from the very opening of the album. While no real ground is broken with this set, it is sure to get your fingers popping and never bog down. I highly recommend it to all fans of straight ahead hard bop 
 This book easily earns five stars, because it's accurate, well-written, and witty. Don't let the format fool you. The author is well-read and has done an impressive amount of research, so much so that I believe high school and undergraduate students in history or military science could use it as a reference. It's a fun read 
 This CD is my weak-point. This was the first Garbarek`s work I `ve heard and it is still my favourite one. "Psalm" is a breathtaking piece!! 
 I only wish I had the writing talent to come up with a review that would do this story justice.  We've opted not to get a DVD player to entertain the kids in the car.  Instead, we listen to audio books that we pick up from the local library.  "Bud, Not Buddy," was by far the most wholesome book we've chosen.  In this Audio book, actor, James Avery, reads in a lyrical, better-than-James Earl Jones, voice.   You'll fall in love with Christopher Paul Curtis's clever, funny and, ever-so optimistic orphan, Bud Caldwell, as you follow Bud on a journey through the Michigan of the Great Depression.  The writing is witty and colorful.  Curtis's lovely story will stay with you and leave you feeling hmm hmm goooooooood!  We chose the audio book only as a way to entertain the kids on those long boring drives, but since we are home schooling, this book has become a launching pad for lessons in creative writing, the history of the Great Depression, and, of course, that Great American Institution--Jazz.  
 I had the good fortune of taking a class with Jennifer based on this book. Everything starts with filling your pantry, as she directs in the beginning, and the rest is easy! The recipes are GREAT (shrimp and white bean sage chili, short ribs, ice cream cake roll and Mom's fruit pizza are "must-makes") and not very time consuming. Jennifer's enthusiasm comes through in her great commentaries and explanations. Definitely buy this cookbook - you WILL use it 
 love love love this heating pad...auto turn off is a great feature...4 settings ...the only flaw is that the control thing is pretty big...other than that its great..... 
 This is the 7th or 8th of Smiths wonderful story books I have read. What I enjoyed about 44 Scotland Street, as always, was the richness of character, the foibles, fears and strengths of these multiple and varying people who you feel you know on first aquaintance. The psychiatrist and overbearing mother take therapy to a whole new and perverse level! The narcissistic adonis, the bewildered young lady on a gap, the indecissive gallery manager are just a few of the treats in store. The ending of the book does not tie everything together in a neat package but you have enough at this point to do your own closure on the main actors of the book. A fun read 
 I was familiar with Todd Goldman's "Boys are Stupid" stuff through the t-shirt line, but this little book goes way beyond.  It is so hysterical!  I've got it on my coffee table in my office, and everybody who comes in is drawn in by the title, won't stop laughing and just can't put it down 
 Lorenzo Smythe has to be one of the best examples of a character you love to loathe in the beginning, and winding up loving by the middle. The way that Smythe, like so many of Heinlen's first person narrators, reveals things about himself, sometimes inadvertently, is just as interesting as the stories he tells. "Double Star", as far as I'm concerned, is his Heinlen's virtuoso performance of narration, and a terrific plot to go with it 
 This really cool "prequel" answers once and for all the burning questions you have been harboring about the man-child who lives in Neverland with other little boys.  No, no - not THAT one, I'm talking about Peter Pan, the fairy-loving, pirate-hating leader of the Lost Boys. (Same thing, you say - but that's a different story altogether)  It seems that Peter Pan was an orphan, who was put aboard a ship with other orphaned boys, en route to a shortened life of serving the evil King Zarboff the Third, when a chance meeting with a little girl and a mysterious crate leads to a wonderful adventure beyond his wildest dreams.  The answers to the following questions are just 480 well-spaced quick-turning pages away:  1.	How did Peter Pan get to Neverland? 2.	Where the heck is it anyway? 3.	Where does pixie dust come from and why is it addictive? 4.	Tinkerbell - fairy who looks like Julia Roberts or bird brain? 5.	Mermaids - fish or just plain foul? 6.	What made the natives restless? 7.	Should you ever give a crocodile a hand?  An often funny, action-packed piratical yarn that's sure to delight most young readers.   Amanda Richards, October 19, 2006 
 President Lyndon Johnson's tapes are exactly why modern presidents might want to leave the recorders off. We can read all kinds of conversations here- from his domestic problems with civil rights, to his election, to the war in Vietnam. We also can see how tender he was towards his wife, while still having affairs with other women. Michael Beschloss does us all a favor by providing transcripts of the tapes' key moments in the first two years of LBJ's presidency, with background material to explain all of their significance. Vietnam War researchers and U.S. history buffs will need to make this book a guaranteed spot on their shelves. Please note, too, that the auditapes are also available- but not all of the material in the book is found on the tapes

 Fast-paced and fun!  Pulp heroes, zombies, deadly gasses -- you name it and it's in here.  Once you start reading you're not gonna want to put it down 
  "Stretching Scientifically" is as mentioned in other reviews not the best organized book on stretching, but in my opinion it needn't be. The goal of the book is not to give you a specific program for such and such sports (although a couple of examples are given) but to give you a thorough underdstanding of the priciples of stretching. If you understand the theory and principle of stretching, then you can apply those to any specific stretch routine making it better.   The theoretical information in the first chapter is not, as another reviewer stated, "filler". It may not be very necessary to understand it to the fullest, but it gives insight into stretching which in return will give you a better stretch. Also he documents all his statements and gives references all the way through the section which gives the reader a reference for further reading and also gives the text an air of authenticity and authority. Something worth doing is worth doing well, someone once said, and it is also true here.   All of the excercises shown in the book are simple and easy to do and will create results if you ACTUALLY DO THEM. I've been training Chinese martial arts for many years, so I was flexible to start with, but after following Kurtz' book for only a month I saw great results. Especially the dynamic stretching routine which can be made anywhere at any time is worth more than words can express. It makes the body loose and supple and keeps you flexible in only a few minutes a day. If only you do it.   There are of course bad things about the book. The drawings in the specific routines are of matchstick men doing the excersises which I don't care for (you can perfectly understand what you're supposed to do, it just looks bad), and the layout in general is not as good as it could be. But these are only small things and has no bearing on the important things in the book: the information on stretching.    Highly recommendabl 
 I think anyone who solves serious problems by analyzing data will want to own a copy of this book.  Being able to organize data into the right visual image can often make no less a difference than that between seeing the answer to the problem vs. getting lost in the complexity and variation in the data.  This is a uniquely comprehensive encyclopedia of graphical techniques with just enough detail on each technique to help you choose the right one for each situation.    There are no long, detailed explanations of principles.  What you get are a few illustrations of each type of graph, with a general description of the strengths of that particular technique and several variations to show how it could be applied to different situations which share some central similarity.  One review criticized the alphabetic listing of the techniques, which is a reasonable critique in general.  However I think the weakness is mitigated significantly by the way the graphs are grouped together into broad categories once you get to those.  The alphabetically listed individual headings are mainly for cross-reference.  It seems clear to me that the book wasn't intended to be read from front to back alphabetically, but that the reader would have a rough idea what sort of graph they needed, would start with the heading for that category, and then when neccessary, would refer to the cross-referenced section alphabetically.  In any case, I found it useful to place sticker-tabs on the pages for the main categories of graph that I care most about, and use those tabs as my starting place for choosing the right graphic.    There are about ten broad categories of graphs I usually care most about, such as bar, area, column, line, and point graphs, control charts, statistical distribution charts, and time/activity charts.  In addition there are about another dozen or so big categories of topics about graphs in general, such as choosing the right aspect ratio, the right font, and the right scale.   Don't get the wrong idea here, none of these topics is covered in great detail, this book is wonderful *index* to visual techniques for showing data for operational purposes but it is not a detailed how-to or an academic treatise on the individual techniques.  Also, the book is not intended for creating flashy presentation or marketing graphics, nor does it cover argument maps, truth maps, or any other single sort of conceptual maps in any great detail (although it does touch on the topic in general).    A welcome bonus is that the bibliography is particularly well selected, and not just a list of popular books on graphs.  Some of his references are difficult to get and I suspect that some of these sources may even out of print, but some of them like Tukey's work and William Cleveland's texts are well worth searching for.    This is an indispensible encyclopedia of operational information graphics for helping you to help data tell its own story in its clearest and most revealing light, whether you are trying to manage the quality of a process or track down the source of a problem.  The examples are extremely well chosen and representative, and the explanations are concise and helpful in a way that lets you use this as a quick reference and not just as a textbook.     
 Whether people like him or not, there's no doubting that this man is a musical genius! He started his career as a rock star aiming his music towards white teens but everyone of all races and ages was curious as to who this little man was. When he realized how much attention he could get from people just by being different, he figured why not try different things like movies. If you're from the '80's then you have at least seen 2 out of the three movies that were made and you owned at least one album. I loved him then and still do today, and I'm not alone, I've been to his recent sold out concerts. Don't hate because he's different, learn to embrace and appreciate the differences!   
 Mark Twain's time-machine drops the main character in this book in the 6th century of King Arthur's Great-Britain. What he sees is a nation of slaves under the heel of king, Church and noble ('a privileged class is but a band of slaveholders'): 'sweat blood for them, starve that they might be fed, work that they might play, go naked that they might wear silk and jewels, pay taxes that they might be spared from paying them.' But the slaves were so poor-spirited that they took the thanks (cuffs and contempt) and the attention they got as an honor. They were completely under the spell of the Church: 'a united Church means death to human liberty, and paralysis to human thought ... in two or three little centuries it had converted a nation of men to a nation of worms... she invented 'divine right of kings'; she preached (to the commoner) humility, obedience to superiors, the beauty of self-sacrifice, non-resistance under opression and she introduced heritable ranks and aristocracies.' No wonder that the nobility, 'tyrannical, murderous, rapacious and morally rotten as they were, were deeply and enthusiastically religious.'  In order to fight against the forces of darkness and to free mankind Hank Morgan creates teacher factories. But he is confronted with the problem of heridity and social conformism: 'There is no such thing as nature; it is merely heredity and training. All that is original in us can be covered up and hidden by the point of a cambric needle, all the rest inherited from a procession of ancestors that stretches back a billion years.' His teacher schools liberate only a few dozens of pupils. With their help, he has to dynamite the whole British aristocracy in order to install his ideal of universal suffrage ('when every man in a State has a vote, brutal laws are impossible').  This comical science fiction story is ultimately a very actual political diatribe against exploiting privilege, pure indoctrination and class (in)justice.  A must read 
 Good book to introduce children to this holiday.  In the back is a Lunar calender.  I read at school so made copies of the calender and we marked which year the children were born in.  Such as I was born in the year of the rat or a horse etc. The children loved it.        
 Being from chicago, the new colony six where the second most popular local bang in the late 60's only the buckinghams got more national attention.   This CD combines their last 2 albums on Mecury Records "revelations" and "attacking a straw man" . Most people will know the hits from the first album "i will always think about you" and their biggest national hit " things i'd like to say". its good clean pop sound, happy and carefree no anti war messages here, just fun and toe tapping/sing along songs......hope you like as much as i did when i bought the 8-track tapes in '68 and '69 
 I was afraid I would mess up and delayed the changeover , but when I started the change it turned out to be very easy (following the directions given) 
 "Daphnis and Chloe" is one of the best known early Greek romances, precursors to the modern novel. Admired by Goethe, it has been reinterpreted in music and art by Ravel and Chagall.  Written by Longus in the second century A.D, it is a classical romance involving the adventures of two foundling children raised by adopted parents who are humble shepherds in the idyllic setting of the Isle of Lesbos. It is a famous love story that captures the awakening of a first love between two teenagers who don't know what is happening to them. The novel that is written almost two thousands years ago is surprisingly modern; it is erotic, tender, romantic, sensual, and simply beautiful. When I read it first time many years ago (I was very much into the ancient art, literature, history, and philosophy), I asked myself why the literature and art did not stop right there and then - nothing better could be possibly done. It is not true, of course but it was one of the rare moments that you'd like to capture and cherish forever. Last month while visiting the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, I bought a miniature book that includes a suite of 42 Lithographs created by Marc Chagall (1887-1985) to illustrate "Daphnis and Chloe". Chagall's visual interpretation of the Greek pastoral romance of the 2nd (or 3rd) century AD is unique and unforgettable. Even if you don't like Chagall's style, you will not be able to forget it. With his 42 Lithographs, Chagall created a monument to both, Longus and himself. "Daphnis and Chloe" is known as one of the great illustrated books of our time. 
 Why we can`t wait is written in the same style as all of Martin Luther`s writings. It is rhetorical and gripping. It states clearly and leaving no room for doubt the requirements of the [Black] people and the forms of their oppression. It is a fairly short book (A bit over 100 pages) and can be read within a short space of time giving a powerful, if slightly repetitive idea of why he was moved to fight for the rights of his people 
 Joe Cocker is my all time favorite and he just gets better as time goes by.Something about his voice that nobody else can duplicate. Sure wish he could do more 
 For the price it's a nice dress.  Check your size carefully.  I'm normally a 29 waist in jeans, usually size 6, sometimes an 8.  I ordered a Large and it fits with only a little room, but a Medium would have been too small.  Slim through waist and flares out to the sides more than I expected it to.       
 Company is, to say the least, an unusual show. What is it, really? Certainly a brilliant musical, by Stephen Sondheim. But it's taken a very special place in Broadway Lore, thanks in great part to the Cast Album that was recorded in front of D.A. Pennebaker's cameras.  If you're an aficionado of Broadway, you already know a lot about Sondheim. So, it's fascinating to see the young composer coaching his singers and consulting with the recording engineers during this marathon session from 1971.   It's a truly exciting and vibrant look at the process, shot entirely hand-held, with raw focusing and close ups on the vocalists. The performances are for the microphones, not the lenses, so you see quite a few candid moments throughout the evening, and this gives the film a heightened intensity, and even moreso because the whole thing runs just under an hour.  Still, if you have played and played the cast album, it's very refreshing to see the alternate takes shown here. Dean Jones emoting on "Being Alive" is as incredible a performance as you'll ever view, and Elaine Stritch's "Ladies Who Lunch" recording is the lynchpin on which this whole film is hung.  My only complaint about this DVD is the "commentary" track. Granted, this commentary track was done particularly well. Some statements were clearly scripted, like the ones that filmmaker Pennebaker makes at the opening. Also commenting are Hal Prince, Broadway Director extraordinaire, who has some interesting insights and Elaine, the superstar diva, just being her gabby self. They carefully drop comments in where it doesn't take away from the original interview moments in the film, and there's a minimum of rambling, which is all too typical of such tracks on other DVDs.   But the fact is, this commentary track should have been a complete and separate interview section, perhaps gathering a few more of the participants, and sitting them down in a room for a chat. It would have been another chance for Pennebaker to roll more film in revisiting this alchemical moment in time. Ah well, there's very little to complain about here!  If you're even mildly interested in documentary filmmaking, Broadway shows, Cast Albums or Sondheim, you know what you must do: Get this disc!  Highly Recommended 
 First published in 1985, Origins of Life by Freeman Dyson, is a great introduction into the most accepted theories on the origins of life. It was almost universally assumed that the first organisms sustained themselves, in a very hostile world 3 eons ago, by replicating themselves. A brief introduction into the three main theories of replication, a precise chemical process a molecule uses to make an exact copy of itself, is laid out in the first two chapters. Dyson then presents his own theory as to the possibility that the first organisms didn't replicate, but sustained themselves via metabolism, in the form of simple enzymes. He theorized that replicating organisms used the pre-existing enzymes as hosts later on.  In chapter three, he presents a "simple" mathematical model as a basis for biologists to create their own experiments to, if nothing else, prove him wrong (Dyson is a theoretical physicist and this work attempts to bring together thinking from different scientific fields). The last chapter was the best, bringing philosophy into play. For example, he debates the notion that replication of human behavior is not a very exact process, but very fault tolerant instead. In fact, he surmises the first replicating organisms were probably sloppy at the job. If that notion excites you, buy this book! Mr. Dyson attempts to make this book readable for the layman, but does not define what monomers or nucleotides are. This book is not for everyone. A rudimentary understanding of biology would help, but I made it with only a dictionary. I didn't even attempt to follow the math in chapter three, and the author was apologizing for its simplicity!

 This was a great movie, with the next generation only finally. They obviously took this movie seriously and what more can I say. Alice Krige was deliciously evil as the Borg Queen. You couldn't help but feel drawn to her in a fatal, demented way. You almost felt sorry to see her "die" in the plasama coolant in the engine room in the end. Jonathan Frakes did a terrific job along with Zimmerman at bringing out the horror of the Borg. They were truly frightening. It still gives me shivers! Just the perfect villian ever on Star Trek 
 This is definitely not your typical cut and paste job - it is a classy, well-written, interesting photo/guide/memoir to probably the greatest film star of all time.  Is there anyone even CLOSE to Cary Grant working as an actor in Hollywood today (and please don't say "George Clooney")? Grant's remarkable, disciplined, yet seemingly casual, attention to his appearance went deeper than just mere vanity. He was about class, about being a gentleman, about portraying to the world the kind of grace and style this more sordid world today clearly needs. The author has written a lively, interesting account of his life, the development of that style, and tips for the public, that cut deeper than most books of this type. Grant's upbringing was far different than the man he later became - and he literally "created" himself in lasting, memorable film roles, and, later, as the epitome of class, grace, and style. The photos are candid, the writing is sharp and probing, and the tips are timeless. It's a book worth owning, while the man himself, Cary Grant, is worth emulating. It's amazing - and somewhat sad - to think that American cinema once had the likes of Grant, Hepburn, and Astaire gracing our screens. How much we miss not only their style, but their talent and grace. This book reminds us of what he had - and how we might attempt to achieve it for ourselves. Bravo 
 After reading an excerpt of the book in a outdoors magazine, I knew I had to buy and read this entire book. I am not a frequent reader, and I feared that I would end up buying this and not finishing it as I so often do. But I knew just a few pages into the book that I would finish it. I had too many questions that I knew would be answered if I finished it. The only real certain part(having never seen the movie 'Alive!') was that Nando would make it out, since he wrote the book. But past that, I had no idea who would and wouldnt survive and the series of events about to unfold.   I was absolutely riveted. As said in other reviews, I couldnt put it down. There never seemed to be a good stopping point, Because you always wondered what the next step would bring.   Its an amazing story, but not just of survival and the human will to live, But of one mans struggle with the meaning of life and the acceptance of death, and his own discovery that the opposite of death is Love. Remarkable on every account, great detail without being pointlessly gruesome.   I recommend this book to any reader of just about any age 13 and up, or somewhere near there. The only concern would be language.   My only disappointment was the details AFTER escape. There was a nice summary of Nando's life as a whole, but very little about the crash site, what was removed, what was left, What is in the pile of debris that makes up the memorial on the mountain, whether or not the survivors left behind during his 10 day hike DID have to rely on their 'last resort' (discussed the moment he left on his final hike, I wont spoil it for would be readers). I also would have liked a more definitive time-line to help make it easier to follow. Perhaps a full break down at the end of the book of the intial crash and who was lost immediately, and then each person and on which day (or a close estimate) of when they died., more detailed layouts of the landscape and the crash sequence, and perhaps mopre photographs printed that were taken with the instamatic camera they found. And do any items exist today? Such as the sunglasses made from plane visors and copper wire and things of that nature.   But all in all, These are small details that dont detract from the book overall. I give it a strong 5 stars, and will probably read it again to catch any small details I may have missed. Truly amazing in every way. 
 Blink-182 released their breakthrough album in 1999. ENEMA OF THE STATE brought them much needed attention. The Punk/Rock group was given movie soundtrack spots, including for the film American Pie with the bands' track "Mutt". Blink-182 has interesting guitar solos and amusing lyrics. Drummer Travis Barker is the promising musician of the band, and it amazes me that he hasn't aspired to a higher form of music because he would do so well. The band has a unique style of switching singers depending on the songs they perform. The record is at times repetitive, but after awhile the sound changes. As a whole, ENEMA OF THE STATE is a good Punk/Rock album 
 When I visit Amazon.com, they know of my musical tastes and make recommendations of things I might like. Sometimes I like their suggestions, sometimes I don't. One of their latest suggestions was a Boards of Canada CD entitled "The Campfire Headphase." I'd never heard of BOC, but I read a few reviews and and purchased the disc.  The Boards of Canada CD doesn't really fit my tastes in music at all, except that it is in the electronica genre and I find a lot of such music interesting and enjoyable. This particular disc is  quite soft, gentle, mellow, innocuous and not especially interesting. This is not to say that I don't like the CD. I do like it. I'd say it's very backgroundish music, but in an unusual and rather pleasant way.  Electronica elevator music, but strictly for a high-class office building. Some of the songs would make interesting background music to be played while an upscale firm has you on hold on the telephone. I found the disc to offer slow, soft, pleasant and rather peaceful music. Altogether, the CD has fifteen tracks, but three of the tracks are throwaway bits lasting about a minute each. The CD would be better without them. Most of the tracks are pleasant and easy to listen to, but "Sherbet Head" has some annoying sound effects that grate on my nerves.  Of all the tracks, I would regard "Peacock Tail" as the best. Not bad, at all. Rather good, in fact. I may enjoy this disc more and more as I listen to it more often.  Well, would I recommend this disc? Hmmmmm. I first listened to it at the end of a long hard day. It was late at night and I was tired, weary and marinating in a good Shiraz. Under these circumstances, I found the music to be quite soothing and relaxing and a nice way to end a hectic day. Would I listen to the music under more normal circumstances? Not too likely as I tend to prefer harder-edged music. But, It's a good disc for the right moment or mood. Take a listen, then decide for yourself 
 Hull is known as THE expert on the options and derivatives.  I found the book easy to read and the examples are insightful.  However, the book is not meant for skimming.  One needs to focus on the material or important insight will be missed.  I have had to re-read some portions of the chapter to completely understand what Hull is saying 
 This is an intimate account of what one woman goes through after having a heart attack.  I was surprised about how much I enjoyed it.  It is has a great deal of clinical detail of the illness, but it is mostly about the recovery process, the slow, hard, and difficult recovery from the insult to the body.  Reading about someone who can't do the basic acts we all take for granted makes it easier to count your own blessings 
 Definitely THE most comprehensive guide to Karma for the Western mind.  Dr. Jonn Mumford does a wonderful job presenting a great many aspects of Karma and how it APPLIES to your life.  Each chapter is very easy to  understand and includes great little stories that help you fully grasp how  each aspect of Karma works.  The exercises at the end of each chapter  provide a very powerful tool for critical self analysis, a must for  preparation for the "Karma Workout", The Nine Day Karma Clearing  Program.  This program is the most powerful practical approach to changing  your life I have seen.  It is definitely a challenge, but Dr. Jonn Mumford  provides the way to achieve it.  I can't wait to start clearing my Karma 
 It appears that Stephan was dealt a bad hand of cards from birth.  For some reason maybe even biological the pathway between other people & his own heart & soul has been blocked or worse yet never existed.  However music & perhaps a high concept of friendship are a distant bridge from the heart of Stephan to the rest of the world.  It is significant that the greatest favor he can do for one close friend in this world is to help him leave it.  In life, Stephan is the poorest of the poor,but we hope he can see lights beyond the farthest stars    
 This book has practical advice for all diabetics. Judith McQuown does for diabetes tips what Heloise did for household hints--and the tips are just as amazing! The tips are so well-organized, helpful, and interesting that I couldn't put the book down. This one not only becomes part of my diabetes library, but earns a spot on my night-stand.  1001 tips.  Think about that.  That is a TON of tips.  This book can be read from beginning to end very smoothly because of the organization.  Or, you can simply flip it open, start anywhere, and skip around.  I really do love it.    The author is not a health care professional and this book doesn't come across as health education.  This book has warmth, doesn't lecture, and comes from a fellow diabetes patient who has faced the same challenges and experiences as the rest of us.  The tips range from saving on prescriptions to budgeting to living alone.  Us readers are fortunate, however, because she is apparently very talented at researching, interviewing, finding answers/solutions, and presenting information in a pleasing and well-organized way.  I'm so glad I got the opportunity to read this book.  I am the editor of Diabetic Mommy Online Magazine and highly recommend this book to my members.  
 There aren't all that many silent films that hold up well in this day and age, but "Piccadilly" is an exception.  An interesting plot, dealing with sex and murder, and the allure of Anna May Wong make this film worth your while.  A nightclub owner, Mr. Wilmot, sees his fortunes decline after, out of jealousy, he fires the male dancing partner of Mabel.  Mabel isn't popular enough on her own to sustain the club, and so he offers a Chinese dishwasher named Shosho (played by Wong) a shot at performing.    Shosho's Oriental dance is a big hit with the customers, and she is also a big hit with Mr. Wilmot, replacing Mabel as his love interest.  Wilmot's relationship with Shushu stokes jealousy in both Mabel and Shushu's Chinese ex-boyfriend.  Anna May Wong makes the film with her formidable stage presence and radiant beauty.  She is very, very sexy in this film. When she is on the screen, you can't take your eyes off of her!   It is very interesting to see how sex was censored in those days.  In one scene, where Shushu invites Wilmot up to her room, she very seductively streches out on her couch. Her sexy tease goes on until the two seem to explode in passion. But just as their faces are about to meet in a violent kiss, the scene comes to an abrupt end and we are shown Wilmot leaving her apartment in the morning.  [Unfortunately, the makers of this DVD have a drawing of a topless Anna May Wong on the DVD case.  This is false advertising as she does not appear topless. (There is no nudity in the film.)]           
 How many pictures will it store?  It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.    The Kingston 128MB Secure Digital Memory Card, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera,  64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.  These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.  I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs 
 Somehow ATDI keep getting labeled as a pop punk or emo band. Pop punk bands write songs that are easy to listen to, and that people can relate to. Emo bands have become essentially pop punk bands but darker and edgier. At The Drive-In's songs are neither easy to listen to, or easy to relate to. From obstinate lyrics (Widows! An antique replacement/Widows! A briefcase filled with Mace/Widows! Six legged lost and found, found")to the bilingual lyrics ("Tour de force! Tour de force! De facto! Ayachuco! Ayachuco! Ayachuco!"), nothing about this album is easy. But it is oh so rewarding. Omar A Rodriguez-Lopez is a brilliant guitarist/songwriter/producer/musician, Cedric Bixler is a great singer (though more raw here than on the Mars Volta's recordings), Jim Ward is an excellent rhythm guitarist and backup vocalist, and the other two Sparta guys no one talks about aren't too bad either. This is more listenable than the Mars Volta, but far more engaging than Sparta's fairly bland releases. Anyone who says ATDI are a pop punk band are wrong. In fact, anyone who tries to stick a label on ATDI are wrong--this is just good music 
 I browsed the web for  a movie name which has two american teenagers jailed in thailand(not their fault) for drug offence and i liked a song in that called remember me and i wanted to know who sang that . That is how i got introduced to the world of sarah brightman. From then onwards i got hooked on to her music. She is just superb. I recommend her dvd's and music cd's to any one 
 This is everything a true Scion of Bradbury could ever seek in a biography. Weller's writings reminded me of childhood curiosities, idle musings on the nature of my favorite author, and just as he incites such queries, he anticipates and satisfies them within paragraphs. The layout is such to explain the development of Bradbury's indidivual works without disrupting the chronological explanation of a truly unique and significant life. Want to know why Bradbury considers himself a fantasy writer instead of sci/fi, and how he differentiates the two? Curious as to the nature of the police encounter which inspired Fahrenheit 451 (or indeed where Bradbury found the specific temperature?) Whether you grew up on Bradbury or came to know him later in life, this book will enlighten your mind as to the inner workings of one of the greatest authors alive today 
 Night is Wiesel's personal memoir, which relates his personal story before and during World War II, as he and his father are separated from his mother and sister and interned in a series of concentration camps.   "Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never."   I read Night in high school, and always think of it as being a particularly long book, which it is not. Wiesel manages to pack more than I would think possible into a little over a hundred pages, which relates the story of himself and his family during the Holocaust. It is a beautifully written work that relates a terrible story. I found the story of Wiesel's loss of faith and the relationship he had with his father particularly memorable. If you somehow missed this in high school, pick it up, if you didn't, find it again. It's worth it 
 The new DVD sharpens the film up considerably. The Theatrical Trailer is included along with a cartoon and Hollywood short that don't have much of anything to do with this great film. As before, I mentioned that I had hoped that all the film would be put back together and although this is a little better there is still some cutting, including the Oklahoma Indian Land Deal Peace Pipe smoking scene which is still missing here. This film was the biggest money maker in 1940. It won an academy award for special effects and deserved it. Why can't we have the whole production on film?  Anyway, I still recommend the film for entertainment value. They don't make films for pure fun anymore but this was one of them 
 Book in good shape. Shipment arrived at a good time. Nothing to complain about 
 I really enjoyed this book and found it suspenseful so I don't understand all the negative reviews... but it is also my first Frank Peretti book.  I suppose if you were hoping to be scared out of your wits you'd be disappointed.  I loved the detail and the characters - I recommend this one! :-) 
 Larry gives good insight into COT report. It will open you your eyes, because you will know why the price change. With COT you will know what the big guys are doing and that is very important for trading.  There insn't much stuff for stock, almost all is dedicated for commodities.. 
 Things never seem to go right for Yorick Brown, the last man on Earth.  Nearly two years ago, a mysterious plague wiped out every mammal with a Y chromosome except for Yorick and his pet monkey Ampersand.  Along with the mysterious Agent 355 and geneticist Dr. Allison Mann, the trio is going to California in order to get to some research that could be mankind's last hope.  After the mysterious events of the mini-arc known as Comedy & Tragedy, 355 and Dr. Mann leave Yorick in the care of one of 355's former colleagues, Agent 711 (remember that the numbers are pronounced Three-Fifty-Five and Seven-Eleven, making for a great one-liner) while the two ladies go to a hospital to help the wounded Ampersand.  Of course, something unexpected occurs, and Yorick has to question certain things that he once believed.  We also get a glimpse into the history of the Brown family, including a hint at a traumatizing event in his sister Hero's past. Furthermore, yet another militant women's group makes an appearance, though this one has a much different political agenda than ones previously seen.  The end leaves Yorick in a strange place emotionally that will be very interesting to explore in future issues. As usual, Brian K. Vaughan doesn't disapoint.  The story remains engaging, and the humor is great, while the overall dark tone remains.  The art is great, and may even be improving.  If you haven't started Y yet, get on it soon 
 This book was recommended to me by my therapist after realzing that members of my family have this disorder-- and also that as a result I, too, display characteristics of it.  It gave me tremendous insight to the causes of this behavior and constructive ways to deal with it.  Also to understand what behaviors are acceptable and healthy and which ones are not-- something I was greatly confused about!  I highly recommend it 
 This cd is hard for the average rap dumbass to handle. So this is not for you. This cd is for anyone who likes creativity, intelligence, and heart in their music. Buy all of his cd's and actually listen to them.  Play them in rotation like the radio plays out every weak garbage 50 cent G-Unit songs. If you still don't like the dude then im sorry for you. My top 7 from this cd are: 1.) Nazareth Savage (kills it)       2.) You Know My Style (That's Flawless) 3.) Street's Disciple ft. Olu Dara (classic) 4.) Thief's Theme (old nas) 5.) Rest of My Life Ft. Amerie (nice cadence) 6.) Reason (anoter good message from nasir) 7.) These are heros (Haha i love yes masta WB) Love how he tells us who he think was "Real to him" Red Foxes. Gives credit to Tiger Woods, Cuba Gooding Jr, and Taye Diggs. 8.) Virgo ft. Ludacris and Doug E. Fresh (haha yea thats how the Virgo works) These are just a few of the great tracks on this cd. The whole cd is a good listen. ANOTHER CRAZY THING I HEARD IN THE COMBO SONGS SEKOU STORY AND LIVE NOW SCARLETT IS ACTUALLY NAS WITH HIS VOICE PITCHED UP. MAKES SINCE CUZ FLOW SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING HED SAY.  
 This book was more than I had expected it to be.  It was a fun read and helped me feel "normal" in a world where I struggled with weight loss.  I recommend this read to anyone who is undergoing or will undergo weight loss surgery as a learning tool 
 A great guide on creating a cottage garden for those new to gardening 
 Released prior to his more familiar synth-laden jazz fusion offerings, this vibrant recording features Corea exclusively utilizing the electric piano to produce a quietly joyful sound.  The title track starts quietly with soft e. piano cadences, joined by Airto Moreira's innovative percussion.  Flora Purim, at the peak of her vocal abilities, insinuates herself into the mix, using her elegant voice as an instrument, segueing into a Joe Farrell flute solo.  The song diminishes and slows back to a Corea solo, then speeds into an effective blend of keyboard chords and Stanley Clarke's melodic driving bass. "Crystal Silence" features Farrell's delicate soprano sax.  "What Game Shall We Play" features words by Corea's longtime lyricist Neville Potter, which are brightly sung by Purim with a decidedly upbeat Latin edge.  "Sometime Ago-LaFiesta" spotlights each member of this extremely gifted band as they start out in a wistful ballad moving into a musical rendering of a Spanish Festival.  Recorded in February, 1972 for ECM records, "Return to Forever" was produced by Manfred Eicher 
 I don't know how many spoons my husband bent while he was scooping his gourmet ice creams.  Nevertheless, I never really considered buying an ice cream scoop or spade - afterall, a spoon was good enough for my parents, so why not for us.  However, tennis elbow set in and my spouse needed something that would allow him to dig into the hardest ice creams.  I needed something to round out an Amazon order so that I qualified for a $25 discount and voila - this ice cream spade was the answer to both our needs.  We love it - it's sturdy, well made and we're thrilled with this "accidental" purchase that turned out to be an absolute necessity 
 Although I have never suffered from ADHD, this book paved the way to understanding the impact of sugar on my body. By eliminating sugar (as much as possible), incorporating flaxseed and flax oil into my diet, reducing stress and receiving regular chiropractic care, I have truly transformed my life. Gone are the irregular periods that plagued me for over 25 years, gone are the severe menstrual cramps and mood swings, gone are the fears of having to have a hysterectomy - all without having to take a single drug or pill that many doctors recommended. I can't thank Dr. Bob enough for helping me realize that I needed to take responsibility for my own health, educate myself and listen to my body. This book will provide many suggestions for improving your health naturally - the decision to follow them and enjoy a healthier life is yours 
 I have bought several copies of this book to give to people who mean something to me.  When I share a poem from this work I am often questioned about "where did you find that"?  The range is enormous and the  selection of latin poetry in particular is just great. (Even the  translation versions are selected carefully)  The authors had a great sense  of passion, humor and sensuality in their selections.  I don't care if  someone else thinks their favorite poem is missing...If I had just one book  of poetry to keep this would be it 
 The title of the book is Isaac Newton. Isaac Newton was a young boy who was born on Christmas.He was interested in models when he was young, but in the future is intriguement changed. Soon he became interested in other things.Thru his youth, he transferred form many schools. In the future when he was studying, he decided to start inventing. This story takes place in many settings such as, his home, Trinity University, so on.The theme of the book is go out and learn. I give the book 4/5. 
 ENLIGHTENED NATIONALISM is a profound and lucid account of how nationalism arose in Germany by tracing its roots to Prussia in the early 1800's after Prussia's defeat by Napoleon.  The author's research is based on his groundbreaking analysis of previously unavailable documents.  He carefully describes the interplay between King Frederick III, his aristocratic advisers -- some liberal, others staunchly reactionary -- the traditionalist landed nobility, and the growingly restive citizenry in the struggles over whether and how to grant Prussia a constitution.  The book's well-documented insights help us understand how Prussia later came to dominate Germany 
 This is one of the first and arguably among the best of the Shlomo Carlebach albums. It is, however,an early recording. As such, it does not include many of the stories or narratives that find their way, so beautifully onto the later albums. Still, however, it is a wonderful first taste- of what ultimately developed into a World wide revolution within Jewish music. It is an important album in every sense of the word, and should serve as a first installment on a collection. Those who are interested in further information and further exposure can and should contact any local Jewish book store- where they will also find copies of several related books-"Holy Brother," and "Shlomo Stories." An additional source of information if the Carlebach synagogue, Kehillat Jacob in Manhattan 
 Skilful means was a technique employed by the Buddha to enable his disciples to awaken, or to be saved from danger which relied on bribes, inducements, threats or half truths - just as a parent may employ on a young child.  For example, once the Buddha promised one of his monks divine nymphs if he would meditate - eventually after that monk awoke, the Buddha was freed from his promise.  What if the entire often complex teaching of the Buddha was skilful means, merely a complex advertisement or device to draw people in - given they would only truly comprehend reality after they had themselves pierced the veil?  What if the teaching had no inherent truth at all?  This work tackles not so much compassion or even Skilful Means (Upaya) but the Buddhist attitude towards view and whether Buddhism makes any empirical statements of truth that go beyond a soteriological function.  It spans the spectrum of Buddhism in its search for the development of Upaya, emphasised in the Mahayana approach.  Of the four "heretical" teachers in the Pali Canon, Sanjaya Belatthaputta was caricatured as an extreme sceptic.  Asked e.g., "is the world eternal?" he replied using the fourfold logic: I don't say (i)it is, (ii)it isn't, (iii) it's both yes and no, nor (iv)it's neither yes nor no.  The Buddha is reputed to have asked "Does this apply to your own philosophy?"  One problem that the student will face is that Buddhism itself appears to have aspects of this "eel wriggling" approach.  Schroeder argues, reiterating the famous simile on the raft, that the bulk of the scriptures could be seen as little more than skilful means with no essential propositions.  Whereas Schroeder confines his argument to the realms of Buddhist philosophy and meditation, the idea can extend to our experience of reality and attempts at its reification.  There is nothing especially new in this Upayic approach to Buddhism though what begins like the re-invention of the wheel is quickly superseded by the ramifications of this idea and how it affects our understanding of the teaching.  Schroeder is at pains to be modest stating that the book itself does not represent another skilful means.  The author deepens his approach by clarifying the concept of conventional truth vs ultimate truth that was again enlarged by the Mahayana schools.  One highlight of the book is Schroeder's analysis of the old Abhidhamma approach representing a matrix of postulates on the functioning of mind and meditation; in particular the description of the arising and ceasing of mind moments within a temporal frame.  According to the Sarvastivadins, says Schroeder, the character of the mind moments changed but the essential underlying substance of experience svabhava remained.  The Sautrantika's rejected this as it admitted of a self or atman, but replaced it by stating that only the present is real and that moments arise and cease into nothing.  These arguments encapsulate a paradox found in any search for "ultimate truth".  The latter scheme denies causation by ignoring past conditions and the mechanism of present conditioning.  Nagarjuna and later schools tackled this problem by expanding the concepts of emptiness in phenomena leading to non-duality, important in Zen.  We are taken from the Abhidhamma approach through Vimalakirti and Nagarjuna to Zen including a little on Pure Land.  Each tradition in succession seem in part a one-upmanship of the previous approach, trying at each turn to avoid the impression of clinging to theories and external forms.  The author incorporates elements of Western philosophy and metaphysics into a narrative that is pithy yet engaging and fairly comprehensive. Schroeder is critical of occidental interpretations of Nagarjuna as a philosopher and metaphysician independent of a soteriological aspect.  This is important as more will probably be written on Indian philosophy in the West than ever before. Several scholarly works are cited though a few seem questionable.  Schroeder's unfamiliarity with ancient Buddhism is somewhat betrayed in his assertions e.g., that the fire worshippers the Buddha gave the Fire Sermon to (headed by Uruvela Kassapa) "ritually burnt their own flesh" when there is no precedent that the then fire-worshippers did this.  He also mentions the Buddha to be with the five ascetics who "once lived in the mountains".  In this light, Schroeder's analysis of the Abhidhamma approach to Theravada in terms of "seven stages of purification" may be too fixed belying the diversity of teachings then available.  The original Buddhism was not Theravada and traditions can only be defined by comparison to alternatives and due to degrees of sometimes unfortunate polarisation to retain integrity.  This academic though accessible book, rich in quotation remains somewhat inconclusive at the end though it can be seen that the concept of Upaya in the sense of an absence of fixed teachings probably existed in all traditions.  It will be an invaluable reference and an entertaining read about what the teaching is not.  Perhaps the work could have been rounded off to indicate what Buddhism therefore does amount to and how it may critically hinge on the learner's state of mind.  E.g. When questioned about the Buddha's views and those of his disciples the layman Anathapindaka admits ignorance but does explain his own view (Anguttara Nikaya X.93).  To present Buddhism as merely Upaya could simply entrap us in another view.  The teaching is a means to truth and involves a grounding in skilled qualities of mind like love, energy, concentration, equanimity, emphasised by the Buddha several times - perhaps these qualities could have been scrutinised to see if they represented nouns or verbs.  If they are to be seen as clunky beliefs or potential wings to freedom. 
 This is Carey at his best. This movie is hilarious and the special features are awesome 
 Firebird Books has put out some excellent reprints, such as Midori Snyder's Oran Trilogy and the wonderful Redwall books. But they have outdone themselves with Patricia McKillip's "Moon-Flash" duology. It's bittersweet, beautifully written, and serves as an unusual coming-of-age story.  In the first book "Moon-Flash," Kyreol is a young woman living in the jungle valley of Riverworld, which the inhabitants believe is the entire universe. But while unhappily living with her betrothed's family, Kyreol encounters the strange Hunter, and realizes that he is from somewhere else. And wherever he came from, Kyreol knows that her long-lost mother went there.  So she and her childhood friend Terje escape down the River. When they finally make their way to the Hunter and his people, Kyreol and Terje are taken to a lunar Dome far above their home. Together, they will find that the universe is more complex than they ever knew -- and that nothing in Riverworld, even the sacred Moon-Flash, is what they think it is.  "The Moon and the Face" picks up four years later. Terje and Kyreol have been trained by the Agency, and are now ready for their first assignments. Terje will be accompanying Regny back to Riverworld, to observe its inhabitants, and Kyreol will be going to a nearby planet to observe the lightless Burrowers.  Except neither mission turns out right: Kyreol's spaceship crashes on a desert planet, stranding her in an abandoned city with an unknown alien. To make matters worse, she is plagued by dreams of death. And Terje returns to his old village, only to find that the Healer (Kyreol's father) is dying.   Patricia McKillip began writing the "Moon-Flash" story while she was in the middle of another science fiction book. And like her other sci-fi stories, "Moon-Flash" is light-years away from typical space operas.  McKillip's dreamy, detailed writing is still in full force here, whether she's writing about a lunar base, a rainforest, a graveyard, or a colorless city on an alien moon. Even her aliens are unusual -- some are made of water or air, while others are furry three-eyed creatures who communicate entirely in wordless song.  She also explores the idea of primitive people being exposed to futuristic technology, and the way it would change them -- they would gain knowledge, but lose innocence. The most bittersweet subplot is that of Kyreol's parents, whose love was sacrificed so that her mother could preserve Riverworld. And while Kyreol and Terje seem to learn everything a bit too quickly, McKillip makes their slow education absolutely thrilling.  The first book's main focus is on Kyreol, exploring her doubts, her curiosity, and her longing to know everything. But the second is more about Terje, who struggles with his love for Riverworld and his love for his new life. They grow from naive children to independent leaders and explorers, and in McKillip's hands, it seems entirely plausible.  The "Moon-Flash" duology is a beautiful, spellbinding piece of science fiction, and it's a good thing that this story has finally come back into print. Absolutely entrancing 
 I've purchased many copies of this book for friends who are involved with healing. It provides the yoga poses and complete yoga sequences for each needed type of healing. Presentation is clear and complete. And, even better, there is an excellent index 
 We use these Bibles for a Bible study with prisoners.  Their reading skills are not always known but most seem to handle the Bible and grasp the information fairly well.  They enjoy the study aids and helps 
 Dr. Wansink is a food psychologist who specializes in the investigation of the mental and emotional factors that cause us to eat.  This book demonstrates that we can lose weight, simply by being more mindful of our eating habits.  It contains interesting and humorous case studies that highlight those mindless activities that add 200 or 300 calories to our diet each day and which can add up to 20 or 30 excess pounds in the course of a year.    The author provides practical suggestions at the end of each chapter that will help you to make the simple changes that will allow you to lose 2 or 3 pounds per month without resorting to conventional diet techniques that are doomed to failure.  Although this book is based upon scientific research and extensively end-noted, it is enjoyable to read, easy to understand and quite funny at times.      This book is a great value for the money and the five or six hours that it will take to read it 
 I am a huge fan of Daniel Goleman.  He's the bestselling author who coined the term "Emotional Intelligence" with his 1995 book of the same name.  Now he's got a new book, "Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships."  Social intelligence is the ability to read other people's cues and then act on them.  Life is all about relationships, and there is a science to how we relate to each other.  It's fascinating to see how Goleman breaks down each aspect of communication.  We can learn how to more effectively express ourselves so that we feel understood.  And we can learn how to better "read" other people so that we can better understand.  This helps to improve our interactions and ultimately strengthen our relationships.  He talks about "synchrony" or interacting smoothly at the nonverbal level, which is an important, yet often overlooked, part of relating.  Goleman also scientifically explains "the capacity for joy" and how that affects our social intelligence.  He shows how our resilience plays an important role in our happiness, which comes into play as we express ourselves to others 
 Nursing Nana is a great gift. It is soft and cuddly, and the puppies attach with magnets, giving a realistic nursing "tug" as you attach and detach them. This would be a great gift for a child when a second or third child is being born to take the angst out of mom nursing the new baby. It is a bit smaller than I anticipated, but it is still worth it because it is well-made 
 This is the most precious book for heart healing and understanding available.  It makes you cry and laugh and understand the little things. Thanks 
 This is the version I remember from the 70's, I believe this was Lesley Warren's first movie 
 I bought the first edition of this book just about the time I decided to quit the corporate rat race in the very early 90's. I was then forty three years old. Since then, I have found it - in fact, I have reread it several times - to be a very provocative, entertaining, down-to-earth, and tremendously inspiring book. It also strikes a common chord with me: Like the author, I was trained as an engineer. I simply love the author's personal philosophy as expressed in his wonderful book: We work so hard - and over-value work so much - that we have forgotten how to just live! Life is short! - go and enjoy it all!  I highly recommend this book to all corporate rats who are longing or aspiring to pursue their dreams, to work more productively (by working less), to be financially independent (with less money), embrace enjoyable leisure and pursue "creative unemployment."  
 I liked the book, i thought it was a change from all the usual hating that goes on this country. I don't understand why people think it is the responsibility of one country to make the whole world successful and happy- maybe i am slow, because I really don't see how that can be done. I think this country helps out a lot as far as food and aid in poor countries but I could be mistaken.  This going to sound selfish but why should people in this country worry about how other's perceive them- you can't please everybody. If all the countries in the world were on common ground in every situation- there would still be people who will have negative things to say about the country. I really enjoyed the book but a lot want because it don't have a lot of negative things about America.   
 I bought this book on a whim. For a long time I had been interested in law and wanted to see what studying it was all about. I don't think I could have picked a better place to start. From the word go this book delivered interesting cases with in-depth analysis at the end of each one. The analysis was especially helpful in picking apart the important points of law that the case represented. Now when I watch Law and Order and The Practice, I can tell my girlfriend about what is going on (in the legal parts) and sound like a total know-it-all, which is totally awesome 
 This book was not only well-written and easy to understand, it also provided valuable insight into the world of forensic anthropology.  I highly recommend it to those who wish to know more about the subject without getting into the, no pun intended, bare bones of it.  If you're considering a career in this field, this book is an excellent guide to what the job actually entails 
 This novel is as close to perfect as one could write! Characters, plot, conflict, suspense - all are amazing.. 
 I hesitated ordering this book because a previous reviewer reported that he had found the binding to be inferior. Perhaps this was true in previous bindings, but the copy I recently obtained looks fine in this regard and should stand up to heavy use for some years to come.  I'm finding this an excellent disctionary in all regards, though as a beginner I have not put it to lots of use. Basically I use the New Nelson, with this dictionary as a supplement, especially for compounds. And there are times when this alternate system of radical identification is just easier than the traditional system. 
 This was the first Philip Roth novel that I picked up, and I found it to be a page turner. It was exciting to read and Roth wove such a believable story. I enjoyed it thoroughly; it really did feel as if the events were happening and happening to me. It really opened my eyes to a different era, and this novel has changed my world view 
 A Christmas Memory is short but it is so rich that you will not end feeling deprived.  The writing is so beautiful.  I wanted to just crawl into that story and be there with them.    We had this for a book group and it received a unanimous thumbs up.  Only one other book has done that.  
 This is a great guidebook for photographers because it presents at least one photo of each potential destination.  So you can get a pretty good idea whether it is worth venturing out from your hotel.  The guide is compact and perfect for a one-week trip to Israel.  I used it when on business there and had a few extra days to prepare a photo exhibit for photo.net.  If I were staying a month I'd probably want something thicker.  Students on a budget will want to supplement this with a "How to get around cheaply" guide like the Lonely Planet or Lets Go 
 I was SO glad when this came back in print.  This is a cumulative tale a la "House that Jack Built".  You can get the children chanting "Jump Frog Jump!" in a few pages.  Barton's bright folk-like  illustrations fit right in 
 There is a Bugs Bunny cartoon that has the rabbit running afoul of some dogs in the New York City.  Trapped in an alley, Bugs grabs a book that is nearby for some meager protection; the dogs see the title, perk up joyously and run away.  The name of the book:  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.  I have to wonder if more people have watched the cartoon than read the book that provided its punch line.  Up until recently, I was only in that former group, but not anymore.  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is Betty Smith's semi-autobiographical novel of life in a poor family in the early 1900s.  As the story opens, it is 1912 and Francie Nolan - the protagonist - is eleven years old.  She lives in a small apartment with her father, mother and brother.  Her father Johnny is an amiable enough fellow who nonetheless has sunk into alcoholism.  Rarely employed - and becoming less employable - he is unable to be the family breadwinner.  Katie, his wife, married him more out of lust than love and now is suffering the consequences:  although still young and beautiful, she is suffering from the burden of holding the family together.  Neely, Francie's younger-by-a-year brother, still clings to childhood.  This is the story of Francie's life, and like any life story, it is not driven by plot as much as character.  We see Francie's development from child to young adulthood, while coping with the many problems (and occasional joys) that accompany an impoverished life.  Attending bad schools, going to church, working to support the family at meager wages, even contending with a psychopath:  these are some of the events that occur in Francie's life.  This is an excellent book, well worth the "classic" designation often given to it.  Smith's strengths are with her strong characters and wonderful writing.  Francie, of course, is the centerpiece; a girl who is gifted but may not be able to exploit those gifts in her poor environment.  Yes, there are sad moments in this book, but it is not really downbeat; one can imagine an adult Francie looking back at many of these events with a bit of wistfulness.  Compared to other "great" novels of yesteryear - such as Gone With the Wind, To Kill a Mockingbird or the Grapes of Wrath, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn seems to not get the same attention anymore.  It is, however, a book that is a pleasure to read. 
 I got Bad Boy Ballmer as a present, put it on my bedside table, and picked it up one night last week. I read it all the way through, discovering more about Microsoft than I'd read anywhere else. A tech buddy has his birthday next week. I'm getting him a copy 
 All summaries of its fantastic characterizations & plots aside, reading Middlemarch also made me realize that the power of concentrated and careful observation of human behavior (and the ability to translate that onto the page) that was practiced to perfection by Eliot, and that is the essence of the novel, is a dying art.   No one writes books like this anymore because no one observes this carefully anymore.  Perhaps that is in part because novels like Eliot's laid the groundwork for a typology of characters that can now be referred to in shorthand.  But I think it is also because we no longer find meaning in that kind of contemplation, rather we leap immediately to analyze, ironize, & distance.   It is truly an astonishing piece of work and while I have other favorites, I can think of no better writing in English.  
 I have used his guides for years now. I always enjoy his very frank reviews. I feel the reviews often hit upon key points of the films which help in my decision to watch or not to. Sometimes the reviews are so bad in a funny way you just have to watch!  The book also notes in reviews, actors first "small" appearances in movies (often uncredited), any sequels or remakes are noted, the variety of formats the film is currently available,and a complete listing of popular actors of the past and present movies made in order of release.  You will also find a very handy list of places to find those "hard-to-find" movies! 
 He discusses 9 different regions of America, with a map showing the boundaries. He calls them New England, The Foundry, Dixie, The Islands (of Caribbean/Florida), MexAmerica, Breadbasket (midwest), Ecotopia (west coast), Empty Quarter, and Quebec. He shows how each has its own distinctive culture and economic climate. Published in 1981, but still rather a good read 
 This is one of the most beautiful books I have read in years.  Mda skillfullly evokes the tensions in contemporary South Africa for blacks caught between the tug of Western, technological culture and  their identity in long-standing traditions.  The story is given added substance by Mda's recounting the history of similar tensions from the nineteenth century, thus creating deep emotions that propel the characters.  The story mixes family feuds, spats between the sexes, and sober deliberations about community versus individual choices, all told with a level of humor that underscores rather than undermines the importance of these issues for South Africa today 
 A highly skilled team working for the Imperial Inquisition roots out illegal dug smugglers. Sound overdone except the drugs are tainted with an evil supernaturall power and it's Dan Abnett writing the story.  Truly one of the most underrated SF authors around. If you like military Sf,read this book. If you like adventures of Richard Sharpe, read this book. If you like Star Wars, read this book.  Heck, if you like SF read Ravenor, then do yourself a favor and read the Eisenhorn trilogy. Forget the cheesy covers and find the hidden treasure of an adventure inside. 
 Adrian Streather has compiled the complete owners manual. If it isn't covered between the covers it doesn't exist. The pictures are spot on to assist in understanding the text. This book is not an option but a necessity for the 993 owner 
 This is a great start to the role-playing game Vampire: The Masquerad 
 Truly an excellent piece of research and coherent explanation of suicide bombing. Nuanced and based on field research, I respect what the author did to get the information to write this explanation of the unexplainable as the cover says. High risk field work always generates more interesting accounts and first hand reports deliver a punchier analysis. The author's language skills and willingness to take risks also impressed me 
 Edward Said is famous for being a Palestinian and being a leading polemist on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  Visciously anti-Israel he has caused many scnadals and was a renowned thinker.  His memoir, written when he was sick, is insightful a true tale of what the Palestinian Arab elite looked like on the eve of the 1948 war.  Said was born in Jerusalem, according to him, and was raised in Egypt, with a nanny and drivers, his father was American and had served in WWI, both his families came from Baptist protestant and Anglican backgrounds.  His father made good money in Egypt in a stationary business, employing many of the diverse people that lived there then, including Armenians, Greeks, Copts and Jews.  Today that community isd gone, as is the elite neigborhood where Said grew up and the private schools he attended.  Said was in Jerusalem in Talbieh during 1948.  He recalls the war and its aftermath. He also writes about Lebanon, about the village where he stayed there and travelling in the Middle East as a young boy.  His was a life of luxury, a life that was 'destroyed' by 1948.  His uncle was murdered by the Egyptian police for being a communist.  His parents didnt talk politics, he makes up for that.  An interesting work, helpful for anyone interested in what the Palestinian Arab elite looked like in the 1930s.  Seth J. Frantzma 
 It always amazes me how people see things differently (see other review.)  I agree that this is not one of the more lighthearted & "catchy" Scholastic videos of the lot, but it has SO much to offer.  This is an especially good choice for an older child.  The cover story "Scrambled States of America" is hilarious and has many hidden humors within it that grown-ups will even appreciate.  The other stories that the other reviewer referred to are anything but boring.  Rarely do I want to sit & watch what my kids are watching, but I find that I can't resist this one.  I couldn't believe my ears the other day, when I heard my 4 year old son singing the words to "This Land is Your Land."  And I could NEVER consider Peter Spier's drawings to be boring!!!  As a child I used to sit & stare at his books for hours on end.  The animation to the "Star Spanled Banner" and all the verses that we usually never get to hear are absolutely BEAUTIFUL (sung by Aretha Franklin)!!!  I get goose bumps & cry every time I watch it.  This DVD is very educational.  Bonus stories include John Henry and Johnny Appleseed.  I have to admit, we don't watch this DVD as much as the others, but I love to pull it out on July 4th, Veteran's Day, election day, etc. I never feel guilty letting my kids watch the Scholastic Video Collection 
 What a great little book.  You can digest it in daily chunks and really chew on and apply each principle.  I liked it so much I recommended it on my blog:  [... 
 My only complaint is that, unlike the 2nd edition, which greatly expanded on the 1st edition, including some very useful and clarifying notes by Dawkin's addressing much of the controvery his first edition created, this aniversary edition does not include any new material, other than a new forward.  If you are interested in reading this book, a used second edition copy is as good as this one (skip the first edition -- lacks the last two chapters and Dawkins' comentaries).  The information in this book is worthy of five stars.  It is the finest treatise on natural selection as the prime shaper of an evolutionary process to date. It clearly shows how a complex biological system (like humans) can arise from simple replicating molecules.  It does not refute religious ideas of supernatural creation, but simply provides an alternative explanation via a natural biological mechanism.  It isn't, as some think, ground breaking research -- as Dawkin's says himself, if is more a treatise of existing research.  It's importance is in Dawkin's magnificent writing ability that bridged the technical fields of evolutionary biology and sociobiology to the layman 
 This book is great in this sense that it illustrates the philosophy behind the numbers used in ACI code and the limit states of each design parameter.  It is great for understanding the behavior of reinforced structural  systems as well as practical design 
 This obviously works well for someones first or only B.A.D. album, which of course is the intent. Everything that any casual fan might know is present. There's no doubt that the biggest hits here are "Rush" and especially "The Globe", but the rest is good too. Minus those two songs, the strongest stuff is the first 4-5 tracks. All are sample-filled and hit-worthy. The rest is decent and fun, which I think sums up the band as a whole also. Truth be known, if all you know is "Rush" and "The Globe", you may just want to get "The Globe" album. It has both hit songs and is solid front to back with killer tunes. Can't go wrong here though 
 Once in a while a book speaks so strongly to so many people, that it does the impossible. It is popular and worthwhile.  The best part is that this book gives simple pragmatic execrcises to change communication for the better. Get the book and stay married.  Another great reading that I recommend is "In the meantime"  by Vanzan 
 David Puttnam (with Neil Watson) has written a book that has a different, and often very personal, perspective from the usual film histories.  It is a broader, more international examination into the reasons for Hollywood gaining world wide dominance of the film industry.  This is not about movies per se but is, instead, about the business and politics of making movies.  It includes many anecdotes, told in a basically chronological format, from the beginning of the industry to the recent times.  Much of this information was new to me as most film histories concentrate on the movies and the men and women who create these works.  This one concentrates on the men who finance these works.  An interesting book for those interested in the deals behind the deals that make the movies we love 
 The simplest things can be hardest to master, from telling a story to understanding etiquette: no more, with The Expert's Guide To 100 Things Everyone Should Know How To Do, a "listener friendly" collection of easy pointers on everything from painting a room to maintaining health. Various experts contribute essays to the cause of efficiency, which receive fine narration by Paula Parker and others, and which make it easy to simplify tasks. 
 Insightfully written by Anthony Stevens (a Jungian analyst, and psychiatrist of 30 years' experience), Archetype Revisited: An Updated Natural History Of The Self is now in a greatly expanded and updated edition. Dr. Stevens provides Jungian students and scholars with a thorough exploration and stimulating study of the connections between archetypes of the fields of ethology and sociobiology, while addressing archetypes in practice such as the family, the mother, the father, masculine and feminine images and more. Archetype Revisited is a worthy and welcome contribution to Jungian Studies reading lists and reference collections 
 If you only buy one book on doll repair, it must be this one.  It covers dolls from antique to modern, in laymens language.  I have been repairing dolls for over 15 years, and learned almost everything from this one book.   It has good diagrams and takes you through each process step by step.  I  highly recommend 
 Before I began reading this book I had little interest in impression - mentally it made me think of Monet's "Water Lillies" and Renoir's scenes of wealthy people socializing - just a little too "cute" for my taste.  However, I've become very interested in the 1800's since reading a few Darwin biographis so I picked this book up on a whim to take on a trip. I am more than halfway through reading it and am fascinated with the political and cultural situation in France in the mid 19th century and how it influence the artists who became known as the impressionists.  If you enjoy history at all, and if you particularly enjoy books that give you a complete cultural picture of historical events you will like this.  And it might even change your attitude about impressionism. 
 I think I will never look at the British the same again! I didn't know how evil they were! It is disgusting to see, what crimes they committed against freedom itself! They murdered patriotic Americans in cold-blood!  Every American MUST see this movie to understand what a living hell life was a few hundred years ago; what Americans suffered, because of the evil British! But in the end we gained freedom!  I have to thank the director and the cast members for this revelation! 5 OUT OF 5 STARS 
 This cd has a nice quality. But I have smelled better. My feet smell better then this cd. To tell you the truth, I think any one's feet would. But it is enjoyable. Especially listening to it while taking a bath. It soothes like the soap bubbles. I swish my feet around to it's beat. It's fun. It really hits the hammer on it's jackpot let me tell you. I recommend it 
 But is didn't have enough information on the business aspect. It doesnt thourogly explain each aspect it covers but still a great investment for anyone entering the music busines 
 Great story!!  Excellent in fact.  My beef is with the narrator and editor:  As someone who grew up in the Baltimore area, I thoroughly enjoyed the local references.  However, it is frustrating to hear the narrator mispronounce Baltimore icons, like Boog's BBQ at Camden Yards.  For the record, it is NOT pronounced Bow-g!  It is Boo-g... Do better research!! 
 I found a lot good information in this book. I want to tell you that it is a very good book about how the English is spoken and not how is it. One thing is how the English is and other is how the English is spoken in all the social levels. you can refresh you knowledge in the grammar structures and how really are used it 
 I have enjoyed the music from this movie since it came out. After not hearing the CD for years I came across it again and have been so pleased with the music.  The selections are great.  If you are a fan of the movie or Rachmaninoff - this is sure to please 
 Endo writes without fear,he knows the story we all keep hidden in our hearts.Deep River is about remembering compassion in an estranged world,forgetting just once the barriers of religion and cultures.To address the larger issue of enjoying the moment,the freshness of a child with the experience of the aged.Grant this gift to all who read this book 
 A curious bear cub leaves his mother to investigate a cabin deep in the forest.  He investigates bowls, chairs and beds before falling asleep -- just in time for the family to return from a walk.  Beautiful and humorous illustrations are the star of this textless retelling.  Our two-and-a-half-year old loves this book -- asking for it several times a day --  participating in the 'reading', laughing, feeling indignant for the little girl and her broken things.  This is a charming storybook 
 Ms. Mitford does a wonderful job of presenting details about the funeral industry.  Published in 1963, this book is even more relevant today than ever.  It causes one to look at the American view of death. Our society is one of fear and consumption, and there is nothing we fear more than death. This is a great read for anyone considering a job in the helping professions. We highly recommend it 
 I rented this movie without knowing anything about it other than it starred Alan Rickman and Josh Hartman.  But I enjoyed it so much that I immediately purchased two copies of it, one for a friend and one for myself. The story is a little silly but the actor's performances are wonderfully low-key and humorous.  This is one of my favorite British films yet 
 This book is profusely and clearly illustrated. Each position is presented in three variations for beginner, intermediate and advanced practitioners. I also have some of Rodney's DVD's which show how he moves. I find it helpful to think of him as the Michael Jordan of yoga. I don't expect I will ever dunk like Jordan nor will I yoga like Yee. But his actions are clear and I am guided into further practice by his materials, adding a new asana every so often 
 I can't believe I'm the first to reviw this book! I have found the information and references in this book to be very good. In most cases Ivars Peterson is one of the best new science and mathematics writers that  I know of! I'm interested in chaos and fractals, but mathematics also is in  this book. There seems to be a little of everything. There is even work by  Mandelbrot that I hadn't read about. I can only fault that he didn't put in  enough of the equations and code to produce the examples. Also a glossary  of terms would be helpful. But it is a very good buy in paperback 
 Anyone who owns stock in any company should watch this documentary. It will show you what monster you're feeding. Furthermore, it is wonderfully produced and so interesting it's hard to look away from the screen 
 I first heard "I want to live" and thought I need to find out who that is, as I live in England I hadn't heard any more on American Idol and just assumed the winners were the only ones who got a record contract. Any way I ordered Josh's album on hearing "I want to live" on a country online radio station from this site. Then while I was waiting for the album "Brass Bed" was being played and I really liked that one. Thankfully the album was better than expected and it contains a lot of tracks that artists nowadays would spread over several albums (cause this album is quality). Having said that the only track that grates at me is "Turn it up", as I have found it over repetitive but the rest of the album more makes up for it. 
 I found this book to be extremely interesting and thought provoking. Joe Dispenza presents many facts and theories on how the brain and mind function and how it is not a static fixed organ of human or other creature for that matter.  While the book explains the working of the storage of thoughts and experiences, for me it still leaves the question of what exactly is a memory. For instance, as a minute part of a thought there are synapses and neuron connections made that eventually can be parsed down to the color blue. It seems to me that it has to be broken down further, why are these associations blue? Why not yellow or a shape like square?   I suppose it's like the physics of an atom, the more we smash them with bigger and bigger smashers the more we find smaller particles.  I will be applying his principles in my every day life and evolve my own mind!  Other than being somewhat redundant, I found the book excellent reading and will read it a second time after I finish "God On Your Own" also by Dispenza.  Respectfully submitted Stan Dougla 
 Jeanne Dams writes very entertaining mysteries featuring a senior citizen sleuth transplanted from the US to a small village in England.  In this latest, she travels to London.  While on the train she meets a young  American on his first visit to the country.  She looks forward to showing  him some of the sights, but before the trip is over, the young man is dead  and the mystery begins 
     This book is about a six a year old boy in the past.  His name is Ben McDonald.  It is the last day of school for Beth, John, and Coral.  Ben starts imitating a prairie chicken and wanderes away from home.  A storm is coming.  He runs for shelter but he falls in a badger hole.  He becomes friends with the badger.  Will he keep alive?  I recommend this book to all readers.                             
 helped my one year old not only associate animal sounds with the right animals but also use the puzzle. highly recommended 
 During his career as a cosmologist Professor Stephen Hawking has proposed many ground-breaking theories. His theories on the origins and nature of the universe are quite complex, but Stephen believes it is important to communicate his ideas to the general public. He has written two books - A Brief History of Time, and The Universe in a Nutshell, to try to explain his ideas to everyone. Hawking is the leading scientist on Quantum Mechanics -- which he describes the behaviour of the smallest particles in the Universe. Unlike everyday objects which tend to obey predictable laws, tiny objects like atoms can behave in very unpredictable ways. Hawking's theories include -- Steady State vs the Big Bang. When Hawking was a student, most cosmologists believed in the steady state theory. The steady state theory says the universe had no beginning and will exist in the same state forever. In contrast, the Big Bang theory says that everything in our Universe (and therefore space, matter and time) began in an explosion about 15 billion years ago. This is the theory that most cosmologists agree on today. The theory of relativity was one of the most important ideas of the twentieth century. Albert Einstein realised that space and time were not independent concepts - how you measure time depends on how you are moving through space, and vice versa. He suggested that gravitational fields could bend what he called space-time. Relativity predicts that time slows down near very massive objects like Black Holes. Black Holes are large stars that have undergone total gravitational collapse and whose gravity is so great that nothing, not even light, can escape from them. The heart of a Black Hole is infinitely dense, and is an example of what mathematicians call a singularity. Singularities are points where space and time are warped so much that the laws of physics break down. Singularities occur at the heart of black holes. The Big Bang is also a singularity; before the Big Bang, time does not mathematically exist. 
 Nice little video for my Zen during my long wait at the doctor's office.  Confucius overcame many difficulties 
 This book was very well written and has a deep plot. The themes in this book are not clear but there are themes. On theme is you should never give up. This is showed by Axel's uncle, he keeps going on without caring about the dangers that lay ahead. He also can persuade them by his voice that is all knowing leads Axel to believe that he should keep going on. This act of bravery helps them through their toughest challenges.    This book is somewhat believable because they describe the scenery so well that it seems real not just in a book. But the book seems unreal because we all know what happens in real life so this book breaks the natural laws of the earth. Though the book seems that you could do what axel and his uncle did you can't. This is a great book and is a fun adventurous book to read. 
 Misdirection, romance, murder, all wrapped up in a Givenchy gown and the focus of Cary Grant - that is Audrey Hepburn in this scrumptious movie.  An essential piece of any film lover's collection 
 I have finally gotten used to this new format that Jim Davis started using with the previous Garfield book. As usual, Jim doesn't disappoint me with Garfield's antics. Poor Jon and Odie are Garfield's usual targets, and spiders too. I love the moments  in the book when Garfield is busy squishing spiders. Those have become some of the funniest moments for Garfield. And I was laughing pretty hard when Jon hits his thumb with the hammer and he yells out "mommy!" and tries to retract that statement by saying "ouch!" but Garfield replies with "too late". Another favorite moment is when Garfield and Jon tries to outdo each other by eating the hottest peppers there are. Classic Garfield. And as usual, Jon has trouble getting a date or one that can fit through the doorway of his house. I may be 27 years old but I will never outgrow Garfield. This is one cool cat that should never change 
 i take this book with me everywhere i go, i have read it over and over again, and everytime i do so, i discover a whole new world beneath my fingertips. this book should be taught in schools and universities, it is simply a work of excellence. 
 I was recently at a very nice restaurant for dinner and this was the coffee they served. It was so rich and delicious. We raved about it so much that our server gave us some of the beans to take home. I've been addicted ever since 
 I found this book to be quite entertaining once I got into it.  Welsh takes the reader into the mind of Roy Strang, a man who I could never imagine relating to, sympathizing with, or understanding.  The dialogue is cool and not difficult to interpret.  Welsh makes a good moral argument about powerlessness and the hatred it can bring into people's lives.  The book's two victims, Roy himself and the woman he later brutally rapes, are both turned into violent souls seeking to regain the power that was stolen from them.  I thought the rape scene went a bit far.  What the main character does is just about the worst thing one human being can do to another.  It's hard to believe that a person capable of such things is not pure evil.  I warn anyone who may not want to read a detailed account of a brutal gang rape to not pick up this book.  I question the ethics of writing such a scene, especially when you are a man.  But that will be for you to think about.  On Welsh's defence he makes every argument against the brutality of rape as well as the justice system's inability to protect women. The ending is fascinating and worth debating about.  All in all a recommended read.   
 This is truly a unique book in the adoption category. While most books on the subject offer good advice, much of what they share falls in the area of common sense. This book, on the other hand, takes us into the real world experience of adopted kids and their parents. The chapter on attachment is the best I've come across, and the author tackles those hard-to-deal with topics (sexual behavior in children; children and psychiatric medications; sibling relationships; talking with kids about being adopted; choosing the right therapist for your child) in a sensitive and direct manner. Even though the book is geared to parents, I really believe teachers and counselors who work with adopted children need to read this also.  
 It works great and we have had no problems with it. I would recommend it for anyone who wants a pull-down projector screen. 
 I f you like books with suspense at the end of every chapter A Corner of the Universe is just for you! This book is about a girl named Hattie who is very helpful. When the time comes for her mother and father to tell her about the untold of her uncle who she never even knew he existed. His name was Adam. He had mental problems. But Hattie likes him as an uncle and a friend. They pass through some difficult times together but Hattie learns that she can lift corners of the universe .This book takes place in the time of the 1940 to 1950. What the author does well is describing details she puts pictures of all the words she says that are happening in your mind. I thought this book is so terrific that everybody should read .Also the author puts you in suspense and you always wonder what will happen next. I recommend this book to everybody who loves realistic fiction books  and  someone  that  enjoys reading. This Book  is terrific!  
 I really loved this book / Very Interesting / Good Ending/ Don't want to tell you too much 
 This book is a godsend for people on both sides of the sponsorship fence. I have managed sponsorships for a number of major corporates. It used to  break my heart to see needy and well meaning organisations waste valuable  resources sending poorly targetted proposals. Sponsees with the good sense  to use a guide like the sponsorship toolkit, will greatly enhance their  chances of finding a suitable sponsorship partner. Good luck 
 This was a great book to take along on a plane. It is engrossing, fast paced, no sooner does one issue get solved and the next is rearing it's head and off we go again. It would make a good movie too.  The characters looks aren't really well defined so you can mentally drop in any particular man or woman, both are key and both are strong.  Oh and the evil ones are pretty evil alright.  Oh and I only give five stars to books on my top ten list. I will continue to read Coben everyone I read has been good 
 In 2005 Murder Inc Records (also known as The Inc) decided to leave Def Jam and pursue a new record distribution home.  But in order to do that, they needed Ja Rule and Ashanti each to release one more album a piece to fulfill the contract requirements, so they both put out greatest hits albums.  Ja Rules album was called, "Exodus" which supposedly is the final goodbye as his Ja Rule gimmick and soon is coming out with his new albums under the name "Loki."  Anyway this album is all of Ja's hits since his first album til currently plus three new recordings.  1. Exodus (Intro) - 4.5/5  2. Me - 3.5/5  3. Holla, Holla - 3.5/5  4. It's Murda (Featuring DMX & Jay-Z) - 4.5/5  5. Put It On Me (Featuring Vita) - 3.5/5  6. I Cry (Featuring Lil' Mo) - 3.5/5  7. Living It Up (Featuring Case) - 4/5  8. Always on Time (Featuring Ashanti) - 3/5  9. Ain't It Funny [Murder Remix] (Featuring Jennifer Lopez & Caddillac Tah) - 3/5  10. Thug Lovin'(Featuring Bobby Brown) - 4.5/5  11. Mesmerize (Featuring Ashanti) - 4/5  12. Clap Back - Minute+ Talking Intro - 4/5  13. New York (Featuring Fat Joe & Jadakiss) - 5/5  14. Wonderful (Featuring R. Kelly & Ashanti) - 4/5  15. Never Again - 4/5  16. Daddy's Little Baby (Featuring Ronald Isley) - 4.5/5  17. Love Me Hate Me - 3.5/5  18. Exodus (Outro) - 4/5  Overall:  70.5/90  3.5 Stars  Most of these tracks showed Ja's softer, radio-friendly side, the side that doesn't really appeal to me.  But he also had some hardcore joints on here like "New York" which is probably his best and my favorite one of his tracks.  If you own all of his previous albums like I do, just download the three new tracks.  Now that his career on Def Jam is over, we'll see how his career shapes up when he releases his two new albums in 2007 
 This is far more than a sports book on perhaps the single greatest sports achievement ever, it is a compelling look at the era itself.  Gary does a wonderful job re-creating the evening and illuminating the racial overtones, the struggling NBA which was a far cry from the wealthy and glitzy league of today, and the fact that this historic game was not televised and only a few thousand fans were in attendance in Hershey, PA, which was not even the home court for either team.  The book meanders through the game one quarter at a time.  Often reflecting back and providing the backdrop on Chamberlain, and the other players, and even provides glimpses into the lives of many of the fans who were there to witness the historic night.  At times the book was perhaps a bit too nostalgic, and some of the time spent on various people not really related to the game were a bit superfluous.  It is really hard imagine several key issues depicted here.  First the racial situation encountered by the players is difficult to read and not feel emotionally angered at the treatment many of the minority players experienced.  The fact that a player could actually score 100 points in a single game is beyond remarkable.  In today's NBA most teams do not score 100 points.  Consider that Wilt Chamberlain averaged over 50 points a game for the entire season, and these are records which will never be broken.  The book is engaging, and well written.  Although perhaps too broad in its scope, it does create the backdrop for the historic night well.  Even if you are only a casual fan of the game, the historical and sociological content alone is worth the read. 
 Edward In The Jungle By David Mcphail. This story is about a boy that dreams about being in the jungle with tarzan. I like this book because of all of the illistrations and it makes me feel like Edward. I hope you read this book because it is a good book to read. I  like it a lot. I hope you do too 
 Most corporate training teaches you what to think.  This book teaches you how to think.  And how important a skill it is these days, with change coming at breakneck speed and uncertainty at a decades-long high.    Above all, "The Prepared Mind" outlines a systematic approach to thinking, even with regard to such seemingly unsystematic activites like imagining.  The book is chock-full of theoretical principles and insights, so, unless you have a background in educational theory and psychology, don't expect to breeze through it and magically turn yourself into a Prepared Mind leader.  This is information that should be absorbed slowly and reflectively.  I found it very helpful to pause often and remember situations where the thinking principles really applied.   Bottom line:  Opportunities are hard to come by these days. A leaders who is prepared will find them and organize his/her company to exploit them 
 Excellent mystery, with interesting book notes thrown in.  Ex-cop Janeway is a well-developed protagonist.  This series of mysteries is always entertaining 
 These notebooks contain the kind of language arts work that I wanted my kids exposed to in grade school.  I knew this would be the kind of work they'd receive in their high school.  KIDS ARE NOT BEING PREPARED FOR THIS LEVEL OF ENGLISH IN GRADE SCHOOLS ANYMORE AND ARE GETTING A TRIAL BY FIRE FOR IT WHEN THEY ENTER HIGH SCHOOL. I really felt this book covered alot but sometimes I found better explainations for the work they were wanting done on a topic in other language books. There is a companion hardback book that can be bought seperately for this coursework.. 
 I've read a few cycle books over the last couple years. I found it to be relaxed & a good read. The book was filled with some usefull information & answered a few questions concerning traveling on a bike 
 I bought this book for my daughter who is five years old and just starting to be interested in these activities and she loved it. She finished it in two days and that is the only negative comment I have, since she was left wanting more 
 What can I say?  Nora Roberts did it again in Angels Fall.  I whipped through this book in record time again, then passed it on to a buddy (who also loved it).  Her books just get better and better as she goes along 
 I agree that this book is indeed over-written and reads at time like a class assignment; the author simply ticking off facts without much coherent thesis.  However, this recital does bring off a charming story interesting enough to hold the attention of the casual historian with only a passing interest in wildlife.  For anyone wishing to immerse themselves in the atmosphere of the American wilderness and the struggles of the early settlers, it is a pleasure.  Just skip over the boring bits 
 I have not read this book.  However I saw the video Biology of Perception, Psychology of Change. Rob Williams gives a simple demonstration on the technique....and it IS very simple to do. I sat down with a friend, did the basics that I saw on the video and had some GREAT wins. Matter of fact both of us did it together rather than waiting for the other to finish.  So, you don't have to spend a lot of money to learn about it. I suggest getting the video from his site. Then if it excites you go do a beginner workshop.(It is NOT $1000.00)  Also I did this over the phone with a friend with out muscle testing. We just assumed that it was a good belief to install into the subconscious. Just take one of your favorite affirmations and do it. It only takes 3-5 minutes.  I am an EFT practioner and my belief is that if it isn't simple AND self-empowering I won't do.  This technique IS simple AND self-empowering. I got changes the very first time I used it. (And I am not that great with muscle testing.) For a $40.00 investment you just might change your life 
 ~Property Matters: How Property Rights Are Under Assault and Why You Should Care~ adroitly and incisively explains that property rights are vitally requisite to a free and prosperous civil society, and he further illustrates how the inalienable right to property is routinely being trounced upon by an overactive and uncaring state. The Lockean cliche "life, liberty, and property" succinctly encapsulates the rights that government exists to protect, and yet in our time the state is the single biggest threat to property rights in our time.  A zealous and overactive government rountinely tramples upon property rights in complete disregard of the rule of law. Senseless environmental laws, asinine zoning ordinances, the phenomenon of regulatory takings without just compensation and other illegal takings in violation of the Fifth Amendment are rendering property rights null and void. On the environmental front, DeLong chronicles how the endangered species act and wetlands regulations have produced some ridiculous regulations and have done far more harm than good. The assault on property rights has steadily increased year by year. DeLong substantiates that property rights are the vital cornerstone of American liberties and that this right must be protected. He makes it resoundingly clear that Americans must wake up to the importance of property rights and voice their opposition to the assault upon private property 
 The reviews I have seen of this historical novel range from gushing to sneering.  This should not surprise the (prospective) reader.  Rather, the spectre of opinions should be taken as evidence that this novel is worth reading.  Understandably, the author's intent is to convey a set of philosophical concepts -- Platonism, gnosticism, humanism -- as concrete (but fictional) historical figures acting in the context of three specific eras.  I would submit that, as historical fiction, Mr. Pears' attempt is largely successful.  If the reader is seeking unvarnished philosophical tracts on these themes, then please consult Plato, Origen, Spinoza, Pascal, etc.  But if the reader is seeking a delightful, slightly challenging but still enjoyable novel that incorporates significant elements of these historical/philosophical schools, then 'Dream of Scipio' is probably a book worth reading and enjoying.  As a writer, Iain Pears provides a credible, even enviable treatment of these themes in the three centuries-apart contexts.  By and large, he manages to avoid the greatest criticism made of other philosophical novelists such as Dostoyevsky; i.e., assigning philosophical positions to individual characters and spreading a thin plot over what is essentially a series of essays on philosophical themes 
 This book was enjoyable--the writing was to the point, and often very funny.  The author makes a very unlikely story seem natural and totally believable.    The ending caught me completely off guard. It felt a little out of sync with the rest of the book, which is why I gave it four stars. But maybe that was the intent, and if so, mission accomplished. I didn't see it coming.. 
 I just heard this band for the first time, playing "Pushin On."  They can bring the funk and the soul, no doubt about it 
 Even dated there is something to be learned from this book. Drucker is one of the few people who not only talks about the future of business but clarifies the present business climate. Even when he is wrong about what will happen, which he will be one of the first to say, he is smart enough to admit it and learn from it. Drucker gives solid practical advice and insight to all aspects of business. And more importantly what should be part of business. I give the book a B+ on the StuPage just because of it being dated 
 i think this video is classic and timeless.  Remember all the stories about the Easter Bunny when you were little??  This is like all those stories wrapped into one.  It's absolutley wonderful!  .. 
 Several of us got to know Chris and others on the investigative tour we went on with them a few years ago.   There really is much more Knowledge and Technology preserved in some of the great pyramids of Egypt than some people would like us to know!!  It might mess up their "Flatlander" and "politically correct" scenarios for what happened there!!   Read this book if you want the physical evidence for  great spiritual truths that have been buried for too long by our various Inquisitions and the burning and destruction of the ancient wisdom books in ancient Alexandria, etc.  Then check them out and see how many of these truths were preserved within the traditions of Freemasonry.  And, lo and behold, some of those scrolls have been found, like the Nag Hammadi "library"!!  They certainly show a different "picture" of our spiritual roots! 
 The text is friendly, funny, and illustrated with line drawings, although more would have made the exercises easier to follow. Michaels carefully avoids most gender pronouns, so the books manage to address multiple genders.The Low Down on Going Down helps readers increase the dexterity and strength of the tongue, jaw, and lips for earth-shaking lovemaking. Michaels also offers ideas for the hottest positions, kinkiest foreplay, and other little-known, cunning techniques while answering those burning questions with eye-opening illustrations. 
 If you just listen to the music you won't appreciate this guy's talent as much as the lyrics.  The lyrics make a very big difference.  There's a story to every song 
 If you don't know anything about this band , I would say only that they will make you very glad you're not deaf .  If you enjoy harmonies and a 60's sensibility together with solid songwriting , then look no further .  The song on this album called AIN'T THAT ENOUGH is just fantastic - it is extremely uplifting and that is how the band's music affects me , though not all their songs have that sort of direction or mood .  I also recommend other albums of theirs such as GRAND PRIX , HOWDY and the latest one MAN MADE .   We need more uncool positive 'vibes' in this world and this band makes an important contribution to that , so they're actually fulfilling a purpose . Buy and luxuriate in this band's world-view . 
 I am in the process of starting a couture label, and this book has taught me amazing things. It sewing you amazing photographs of some of the amazing one of a kind shops. Other than that I thought this was a very excellent book on couture for someone beginning to study it. I bought it when I first started college I have out of school for three years, and the book is still just as interesting to me. It's a great Buy! 
 I saw this in the theater when it first came out. Had to have a copy because it is so gripping. Look at world events in the middle east today and you will appreciate this film even more 
 These classic tales originated circa 6th century BC in Ancient Greece. Well over 50 fables are presented. i.e. The Grasshopper and the Owl is a recitation which explains how the grasshopper was tempted to taste nectar; whereupon, the Owl utilized the opportunity to swallow him. The story of the Pack ass, wild ass and lion explains that it is necessary to take a stand in order to be the master. Similarly, tens of tales are recited together with the lessons learned in each. The presentation is perfect for grammar school student projects 
 Clarence Walker does a good job in deconstructing the Afrocentric school of Black history, with it's emphasis on African pseudomyhology to salve the egos of many Black Americans and ignoring of raw facts and detailed research. Mr. Walker's views may be a bit too conservative for some, but he does a good job of backing up his views with verifiable facts and good research. However, I would say that the need for this book was at it's peak 10 years ago, when the Afrocentric fad was at it's peak and nonsense passing as fact filled the sheleves of Black bookstores. But it still does a good job of rebutting those that will listen to the crackpots again 
 This is a must own for any serious Batman fan or collector of great action adventure cartoons!  I have all 4 volumes of this series and each one is awesome!  I highly recommend it to anyone who loves comics and one of its greatest heroes 
 I really don't know what to say.  This is an absolutely amazing novel.  Sterling is a genius 
 this is an adaptation of the fairy tale "little red riding hood" not for children.it's got a couple good transformations,not the best i've seen but good nonetheless.i'd imagine kids would find this scary and it's not bad on adults either.i doubt that this film would be made these days as the 80's were able to get away with much more,unless the great terry gilliam were at the helm.i loved the set designs,all the little creatures and the way that the wolves were used were all very well done.as i said,not something i would show my 8 year old daughter in fear of it causing her nightmares but would definitely recommend this for teens and adults.a good horror film for those who don't need axe-wielding murderers to be able to enjoy a more of a fantasy done right 
 This book is based on a true murder case which happened in Michigan's beautiful Upper Peninsula about fifty years ago.  The last half of the story is almost entirely courtroom drama and is second to none for suspense in this genre. Not only do we get excellent character development and an exciting story, but also a nice sense of place, as Traver lived in the U.P. much of his life.  Additionally, this book contains the most eloquent use of the modern English language I've ever read, particularly the character Parnell's quotes.  Highly recommended to fans of courtroom drama or classic literature 
 This is a talkative piece, but a great one. If there is any play in recent years that can compare, I don't know of it 
 This book goes a long way to explain the mindset of Muslim extremists.I recommend it to all people who are interested in understanding the religion of Islam 
 Damn, I just put on the other day and it made me remember on how hot this album was...Damn Ghost, I really hope Fishscale would be just as hot!  WUTANG 4-Eve 
 STV is and always will be my favorite of the star trek line. I think the box set is definately worth the time to watch and the money to buy...IF bought used on amazon....I agree with the other reveiwers that the new price is utterly insane. I am a trekker to the heart, who taped near every episode as they aired new and even I wouldn't consider paying 100 or more dollars a season!!!!  The packaging is a little shoddy but the discs themselves make up for it. I really liked the special features. It was interesting to watch the auditions and  the footage of the orignal *gulp* *gasp* * hidious face made* "almost" Janeway.... TPTB definately got it right when they hired kate mulgrew.  Great show....Great season !! 
 Individual Power is simultaneously a humble and empowering read that brings out exactly how to shine your inner light while you make a difference for others. It is an expression of a woman named Barbara Rose, that has "seen the darkest days" and now she is a light to so many people. This book is a light that will help uplift anyone to transform their life. It is a book I would share with anyone that is struggling to find and bring out their authentic purpose, their sense of self, and create a world of difference for others as a by-product of their own authenticity. Barbara is humble and courageous in this book, and that is exactly why I loved it so much.  
 This book is a must read for any baby-boomer actively planning the "second career" phase of their life.  Full of thought-provoking questions on career moves, health, learning and loving.  Engaging prose and an easy-to-read style 
 Gavin DeBecker has given us the OK to trust our gut instincts.  This is a practical guide to recognizing when things 'just aren't right'. He doesn't just allude to what a violent person might do/say.  He gives very specific examples of what to watch for.  This book was given to me by a friend who teaches self defense.  I have loaned it out several times always with great reviews from the borrower. 
 I am not surprised critics and Andy Partridge consider this XTC's worst release.  To be honest I am more surprised so many people are sticking up for this one.  I always thought I was alone in my appreciation of this release.  I am surprised that everyone that likes this album hates the Barry Andrews songs.  I absolutely love "Super Tuff" and "My Weapon".  "My Weapon" may have juvenile lyrics, but they are also rather truthful and the music adds power to Andrews frustration.  Why is this song hated so much?  "I Am The Audience", "Jumpimg In Gomorrah", "Battery Brides" and "The Rhythm" are also favorites. I love the lyrics to "Life Is Good In The Greenhouse" and the atmosphere, but the bass can be annoying and is mixed too high.  "Meccanik Dancing" has grown on me a lot. The rest is annoying, though "Red" seems to be another song I am starting to like. Finally is the clssic, "Are You Receiving Me", which is the bonus track.  Another ace.  This is a consistently enjoyable album that will probably be out of print soon 
 The message and instruction contained in this book is vital to the walk of those wishing to follow Christ.  Some reviews boo hoo at the amount of repetition.  But, just as in anything worth doing, the more you reflect on the way it is rightly done, the more likely you will be to grasp the perfection of the right movement.  I have bought copies for all those who are serious about knowing Christ, and I anticipate that I will be buying many more 
 I remember hearing "Laid to Rest" on the Backyard Wrestling 2 video game. I remember my buddy's band covering it (without butchering, either!). I remember listening to "As the Palaces Burn" with my cousin and just a lovin' it! Yeah, I remember listening to Lamb of God. But they just seemed to have faded away from me.  Now, it's nearing '07. It's been about a month since I've owned "Ashes of the Wake" and nearly since its release since I've owned "Sacrament." Out of the two albums, I love AotW the most. It's so heavy, so brutal, so... awesome! Sure, "Sacrament" kicks butt, but "Ashes..." is so much better.  All that basically needs to be said, except for the fact that Guitar Hero II completely ruined "Laid to Rest" (vocally; musically, it rocks!). But other than that, the highlights are "Laid to Rest," "The Faded Line," "One Gun," and the title track.  "Sacrament" is also recommended! 
 I love my sonicare intelliclean system!  I've had difficulty finding the replacement heads in stores but I'm becoming an online guru.  I love the fact that Amazon makes it too easy to buy the replacement heads that I will never have to spend hours going from store to store looking for this again.  I love the extra burst of toothpaste I can give myself while brushing.   I love the timed 'zone' beep.  The brush head cleans quickly with a dash of water and the toothbrush holds the charge for a week so I can unplug the recharger to save energy (and be one of many to stop global warming) 
 I have always loved Grant Green's music.  Not a big fan of the sell-out years where he tried to cross over into commercial success.  Wes did it, Grant never quite managed to do anything but "sell out" in my opinion.  And the music suffered.  But that's not this CD...  This CD is straight-ahead jazz.  Pure, solid, grooving, dramatic, powerful, inspirational, and just a true pleasure to listen to.  Every member in the band plays like they've known each other since the womb.  So very, very tight.  Grant and Sonny are almost too nice to each other.  They both try very hard to accomidate the other and make sure they have space to play.  And when comping, Sonny and Grant compliment each other in a way that only true chemistry can create.    Grant's sound is very typical on this one.  Signature single-note lines, not many chordal phrases.  When i say, "typical" I mean typical of his greatest playing.  I easily put this recording up there with Idle Moments.    My favourite track on the CD is,"It Ain't Necessarily So."  The interplay between Grant and Sonny will just make you beam with happiness.  Every time Grant tries to hand the lead off to Sonny, Sonny eggs him on verbally with, "go, just go!" And Grant anwers with some heartfelt passion and always finds a way to push himself.  Grant shows off his incredible ability to flawlessly drag his notes on this CD too.  His playing always seems so simple, but he's really a smart and knowledgeable player.    This is one of my desert island discs.  You just can't go wrong popping this set into the player.  Never lets you down.  Simply put, if you're a fan of Grant's more straight-ahead, non-funkified music, then you will probably want to pick this CD set up.  
 This book was one of the best books in the baby sitter club serious and you know there were a LOT! This book really got deep in to Staceys feelings about having deiabets and her strugles with that. Also the whole club is faced with a problem...some one else has started there own baby sitters club!!!!!!! Now this wouldn't be so bad if that club wasn't getting more people calling them....and then when that club pays a trick on them the baby sitters club knows the other club HAS to go!! 
 Robert Ludlum is easily the best and most prolific dead writer in the world. I've heard that when he died he left behind a number of unfinished book ideas. I've heard that his estate then hired an as yet unidentified author to take these ideas and put them into book format. I've also heard that this author has used up all of Ludlum's unfinished ideas and now is using his own plot lines but carefully following the Ludlum formula of how a book should be written.   At any case, this is a post Ludlum novel published under his name (with a trademark symbol). How good it is depends on the reader, which is, I guess the story for any book. A lot of reviewers will say this book is absolute trash.   This book follows the Ludlum formula of a super agent in trouble with his agency. Enter a young lady with no secret agent experience or training but with expertise in some allied field that will be of great help to the agent. Add in a chase through exotic locations and you have a classic Ludlum story.   As for my own opinion, I think I like the new Ludlum's better than I did the originals, especially those published towards the end of his life. The new author seem to have new and refreshing ideas about how to take the familiar Ludlum situations and put them in a new light 
 "Anybody can look at a pretty girl and see a pretty girl. An artist can look at a pretty girl and see the old woman she will become. A better artist can look at an old woman and see the pretty girl that she used to be. But a great artist-a master-and that is  what Auguste Rodin was-can look at an old woman, protray her exactly as she is...and force the viewer to see the pretty girl she used to be...and more than that, he can make anyone with the sensitivity of an armadillo, or even you, see that this lovely young girl is still alive, not old and ugly at all, but simply prisoned inside her ruined body. He can make you feel the quiet, endless tragedy that there was never a girl born who ever grew older than eighteen in her heart...no matter what the merciless hours have done to her. Look at her, Ben. Growing old doesn't matter to you and me; we were never meant to be admired-but it does to them."  -Robert A. Heinlein "Stranger in a Strange Land 
 this is a great book for kids who love pokemon as much as my kids do, my son really loves these hint books and reads them to find out information about his games and how to play them, a GREAT BOOK FOR POKEMON PLAYERS!! 
 I teach third grade and just read "The Stories Julian Tells" to my students as a read-aloud.  They absolutely loved this book!  The five stories in the book each are a chapter, told from Julian's point of view.  Julian and his little brother, Huey, get into mischief, including eating the lemon pudding their father has lovingly made as a present for their mother.  The boys' parents teach them loving lessons whenever they get into trouble.  This is a book that celebrates the joys of childhood.  I want to read Ann Cameron's other books in the series now.  Ms. Cameron truly understands what makes good reading 
 It snapped right on, and looks great.  But sometimes it can slip and press the buttons on the side of your phone.  It can either make the phone not work, or run down the battery 
 A classic adventure tale, this 19th century novel surely must have been a template for the Indiana Jones movies a century later.  It is told in a straight-forward and easy-to-read narrative by the elephant hunter, Quatermain.  Briefly, it tells the tale of three Brits (Quatermain, Henry Curtis, and John Good) and their quest for the legendary treasure of King Solomon and Curtis's lost brother in the South African savannah of the 1890s.    H. Rider Haggard paints vivid scenes with his literary prose.  The imagery and scenery afforded to the reader is as good as any in a movie, if the reader has even the least bit of imagination.  From their harrowing trek across a scorching desert and snow-capped mountains, to their decisive battle in the Kukualand civil war, Haggard masterly paints a vivid picture.  Although there are a few things that seem to stretch the pale of believability, the occurrence of a once-in-a-lifetime lunar eclipse comes to mind, the tale is well-told and credible, in context.  The only thing this story lacks is character development, as there is none to speak of, save for John Good's brief and tragic romance with an African.  For the PC crowd, this novel is pretty high on the Offend-O-Meter.  The native Africans are constantly referred to as ignorant "savages" and they are held in low regard to the native European colonists.  The hero of the story is an elephant ivory hunter who kills for money, as well as mere pleasure.  Plus, the romance between John Good and a native African is considered impossible and a "complication".  But, hey, this book was written in the 1880's and, with that perspective, these can all be dismissed as relics of an earlier time.  All-in-all, I would highly recommend this book for a light and easy read.  There are no complex subplot developments and no deep philosophical ideas to ponder, but it is an entertaining adventure story. 
 I had heard lots about this book: some said it was 600 pages about whales, others said it was their favourite novel of all times. The first usually were teens and the latter were usually my literature teachers, or writers I read.   To be fair, yes, there is a lot about the whales; but that is not boring, Melville always manages to connect that to many other things (example: the head of the whale and the face of God) and whatever happens, his style is always witty and fun. I can never quite believe what I read in Amazon reviews; honestly. Some have said this novel is dry. I'm sorry but this book is so thickly rich of everything that I can hardly perceive how it could ever be dry. As to being boring or slow-paced, the fact that the whole novel is divided into over 100 short chapters does speed up the dynamic as short chapters always do.  It is true that you should not expect a "classical" novel in the classical sense of being "usual", for Moby Dick is not your average novel. It has a narrator who is a character in the story, but he is nearly inexistent as such, and seems to melt in the universe he describes for us. The text itself moves from the story to encyclopedic entries on whales, and back to the story proper. Personally, I never minded that, and quite enjoyed every chapter of it; but it's likely that some don't appreciate that sort of narrative freedom.  It is beyond me, too, that one should "need" a year to read this book. I read it in two weeks, and was by no means reading everyday. The first chapters are really funny, I thought. I was expecting something terrible, given what others had warned me of, but really it was fun. It sure is a demanding book, but then, great books require great readers. And by demanding, that can mean just being curious and/or interested.   This novel is a true hybrid of sorts, combining elements that aren't usually thought to cohabit very well; you could perhaps consider it a patchwork, but for all one can say on it, it remains a cool read! I don't suppose I'm in the majority, but that's really how it felt to me: quite a cool read. It made me curious about the whaling industry and how exactly humans did to kill those sea giants; it may not sound thrilling to some, but if you pause and consider the animals concerned and the sea, and all that, then you realise (I think) how deep this all is. I believe you probably need to be on the same wavelength as Melville to enjoy his book; if the sea evokes nothing to you but tons and tons of water, then you may not revel in the reading of the novel. On the other hand, if the sea seems to you some metaphysical poem, then you will most likely appreciate Melville's grand effort 
 I adore Rachael Ray.  Yes, she can be a bit too much, but I love her bubbly way of getting food to the table in 30 minutes - with recipes that are, yes, I'll say it.... YUMMO!!  Only flaw in this book, is that there is no index and the book is broken down into mini themed chapters.  With no index or any kind of order, I sadly had to remove a star from this review.  Still, bear with it and you can cook up some awesome meals 
 At first I didn't want to read a book about someone on death row but I figured, it's John Grisham it will probably be good and it is.   This books is not an action packed book like some of his others, the Pelican Brief, The Firm or Runaway Jury but it is thoroughly interesting.   It takes this KKK member named Sam Cayhill who is on death row and talks about his life and how he got there. It's really quite a sad story for not only him and his victims but also his family who has been torn apart because of his actions, those that have left him on death row and some of those that did not.   It's really quite moving reading about the emotions that come to everyone involved when someone is about to be gassed etc and John Grisham does a wonderful job slowly leading you to that point.  This book might not change your opinion on the death penalty but it will definitely let you look at it differently through the eyes of a prisioner and his family etc.   A good read for those who have time for a slower paced book that leads to a purpose. If you need nonstop action in a book then this is not the one to pick up.    
 Considering this collection was written in the late 30's and early 40's, and was, in fact, the first volume of Heinlein's now-famous Future History, it has actually held up quite well throughout the ensuing years. However, some of the events in the stories have been inevitably dated. It is still well worth reading, though. Heinlein's quick-paced writing style and caustic wit, not to mention lovable characters, always make his stories worth reading, regardless of when they were released. Also, the stories here, for the most part, focus not on the scientific aspects of the technologies in question, but rather the sociological and political sides of them. This is what Heinlein brought to science fiction. He showed us that the key ingredient in good science fiction is story and characters, not the technology being showcased; and by focusing his stories on the characters within and their aspects, his stories are usually just as readable now as the day they were released, even if some of their inherent technology has been dated by subsequent advances in science. Aside from being the first volume in the Future History series, this book is also notable for containing Heinlein's first ever published story, Life-Line. I'm sure you all know the premise-a man invents a machine that shows when people will die-but it is an interesting read if you haven't, and an epoch in the sense of it being the starting point in the career of one of science fiction's greatest writers. Blowups Happen and The Roads Must Roll (does this story remind anyone else of H.G. Well's The Sleeper Awakes?) both focus on technologies that are now fundamentally debunk in the modern day world, but they both focus instead on the people running these technologies (atomic factories and rolling roads respectively), and are an interesting look into sociology and psychology in science fiction. Let There Be Light is a short, decent piece. The Man Who Sold The Moon novella is the title and longest piece in this collection. It is almost totally devoid of actual science, as it has a rather unique, in fact, plotline for science fiction; but has as it's protagonist a seemingly rather crooked, dishonest character who is not particularly of the usually lovable Heinlein kind. It's still an entertaining story, as the writing style is excellent and fast-paced, and the dialogue is exquisite. Requiem features the same main character, and shows a seemingly total different side of him. This story is quite a bit different from most Heinlein, as it is primarily and emotion-based bit, reminding me of something more along the lines of Arthur C. Clarke. Interesting. Although not his best stories, the ones contained in this collection are worth reading, and a must, eventually, for any Heinlein fan 
 I read the book first, before giving to my 11 yr. old stepson. There were things I didn't even know! I think it will really be helpful in easing the awkwardness of the "sex talk" with preteens 
 Nakken's book provides a clear and comprehensive description of the main aspects of the addicted person.  He discusses the stages of addiction, Society and addiction, family and addiction, and recovery.  this book is definitely a useful read for those intereste in understanding addiction and what is actually going on within the addicted individual.  However, we must always remember that people are unique and each case is individualized, thus these are generalizations and may not perfectly fit all who are addicted.  The most imporatnt thing to realize is addiction is a disease and there is treatment.  Highly recommended book 
 It's a shame this American-made film portrayal of a WWI German unit trapped in the vanity of trench warfare didn't have currency in 1930's Germany. It might have made a dent in the German people's hunger for the bellicose rhetoric happily supplied by the young National Socialist movement.  Alas, we forget too soon.  The acting and cinematography, advanced seventy-seven years ago, seem primitive to the modern eye. Yet the whole production prepares the viewer gradually for the gut-wrenching final scene. A war-weary 'Paul' reaches out from the mire of his entrenched position to pick up a butterfly, the most unlikely provider of color in the flattened landscape of France. Meanwhile, a French sniper draws a bead. After the shot is fired, we see the hand of this most poignant of veterans - returned to the front with just days left on his tour - go limp.  This film remains an important paragraph in cinema's long conversation regarding warfare and the craftmanship employed, ineffectively, to ward it off.  Somehow, amid the washed-out grays on the screen, humanity and its deep, repeating tragedy, come persuasively to life. And then die 
 From my personal days of retail, our motto was increase sales everything else will follow.  Honestly, this is a short sided method of trying to increase profits.  Slywotzky has one evaluate where is the market going, who should your customers be, where is the value migrating towards, so you can be more effective in business.  Slywotzky presents a very well thought out method of looking at your business or a potential business and asking those probing questions that seperate you from your competitors. He offers a variety of business models as well as profit models.  All are valid, and hybirds are suggested, but the point is to know what you are driving towards, and develop your strategy after this.  I have read many different business books, and this one has to be one of my favorite.  If you enjoyed Built to Last or from Good to Great, you will like the depth this book has to offer. 
 I typically read over a hundred thrillers each year, and I think ABSOLUTE POWER is one of the best I've read recently.    ABSOLUTE POWER is David Baldacci's debut novel, and was released in 1996 with much fanfare.  Baldacci got paid over a million dollars for this book, which was a remarkable sum for a debut novel.  After reading this book, I can see why he got paid the money.  Obviously, the publisher made a good investment, because this novel was a huge hit, and Baldacci has since become one of the top selling writers of the past decade.  I won't rehash the plot, which is essentially a murder plot involving the President.  In fact, the plot of ABSOLUTE POWER is its weakest point.  Most of the story is rather over-the-top and based on a series of unlikely coincidences.  Some of the characterization is also on the cardboard side.  But I can forgive that problem (a common one with most thriller fiction) if the story is well written, and this one surely is.  ABSOLUTE POWER, quite simply, delivers the goods.  It's an extremely well-written suspense story, and kept me turning the pages.  It is also a suprisingly well-done crime procedural.  Baldacci clearly did his research on forensics and crime scene investigation.  My guess is that Baldacci spent a lot of time on this novel, and it shows in how effectively the story unfolds.  I have read some of Baldacci's later work, and I don't think it measures up to his debut.  I therefore suggest you first start with this novel, which is the best of Baldacci's books I've read so far.   If you dislike this one, you will probably dislike most of his more recent work 
 It's rare that I would call any book life changing, but for me, this was. Although a life-long Christian, I never really understood the concept of grace. Once I understood God's grace to me, it changed me life. I felt released from guilt. I would highly recommend this book to anyone. I first did it as a women's study, but you could certainly do it alone 
 This posthumously published collection of essays by Colin Gunton continues and extends the trajectory he began in THE PROMISE OF TRINTARIAN THEOLOGY. These well-crafted essays explore numerous themes in Christian theology from a distinctly trinitarian perspective, showing how all truly Christian theology must be trinitarian in sturcture and scope.     The first segment of the book focuses on the theology of the Trinity itself. Gunton tackles issues of the Eastern and Western doctrine(s) of the Trinity, the incarnation, the Holy Spirit and the relation of the economic and immanent trinities and offers fruitful and thought-provoking refelctionss on these themes.    The second section focuses on the implications of Trinitarian theology for other areas of Christian doctrine. The relation between creation and redemption, the Spirit and Jesus, Atonement, Baptism and Eucharist are all treated lucidly and engagingly.     Of particular interest is Gunton's always helpful work on the humanity of Christ and his ever-deepening theology of the Holy Spirit. His treatment of the relation between creation and redemption owes much Irenaeus and Athanasius and is certainly one of the most helpful treatments of those issue availible. His work on atonement as metaphor and transcenendtal is superb and engaging.     Gunton's treatment of baptism was also very good at countering the individualistic understandings of baptism in much of the western church. While his arguments for the practice of infant baptism may not be convincing to all (they aren't to me), they do give one pause in rashly thinking that a person who was baptized as an infant must necesarily be "rebaptized." Put differently, while Gunton's arguments for infant baptism as a church practice may not be totally convincing, they should at lease prevent advocates of "believer's baptism" from simply dismissing all infant baptisms as invalid. Finally, Gunton's treatment of the Eucharist as it relates to the polity of the church was also excellent and helpful. His ability to show how the Eucharist requires the Word is a necessary supplement to the works of creative minds like William Cavanaugh who have done substantial work in Eucharistic theology, yet have paid little attention to the interpretation and performance of the Word as a similarly constitutive ecclesial practice.    On the whole, this collection is excellent and insightful. It addresses important issue from a fully trinitarian perspective and has much to offer the theological audience. I am only sorry the Professor Gunton is no longer with us and cannot contribute more books like this to the discerning Christian leader 
 I have always been a great fan of Southern Rock.  From Skynyrd to Blackfoot.  38 Special is no exception, with members from Donnie Van Zant to Jeff Carlisi, Don Barnes n the rest of the crew.  38 Special are truly a great rock band.   Hits like Back Where You Belong n If I'd Been The One.  It just doesn't get any better then that!  If you like Southern Rock you gotta check this out.  Get the party started with the Wild-Eyed Southern Boys and enjoy 
 Looking for excitement, suspense, thrills?  The Last Spymaster is all these and more.  The plot is quite timely: spies being 'outed', arms deals involving government officials, plotting terrorists from Mideast cultures.  Lynds obviously spends an immense amount of time researching material for her novels; this one contains frightening information about the latest surveilance tools and precise data of various cities around the globe.  I am fascinated how she can weave all this into a rip-roaring tale of greed, deceit and revenge, one that I could not put down despite the fact that I was reading it in a beach community overlooking the balmy Pacific Ocean.  What sets Lynds apart from other thriller writers is the depth of understanding she has for each character's motivations.  This writer knows psychology and, given the right situation, her characters are capable of good and evil and many degrees in between.  Her protagonists grapple with these issues throughout The Last Spymaster.  This is a smart, swift and sexy novel and I've recommended it to my monthly bookclub members.  I urge you to read it, too, you'll be thrilled you did 
 I think my title says it all.  My husband wanted the soundtrack to the Highlander movie and I found out this was it and he loves it 
 I have not always been a big reader, most books were so boring to me that I wished that I never had to read them (or force myself to read them). Accident by Danielle Steel was very different. It actually made me want to read, and I couldn't put this book down! It was amazing, I actually felt like I was in the story and I cried in many parts of it, sometimes my crying was out of happiness. I think that the accident in the story was a great way to bring out the truth of everybody's situation. It may have brought out the worst in them, but in the end it brought out the best. 
 Re-live it, and this time around, have a heck of a lot more laughs!  Barry delivers a biting satire of your American History book, complete with hysterically funny comprehension questions and diorama project assignments at the end of each chapter.  I will never think of the Hawley-Smoot tariff the same again.  The better you know your American history, the funnier this book is.  It brought back lots of memories of class for me 
 This is not a concert video. It is a documentary film that combines concert and audience footage and interviews, and attempts to convey the atmosphere and meaning of the Newport Folk Festival in the first half of the 1960's. As such, it succeeds admirably. Lerner and crew are extremely creative in their camera work and judicious in their editing. They have a wonderful knack for capturing the excitement and diversity of the Festival as well as the hopes, fears, and "humanness" of its attendees. The juxtaposed interviews about the meaning of the Blues with a young Paul Bloomfied and an ancient Sun House alone are worth the rather paltry price of this DVD. It makes for an entertaining and interesting double-feature when combined with A Mighty Wind too 
 Love is the Golden's Light  I read this book in one sitting and I slowed down the closer to the end I got, simply to savor each word and each picture. This book is a heart-sparkler. I laughed so many times and my face is still sore from wearing a big smile from the first page to the last. Insightful, delightful, touching--this book is a treasure. If you have ever shared your life with a Golden, the words and pictures in this book will serve as an affirmation to the deep, shining love and the ever-positive nature of these furry beings. If you have not had the honor of sharing your life with a Golden fur kin, it matters not, Trixie's words will speak to your heart and soothe your soul.  Kathy Anne Harris

 Upon inheriting a cottage in Ireland, Jude Murray takes a chance and literally flees her old life in Chicago, where she taught at a university. Her excuse: she can study the folk stories and Faerie tales of Ireland, pick them and their analogies apart in a laborious paper written for one of those dry, scientific journals.  But Jude is finding more than folk tales in Ireland. She is finding herself, warmth, friendship...and love in the form of one Aidan Gallagher, if she can just let go of all the hurts and haunts of her old life.  Guided by the hand of Faerie magic and the sorrow of a ghost, she and Aidan must resolve to walk a path together as equals or take opposing forks on the road of life.  This is a fantasy romance that is sure to warm the body and spirit of even the most lovelorn souls amongst us. Many young women will spot themselves in the character of Jude Murray--unsure of herself, trying so hard to live up to the expectations of others.  Usually considering myself "above" falling for the ploys of a romance, I found myself caught up in Jude and Aidan's love affair, cheering them on, and even shouting out  "Oh, you dipsticks!" at times. This story will really pull you in!  Jewels of the Sun also spoke to me much of hearth and home--the need for its warmth and stability in the cold aesthetics of the modern world. So, clearly, and much to my shame, I fell in love with the story and its characters. Patricia Daniels also does a lovely job limning the shape and character of the book with her voice--an evocative reading.  reviewed by Sherryl King-Wilds for Fantasy Novel Review  
 This is a book that is very easy to read. It is succinct and thelanguage smooth. The points made in the book are more relevant today than at the time that the book was written. I am sure that if Barbara Tuchman was still alive she would surely add another chapter on Iraq, changing the title to THE MARCH OF FOLLY: FROM TROY TO IRAQ.  It is a work that I would highly recommend to any serious student of histroy as well as those who are cocnerned with the  progess of humanity 
 This Pink Panther film is the best one that I've seen. I've seen The Pink Panther, A Shot In The Dark, Inspector Clouseau, this one, and The Pink Panther {2006}. It has great slapstick comedy by Peter Sellers and the rest of the cast. Speaking of the cast, here they are. Peter Sellers as Inspector Jacques Clouseau, Christopher Plummer as Sir Charles Litton {Lytton}, Catherine Schell as Lady Litton, Herbert Lom as Cheif Inspector Charles Dreyfus, Peter Arne as Colonel Sharky, and of course, Burt Kwouk as my favorite character, CATO. He's awesome! That was my review. Jedi40 
 Since I'm not "hardware oriented" when it comes to technology, you have to work hard to help me understand it.  One book that does a great job is the PC Upgrade and Repair Bible Desktop Edition by Barry Press and Marcia Press (Wiley).  Chapter list:  Getting Ready; Why Isn't the Same Computer Right for Everyone?; PC Overview; Processors, Cache, and Memory; Buses, Chipsets, and Motherboards; Video; Monitors and Flat Panels; Hard Disks and Disk Arrays; CD and DVD; Removable Storage; Modems; Wired and Wireless Networking; Hubs, Switches, Routers, and Firewalls; Configuring a Windows Network; Internet Services, Antivirus, and Anti-Spam; Sound Cards, Speakers, Microphones, and MP3 Players; Digital Cameras, Video Capture, and DVDs; Keyboards and Game Controllers; Mice, Trackballs, and Tablets; Printers, Scanners, and All-in-One Units; Cases, Cooling, and Power; Laptops and Handheld Computers; You're Going to Put That Where?; Diagnosis and Repair; Building an Extreme Machine; Glossary; Index  As I mentioned above, I'm a software developer and I just want my hardware to work.  One of the hardest things for me to do would be to try and build a computer from scratch.  But watching my son (who has no fear of hardware) has made me a bit more at ease with it.  And with this book, I think I could actually try it.  Each of the chapters gives an excellent explanation about how that piece of hardware works and how it fits into the larger picture of a full computer.  For instance, in the CD chapter you'll get an understandable write-up of how information is stored and read on a CD-ROM disk.  Then they transition into how a DVD is read and how the drive functions.  And I actually understood it!  The only place where I thought this book was a little weak is that there doesn't seem to be a lot of upgrade or repair instructions.  I expected more along the lines of step-by-step pictures and instructions on how to replace or repair certain parts in your machine.  There is some of that towards the end when you get into the Diagnosis and Repair chapters, but little as you're working through the book.  Some buyers might be a little upset that the title doesn't quite mesh with the content of the book.  Still, the actual content *is* quite good...  just not what you might expect.  Overall, I like the book a lot as it helps me understand my computer hardware better than I did before.  Just a minor deduction for possible title and content confusion.. 
 This is Shirley Jackson's hilarious account of her struggles raising an expanding family of children.  She is delightfully unsentimental in her account of family life, and any harassed parent will recognise the situations she finds herself in.  For instance, what parent hasn't suffered the anguish of trying to eat in a restaurant with young children, how well Shirely Jackson sums of the sheer horror of that situation, among many others.  I didn't think there could ever be a book about child-raising as funny as Jean Kerr's 'Please Don't Eat the Daisies' but this one runs it a very close second 
 I got the Impressa F7 for mother's day and it has changed my life around! The coffee is predictably par excellence and both my husband and I have no desire to go out for coffee anymore. In fact when we are out, we would rather come home than go to Starbucks. The machine seemed formidable at first (I find any thing with manuals to be intimidating), but after reading the manual and trying out the F7 a few times I got it right. I have since perfected the art of frothing and steaming. It comes with a video, though I did not watch it. CONS: has a fairly large foot print....needs a lot of counter space. Flavored coffee beans cannot be used in the grinder....something to do with the oils. Because of this I have switched from hazelnut coffee to unflavored coffee, and frankly, the coffee is so good that I don't miss the flavored kind.  The accessories such as the water filter and the cleaning tablets are not easily available.....I have to order them directly from Capresso, or from Williams and Sonoma. Finally, although this is a somewhat expensive machine ($1400), we have recovered half the cost of the machine over the past 3 months by not going to specialty coffee stores and spending $3 for each cup.  Hope you find this review helpful. K 
 I've never even heard of this guy. I was at the bookstore and I started reading this edition for no reason. Immediately, he became one of my top five favorite writers. Each story I completed, I was just that more amazed. Amazed with his work and the fact I had never heard of him. I feel it's very sensitive, down-to-earth work. He is an ace at describing the outer scene while also gouging out the the inside. And it is so gouged out, that you can't help but find pieces of your own despair and failings there. Maybe the stories will mirror some similar experiences in your life. I've read writers who could do this. It's hard to find those who can do it so well. This book has introduced me to a lesser-known writer (to me at least) who is greatly capable of this craft 
 When I become aware of a person, I really want to know where they came from.  What did they start out as?  How did they get to where they got?  Were they born rich and just got richer?  (Trump and Gates, for instance.)  Were they splitting rails like Abe Lincoln?  In the case of this book, Jack Welch was born to relatively modest beginnings and became one of the most powerful men in the world.  I found this book to be a great story of a man who went on to lead a giant corporation and gain status as a superstar CEO.  It was, to me, a fascinating book.    Good stuff about what it's like to play in the big leagues 
 When Chaz Perrone throws his wife Joey overboard during their anniversary cruise, he thought he had it all figured out.  Hot looks and great legs not-with-standing, Joey was positioned to ruin it all.  But as Dr. Chaz Perrone's luck would have it, Joey doesn't even have the courtesy to die...instead, the formerly expert swimmer manages to keep her head above water, literally, thanks to a floating bale of marijuana and a hot ex-cop named Mick Stranahan.  When Joey comes to on Mick's deserted island, her eyes are swollen shut, she aches all over, but mostly she is furious.  At herself, for marrying a toad like Chaz...and at Chaz, for having the audacity to toss her from a luxury cruiseliner.  Whatever did she do to deserve such treatment?  Joey is determined to find out..... What follows is a deliciously wild romp through the swampy waterways of South Florida...where Joey is determined to get revenge on Chaz, Mick would like to get Joey, and Chaz is determined to emerge unscathed and rich as hell, doctorate credentials intact.  But Chaz's other head tends to land him in trouble, and when he falls from favor with his rich benefactor and his women on the side, he finds himself on the run....complete with a CroMagnon babysitter.  A glorious story of karma....readers everywhere will sigh with satisfaction at the ending.   DY 
 My first Tamilee workout DVD's and I think they're both great.  I have many workout tapes and this is a great addition to my collection - rates as two of my favorites.   Challenging, but can be modified for the out-of-shape (like I was when I started doing these workouts) Not cheesy Good timing/queues Good understanding of muscle groups worked/purposed of exercises Not boring...I have not grown tired of these and have used them over and over Try the 'extra' 10-min abs - you will definitely feel it! Also a fan of Kathy Smith, Cindy Crawford (Total Challenge) and Windsor Pilates 
 My 1-year old daughter really responds to this board book. She loves the dog, and I think she relates to the colorful simplicity of the illustrations. I appreciate the story, and that it takes place in a city, which will be nice for her as she grows old enough to understand that 
 This is a great book and the best of the bunch when it comes to analyzing dice control. The reviewer who cites Heavy as an authority on craps or controlled shooting must have spent time in the prisoner of war camp of Hogan's Heroes. What a joke!   Sharpshooter is an engineer who fully understands the math and physics behind a controlled throw, something that other writers of self-published books mentioned below, do not.  This is worth reading 
 I am a big fan of Dogfish Head beer and when I found out that brewer and entrepreneur Sam Calagione wrote a book about his company I was anxious to read it to see if Calagione had any interesting tips on the business of brewing and how he has made the Dogfish Head brand practically a household name among both beer geeks and beer critics. What I discovered with this book is that Sam Calagione has some good advice to offer brewing/restaurant entrepreneurs and others who have a pressing urge to start their own company. He has tried many different things, and his penchant for the unusual has proven to be a great success and it forms the backbone of his business.   Calagione spends the majority of this book discussing Dogfish Head Brewing from the early days of formation all the way to the point of maturity. He talks about his own business model and how it has helped transform his company. He talks about everything from innovation to employee morale to profit sharing to community involvement. He shows how his model of success has worked for his type of business and how the same model can be applied to other types of businesses as well.   This book see- saws back and forth between business guide and autobiography but it leans more toward the business side of the equation. Calagione frequently offers up his own company as an example of which business tactics work and which do not. Calagione has achieved a great deal of success but he has the humility to admit that he has also made his share of mistakes. He points these out in the book where appropriate, showing how a misstep here and a miscalculation there added up to exponential problems down the road and what you, the fledgling business owner, can do to avoid making the same mistakes.   Sam Calagione offers some good, basic advice on starting and running a successful company. His writing style is easy to read and his approach to business is a little different from other books of the same genre. Business books can often get boring and tedious to read but this one manages to keep the reader's attention through its simplicity and its personable style. It can get a little bit repetitive from time to time but the advice offered is generally sound and what Calagione says makes good sense. Also, one needs to keep in mind that this book is intended more as a business book for a newly minted entrepreneur. More experienced professional will not find very much useful here. Its targeted audience is the new or soon- to- be- new- small business owner.   One small disappointment with this book is that it's a business guide more than anything else. The reason I say this is because I was hoping to find out more about the man behind Shelter Pale Ale and Chicory Stout and not just a book about starting and running a company. Calagione does share a few personal moments from his past, like his expulsion from private school; his passion for beer; the role his wife has played in his success; etc. But other than this, the book is more about business than anything else.    "Brewing up a Business" is, overall, a good book for the budding entrepreneur and for beer geeks of all stripes and colors. Sam Calagione writes well and he offers up a good deal of humor to keep the book from getting too serious. He has achieved a great deal of success with his Dogfish Head Brewing Company and he wants to share this success with small business owners everywhere. With the right passion, innovation, and drive, a small company can achieve greatness and Sam Calagione is a tribute to this fact.   
 I've been researching ADD for over a year now and was in need of some practical suggestions to cope...and found it in this book...written in a down-to-earth, amusing manner, it is one of the best books I've run across for help in a while.  I recommend it 
 This book is an overview of agile model-drive development, while uses a story about practice agile development for a university system. This application is so simple that it may take only one small incremental step to develop. The author does not care to complete this system at the end since he knows it is very simplistic. It is not necessary to carry out any refectory and iteration. On the journey, the author often stops to tell his experience and point out some treasures exposed along the path. However, at the end, you realize that you are still at Disney Land, although this time guided by a real pathfinder who repeatedly told us it is for real. The author provided several UML diagrams supposedly developed on a white board. But it makes no difference whatsoever if they are printed. They are just decorations to make it looks real. Actually, it is hard to read, as complained by other reviewers.   The main title of the third edition, The Object Primer, is misleading. This book is mainly about agile model-driven development, which is part of the subtitle. A better title of this book should be The Primer of Agile Model-Driven Development. This book does not teach you very much about object itself. Chapter 2 gives you a review of object-oriented concepts. If you are new to OO, such brief coverage will not help you very much. This is not a book that teaches you UML either. UML 2.0 is used throughout this book in straightforward cases. If you are new to UML, you have to read other books first.  This is a well-written book and you may learn a lot IF you are one of the targeted audiences. The author stated, this book is aimed at two primary audiences - existing developers and university/college students who want to gain the fundamental skills required to succeed on modern software development projects. The author give a quite "radical" (his own words) definition of developer as ANYONE involved in the development of a software applications, including programmers, analysts, designers, business stakeholders, database administrators, support engineers, and so on. I understand ANY author wants to sell his/her books as much as possible. But this author is established. He does not have to make us believe that the university registrar needs to read this book merely to be part of the team working on university system mentioned this book. My recommendation is that this book is really written for software developers and students who already have reasonable understanding and certain experience in terms of object-oriented approaches and UML, and they wish to have an overview on how to conduct agile development.  The author provided instructions on how to read this book. I somehow do not total agree with his recommendation. Below is my suggestion following his classification of different groups of readership.  For Programmers, Designers, and Project Managers, the author suggests them to read the entire book. I somehow feel different. If you are a project manager but not that technical, you will feel this book difficult if not impossible. If you are a project manager for a software development project merely since you are PMI certified, you have a lot to learn before you come to this book. If you are a VB programmer and you are not confident on what OO really means, you should read other books.   For Business Analysts and User Representatives, the author said Chapters 4 through 9 is written specifically for you. Well, this is 6 chapters with 144 pages out of a book of 12 chapters with 492 pages. Furthermore, I am not sure why the author believes you need to learn Singleton Design Pattern (12.2.1) and Façade Design Pattern (12.2.2).  For Students, the author asks you to read the book cover to cover. I agree with the author on this, as long as you are the right type of the students who have learned OO and UML and who needs to get the idea how agile approach works and how a project is developed conceptually. If you are still not sure about polymorphism, this book will not help you.  I am an experienced developer and I teach as well at university. I am within the targeted audiences of this book and I do buy many books. I completed this book within days after receiving it since it is quite readable. I am glad I added this book to my collection and I will certainly review it again and again, but perhaps mainly for my teaching duties.   I still give this book a 4-star rating since it gives us a good conceptual model kind of overview on agile model-driven development, with practical advices sometimes. However, he has yet had the time to implement his model (write more substance). He sees the needs of readers and he has made one more incremental deliverable, the 3rd edition. We hope he will get the feedback from us and make another try quickly, one with more implementations. For instance, since this book is an overview, the author should have provided references whenever necessary that lead us to further studies and discussions. The book contains a reference list with more than 100 entries at the end of the book. The problem is that the author expects a developer to figure out what references are relevant when he/she is reading a particular chapter or subject.   The list price of this book is $45; but it sells at $30 with Super Saver Shipping (free shipping) at Amazon.com. As a matter of fact, this book is free for me since I bought it by using the $30 discount I received when I signed up with Amazon Platinum Visa Card.   /* The statement and opinions expresses here are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my employer */ 
 I love this book!!! I worked in the restaurant business for 10 years. Now that I have a "real job", I find myself missing the crazy work hours of reataurant life. I miss the people, because really, restaurant people are like no other. You either belong in the business or you don't.  This book is just perfect. 
 Ms Soto does an excellent job of integrating her obviously extensive knowlege of and experience in hispanic marketing with a vital strategic framework.  This book provides both the novice and the experienced a valuable opportunity to formulate and critique their own efforts and interests.  This approach allows them to proceed from a solid footing rather than merely on the basis of the latest marketing fad.    
 This book was very good, but I didn't write a review to praise this book, only to coreect "Tiara"'s misconception.  Gwynne doesn't end up with Donovan because of alcohol.  Do you know why she had to tell herself, "I can do this, I can do this . . ." She is a lesbian who is in love with her best friend, and she feels betrayed when Darcy hooks up with a guy. Gwynne obviously isn't ready to tell Darcy how she feels, so when Darcy hooks up with Donovan's best friend--Gwynne decides to play it straight, so to speak.  I missed this the first time I read it, along with other themes in some of the other stories 
 This is a fast read and a great eye-opener. The whole theme really is about awareness and should get readers into questioning how they deal with real life and how they train in the martial arts world. Not the strongest on technique but the book is re-readable and should be a standard book in any martial arts instructor's book shelf. Highly recommended, especially at that price. Now if only the other books would get back into print.. 
 This was one of Stargate SG-1's funniest episode ever. You get to finally see The FURLINGS for the first time, too bad it took 200 episodes. (And too bad they may not be real).   If you're a Science Fiction fan you'll love the Burns that go around in this episode. Especially the Star Trek and Farscape burns which were Hilarious. This is the perfect 200th episode for those loyal fans that stood by and watched every episode for the last decade.   
 With her emotionally charged performances, her beautiful voice, enchanting songwriting, and masterful piano playing, Charlotte Martin has forged quite the reputation for herself.  I first caught on to her with "On Your Shore" which I bought on a whim not really knowing anything about her and only having heard some song clips through the record stores listening station.  I instantly fell in love with her.  Everything about her is beautiful.  Her degree in opera has helped her to carve out quite a niche.  Her songs are a rich blend of opera, pop, dance, alternative, and a touch of goth.  Her one girl army performances are divine.  You can really feel the emotion in her songs as they come alive on stage.  If you like to try something refreshingly different than your typical bubble gum, cookie cutter music, then give Charlotte a good listen.  I think you'll enjoy 
 False Memory by Dean Koontz is a study of terror...it delves into the deepest part of an individual's sub-conscious and the complexities inherent.   It is a study of mind-control and the sheer breadth of one man's dementia and almost demonic character. The villain is Dr. Mark Ahriman, an outwardly kind, compassionate, and utterly "dedicated" member of his profession, who is a therapist. Fooling the outside world with his faï¿½ade of respectability, Ahriman has been ruthlessly brainwashing his patients into performing unspeakable acts of brutality for him. He leaves a grisly path of carnage behind him as many of his patients destroy themselves and their loved ones, these acts having been programmed into them.  His dastardly plan begins to unravel however, when after he programs his newest patient Susan Jagger into committing suicide, her best friend Martina Rhodes ( nicknamed "Martie") and her husband Dusty begin to investigate this bizaare case. Having been close since children, Martie simply cannot accept the verdict of `suicide' for her best friend and suspects foul play. At the same time, however, both her and her husband are experiencing frightening occurrences as in Martie's case, a desperate fear of harming her family, and for Dusty, unusual lapses in time. Will they put an end to this horror? Will they ultimately triumph or fail? Find out in Dean Koontz's tightly written masterpiece "False Memory"!  
 My daughter (18 months) loves this book and its vibrant illustrations. I read the simple text with rolling excitement and she follows the dancing baby right to the end. Very simple and very sweet 
 I have two domestic long-hair cats that love sleeping on the couch.  One of my cats has a bladder problem, and my last couch lasted only a year and a half because of it!  When I bought my new couch, I also bought the large Scat Mat to get some life out of my couch.    I was worried about the intensity of the shock of the Scat Mat, but I kept the mat set to the lowest intensity.  My friends touched the mat just to ensure that it wasn't too intense - it startles the cats but obviously doesn't hurt them.  I only had to use the mat for a week before my cats had learned to stay away from the couch.  In fact, they don't go near the couch at all.  Even though the mat only covers the seat cushions, my cats don't even jump up on the back cushions or even scratch the arms 
 I do not understand what people  expect? This book was one of teh best (and we bought many) books to help my daughter understan dteh adoption process - it was teh only one which didn't involve teh birth mother  which is something that can be introduced later when they are little older... Though my daughter is from India (not domestic) it still works - children are not so literal to think a car seat means that you literally got a car seat.  4 years later it is still one of her favourite bed time stories and has helped us introduce teh concept of adoption very easily. I reccoemnd it to all new adoptive parents adopting small children 
 I bought this cuff on recommendation of my Md.  My HMO tested it to be among the best. I've used this BP cuff almost 100 times now.  It appears to be consistently reliable, and has been accurate when tested against standard cuff results.  The ComFit Cuff is much easier to use than the previous "D" ring kind.  The only negative I can say about it is that it is sensitive to any movement during use, and you need to use it with your arm positioned with elbow on a stable surface.  Otherwise, it will give an "error" message.   I am an RN, and I strongly recommend it.  I also think it would be easy for most elderly adults to use.  
 If you are a moralistic bore, who was offended by Little Miss Sunshine (as apparently many were) DON'T watch this film.  If you enjoy the early films of John Waters and enjoy being jolted and even disturbed by over the top violent humor, then I say 'what are you waiting for a second brick to the head? 
 I have to thank the New York Times Book Review for inducing me to read the book. Because it is so painful to read abot the Shoah and because most of the facts are already imprinted in my brain, I avoid books on the subject. But I wanted to know what was going on, as some of the revisionist ideas had filtered through and were bothering me. I found everything I wanted in this book, plus a lot more.  The trauma is there, so the more we know and understand, the better 
 Terrific writing and story line.  You wont be able to stop thinking about it all day long till you finish it!  Excellent twists through out the whole thing too.  The story just keeps getting deeper and more twisted.  I'm looking forward to reading the rest of Tess' books.    Definately pick up this book! 
 We bought this book for both of our daughters when they became pregnant and both have enjoyed hours of reading looking for just the right name.  The book includes the name origins, which can help when picking a name for your child 
 This novel was amazing.  It is just as good as Jurassic Park and I recommend it to anyone who loved Jurassic Park.  This novel is much better than the movie so if you liked Lost World, then you should definitely read this.  Crichton realistially extends this series and keeps you entertained throughout the book.  Once you pick it up, you won't want to put it down 
 I am writing this review primarily to let people know what to expect from this product, since Amazon/Toys R Us don't seem to have a clue - even the image was provided by a thoughtful customer. I bought this in-store at Toys R Us because sizing information was not available online (except for the size of the box, for some bizarre reason) and I didn't want to take a chance with getting the wrong size. So let me share that information with you - this helmet is suitable for head sizes from 20.5" to 22". I think overall that this is a great set, but I marked it down a point because it does not include elbow protection. From my own experience learning to skate or even snowboard, I can say that I would generally fall onto my knees or the heels of my hands, so knee pads and wrist guards would be perfect for me. But with a young child who knows?! This is for my neice (I am not a parent) and whilst I am generally happy with the set as it is, I think it would be nice to include the elbow protection (which is afterall available in other sets, but does not appear to be available separately) to make a complete safety package. Perhaps we are supposed to buy and extra set so we have the elbow pads and two sets of knee pads, or perhaps I am a touch too cynical 
 I've heard only a sample of this record, but I have to say that in 'A Little Priest' Todd's voice/acting is rather a measure below Lansbury's. I recently saw Sweeney Todd (three times) at the 5th Avenue Theatre in Seattle, and after browsing press release photographs from other shows, and hearing different casts sing, I have to say the Todd from our showing here was the best I've ever heard and probably the best I will ever see. 
 I used the video tape of this exercise routine for several years until I wore it out.  I started using it when I was very out of shape and unable to use a step.  I then progressed to the step, adding on levels, then to weights, and then to heavier weights.  As you can tell, this video is great for use from beginners to those experienced enough to use weights while aerobicizing. It is a lot of fun, and I never get bored with it.  
 I heard this man speak first, which was what convinced me to get the book.  Incredibly relevant content for today, and even more relevant when you start extrapolating into the Mexican and South American native history.  I must admit though that there are a few pages in there where I raised my eyebrows at some of his "optimism", but then again I can learn from that as well.  "Never stop dreaming until you're ready to wake up and do it" 
 And by peace-loving, I mean non-Muslim...  Islam is a belief system invented by a regional medieval warlord to help subjugate local tribes.  It has become earth's cancer.  Imagine the KKK with a billion people, including heads of states.  Imagine the Third Reich spanning 20 countries instead of just one.  Their scriptures (the unholy ramblings of a regional bully--and a murderer and pedophile) advocate global genocide and the sickening enslavement and humiliation of women. Of course, their brainwashed soldiers will comment on the "decadence" and the "polytheism" of the West.  What they won't say is that they'd secretly love to see every man, woman, child and baby slaughtered.  If Churchill were alive he'd recognize fully the gathering storm.  Sadly, we're up to our neck in politically-correct appeasers.   
 Mechanical Resonance is absolutely fantastic and it deserves so much more credit that it is getting. Actually Tesla deserves so much more credit altogether, but they are terrific in my eyes and songs like EZ Come EZ Go, Cumin' Atcha Live, Modern Day Comboy, 2 Late for Love, Changes, and Gettin' Better are awesome. I'm glad Tesla are back and I hope one day they come out with that one album that will make them superstars 
 Bulky, noisy and takes up lots of space - BUT it is the greatest drink mixer you'll ever buy.  My wife is the queen of frosty drinks.  With this blender the ingredients don't separate half-way through your drinking pleasure.  Our old mixer, also touted as a professional blender, caused the ingedients to separate in the glass after about 3 minutes.  Have not seen that happening after this blender get's through doing its job. Crushes ice without cringing and is esstially oblivious to anything thrown in, just blends everyting into a great pulp.  Highly recommended for the serious frosty drinker 
 An impressive survey of Chinese intellectual development in the 1990s 
 This too is a good box set, always enjoyed this series.  Nothing bad in it, just good entertainment 
 What a classic album - this is a great debut - and in my eyes it is every bit as good as 'the Queen is Dead'. 'What Difference Does It Make' is one of the best songs Morrissey ever penned - it is really one of his songs that sums up all of his work as an artist. No other band of the 80's was so intelligent 
 Yes, a five-star book compared to most of them, but compared to "USA," this novel's a warm-up, between 3 & 4 stars, rounded up for innovation if not poise. In the start of each chapter you get marvelous, miniature modernist riffs, reminding me of saxophones, Carl Sandburg, Whitman, and Joyce (he loves those runoncompounds too); these anticipate the "Camera Eye" vignettes that would enrich "USA"'s own prose concoctions. Jimmy Derf (some surname) and Ellen Oglethorpe emerge at the end as the two main characters; others come and go much like life itself--the central figure is not one human but a cast of millions. As an urban reporter here, Dos Passos excels at capturing the snatches of dialogue, smells of the bums, grit of the air (it's rare that nature itself is shown as less than threatening, when it's evident at all), and shouts and noise that, then as now, relentlessly hums and pounds along Manhattan's streets. It's naturalism combined with realism.  Since "USA" for all its flaws is one of my favorite novels, I wanted to compare "MT." The pace is very quick: I read this in three sittings, one per main section. What still seems innovative eight decades later is Dos Passos' ability to skip forward within a dialogue to show how the minutes pass even as the characters are speaking--you hear enough to understand that moment, but the next line may be a half hour later into the situation or scene or action. This "jump-cut" characteristic becomes a bit maddening at times, as it does in cinema, but technically it's fun to watch! This adds to the filmic parallels that flow through "MT," which keeps the clips coming much as a well-edited docudrama might pull off.   After 9/11, some readers of the opening pages of "Moby Dick" noticed headlines of "war in Afghanistan" and the like that seemed to presage the current turmoil, 150 years before. Towards the end of "MT," my eye lingered as I re-read this paragraph: from a failed con-man talking to a slick lawyer: "I happen to know from a secret and reliable source that there is a subversive plot among undesirable elements in this country...Good God think of the Wall Street bomb outrage...I must say that the attitude of the press has been gratifying in one respect...in fact we're approaching a national unity undreamed of before the war." (part 3. ch. 1)   Dos Passos rarely lets his characters stand still and think things through. They try, but there's always someone bursting through the door, or buttonholing them on the street, or the danger, in one dramatic case, of daydreaming leading to disaster. He captures the frenetic speed demanded by NYC, and 20c city life, in this chronicle of a couple of handfuls of characters drawn to the bright lights, and the indifference of the city towards their ambitions and schemes. It's not uplifting or casual reading, but for an immersion into the sensations that ran through and past those who grew up from about 1900-1925, this novel, while uneven, captures what it must have been like for the latest generation who thought they were the first to invent novelty, encounter licentiousness, or concoct flim-flam and skulk around in deceit and skulduggery. Homosexuality, racism, injustice, bootlegging, protest, complacency, war-fever, and rags-to-riches and back down: all these color and vivify the portrayals of the few who stand for millions more in Manhattan.  The slang may have changed since then, and the buildings have grown higher, but the people, even though they are more types than rounded (with the exception of about half-a-dozen who endure through most of the novel)--they are the kinds of figures you can still encounter today on any crowded street.   
 Yes, there is a ridiculous number of post-punk bands out there today- The Futureheads, Kaiser Chiefs, etc... and while I love them all, the boys of Maximo Park have proven that they can stand out. The killer riffs and beats are only the beginning- frontman Paul Smith (in addition to proving that combovers can be sexy and making scissor kicks look effortless) writes lyrics full of wit and heartache and sings his heart out with the most conviction I've seen in a lead singer in the past few years. But anyway, to the album...  "Signal And Sign", the album's opener, is a strong beginning with a really catchy beat that sucks you in, but by the time "Apply Some Pressure" opens, the beat is downright infectious. This song is my personal favorite, not just because it is dangerously catchy- it's got everything from the singer's "fragile desperation" (as Smith put it) to the hope of starting all over again and being in love. Maximo Park have been accused of being pessimistic, but this song shows that there is real hope in the midst of all the desperation.  "Graffiti", the album's most popular single, is quintessential Maximo Park- the line "I'll do graffiti if you sing to me in French... What are we doing here if romance isn't dead?" is witty, romantic, and powerful.  "Postcard Of A Painting" is usually overlooked by listeners but it would have been prime single material. The melody bounces along and as Smith cries out "Your eyes are big when they're so close, why can't we say goodbye in public?" the conviction in his voice is amazingly powerful. This definitely has an infectious pop beat that rivals more popular singles like the previous two tracks.  "Going Missing" is one of the more depressing songs but has a melody that sticks in your head, even five days later, when you find yourself singing "This can't go on, so I should just forget it, forget it, forget it..." While the singer is only imagining his love with someone else ("Mr. Brightside"-esquely), you can feel a foreboding feeling throughout the song.  "I Want You To Stay" is my next favorite after "Apply Some Pressure". The beat for this song is very rhythmic and yet different from the other songs on the album. The lyrics paint a vivid, romantic portrait that makes you feel the pain of a lost love that the singer refuses to and can't ever forget. It's the most heartfelt, tearjerking song on the whole album, and really shows off Maximo Park's romanticism, poetry, and ability to make dangerously catchy pop songs that can be mainstream and still touch the heart.  "Limassol" has got a lot of really good keyboard and is quite poppy. It's probably the most pessimistic/angsty but with that angst comes a lot of passion. The line "Saw the lights on in your window, even though they said you'd gone" is a little stalkerish,  but pretty good.  "The Coast Is Always Changing" is very direct ("I am young and I am lost"- a big theme of this album) and bittersweet. It's witty like the rest of the album but has an especially earnest quality. The keyboards are really New-Wavey and the song reminds me of the Smiths a lot.  "The Night I Lost My Head" is a little bit humorous as it's basically about meeting someone special, but being just a bit too inebriated. Just a bit.  "Once A Glimpse" is ridiculously catchy. You can hear the bass and guitar play off each other perfectly- the whole song is brimming with energy and angst. It's definitely one that makes you want to jump around.  "Now I'm All Over The Shop" is different in that the singer is in control of the situation, and that dynamic makes it very interesting. Beginning few lines are especially catchy, and the line "I know you'll be fine now that you're not mine!" is one of my favorite lines in the whole album.  "Acrobat" is definitely different- it's spoken-word, which is often the downfall of many a well-meaning artist (just think Madonna's "American Life" rap)... yet instead of standing out as awkward it stands out as especially poignant. It also slows the album down a bit and gives you a bit of a break from all the crazy dancing you've probably been doing since you started listening... I know it isn't just me... seriously...  "Kiss You Better" races quickly and is maybe the most optimistic song on the album. Smith exits pleading "You, you're so scared, that you're just gonna let it happen!" and before you know it, it's over. In my personal experience, it ends before you can realize it and leaves you optimistic, despite the final line not exactly being full of sunshine.  As for flaws- the only flaw I see is that the album ends too soon! Maximo Park have definitely set the bar high for other bands and for themselves, but if their sophomore effort turns out half as good as "A Certain Trigger" it'll be a knockout (in a good way). Many accuse Maximo Park of being no different from other post-punk bands, even though every second of A Certain Trigger says otherwise. Many artists make catchy pop songs, others make romantic and lyrical songs, but Maximo Park is one of the few bands out there who can combine all these factors so well. Paul Smith, Lukas Wooller (keyboards), Duncan Lloyd (guitar), Archis Tiku (bass) and Tom English (drums) come together to that killer formula that makes Maximo Park soar above the rest. Long live post-punk.. 
 I first heard Pete live as an opening act and even as he had to fix his amp himself because he couldn't afford roadies I knew it was magic.  Every song on this album tells a diffrent story in a beautiful voice and catches me in a diffrent way- there isn't a single one I don't like.  "Caus it already is (For Nancy)" however has always been my favorite.  If you like good rock and can appreciate something that plays on the softer side at times definately pick this and his other works up 
 The New Money Masters by John Train is the successor to his first book and is just as informative.  Investors covered include the following: Jim Rogers, Michael Steinhardt, Philip Caret, George Soros, George Michaelis,  John Neff, Ralph Wanger, and Peter Lynch.  Outstanding investing is the  result of a disciplined mental process.  It is time well spent to learn how  these investors think 
 I loved the Mad Scientist club series (see my review of the "Mad Scientist Club" book). This is a continuation of that. Yes, the Hardy Boys are good, but this is better 
 Comfy and pretty - these are like the PERFECT shoes.  I get so many compliments on them.  Shiny leather, low-ish heel make these ideal 
 This was part of my "assigned reading" when I first became an IT consultant.  It does a fantastic job of providing practical guidance to anyone who interacts with people (i.e., all of us).  There are numerous example dialogues and many gems of advice 
 Harold Bloom is certainly one of our leading critics and one of the few left who can honestly use that title. He rightly spends a good 100 pages of his book attacking the fake critics of today, people concerned only with advancing their (normally narrow-minded) beliefs. They dont' care about good writing, they care about Christians or Homosexuals or Black power or some other narrow catagory and spend all their time promoting authors who fit the catagory, regardless of quality.   All of his comments on these people and in the importance of the canon are great and necessary. His very long (and very diverse ethnically and genderwise, despite what many pretend) list of the canon is excellent: the perfect place to look when considering what to read next.   I would, however, say that his writing on th authors is often a little over-the-top, especially when he discusses Shakespeare. Shakespeare is claery the greatest dramatist ever and a good candidate for greatest writer... and he IS certainly the center of the canon. He is not, however, the be-all end-all of literature and the rest of literature is not some mere imitation of him. In general, sometimes his prose feels to much like lavish purple praise instead of interesting criticism.   Still, overall this is a worthwhile book and the canon itself is invaluble. 
 This album is a collection of songs from from the very early days of the Birthday Party, many of which were recorded as the band "The Boys Next Door," (circa 1979) but this is definitely some good stuff.  Songs like "the Friend Catcher" and "The Hair Shirt" definitely reflect the band's later darker direction.  It doesn't end there; "A Catholic Skin," is a pounding rhythm-based jam, (read: deep, bass centered groove) as is the final track "The Hair Shirt,".  For those looking for some great Post-Punk music this is an exceptional beginning. The Birthday Party were an intense group by design, and as an introduction into later, more chaotic works this re-release functions extremely well.  Death rock owes much to these guys and I, for one, love them.  Those who appreciate Nick Cave should get a lot out of this.  Follow this album with the Mutiny/Bad Seed EP.  The Birthday Party were immensely important, whether or not you like their insane songs.  Listen.  Learn and judge for yourself, no one else can say anymore than that.         
 This is one of only two novels that I was forced to read for school and actually ENJOYED! A definite page-turner! You won't be able to stop reading it 
 Mary Austin's brilliant essay on a small corner of California is the subject of this breathtaking book.  In prose of unvarying beauty and satisfaction she paints a stunning portrait of high mountains and deepest valleys, describes in vivid detail the lives of the native Indians and Mexican immigrants, and reminds her readers that there is life and vitality to be found in these trackless desert regions.  I believe you will agree with her own motivation for writing "The Land of Little Rain" after reading it:  "...as one lover of it can give to another.&quo 
 Edward Ruppelt spent years at the helm of Project Blue Book in the days when the Air Force was seriously trying to figure out what was going on, rather than acting solely as an instrument to debunk genuine sightings and placate a confused populace. This book is a great history of the late forties, early fifties so far as the "Martian threat" is concerned.  Ruppelt put together a team of investigators who put serious time and effort into interviewing witnesses and cataloging data. They tried several proactive initiatives to capture verifiable evidence of UFO activity, such as sending up jets loaded with film in the gun cameras, but could never come away with quite enough evidence to convince the top Pentagon brass of the UFO's unearthly nature.   Not that Ruppelt couldn't supply plenty of evidence. Most everyone who looked at what he had compiled became convinced of the interplanetary explanation. The problem wasn't the availability of proof; the problem was in determining how much proof constitutes absolute proof. There never was the smoking gun which would convince the brass to accept the interplanetary explanation as the definitive explanation. So long as the UFO's could possibly be harmless natural light and/or weather phenomena, then there was no reason to take a definitive position.  Ruppelt has a great point of view. He remained stalwart in gathering evidence and trying every possible way to explain each UFO sighting as an explainable occurrence. He had about an 80% success rate. Most sightings indeed were weather balloons, nonconventional aircraft, Venus, temperature inversions, or seagulls. These explanations were given plenty of press. The 20% unknowns were simply unknowns with no further comment given.  This historical document of an interesting era in military and social history takes on added depth with the 1979 bombshell of our supposed recovery of a downed craft in Roswell in the summer of 1947. As you read of Ruppelt repeatedly facing resistance to the extraterrestrial option from the Pentagon, you can question whether the directive was coming down from the top to put the kabosh on the ET explanation until "more proof is made available" while the top brass is sitting on the ultimate proof all along, with Ruppelt none the wiser 
 Having thoroughly enjoyed Charles Slack's marvelous 2003 offering "Noble Obsession: Charles Goodyear, Thomas Hancock, and the Race to Unlock The Greatest Industrial Secret of the Nineteeth Century",  I was eager to read "Hetty" despite the fact that I had never even heard of her.  She is a largely forgotten figure in American history. In his "Acknowlegements" at the end of the book, author Charles Slack recalls that he embarked on this project at the urging of his mother despite the fact that at the outset "I only had the vaguest idea of who she was talking about." Hetty Green was the daughter of Edward Mott Robinson of New Bedford, Mass.  Robinson made his fortune in whaling and his daughter Hetty exhibited a keen interest in business from a very early age. This was highly unusual for a young girl in those days but Hetty was determined to follow in her fathers footsteps.  Hetty was raised a Quaker and as such she did not believe in showering herself with luxuries.  Rather, she spent virtually her entire life scrimping and saving.  This was certainly not necessary because Hetty Green would become by all accounts the richest woman in the world.  She owned dozens of buildings in New York, Boston, Chicago and St.Louis.  She owned warehouses and gold mines and was also a major player in the emerging railroad industry.  She would be a force to be reckoned with on the American financial scene for more than half a century. And you did not cross Hetty Green as her archrival, the legendary industrialist Collis P. Huntington, would discover early on.  At the time of her passing in 1916, her empire was conservatively estimated to be valued at more than $100.000.000!!! Charles Slack is a marvelous storyteller.  In "Hetty", you will also learn about Hetty Green's personal life which in many ways was beyond bizarre. Yes, she did find time to marry and have two children, Ned and Sylvia. But in spite of her enormous wealth Hetty Green spent virtually her entire adult life living in cheap tenements in places like Hoboken, NJ in an effort to avoid the press and more importantly the taxman. But what made Hetty tick was clearly not her personal life.  Rather, it was the business world that consumed her.  "Hetty" recalls the remarkable story of America's first female tycoon.  It is very well written and highly entertaining.  Recommended!      
 This book was revolutionary in terms of animal rights theory when published in 1995.  Gary Francione is a law professor as well as a philosopher, and his legal expertise allowed him to add an essential component to animal rights theory that was missing in the previous literature.  That is the realization that animals are human property, and that in the United States legal system, property cannot by definition have meaningful interests compared to property owners.  Our laws purport to balance the interests of humans and animals, but this book is replete with examples of U.S. judicial decisions which show that the property status of animals pre-determines the outcome of that balance in favor of humans.  Animals, Property, and the Law is a must read for students of animal rights, animal law, jurisprudence, and moral philosophy.  It addresses certain topics, including the doctrine of legal standing, in more depth than do Francione's later books.  It also provides a rich and devastating critique of the federal Animal Welfare Act, which purports to regulate the use of animals in experiments.  
 I liked the subject matter of both this book & The Making of a Chef, but, as other reviewers have previously mentioned, these books are plagued by seriously flawed editing. Repetition abounds, as does typographical, syntactic and basic research errors. In Ruhlman's quest for perfection in cooking, he looks as if he abandoned this ideal in his writing. I really wanted to like these books but those mistakes became increasingly more annoying as time went on 
   Love Sam Elliott; even when the material isn't tops, He is!  This one is really good 
 Well....this was my first camera ever and I do attest accurately that the advertisement holds VERY TRUE for most of the features. The picture quality is fantastic, the special editing the camera is capable of (built-in templates), and the different modes that the camera can be positioned to take photos.  One weakness I do want to point out is that it could be hard to determine which mode to take the appropriate picture in (outdoors, bad lighting etc). Therefore, I STRONGLY urge you to read the instructions which state, "Please experiment with this camera before taking photos" (basically I paraphrased it).   Other than that, this camera rocks!!!  Advantages outweigh the disadvantages by far 
 Thanks a lot guys these are the best headphones, I had a pair but my kids broke them, I was so happy to find the same headset on amazon so reasonable, because in the stores they were about $30.00 also the arrive time was Grrrrreat   Thanks again   Ricky Thompson Tallahassee F 
 the very first light is a luminous book, filled with the joys and sorrows of physical experimentation at its best.  This is some of the best science journalism I have  ever read.  I know some of the people so lovingly and  painstakingly described:  they are honest portraits, beaut-  ifully rendered.  The range of emotions runs the gamut:  the  highs, the lows, the trill of discovery, the constant re-  trenching to make experimental packages of equiptment  cheaper, smaller, cheaper, fool proof.       This is one of the most human books ever written about  scientists.  Please, don't miss it 
 Excellent! This series bridges the gap perfectly between the movies. After a while, you become so engrossed in the story, that you forget that it's animated. The voice actors also did a great job of replicating the movie actors' voices. I would definitely recommend this and I am eagerly awaiting a new rumored series 
 Janet Evanovich is a good mystery writer,but her true talents lie in the colorful, sexy, endearing characters that she uses in her books.  This was an excellent book, and I continue to love Joe, Ranger, and Grandma.  However, I would choose Joe--the stable, devoted, loyal character 
 [warning - major spoilers] I loved this fantasy series, for the characters and generosity of spirit.  Some reviews on this site think the ending is a a let down but I was pleased to not have a cheesey Hollywood-style epic showdown in the final scene.  The biggest lessons for Lyra were those of the heart, and of work and knowledge, after all. And why do people complain that all the loose ends were not fully tied up?  Do you really want an epiogue saying how Will & Mary managed once they returned?  How Lyra's life turned out?  If anything happened to Mrs Coulter and Lord Asriel after they fell into the abyss?  Not all the threads in life lead somewhere neat and tidy so this book should not be jizsaw puzzle where everything is absolutely resolved.  I worry about how Will in particular will manage after we leave him and that gives added resonance for me to the book.  And the reviewer who said Mary did not 'act the serpent' is plain wrong!  She tells them stories which open their minds and hearts towards a sexual relationship.  Mary did start to help the Malfula with the spyglass, explaining that they needed to find someway of directing the pods towards the dust.  Perhaps they would have gone on to do so if Will & Lyra had not sorted things? Yes the book is anti-religion but is it necessarily anti-God?  The emphasis on goodness, kindness, building knowledge and universal consciousness, the interconnectedness of everything, the release after death into the universal ... There is a lot here for children, indeed readers of all ages, to consider.   
 This hub takes care of old power issues I had with smaller (unpowered hubs).  It is handling my pda, usb jump drive, high capacity external drive, and printer.  And I still have 3 more ports.  And I haven't had any USB power alerts from my computer since I added this hub.  It does what it says 
 Our house has a very damp basement and to combat that we purchased a Bionaire BDQ 24 about a year and a half ago and it worked just dandy until a little over a week ago when all of a sudden it simply stopped pulling in any moisture. Just like that. Fan still spins when you power it up, but no moisture collects in the reservoir. From what I've gleaned in the past week about the workings of dehumidifiers over the internet, the 'compressor' on the unit must have bugged out.   Well...I phoned Bionaire's customer service line and they offered to immediately replace my defective BDQ 24 with this model the BDQ 25 as the BDQ 24 was out of stock and wouldn't be available until November. November?!   A few days later, the UPS trcuk arrives with our new dehumidifier.   This model looks a lot like the model 24 only it's bigger--it is very elegantly designed (for a dehumidifier) and so far it seems to work just great, pulling in pint after pint of H-2-O.   Here's the rub: I must dock this product ONE STAR because it is Extremely NOISY!! By 'noisy' I don't mean refrigerator noisy. I am talking jumbo jet taking off in your living room noisy. It is one LOUD MUTHA!  I have no idea how Bionaire feels they can get away with referring to this machine as 'Quie-tech'. But it works.   I just hope they fixed the bugs with the faulty compressor in this model. Time will tell with regard to that issue. Anyway it does have a 2 year warranty.   Oh. And that wireless indicator is junk. Synched it up with the unit and then all it did was beep. Wife made me yank out the batteries. Very annoying.  --Bil 
 This text is a great resource for any teacher who wants or needs to use music in their classroom. Many times as music educators we are expected to teach in areas we do not feel the best at. As a music teacher this will add to your confidence and give you creative ideas for class. As a classroom teacher, it will help you understand music and music notation beyond what your students need so that you feel confident to teach the basics to your students and use music as a supplemental tool in your teaching. I highly recommend this text 
 This is a collection of over 30 pieces by and about Buddhist women.  It is based on papers from "Women Changing Contemporary Buddhism" Conference.  Some are scholarly, some biographical (noted with symbol in the Table of Contents).  Many of the latter were interviews by Martine Batchelor (author of "Walking on Lotus Flowers").  It includes pieces on many countries both Eastern and Western, providing an eye-opening breadth of view.  It includes considerable material on ordination and the relationships among different categories of nuns, monks, and lay practitioners.  Some of the contributors are well known in the West (e.g. Bhikshuni Thubten Chodron, Martine Batchelor, and Jan Willis).  The topics also have large scope: teachers/teachings, political & social change, the arts, and health.  Some of the articles were outstanding, though each reader will have differing favorites.  I particularly liked Amy Schmidt's piece on Dipa Ma, Melissa Kerin's on Tibetan nuns now creating sand mandalas and thangkas and visiting the West, Kate Wheeler's sensitive piece on motherhood, and the last piece about famed Tibetan female doctor Kandro Yangkar.  But my favorite of all was Hi-ah Park's fascinating piece on how she became a Buddhist Shaman.  There's a wealth of material here-something for everyone interested in Buddhist women.  I think it makes much headway towards (p. 5): The hypothesis of this book: "that, in the contemporary setting, women are playing a significant and even decisive role in the way forms, practices, and institutions of Buddhism are changing to meet the needs and demands of life in late 20th and early 21st century culture."  Supporting the editor's contention that we (p. 6): "need new and more efficacious forms of Buddhist practices in the contemporary setting," contributors have made some profound and potentially far-reaching conclusions concerning adaptation of Buddhism to the West: p. 98: Rotraut Wurst: "Many Western women don't normally retain many Asian elements in their Buddhist practice." p. 330: Melissa Kerin quoting Alan Spoonberg: "Buddhist attitudes towards women were shaped, in part at least, in reference to the social circumstances of the day." p. 339: Judy Dworkin quoting the Dalai Lama in "Freedom in Exile": "It is not sufficient for religious people to be involved with prayer.  Rather they are morally obliged to contribute all they can in solving the world's problems...For what is religion?  As far a I am concerned, any deed done with good motivation is a religious act.  On the other hand, a gathering of people I a temple or church who do not have good motivation are not performing a religious act when they pray together." p. 419: Kate Lila Wheeler: "...'the take it or leave it' part of the doctrine.  Even the Buddha emphasized in one of his sermons that his followers should test his theories, take what they needed, and leave the rest." p. 431: Theanvy Kuoch: "Children are disrespectful of parents who no longer teach them right from wrong and who do not have the energy to correct them." This is an important and valuable book for world-wide Buddhists and feminists alike 
 I have read Not as a Stranger perhaps four times, and every time come away with something new.  The older I become, the more I realize the story is not so much about Medicine, and the passion/obsession required to complete medical training, but about a man who matures and realizes that he is not  an island.  Compassionate telling of a situations that are still relevant  today.  The examination of small town life, politics, and the medical  industry in the early twentieth century is very well done.  What is amazing  is the examination of one man's marriage, but I leave that to the reader 
 Any e-dictionary will give you definitions of course, but what I especially like about this one is that it is lightning fast. Also, when a definition contains an illustration it's indicated by an icon which you double click to view (and which comes up instanteously in a seperate window). This dictionary also allows you to search a word by different criteria other than for just its definitions: rhymes with, Homophones are, Date of, Author quoted, Definition contains...etc, etc. One note on installation: make sure you temporarily disable active virus software (and it wouldn't hurt to do the same for those other programs on the right side of the task bar) 
 As the album title indicates, these performances were employed as the soundtrack for the film Un Coeur en Hiver, but for those who are looking for superior performances of Ravel's chamber music, this should be of no relevance.  What is important is that here, on a single CD, you have idiomatic, deeply felt performances by excellent french musicians in very good sound of all of Ravel's chamber works with the exception of the string quartet (of which there are numerous recordings, most often coupled with the Debussy quartet) and the introduction and allegro (which is a 10-11 single movement work for string quartet plus flute, clarinet and harp-look for the recording by the Melos ensemble). No other such collection exists that contains so much of Ravel chamber music on a single CD. If you are interested in this music, buy it and enjoy 
 This is one of the many "gambling milieu" books that have hit the scene over the course of the past few years; although, unlike many of the others, Konik's effort features strong writing and a furious pace. Upon finishing it, I took a look at the page numbers because I couldn't believe it was over. It wasn't that it was too short, the real problem was that it was too good. In small chip size pieces, Konik addresses the infamous world of gambling. His coverage is far better than that of the average commentator as he includes horse racing, greyhounds, blackjack, sports betting, and golf hustling within his narrative. To say this one is fascinating is an understatement. A better description is that it will even, dare I say, appeal to the general public--and, indeed, it has. The title essay concerns crazy proposition man Brian Zembic, and it may well be the best of the compilation. After all, how many people become quasi-transvestites for 100 grand? Well, that's the terrain you're in once you open these pages, and you'll be grateful that Konik did such a magnificent job of immersing himself in it. 
 I strongly recommend this book to those with an interest in travel, nature conservation and the history of central Asia. John Hare gives a detailed and clear account of his expeditions into the Gobi and Gashun Gobi deserts in Mongolia and China in serach of the wild Bactrian camel. Combining history, science and keen observation, John Hare brings the desolate wilderness of Central Asia to life 
 Bought for my KRZR phone pretty much plug and play, allows me to buy any off the shelf headset with the std. 3.5mm plug. The sound quality is good but just as a word of warning you can't answer calls unless you unplug the unit first 
 I see Wynton Marsalis mesmerized, James Brown befuddled, Aretha astounded, Mariah mortified, Beyonce blushing, Eric Clapton clapping, and Pelham Goodard (Peegee) gasping. Ahhh yes! The seven-layer salad of song (jazz-funk-soul-pop-r&b-rock-calypso)...The Magic Johnson of music. My fav...TTD's Recurring Dream. I luv the metaphysical stories, Jimi Hendrix-like wa-wa guitar sound, and that cowbell sounding percussion. Mad props to We don't have...great calypso, Holding on to you, Supermodel Sandwich w/cheese...so, so funky, as well as all the others. It's too bad many slept on this work of art. But many slept on Ray Charles until just recently. Although the album title doesn't indicate what the song or album is about, nevertheless, it is less than flattering. No other complaints though. Definitely an album for the thinking person and introspective. I genuflect out of courtesy and respect. 
 Ahh, Machine Head! I remember when this came out. I bought the cassette, and within 4 years had literally played it to shreds. Then I bought another cassette. It was one of the first cd's I ever bought, but the first cd was pretty poor sound quality. I found a German cd at a used record store, and the sound quality was excellent. Then, there was the 25th anniversary cd, which was top notch, too. All in all, I figure Deep Purple owes me a gold record for the amount of money I've spent on Machine Head. And it's been worth every penny.  "Highway Star" is a great way to start an album Awesome. All of the songs are great here. "Smoke On The Water" and "Space Truckin'" are the popular ones, but I've always been partial to "Maybe I'm A Leo."  This is one awesome album. If you don't own it, why not 
 Another great product for boys.  I have grandchildren that are 2 & 4 years old.  They love trains!!!!  Their favorites are GeoTrax and Thomas the Tank Engine Systems.  They have played for hours and hours with these.  Highly recommended products!!!! 
 not the type of books I usually read (poetry and all) and it took me quite a while to "get into it" but it was worth it. the story is multi-layered and interesting and the whole book is wonderfully written. Highly recommended.  
 Refreshingly honest with insight that teaches partners to be "count-on-able," to be happy together and much more. "Loving in Flow" is a delight to read 
 I absolutely love this CD. I bought it when it first came out, and I used to listen to it everyday, a few times a day. But recently I found my CD and it was CRACKED! Anyhow , I'm about to buy it again. But I wanted to let everybody know that this CD is definetly hot, you don't have to skip any songs because they all are good 
 If you like Vangelis, you'll like this CD.  The music compliments Ridley Scott's motion picture "1492: The Conquest of Paradise".  The cut "Moxica and the Horse" sounds enchanting, with the first part sounding like a voice in the wind.  A few other tracks give the feeling of sending someone off on a long journey, not seeing them for a long time.  Overall, the CD has a Spanish flavor blending in well with the movie 
 Like virtually everything else I've read by Postman, this is a thoroughly original thesis, a well-laid out argument, and an extremely thoughtful critique.  Plus, as important as all of the above, he writes well -- so  what might seem turgid and polemic in another author's hands seems  effortless and fun when Postman is at work -- and he doesn't carry on  endlessly.  He makes his point and moves on.  Postman is that rare  contemporary commentator who you can read start to finish in only a couple  of sittings.  "Amusing Ourselves to Death" is still my favorite  Postman work, but this is a close second.  Well worth your while 
 C'mon! Admit it! You love sappy love stories. Especially with a sci-fi twist. Yes, this is cute and harmless, and a real tear jerker. But you know you are gonna love it even more when you see it done by Mel Gibson. Jamie Lee Curtis and Elija Wood also do a great job. The main thing here is that the characters make the story believeable and enjoyable. 
 BCI has done a phenomenal job with this DVD, and the He-Man releases.  This DVD has lots of extras, has a high quality transfer and a nice case.  The special is good for the whole family and a nice introduction to both shows.  Fans of She-Ra can be especially excited that the series will finally be released by BCI, the same people resonsible for He-Man.  This summer The Secret of the Sword will be issued, followed by Volume 1 of the series in the fall.  Yeah 
 There are so many cheesy things in this movie, things that don't make sense (why does that wheel blow up at the end????) that this movie is simultaneously cheesy and totally funny. I recommend this movie highly if you find corny movies hilarious 
 im sure this book would be better if i actually used it; and i have a strong sense that I will in the near future 
 Dr. Seuss magically takes readers on an adventure of imagination and thinking.  His nonsense words and rhyme scheme keep a reader's interest at any age level 
  The great thing about this book is that it compels managers to do the things that they know are right, but aren't willing to take the time. Our companies don't reward us for managing, but this is precisely what helps people to perform. The reason this book is so great is that Blanchard has a wonderful knack for succinctly putting into focus a manager's need to put his or her people first. That makes this book invaluable and a worthy read. 
 Easy to read without too much detail. Hits all the major points for a good understanding. Great for someone with a busy schedule. Easy to understand difficult concepts 
 He was,and still is, the greatest spanish crooner of all times. A particular vision of the music, full of passion and great voice, from a talented singer and musician. Unfortunately,life didn't give him any opportunity to share his talent to the rest of the world, but his music is still alive, now and forever 
 Pretty predictable hits set from Marie. Her last two albums (All in Love and Stepping Stone) are completly ignored. In their place we get a dreadful remake of Paper Roses and two new songs.  At least one of the new songs is worth listening to. Like a Hurricane is upbeat and an all around fun song. I also like the double entendres in the lyric. Whether it was intentional or not, I don't know but it is hilarious. The other new song Think With Your Heart could have come off of her 4 previous albums and no one would be the wiser. It's not a bad song,  just kind bland. I have a single by her that came out in 1995 called "What Kind Of Man (Walks On a Woman) that was totlly awesome. The album never came out though. Instead of buying this hits cd. I suggest digging out the more complete "25 Greates Hits" album, it includes, all of the hits from the 80's the previously mentioned "Like a Hurricane" and a songs from the 70's both with and without Donny. 
 I think my title might say it all.  I am over the age of tween and teen, but I enjoyed this book, recommended for a book club I am in.  The author's style makes it an easy read and I loved the characters 
 For the average person this is a great introduction on how to use a computer that is running Ubuntu Linux. I love the topics that are covered and Mr. Grant didn't miss any of the basic topics that interest the average user. There were some techincal inaccuracies that the average user wouldn't notice or necessarily even care about but they don't diminish the value of this book. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars instead of a perfect score was that while the book covers step by step how to do many things it lacks any real tips or tricks for using the tools that it covers. It's possible that because he tried to cover so many topics it was difficult to incorporate more "meat" but I do think this will get someone started with some strong fundamentals and Google can help with the rest. My suggestion would be if you have someone who's not very comfortable on a computer that you want to ease into the world of Linux get them started with this book, when they come craving more knowledge get them the Official Ubuntu Book 
 This is an easy to read book with the detail you would expect from a pocket consultant. The author doesn't waste time with the basic chit-chat and does a good job of laying out the useful material.   Content includes initial setup, backup, performance monitoring/tuning and more advanced features such as registry and metabase settings. Advanced readers will eventually want to search for further information on some of these topics (scripting for example), but this is to be expected. The books leaves you feeling comfortable with what you've learned and with a good feel for where you might want to expand your learning in the future.  Most of my computer books end up getting re-sold or trashed, but I'll be keeping this one on the shelf for myself and others to use in the future 
 This is the continuing saga giving an insight into the life of one of the greatest men who ever lived, Julius Caesar. A man whose deeds were legendary and possibly only surpassed by the man he admired so much, Alexander the Great.  The Field of Swords deals with the period in his life when he had amassed his own legion the Tenth, comprising of men who thought of him as a God and were more than happy to follow him to hell and back.  Caesar take on the unenviable task of trying to quell the fearsome tribes of Gaul with his boyhood friend Brutus by his side. This campaign takes up the major part of the book and gives an insight into the problems Julius would have encountered with the war-like tribes he came across. The book ends with another sortie into  Britain.  While Caesar is away from Rome his old rival Pompey is making his own plans for immortality. The two men who have had an uneasy relationship are bound to have a confrontation in the near future, one that could be fatal . .  
 For those of us who were teenagers and into hip hop in it's embryonic stage, reading this will be like fondly looking through a high school yearbook. The flyers and forgotten record labels like Sugarhill and Enjoy will also prove to be quite nostalgic. For those who weren't there, this is an excellent history of young people who rebelled against the sterile music of the day and longed for a voice of their own, which would later evolve into a multimillion dollar industry. Hopefully, it will encourage another generation of young people to be creative in forming a new kind of music 
 Loved this book and the "new way of thinking" it presents. If you can get through the scientific language and follow the authors path it is well worth the read. I actually put the experiment to use and was amazed at the results!  
 I wanted it for my collection, however you can sift through all the youtube stuff and end up with the same video for free if you want to do the work 
 I notice below a lot of unfavorable comparisons to Norman Rush's first novel, Mating. The comparisons are fair to some extent: Mating is a more perfect work of art, more restrained, less baggy.   On the other hand, this is a bit like unfavorably comparing Daniel Deronda to Middlemarch. I say: as long as George Eliot is writing it, who cares? The same goes for Norman Rush, who has to be one of the four or five best living American novelists. If you haven't read Mating yet, then read it first. It's a marvel; there's nothing else like it. After you read Mating, trust me, you'll want more Norman Rush, and Mortals will give you exactly that.  It will indeed give you 763 pages of Norman Rush, and of Ray, the book's hero. Ray may not be as admirable a human being as the narrator of Mating (who makes an interesting appearance in Mortals, by the way), but his flaws make him even more persuasively human. Ray is as real as anyone you're likely to meet in a novel this year, or in life. He's also wise, and interesting, and funny.  Maybe we could have done with a little less Ray during the action scenes in the last third of the novel. A 600 page Mortals might have been a more perfect book. If you feel that way, then do what one of the reviewers below suggests: skip around in that last third. But whatever you do, don't miss the last few chapters, which are beautiful, heartbreaking and true 
 Paul Artisan, Private Eye, has a normal case load that includes insurance fraud and divorce cases.  He's a little hesitant when Cliff Widmore walks into Paul's office and asks Paul to find his missing twin.  Zander has a habit of disappearing for years at a time, only surfacing when he wants some of his coming trust fund.  But this time, Cliff thinks Zander is in danger, and Cliff wants Paul to find him and bring him home safely.  Hopefully before their father dies.  What Paul thinks would be a straightforward case turns out to be anything but.  Those who do know where Zander is aren't willing to talk.  And Paul begins to doubt Cliff's sincerity in asking Paul to find his brother.  When a man dies while talking to Paul, he begins to think he might be in over his head.  Can he find the missing twin?  This book really should be read on two different levels.  The first is as a straightforward mystery.  As such, it succeeds.  The plot is good with lots of confusion thrown at Paul and the reader to keep us guessing.  The ending felt a bit pat, but that's minor.  The characters are interesting and complex enough to carry the story.  Then there's the LOST factor.  This book is a tie in to the TV show LOST.  The author was on the flight at the center of the show.  There are lots of references to people or things mentioned on the show that were fun to spot.  The themes of good vs. evil and redemption are also key to the series.  But if you read this book looking for a back-story to the show or clues to what happens next, you will be disappointed.  This only makes sense since the book was supposedly written before the events we watch every week even began.  This book is a good mystery that will entertain anyone whether they are a fan of the show or not.  Those hoping for clues about the TV show LOST will be disappointed by the lack of direct references to the events on the island 
 This cd says it all. from the (finally released) barroom hero to the live "white riot," this has to be the best compilation of thier songs 
 The author has a great understanding of the British army of the 18th century and how one would purchased his rank and then hope for a promotion. Or would work the social system of the army and goverment for a promotion. James Wolfe played the system and was all so a great officer. This is the best book I have read on the James Wolfe. I have tried to read all the books I can find on him. He is one of those outstanding military leaders in history. And yes he was sickly and a mothers boy. Yet he could win  battles. Because over his victory at Quebec. We have are nation  and our freedom.With the French out of Canada,the Americas did not need the British army and the King any more. You all know what happened to them in the in a few years. Great book on James Wolfe well worth the cost and a good read. I hope the author will keep on writing 
 We are homeschoolers, and are studying U.S. History.  We used this book to compliment our studies of the Reconstruction and Reform Period.  My children enjoyed the layout, as well as the information.  They liked it so well, they usually read ahead of the scheduled assignments 
 I'm an old man. And the sea is something I know nothing about. So call me ignorant. Still, nearly 60, I just read this book for the first time and it is unquestionably the best novel I have ever read, equal to any poem or drama. I believe you have to have lived a little and maybe even tried your hand at expressing yourself artistically to really appreciate this book. I don't think it's for young people - definitely not for most teenagers, and probably not for most college-level students, unless you want to discourage them. It almost makes arthritis worth while.   The latest volume of "Best American Poems" has a work by Thomas Lux, originally published in Five Points, called "Eyes Scooped Out and Replaced by Hot Coals". That is his proposed punishment for anyone who hasn't read Moby Dick by their mid-20's. While it's a clever and humerous way to make a point, this Pol Pot approach to literary education is viewed positively by many teachers and helps explain why so many people end up with a negative attitude towards a book of this stature.  Just consider the sea-nario: You are weary of the everyday world, and decide to sign-on with a whaling ship to get a little therapy. The ship's captain is a madman. That right there is enough. And consider the historical significance. Moby Dick was written right around the same time that science really began to explode, and we were entering the modern period of capitalism and capitalists (our new Ahabs). For the first time in human history, there were thousands of regular working people - some of them artists - who had literally traveled the entire globe on whalers and knew many parts of it well. These same conditions, of course, soon led to the demise - or rather the replacement - of whale oil for its traditional uses. So there was really only a brief moment in time when such a book could have been written. And it was, thank god. It is no coincidence that Moby Dick, published in 1851, was probably being written by Melville at the same time Marx and Engels were writing the Communist Manifesto. Both represent a similar landmark in human history.  What more can I say? I literally enjoyed every single page. I had readied myself to be bored by the cetology chapters, but wasn't in the least. And some critics note the variations in perspective and writing styles, but that didn't bother me at all - I scarcely noticed. For me, one of the personal highlights was when Melville describes the setting for the skeleton of a great sperm whale found on an island in Chapter 102, A BOWER IN THE ARSACIDES:  "Through the lacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver! --pause! --one word! -- whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all these ceaseless toilings? Speak, weaver! --stay thy hand! -- but one single word with thee! Nay --the shuttle flies --the figures float from forth the loom; the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god, he weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal voice; and by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened; and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it"  By the way, this review is based on an old, worn copy of the book that I purchased at a sale. It's not based on any particular edition or publisher, and my review is focused exclusively on Melville's writing, not how the material is presented in print.  Please give it a chance.  
 One of those films that does everything right!  And it is a horror film no less!!!  What can I say that has not been stated before.  A perfect film 
 My whole family and I have been enjoying watching these Abbott and Costello movies.  Good wholesome family entertainment 
 I study yoga and bought this book at my studio. I love the pictures-- they inspire me as a yogi and they teach me form just by looking at them. I like the book better than many of my artist model books as many of them fuzz out the private regions! this book is about yoga, pure and simple, in the buff and captures graceful women and thier art.  My only problem was that the woman are all athletic and strong and make yoga look like it is only for the well built when yoga is for everyBODY 
 Originally issued in '85 as a triple album, this essential and ultimate Tangerine Dream collection fits nicely onto 2 CDs (19 tracks, 133 min.). This particular release is the 2002 reissue of the 1985 compilation (exact same tracks), albeit with a new cover.    This collection was originally issued shortly after TD enjoyed true broad commercial success for the last time with the soundtrack for the movie "Risky Business" (starting and ending the compilation on tracks 1 and 19). All other tracks inbetween are the highlights of the Virgin Records era of TD (thankfully leaving out pre-1973 experiments like Zeit and Alpha), starting with excerpts (too short, in my opinion) of "Phaedra" and "Rubycon". The tracks move along pretty much chronologically, ending with "White Eagle" from 1982.     The set includes 2 side-long tracks, "Ricochet Part II" and "Tangram Part I". The "Ricochet" track shows TD at its peak, a 20 minute oddisey of throbbing sequencers and soaring guitar solos. "Ricochet" stems from '75 but hasn't aged a day. And to think that the "Ricochet" and "Tangram" albums actually made serious dents in the UK album charts in the mid-70s! Those were the days! If you're gonna to buy just one Tangerine Dream CD, this is the one . . .    If you're looking for more "essential" Tangerine Dream, check out last year's "Bootleg 1", which brings 5 live concerts from the 70s. 
 The only reason that this book didn't get a "5" star rating is due to the part that you record what you eat on a daily basis is small with no space to record calories and fat grams 
 I'm not sure why I bought this book, but for some reason I did.  These books seem to be for kids, but they have huge amounts of adult appeal as well.  Look at the card in the back you can send away to get the catalogue.   It has two age categories:  "I am a kid and was born in the  year______" or "According to my birth certificate I am an adult  but I deny it!".  Well, I must fall in the second category.  Imagine  two grown ups wrapping each other's hair in embroidery floss--sounds silly,  but we had a blast.  These Klutz books are excellent, easy to follow, and  fun.  If you want to learn how to do something, see if there is a Klutz  book about it.  It'll certainly be worth your money 
 I picked this out for my son who loves this movie, it looked a lot bigger then it is, so I got it and it fit so great at the top of the stocking.  WHen you hit him he says "Hey, I'm build for speed not for slammin"  and "Hey, watch the fenders, friend" and a few other things.  The voice is great and sounds just like Lightning in the movie 
 I have fond memories of Secretariat.  I was just 10 years old, but I remember the Belmont like it was yesterday.  I cried when this wonderful horse died.  I read this book about a year ago and could not put it down.  Nack's writing and his admiration and love for Secretariat made such an impression.  His description of the last time he saw Secretariat brought me to tears.  This book should be read by everyone with any interest in horses.  It would be a shame to miss this one.  It is well written and not to be missed.  Thank you Mr. Nack 
 Janet Fitch's descriptions and prose leave little to the imagination and she creates a punk world that is so graphic and believable that it could very well be called a work of genius. The first half of the book read smoothly, as Josie struggles to deal with the after-effects of Michael's death. I could vividly feel her emotions as she began to learn that the man she loved so strongly was not exactly who he seemed.   The one problem I had was with the second half. I felt that she dealt too much with Josie's feelings for Michael. Living in Josie's head for the entire book, she became sort of unsympathetic to me. All she did was flounder around, thinking about Michael and while that is certainly believable in reality, it is not all that interesting to read two hundred pages of it. I even found myself skimming parts while she was staying with Meredith, lounging by the pool or smoking in the study, because it got so bogged down with her thoughts that I nearly got depressed myself 
 This is a book you should read before you quit your job. This book is the one you can trust. It includes almost everything you need to know about working from your home. No wonder it's a fifth edition 
 Don't feel like a philistine.  Don't scratch your head and wonder what is the matter with you for not appreciating the world's great literature.  Just read this book and it will all come clear.  In all likelihood, your literature teacher didn't know how to teach.  Rosenblatt's thesis is that without a pro-active, supportive environment in which a novice reader is credited for those things he or she can discern from his/her experience, knowledge, intuition, and reasoning, the most erudite transfer of knowledge from a 'professional' reader to a novice will at best be a delivery of information not unlike the role the pizza guy performs in bringing you your pizza and at worst, promoting a self-doubting reader who will not feel comfortable with his or her own insights.  Assuming that a prime reason for reading literature is to sense the 'transpersonal' between writer and reader, anyone who can read should be able to make that connection since we are all human.  Of course, expert knowledge and scholarship have their place, but not the first place.  The primary place is within, and it is the job of the promoter of 'literature' to help the student find that place within himself or herself--not demean the unenlightened to exact revenge for all those years of torturous graduate school. 
 I have several Bibles, all with different helps.  This is my favorite, with commentaries that apply to life today.  The Life Application Bible is the most popular at the Bible Study Group I attend, because it often has  the answers to the questions we ask.  It is wonderful for newer Christians,  but is just as important for those farther along in their Faith Walk.  I  highly recommend this Bible for anyone, and have purchased one for myself,  as well as many as gifts.  READ IT 
 "The Breakthrough" really is one of the best albums of 2006 (I know it was released in 2005, but it was at the end of the year, has continued to be a big airwave-influence this year, and will be eligible for this year's Grammy Awards.)  There is not one dud song on here.  I personally like almost every song.  The only one's I do not like are "Good Woman Down," "Baggage," "Ain't Really Love," and "Father in You." It is not that they are bad songs, I just can't personally relate to them right now or I am just not feeling those.  All the other songs are outstanding for me, and I like this because even though I think Mary is probably speaking to people in these songs, as a Christian I am really able to speak many of them to Jesus and he speaks to me through them.  Songs like "No One Will Do," "Be Without You," "Gonna Breakthrough" and "Can't Get Enough" can take on spiritual themes.  And songs like "Take Me As I Am" and "Can't Hide From Love" are becoming faves of mine too.  After the somewhat disappointing "Love and Life" (though I still liked it, I think all of Diddy's monotonous production weighed it down some), it rocks to see MJB coming back roaring like this.  Also, there is a hidden bonus track after "One" that is a good dance song with a good message, even if the track does rip-off No Doubt's "Hella Good" somewhat.   
 From the time I picked up Tellin' Stories form a used bin on a whim, (I had never heard of Walter Trout), I have done everything I can to get his music and see him live. His live performances are the thing of legend, (if everyone took half as much pride in what they do as he does...). This CD exudes that same feeling while Walter gets together with some of Blues Rock's greats. The opening track, (with the legendary John Mayall, one of Walter's former bosses), is worth the price of the CD itself, but then there are twelve more tracks with greats like Joe Bonamassa, Jeff Healey, Coco Montoya, Bernard Allison (almost too bad Luther wasn't here too), Eric Sardinas, Guitar Shorty, and several others. If this doesn't get Blues album of the year, something is drastically wrong. Buy this CD 
 This computer rolling is just fantastic: Very good quality, Strong and with a very big room to carry the laptop a complete mobile office and at least 2 day clothes. It's the best one. I have the Potomac model for daily use too 
 This is my first Layton book.  I don't know if I will read another, but I loved this book.  The villian was a little underdeveloped as a character, and the premise of 4 bullets and he didn't die, was a bit far-fetched.  The author might have made Rasputin a bit more believable, more mortal.  But, the characters were fun, likeable, and entertaining.  The gratuitous sex was pretty great too.  I would recommend it highly 
 I bought this book without ever having heard of it or the author; but my son was having a dragon birthday theme, so I took a chance.  What wonderful luck.  It is good for children age 4 to 40!  We have read it numerous times and the chapters provide comfortable break points as well.  This book stirs the imagination and keeps the reader and listener interested 
 I've been following Mayer since his Room for Squares album.  I like all his stuff, but have found that this album tends to hold my interest for a longer period of time.  The others were entertaining, but this album hits your senses in a way the others didn't quite accomplish.  His new songs, Vultures and Gravity, which will also appear on his next release, "Continuum" are in my opinion his very best.  I couldn't stop playing Vultures for weeks!!!!  I guess I'm out of the loop.  I've been reading a few reviews and was surprised by the amount of controversy surrounding this guy.  Why everybody feels the need to crown or crucify him is bewildering to me.  Just take the music for what it's worth.  He's a great songwriter and a fantastic muscian.  P.S.  I meant to give this 5 Stars.  Sorry.  : 
 This is the best new business book I've seen in several years.  The book is a great read.  Every chapter adds value.  Instead of repackaging old ideas, Weinzimmer provides guidelines that are well thought-out and supported, but radically innovative.  His discussions of "external framing" and "aligning a company for fast growth" really challenge a lot of faulty assumptions.  The thing that excited me most was his challenge to move from being "market-driven" to being a "market-driver" -- learning to anticipate customer needs and solutions before customers recognize them.  Best of all, this author provides easily understandable principles and down-to-earth suggestions for how to put them into action 
 I know, you "don't have time to read."  Believe me, as a stay-home mom of a 2-yr-old and 2-month-old, I KNOW.  So why get another book?    This is why I like it and why I've given it to a few close friends: 1.	It makes me feel NORMAL, whereas before I felt like some freak of nature and the only person going through these problems!  That alone has done wonders for my psyche. 2.	It's written by real people moms and not academic experts - they have been in the trenches and lived to tell about it.  I especially like the story of the woman who was so exhausted she tried to breastfeed her husband's arm in bed. 3.	It shines a lighthearted and humorous light on some otherwise very weighty and serious topics such as extreme fatigue, resentment and other sensitive areas (see chapter titled "Coitus Non-Existus.")  I laugh out loud every time I read a section, and a little laughter goes a long way - real stress relief!   4.	The analogies are always right on and also funny, like comparing a baby to a hand grenade thrown at a marriage.  And then comparing a baby plus a toddler to a full frontal assault including tanks and heat-seeking missiles.  Painfully true!!!  And comparing husband and wife to circling wolves, ready to fight over any scraps of "free time" that get thrown their way. 5.	It is refreshingly non-biased to either sex - both points of view are really represented fairly, so instead of staking wife against husband or vice versa it puts us all on the same team, in this together as parents and spouses. 6.	You don't have to read it all the way through.  I've only read sections; I can pick it up at a different place each time to get a little perspective.  For immediate humor and reality, check out the table on page 196. 
 The collection is good nonetheless, spans a number of good tunes and time. However, this band was popular during the remix phase of dance music...and I've heard some of the remixes (especially 'burning down the house') and have to say that they do deserve a spot on this 2 disc collection. Other than that it is well worth the money 
 I have been climbing mountains for 29 years. Been there done that... first climbs, awesome views, friendship, more close calls than I can remember. Yes, I have explored caves and rafted mightly rivers and gone on a winter expedition to the Arctic. But climbing mountains is the most beautiful of them all. Very often people ask me why I climb. I have a very stressful and time-consuming job enclosed most of my days in a building working with computers, and friends tell me that vacation time is to go to a warm place to relax and recharge rather than going somewhere dangerous to get even more tired and stressed. How boring that seems to me. It is very hard to explain why I find climbing so wondeful... and so humbling. I like Joe Simpson's book not necessarily because of the great climbs he describes but rather because he makes a great job in writing about the fragility and the humility... and the awe, the passion, and the intensity with which we love. It is that which wraps a mountaineers heart.  We don't believe we are supermen or immortal... we are not arrogant. This book may help non-mountaineers understand us better, and will allow us mountaineers see in written words things we know all too well in our hearts. 
 I remembered this movie from my childhood.  So I ordered it for my grandchild (age 3).  She absolutely loves "the cat movie" and asks to watch it over and over.  Appropriate films seem to be difficult to find for a young child who does not care for animation 
         This book masyerfully unmasks the sorrows of the nation. The author is able to compose a memoir of the haunting lives of children in New York's ghettos. The fierce images of rat-infested homes, and schools filled with poisonous lead walls leave readers unable to fathom how people truly exist in such harsh conditions. Kozol addresses every area of the spectrum from the children's point of view to the political views of the country. Also presenting an array of diverse issues such as AIDs, drugs, underage prostitution, death, motives based in moral, religious beliefs, and inhuman treatment towards others to the reader. Feelings of pathos arise after hearing the accounts of the children in the area; readers feel sorrow for the children because they are stripped of their childhood. Numerous quotes and examples are given in the book, but one that particularly struck me was when Kozol asks one of the children if he knows anyone happy at all the boy candidly responds, "Not many...Well, to tell the truth, not any who are happy for more than one day...No! Not for one day. For 15 minutes...Not any. That's no lie"(212). To honestly not know at least some form of happiness is incompressible for me and I'm sure for many others as well. By using statements made by children the author easily wins the readers pity and sympathy. Our pity soon turns to anger when he describes the lack of government support. Examples such as unsanitary hospitals, toxic incinerators, closet sized school rooms, and shabby, less then adequate housing evoke sentiments of detest towards the government's lack of aid towards these poor devastated people. But once again Kozol quickly changes our feelings to those of denial. He provides shocking statistics and first hand accounts as to how the nation sympathizes with these people for five minutes and then continue on with their lives.  It seems shocking that people would do things so cruel such as disposing of their waste in the ghetto streets. While reading, it became a necessity for me to remind myself that the events taking place were all true; this is not a cleverly composed work of fiction, though it would certainly be far more assuaging if it were.      Taking into account the brilliant components of the book, I must say that I was vexed by one minor detail; Kozol's overall presentation of his opinions. The beginning of the book revolves around the accounts of parents and children within the area and the author provides few opinions on the subject. But towards the end he fills several pages with statistics followed by passages of his opinions. I feel that this takes away from the book because rather than focusing on the children and people living in the area we turn our attention to the author and how he is impacted by the events and things he witnesses.        Other than this minor dislike I think that the piece as a whole is very informative and certainly does a good job at presenting what appears to be the ideas and realities for several minorities in New York. It may not be a thriller, or adventure novel, but it most certainly is a mystery. A mystery as to how people are able to survive in such hostile conditions and retain hope. Kozol's mastery of rhetoric reveals that the issues taking place have been around and that until something changes they will remain so.   
 Very good review of a current sports star.  Easy for my 7 year old daughter to understand and keep her interested 
 Some of the information is very beneficial...having been uncomfortably placed in the situation to deal with the issue of dual relationships. That's just one issue.  Sometimes this book is hard to read, because some topics are a little boring, but overall, it's one of the better books I have purchased this semeste 
 I really do reserve that title for only one album every year.  Now maybe my views will change by December 31, but I doubt it.  First things first:  even at his most accessible, Dave Douglas is not very accessible on first  or second listen.  But the more I listened to this album, the more I  realized that these compositions are brilliant; these musicians are playing  at the top of their game; and that they are interacting telepathically with  one another.  By the fifth listen or so, my ears were finally catching up  to the wonderful music that these guys were hearing as they made the album.   It was then that I realized why this album really is a heartfelt tribute  to Mary Lou Williams.  Sure, before that I knew that Douglas had thrown in  some superficial tributes:  for example, a few tunes were written by Mary  Lou, and several tracks (most notably, Soul on Soul) incorporate stride  piano lines and bebop licks and other styles that Williams played during  her long career.  But after repeated listenings, I realized that the real  tribute comes in the nature of the music itself:  it is highly experimental  and deeply spiritual, which is precisely how I would describe Mary Lou  Williams at her best.  It is jazz and yet not jazz.  It is soulful, but not  in the Motown or even Judeo-Christian sense of the term.  Douglas's life  experiences are obviously not the same as Mary Lou Williams', but he brings  to his music the same passion and self-assured identity that Mary Lou  Williams brought to her music.  It is hard to explain if you have not  experienced it; just an overwhelming sense of peace and contentment that  stems from the musician's confidence in his craft and where he is in his  life.  That quality enables the listener to enter the music, to get inside  of it in a way that (in my experience) only Mary Lou Williams could  duplicate.  The music is all his own, which paradoxically is his real  tribute to Mary Lou Williams 
 Finally there is a quick way to make a great Udon Soup at home!  For any Udon fan, this is a must try product.  The noodles are as good as Udon noodles get, and the soup mix is great base to start your Udon.  Here is the way we make Udon using this product as a base:  We take the noodles and soup mix from two packages (bowls), add some additional soy sauce and spices we like, and boil it all in a pan (you don't need to screw around with all the noodle rinsing, just throw them in the pot).  When the soup and noodles are warm, we add chopped romaine.  This is super good, and costs less than $[...] for two LARGE servings of Udon - a deal by any standard!!  When we really want a full-on Udon, we add some sliced pressed fish like the restaurants use in traditional Udon (the half moon pressed fish, white with the orange/red coating) and shrimp.  This is heavenly!! 
 This is the complete vocal score to Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Sound of Music."  It contains all the vocal lines and underscoring from the theatrical-not the movie-version of the show.  It's not ALL that different, but there are a few songs that were cut from the movie which are included here.  Conversely, there are a few songs from the movie version which were not in the original stage version that are not included here.  Other minor discrepancies between the two productions include the ordering of the songs "Climb Every Mountain," "Do-Re-Mi," and "My Favorite Things."  That being said, the actual score is the typical piano-reduction score as used by most musical productions.  A complete list of characters is provided, though there is no discussion of their vocal ranges.  A breakdown of the original orchestrations by Robert Russell Bennett is also included, as is a synopsis of scenes and a complete index of musical numbers.  Instrumental cues are included throughout the score.  
 I recently ordered this pan, wondering if it would be worth the money.  I have a smooth cooktop and my larger saute pans don't have flat bottoms which causes the pans to spin when I stir - very annoying.  This problem is solved with this pan!  It is very heavy duty so warping won't happen.  It is wonderful to cook in and cleans up easily.  The cooking surface at the base is about 10 inches, and at the top the pan is about 13".  I chose this particular pan because I knew I would be able to cook a wide variety of meals in it.  My smothered pork chops were awesome when cooked in this pan.  I'm hooked 
 I've built the blanket chest, bookshelf and chest of drawers.  The only problem I had was with the chest of drawers.  The dimensions allow for only an eigth inch overhang on each side of the drawer front.  By adding one eigth to each side of the drawer width, you only get the width of the opening, not an overhang, and a lot of side-to-side play in the drawer.  You need to make the drawer about 1/2" wider than the plan.  Other than that (which should of been caught by Norm's general caveat of measure twice, cut once), I really like the book and the narratives that go along with the project.  Compared to the measured drawings that you can buy directly, you are better off buying the book and interpolating a few measurements 
 *	I would give this book an 11, if the scale went that high.  From the opening gun, right through to the last words, I found this entire book to be easy to read and extremely helpful.  The author doesn't preach, or get into technical gobbledygook.  He stays on course, for the most part, addressing root causes of the situations that most of us face on a fairly regular basis, and then providing very doable suggestions to achieve desired results 
 These plays are highly thought provoking and flow very well.  Both have odd plots that keep you interested.  The obviously stronger of the two, The Zoo Story, combines comedy with drama in a very interesting way.  Only four  stars because reading the play does not substitute for seeing the play's  production with all the interaction 
 Most of the compilations around nowadays are pretty good but far from the best, short of buying the actual albums themselves.  I feel that this holds its own in terms of the casual listener is concerned, but an aficionado of the band would want a double disc or box set to be happy.  It's organized chronologically which is a plus to me, with the all of good tunes here. It has all of the classics from the band you'd want.  In the Name of Love, Lies, Love on Your Side, Hold Me Now, Doctor! Doctor!, The Gap, & Lay Your Hands on Me.  The album's major plus are the not-so-well known tunes to me like We Are Dectetive, Don't Mess With Doctor Dream, Nothing in Common, & Get That Love. The booklet enclosed has some good info on the band, including their explosion onto the MTV scene, as well several photos, credits for each song.  Too bad, they didn't fill out the album's time with some lesser known tunes not here or live tracks.  They were phenemonal live & should've had some live tunes here to show it. I love all of the tracks, but it's not complete enough to get a full 5 stars from me 
 This is a good book for young women struggling with body image and self-loathing. Those suffering from an eating disorder often feel alone and isolated - this will help them to know that they are not alone. The book sends the message of learning to accept themselves and reject the unattainable quest for perfectionism. 
 Mr. Schlesinger is famous for his ties to the Kennedys and it's obvious he admires his subject, but this is still a pretty balanced account of an interesting life.  You see the turbulent world of the 60's from a very present force of the times.  I read this first in college and was very moved and inspired by it at that time.  It's a big book, but worth the time. 
 It's the best GTD studio album since Move It On Over. What I really like is that there are no weak songs on this CD, unlike previous releases where there appeared to be a lot of filler material. I have had this CD in my car for 4 months and I keep coming back to it. I just can't get enough of it! I can't wait to see my next George Thorogood concert 
 Nice little video for my Zen during my long wait at the doctor's office.  Confucius overcame many difficulties 
 This series just keeps getting better and better. In this installemnt we find Eve investigating the murder of someone from her past.   Watching Robb reveal the layers of Eve and Roarke, two of my all time favorite fictional characters gets better with each book. Readers will be pleased with this installment and anxious for the next one to arrive. Another winner in a fabulous series 
 And I've read thousands in my lifetime.  If I were to pick a contemporary writer in the same vein of vision and emotion and sheer genius, I would recommend Carole Maso 
 For Keeps where shall I start.  For Keeps is one of those 80's movies that would fit perfect on The Lifetime Network.  Molly Ringwald stars as Darci Elliot and Randall Batinkoff stars as Stan Bobrutz (intentional hard to spell and pronoucne name, it is the butt of several jokes in the film).  The two high school sweethearts are sent fast forward into adult hood when Darci becomes pregnant.  They struggle to stay together.  I think this film is great because it shows young people just how hard things can be when you introduce a baby into the picture.  It is not one of those happily ever after stories, Stan and Darci go through some real hard times.  The movie itself takes a real awkward turn towards the end with Darci pushing Stan to pursue his dreams without his knowledge, but the movie will entertain those in 6th grade and up.  Its a bit pricey but it is good for educational use and for the 80's fan building their collection 
 I contributed a few recipies for this book (check out the web service and GUI sections for yours truely), so of course I'm a little biased...but I have to say that it's a great resource for anyone that does real work with Ruby (or in Ruby on Rails). I should also state that my contributions were very small, so I'm really not just endorsing it because I helped out.  It's got a little bit of everything in it from the basics of the Ruby language to the more advanced topics like meta-programming, network programming, and GUI development!  Best of all, since it's a cookbook and not a documentation book, it solves real-world problems in an easy-to-use, easy-to-understand format.  You don't have to waste your time reading the whole book (unless you want), you just find the problem you want to solve, and wha-la it's solved.  I really do think it's a must have book 
 Because most people will review the actual book(s), which in this case are classics and I feel do not truly need a review, I will review this edition. Having the two in one is useful if you, like me, have not read the two prior to purchase or if you are a fan of both books. They are bound handsomely and the dust jacket is simple and smooth. The introduction is by someone who is obviously enamored with Orwell, and it gives some insight to the work and history of Orwell, though is mostly unecessary as you could probably wikipedia the information. This is a nice edition and I felt it was a good choice for me 
 Timbuktu is my first Paul Auster novel and surely won't be my last.  I applaude this insightful look at man's best friend.  The character development and creativity of Mr. Bones is truly remarkable.  This is an easy to read book but one with lots of messages.  Somehow, Auster masterfully puts you in the mind of a dog and takes the reader for a journey that's to be remembered long after the book is completed.  If you love dogs or better yet love top quality literature, this is the book for you.  I can't wait to get to the bookstore and check out more of Paul Auster.  Consider me a new fan Mr. Auster!!!! 
 "Eternity" virtually swept the 1953 Oscars, and no wonder. It's a multi-layered human drama set within the larger canvas of World War II. The all-star cast is uniformly excellent. Indeed, Sinatra's Oscar-winning turn as Maggio single-handedly revived his sagging career. And the torrid (for the time) beach scene with Lancaster and Kerr remains one of cinema's most indelible images. Watch for that culminating Pearl Harbor attack sequence. 
 I just love these.  We used to in sandwiches for a pirate themed party.  They worked perfectly.  We also used them to decorate the table tops.  
 Frankly, I found this to be an especially demanding book even when reading it for a second time. Whyte requires of his reader a rigorous as well as truthful self-exploration, and in ways and to an extent few other authors do. As is so often true in other dimensions of human experience, the benefits derived from reading his book are almost wholly dependent upon how much is personally invested in it. As Whyte explains, he wrote this book "hoping it would be read in two ways. First, as a good story about the difficulties and dramas of preserving the soul at work -- in short, a page-turner; second, as a book that could be studied, contemplated, and discussed with others." More than 50 years ago, Mortimer Adler affirmed the value of reading the "great books" because they stimulate and enrich what he called "a conversation across the centuries." I think this is what Whyte has in mind when providing, in the book's final section (a "User's Guide"), a number of thoughts for reflection and discussion as well as for self-questioning. For example: "What is my heart's desire in life? What are some of the particularities of the way I like to live? What are the essential qualities that give me a sense of belonging? How can work be a good servant to my essential nature instead of a taskmaster?" As I now reflect on this book after a second reading, I think its greatest value lies not only in the truth of what Whyte expresses so eloquently but also in what his assertions and questions require his readers to consider as they seek spiritual fulfillment in their own lives. Those who my high regard for this book are urged to read Whyte's other books, especially Crossing the Unknown: Work as a Pilgrimage of Identity and Fire in the Earth; also, to check out David Maister's Practice What You Preach and Tim Sanders' Love Is the Killer App as well as Eliyahu M. Goldratt's The Goal, Critical Acclaim, and It's Not Luck 
 A lot of people mistakenly group this album with Seamin, Relaxin, Workin, and Cookin, which were all recorded during a later span of time, consecutively, with the Coltrane group.  This one is completely different.  With that out of the way, this is a good jazz record.  It is not OUTSTANDING or ESSENTIAL per se, but the first two tunes are swingin' blueses, featuring soloists that don't appear with miles too much like JJ and some guy named Lucky Thompson, who is a little different than most of the sax players Miles plays with.  The other songs on the CD are with a different, less bombastic group featuring a mousey but inventive alto player that i hated for a long time after i bought the cd.  What I still dislike, however, is Miles's solo on the last song on the cd, where he keeps repeating the same lick.  Otherwise, the ballad is in his usual tender style, and Solar, the original Solar, sounds completely different than the way anyone else ever in the history of jazz ever played it afterwards.  It's really chilled out and beautiful and I think the prince of darkness is using a cup mute.  OK, buy it for Solar, and enjoy some fine blues and an obscure Bird clone 
 This book is excellent.  It's written for the average Joe; no technical jargon -- it can and should be used by everyone.  It's a short and sweet read...brief and to the point, it can be read in approximately 1-2 hours.  I'm a radio announcer, and this book is one of the top 5 that I insist other people read ... but get your own copy! In my opinion "How to get your point across in 30 seconds or less" is equal to AT THE VERY LEAST one half semester of a college course in Public Speaking 101.... and it's much cheaper! This book should be required reading for everyone who opens their mouth in public 
 I've been working as a professional photographer & cinematographer for over 10 years; I have tons of exp. with every kind of camera on the market past and present and this is the camera I love to carry with me when I'm out and about.  Its slimmer then my cell phone, smaller than my wallet, and rugged enough to be carried with my most every day of the week.  I've had my for over a year now and had little to zero problems with it.  The T7 reacts fast to changing environments and distances.  I have the underwater housing for the camera which I use on a weekly basis for filming surfing videos & images.  This camera also has a special function that I have yet to see work well on another camera, the burst & multi-burst functions.  I can captured 30 or so images in a split second thanks to this function or switch it to capture an every 1/4 second for 8 seconds.  It is an ideal function for fast action photography or a sports photographer on their day off.  I highly recommend this camera to anyone from novice to professional because of its ease to use and adaptability to the situation.  The only thing I would ask of Canon would be to make their newest version of the camera to be just like this one and add a shockproof and waterproof housing to this awesome camera 
 The way Jim Corbett tells his stories reveals much about the man himself: humble, honest, and generous.  Unlike Capstick, Corbett hunted for his love of nature rather than for pure adventure. He loved being in the jungle and observing everything around him - this is what made him such a great hunter in the first place. Some readers might wonder how somebody who loves nature can go tiger hunting. In fact, Corbett only hunted tigers or leopards who had turned man-eater, in order to protect human life. In doing so, he inevitably killed the wrong animal on occasions (something he himself acknowledged). We should also see beyond our own day and age: in Corbett's day, tigers were still extremely common in India, and the environmental movement barely existed, and yet he was one of the first to warn of the threat to tigers, becoming, without doubt, a pioneer for their preservation.  Unlike Capstick, his writing is infused with calm: he does not focus on blood and guts, but explains his tactics and describes physical scenes in painstaking detail, as if to another hunter. To me, this makes his books all the more convincing. His hunting success is built on patience and a lifetime of observing jungle behaviour, not bravado. These are not macho books, although Corbett clearly must have had nerves of steel.  My only criticism of this book is the quality of the proof-reading. The number of typos is frustrating to the point that it sometimes gets in the way of enjoying the book. Jim Corbett's writing suggests he was a meticulous man, so it's a pity the publishers have let him down on this 
 The movie is about two men who fake fairytales for money. They are employed to stop these children from disapearing into a forest in a town. Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm take on the job or be forced to die and go into the forest. This is a really good movie and is an action packed fairytale 
 This is one of the most awesome blues discs I have come across.  It's actually older than I am, but the sound is awesome.  It was playing in the other room, and I kept wondering who was yelling at me!  Muddy's known for his electric side, but this doesn't lose anything by going acoustic.  With Buddy Guy and Willie Dixon as the backing band, how can you go wrong.  A great CD for those interested in the REAL blues 
 I started doing yoga 3.5 years ago.  Because I needed to use so many props, I stopped for a period of time to focus on weight-training...to increase my upper body strength.  After watching this video, I realized that, while the weight-training did help, the CORE of my problem was short arms and short legs...relative to my torso!  I will ALWAYS need props (blocks) when doing yoga simply because of my body proportions.  I also realized that I will NEVER be able to do certain poses (such as headstands)...again, because of physical proportions (arm length) and lack of adequate neck extension relative to arm length.  With the information in this dvd, I was able to immediately modify my power yoga in a way (using props) that allowed me to get the maximum benefit of various poses without feeling that I was 'cheating'!  While I recommend this dvd to everyone doing yoga, I especially recommend it to individuals who have short arms/legs!  With blocks, I can now maximize the benefit I get when doing my poses!  mary    
 I had the pleasure of meeting Hill Harper at the Delta Sigma Theta National Convention in July. As both a teacher and a counselor, I was so pleased to see Hill Harper take on the challenge educating our male youth population. After reading the book, I must say that my expectations were not just met but greatly exceeded. Not only does this book have a permanent place on my reference shelf, I will be writing a grant to purchase copies of the book for each graduating 8th grade student at my school. The information on avoiding the common pitfalls of life is so vital.  In today's society where manhood is measured by such materialistic and superficial means, it was quite satifying to see the "old school approach" of taking care of business translated in a way that even the youth of today can appreciate. I am so looking forward to seeing great things happen in my school as my young male students get the quality of advice that could only come from someone truly caring, compassionate, and concerned with their plight 
 This book was one of several books I studied to better understand the role  of place in architecture and interior design.  It helped me understand the  importance of working with clients to understand the meanings they infer  from the environment around them. In the book, Tuan highlights the  importance of meaning and an insider's view.  He describes place as  humanized space.  The contrast of open space with enclosed, comforting  areas enhances both.  As a person's emotional bond to a space increases, so  do familiarity, comfort, and the sense of insideness.  Without personal  control over space, this emotional bond is slow to develop.  To create  place, Tuan suggests that memorable architecture should strenghen our  memories, enhance the self, and provide layers of meaning to a space 
 I am a big fan of DuQuette's book and I have loved everyone that I have read so far. The Chicken Qabalah was no exception and is most definitely recommended. I particularly enjoyed the section on the Hebrew alphabet and found it to be of particular value as an introduction to the Hebrew alphabet. However, the parts on the `Tree of Life' and the Tetragrammaton are also particularly useful. My only critique on the book is that it sometimes feels as if DuQuette goes a bit overboard on the humour aspect of his effort. 
 In many periods of his life De Sade deserved to be in Jail, and in those periods he deserved whatever happened to him.  But the place he died in was because of this book.  Let that be known as a fact, that he was arrested and held by Napolean because he was believed to be the Anonymous writer of Justine, which he was.   This book is what placed him in the asylum until his death.  He was a sick mad man.  But he was also a sick genius.  And in the end it wasn't his bad nature that put him in jail, but his "bad" words.  Napoleon's orders on the grounds that his writings expressed a state of 'libertine dementia'.  Justine is the most abominable book ever engendered by the most depraved imagination.  The book is a piece of literature, with simple prose, and average writing, probably from translation.  Must buy book. 
 This book is a great book if you're new to poker. It is a quick read, concise, and well worth the price. It doesn't matter if you're just playing a "friendly" neighborhood game, or going to Vegas to try your luck. 
 I don't read alot of books like this one, but I really enjoyed it.  I could not understand why some of the people did what they did in the book but I must admit it kept me on the edge of my seat.  I can't wait to read the sequel 
 I liked this book... I thought the authors really understood the characters and displayed them well... This story picked up from the Christmas episode where Maxwell heals all but one little girl.... Although you don't need to see that television episode this book speaks well for itself.. It was an exciting adventure that included alien teenagers on a quest to protect their identity while they had to go incognito as normal human teens in a society that would see them as a threat if their true identity was ever revealed... A well written story that shows that human and alien spirit are more alike than anyone would dare think. 
 This album as everything you need to have as a metal fan. I still don't understand why Tesla isn't the biggest band in the world?? This album should be at least double platinum. Highlights: "Into The Now", "What A Shame", "Miles Away" and "Recognize" and finally all the other songs on the cd. Listen carefully 
 Rosemary's music of the early fifties reflected the times in which they were recorded, featuring some truly brilliant songs culled from a variety of sources interspersed with the occasional silly song..  The set includes five of Rosemary's seven UK hits, the omissions being Man and Where will the baby's dimple be, but neither of them matter in a collection like this. The five UK hits included here are This ole house, Mambo Italiano (both number hits), Half as much, Hey there (both top five hits) and Mangos (a minor hit). This ole house, the song most readily identified with Rosemary by UK fans, returned to the very top of the UK charts when revived by rock'n'roll revivalist Shakin' Stevens in 1981.  In America, Rosemary had many more hits but although this is an American compilation, some big hits are omitted to make way for less obvious but welcome recordings. The really big hits are all here including the number one hits Come on a my house, This ole house, Hey there and Half as much, together with the number two hit Botch-a-me, a novelty song that really doesn't stand the test of time well but the public must have loved it at the time to take it that high.  The biggest omission is a Christmas song that made the top ten, but I'm happy with that. I love Christmas music but I prefer it to be kept separate from other recordings, especially where the singer has recorded enough Christmas songs to fill at least half a CD. This particular recording is on Rosemary's CD, Songs from White Christmas and other yuletide favorites. The next biggest hit missing is Beautiful brown eyes, which almost made the top ten on Billboard, peaking at eleven. It might have made the top ten in another American chart. While this omission is more of a disappointment, it can be found on the more recent compilation Country Rose. That set includes twenty-one tracks from the early fifties, drawing on Rosemary's country-influenced recordings. This ole house and Half as much (both of which were originally country songs) are also to be found on that set, but they are the only duplicates. So you can rectify those two omissions by purchasing Songs from White Christmas and Country Rose.  Rosemary eventually became a highly respected jazz singer and clues to her later success can be found here via the inclusion of her covers of In the cool cool cool of the evening, Sophisticated lady and Blues in the night. But mainly, this is about Rosemary's early pop hits.  While this is not a definitive hits collection, the essential hits British and American hits are all here so it's a good starting point. If you wish to explore Rosemary's music from this period further, there are plenty of other CD's available, a couple of which I've mentioned 
 This is one of the series of Kai Lung stories, written in a delightfully humorous style by Ernest Bramah. These pretend to be translations of an imagined classical Chinese literary style, and follow the fortunes of Kai Lung, a wandering storyteller who is able to recall a tale pertinent to any situation he finds himself in. My edition was published in Hong Kong by Oxford University Press in 1985; others in the series include Kai Lung Unrolls His Mat and Kai Lung Beneath the Mulberry Tree, all equally enjoyable.  I never tire of re-reading any of them; regrettably, Bramah's works are out of print and hard to find 
 This is probably MC Eiht's second best of his 10 solo works (as of 11/04)(behind his 1999 classic - "Section 8")(not to mention he's part of 5 group albums).  Eiht shows why he's been around since the late 80's as he never delivers a weak album worth less than 4 stars.  A must have album.  Guests are few and from his NOTR clique or from Comptons Most Wanted.  Production is great on this one and is done by Eiht himself and DJ Slip and Prodeje of South Central Cartel.  It has 2 classics, 2 great songs, 2 that are ok, and the other 9 are good songs.  If only he got the airplay he deserves at least on the east coast (couldn't say for the west - much like Spice 1 or DJ Quik and many other Cali rappers) he'd have at least 10 million solo records sold and a bunch of platinum plaques.  #1 - 10 (classic dissin' DJ Quik) #2 - 9 #3 - 9.5 (get's on Quik again f/ N.O.T.R.) #4 - 8.5 #5 - 7.5 (slowed down track) #6 - 9 #7 - 8.5 (f/ DaFoe) #8 - 10 (classic track) #9 - 7.5 #10 - 9 (f/ Boom Bam) #11 - 9.5 #12 - 9 #13 - 8.5 (f/ Tha Chill) #14 - 9 #15 - 9  b.

 It's sad that someone would give negative rating to someone paying homage to a great musical soul. RIP Chris - It's a wonderful thing I'm sure to be able to pass away in the arms of someone you love. Your music is absolutely beautiful and devoid of pretention. I wish I had been given the opportunity to see you perform 
 Two very short, thoughtful essays and an interview on the conflict between the State of Israel and the (inevitable)Palatinian State; it is about real estate (and economics) stupid; read it and, then, join the Order of the Teaspoon 
 Dr McGraw's book is great reading and I would recommend along with Mr Mark Middleton's book; Personal Success and the Bottom Line 
 I love every second of this disc! As a teen I was given this as a birthday gift (in vinyl of course) because I loved "Reeling in the years" and I was learning guitar etc. I played the record until it was "beyond scratched". There is no one word that I can use to describe the greatness of this CD!!!!!!!!! 
 If you only buy ONE cd this year (well, you already win cause this is 2 cd set..lOl) buy this one! Wynonna can sing just about ANYTHING and this double cd set will prove that. "I want to know what Love is" is possibly her finest hour but "It's Over yet" and "I can Only Imagine" give her a run for her own title. Her big hits are here, great cover versions and a couple of new songs too boot. FIVE STARS 
 Laugh out loud funny, well, the first section mainly. Then it gravitates to deeper issues. This book is about a spiritual quest. But it's readable and welcoming! I'm usually not into reading spiritual books. I could never get even through the first page of most.   But not this one. Ms. Gilbert writes from her heart and is willing to share every bit of herself, which I'm not exactly sure why she would, and I don't think she is quite sure either but she committed to writing the piece, no matter what. I respect and appreciate that on many levels. 
 This excellent package comes with both the hardcopy and digital PDA version of Davis's Drug Guide for Nurses, the best drug guide which I have used.  How many errors could be alleviated if more nurses looked up their meds?! However, since on most units, medbooks are only available in the medroom and a medbook is too bulky to carry in most cases, the sad fact is that meds are not looked up. My first PDA drug guide was Mosby's, which I have had for over a year; I now also own Davis's. I cannot tell you how many nurses have asked me to quickly look up their meds to see check on dosages, adverse reactions, or nursing considerations. More than one time the meds have been held or orders questioned as a result, but had I not been in the room, the med likely would have been given. How nice it is to have an entire med book electronically available in your pocket, searchable by both generic and brand names (no more flipping through indexes trying to find the generic name), always accessible.  So now you are convinced of the necessity of owning a PDA drug guide, but which one should you buy. Like I said, I have owned Mosby's Drug Guide for over a year and have just recently purchased Davis. I have found Davis's drug guide to be more thorough. Davis is also easier to navigate. Both Davis and Mosby have drop-down menus to quickly jump to the desired section of the med-entry (i.e. mechanism of action, adverse reactions/side effects, compatibility, nursing considerations, client education, etc); however since Davis has the content divided into more subsections, it is quicker to navigate to the desired content. So, my personal choice is Davis; however I do not think you would be remiss to purchase either of these. I only encourage you to move out of the hard-copy med-book and to the PDA version.  You may also like to know that you can integrate many other helpful resources such as lab value guides (such as Pagana & Pagana's Diagnostic Laboratory Test Reference, ISBN 0323033954; or the one included in Medical-Surgical Nursing Clinical Companion, ISBN 0323031994), medical dictionaries (Like Taber's, ISBN 080361408X), and more. I hope that more nurses are walking around with entire reference libraries in their pockets resulting in better practice, improved patient outcomes, and reduced errors.  http://www.hantla.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=20 
 If you always wondered what the hell the "GIANT" posters meant, now you can read their creator's book and find out. Includes great photography of Shepard Fairey's work from around the world. This new Hardcover edition is a really nice edition 
 At some point while I'm reading a work of historical fiction, I'll ask myself "Is this story believable?"  Well, not only is Black Cross believable, it's hard to imagine that it didn't occur.  Iles has written a story that seamlessly merges historical fact with dramatic narrative.  Yet, a believable story isn't the book's only positive feature.  Iles also masterfully paces the story, resulting in a tale that is difficult to stop reading until the conclusion.  Additionally, Iles has created realistic characters that act in ways which are credible.  All these elements combine to make a book that is near perfect.  In fact, if one took out the superfluous love affair and the epilogue that wraps things up a bit too neatly, this book is perfect.  Historical fiction fans owe it to themselves to add Black Cross to their libraries 
 In case your new to the ps2 eye toy.  It is one cool toy.  THis is the perfect entry into the eye toy market as well.  Kenetic is lots of fun, and you get a great workout.  Best of all, you get feedback as to how well you are doing.  I am talking stats as to how well you performed today and relative to other outings.  All in all it is a great purchase.  The camera is placed on top of your tv, and then projects your image onto the screen.  Throughout the game you have to do various tasks with your body to move objects around on the screen.  This is worth it if you are looking for a solid title for the eye toy, or if you are just looking for a great workout 
 I run a knitting circle at a continuation high school where the students learn to knit and then donate the products they make to local homeless shelters for community service hours (toward either probation or graduation).  I have personally researched hundreds of "Learn to Knit" style books and this one is by far the VERY best.  The illustrations and instructions are excellent, concise and clear.  The students have been able to use the book both with me in front of them but then also at home on their own.  Many homeless people in our neighborhood are warmer (in large part) because of this book.  :- 
 Usually I sell my textbooks after using them.  I will keep this one.  It is well written and very easy to read.  What I value in this book the most is the numerous examples of tips and tricks in understanding and manipulating financial statements.  We use this book at Freeman, Tulane in  our itermediate accounting class 
 Beautiful. Kushner attacks many of the world's carnal attitudes and inputs thoughts and principles that help combat them. Though he is not Christian, this book is full of principles that help you avoid being conformed to this world and be transformed by the renewing of your mind 
 this is a book that has more intensity and insight with each new reading. it is the story of a physically handicapped child who with the support of his grandfather takes on a difficult challege and competes to his highest potential.  the story integrates overcoming challenges, uncondition parental love, hard work, and aging while finishing with a realistic outcome.  the reader will be moved with pride and hope 
 This band from Chicago, IL has brought back to the music scene what it has  been lacking for so long: powerful, pretty, poignant, punch packing pop.   It is influenced by the Beatles, Beach Boys and Big Star, but it is not an  album redux.  In finding the more 'subversive' side of love, Frisbie grabs  you with beautiful harmonies, heartbreaking lyrics, and hooks that'd snag  the most cynical of music listeners.  This album is a gem, and there's only  more good things to come 
  MGM's movie,based on the book by L. Frank Baum,"The Wizard of Oz,"is nearly 70 years old.  But its stars, Judy Garland, Bert Lahr, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Billie Burke and Margaret Hamilton, still shine brightly as ever, and the movie continues to be a particular favorite of young and old.  Aljean Harmetz is the daughter of a woman who worked backstage at MGM. Harmetz's mother worked in the Wardrobe Department; she was able to estimate sewing costs on thousands of costumes, from 1937 to 1951 --including the nearly one thousand needed for "The Wizard of Oz,"alone.    So starting from this birds' eye view, Harmetz is well able to explain how "movie magic and studio power in the prime of MGM" resulted in "the miracle of Production #1060."  To that end, she did hundreds of interviews, with actors, singers, songwriters, cameramen, screen writers, costumers, directors, and technicians.  She succeeded in bringing the great glory days of MGM, under its sentimental czar L.B. Mayer, to technicolor life.  Harmetz explains how the Emerald City was designed and built; how the cyclone was created.  She tells us how Judy Garland's immortal "Over the Rainbow" was nearly lost, as envious, nitpicking producers responded after the film's first screening:  "Why does she sing in a barnyard?  Take it out!"  The author gives us fine portraits of Margaret Hamilton, who played the Wicked Witch of the West--"she enjoyed every moment screaming about those slippers."  Binnie Barnes, who played the Good Witch Glinda, retiring to her pink and blue dressing room to await her next call.  Bert Lahr creating the endearing cowardly lion-- his costume weighed over 50 pounds.  "It was like carrying a mattress around with you," he said.  And he could only sip liquids once in full makeup.  Ray Bolger, the dancer who created the Scarecrow, " I have no bones.  I have nothing inside me.  It's just the wind holding me up."  And Jack Haley who inherited the Tin Woodman's part after an allergic reaction to the aluminum paste makeup, put Buddy Ebsen, first cast for the part, in hospital.  You should find you read these marvelously detailed pages with great enjoyment, and if you're as sentimental a fool as I can sometimes be, even with emotional involvement.  If you love the movie, you might want to try to find this book 
 this is a wonderful book. It's better suited for reading with a small group rather than with a class. The asides are lost with a class. Even so my class walked away with an amazing amount of new knowledge about their teet 
 If I had to keep one baking cookbook this would be it.  The recipes are fabulous, easy and always fetch rave reviews.  It is a definate asset to both the experienced and novice baker's kitchen 
 It was such a treat to read this book!  I love memoirs, but often you finish them feeling rather depressed about the state of relationships today.  Here a mother and daughter who love and respect each other take turns writing about their lives together and apart.  They are both authors, and so the writing is skilled, but warm and down to earth and never overblown and literary.    Some moments I especially enjoyed---how both mother and daughter spoke about how they never really learned to wear make-up or have their hair done---something I often feel very alone about as I share that trait!  Perri making her mother a vest---her mother's reluctance to have any fancy or labor intensive done for her, and how the buttons cost $30, which Perri said she would never tell her mother and of course could not resist telling her right away!  How both mother and daughter remember their husband/father---this book is a fine tribute to him.  The tale of Bingo---the dumbest and most useless dog around---one of the only dog stories I've ever read that didn't end with everyone loving the hopeless mutt!  I almost missed reading this book, as the title and the cover dont't really describe well what it is---a memoir.  I thought it was an advice book, or a book of stories of MANY mothers and daughters, not a specific pair.  I am glad I read it anyway, based on my enjoyment of previous Klass books.  It is a heartwarming book in the most true, non-sentimental way 
 This is one of the best written popular science books that I've come across - it reads more like a fiction novel than a science book. Ridley takes a very complex topic and reduces it to a level that anyone with high school science can follow and understand the major points of each chapter; mostly imparting a sense of why the study of genetics matters, and only going into detail on a few gene sequences through out the book.  The book is structured to look at one gene (or related sequence of genes) on each of our 23 chromasomes in each chapter. Sometimes the discussion is what you'd expect - "Here's a gene linked to susceptability to a disease" (though for me an unexpected kicker was that the same gene which makes you susceptible to a 'condition' in later life is often one that caused you to be resistant to some other condition in early life). At other times it's a discussion of how heredity of traits may work, how one can do population migration analysis by looking at geographic spread of genes, or something as prosaic as why some of us like to drink milk, and others don't. All the while, little gems of wisdom are slipped in; like how the human race is [genetically] not really all that advanced, with many simpler creatures like bacteria having had many more evolutionary cycles, or that (for reasons not well explained) humans are genetically quite similar to mice, as well as the more obvious primates.  Ridley has many opinions that come through in this book - some are political, others are scientific, but he's fairly clear to distinguish whether he's talking about something that's a fact backed by scientific data, or a Matt Ridley opinion. He's also refreshingly open on how hard some of the 'facts' are (i.e. this gene sequence causes this effect Vs. it appears that this gene is linked to this effect in 59% of cases), he doesn't appear to be trying to convince us of the importance of genetics, but merely stating what he knows to be fact, and what he believes that other partial facts add up to.   I was absolutely fascinated by the content of this book, it was much more 'un-putdownable' than most fiction I've read. I found myself on a roadtrip one day, making excuses to stop for a coffee, just so I could read one more chapter.  The most powerful thing I can say about this book is that had I read it 20 or so years ago, I'm pretty sure that I'd have made a different career choice and I'd now be a geneticist.. 
 OK, he's writes great thrillers. But he is getting a bit sloppy. First, Chivas Regal is a blend and not a single malt liquor, and second, the 9/11 horrors did not occur at breakfast time in London but rather in the mid afternoon. But I will forgive him his tresspasses, I read the book on a flight from London, and it made the hours "fly" by 
 There are many good christian biographies and many good christian books written on many subjects, but I have yet to find a single one that even comes close to the "Lectures on Revival" concerning having personal revival. A fantastic "how to" book, it is unparalleled. Though written about 150 years ago, the methods in this book are timeless and do work. I have seen it myself on a smaller scale when his principles (which are bible principles) are followed. Think what would happen if one or two of us really yielded ourselves to God as he did. We COULD have sweeping revival today. If you still have any doubts, read the "Autobiography of Charles Finney" and see for yourself that over and over again he used the same biblical methods mentioned in this book and achieved the same biblical results. The autobiography makes this book even more believable. The books go together. It has been noted, (not by him), that 85% of his converts were still living for God 7 years after conversion. Compare that with 1% today. Who's wrong? You be the judge. I challenge you to read the book and don't criticize his theology until you do. As one preacher friend told me, "They criticize his theology, but they can't match his power!&quot 
 I owned a leather checkbook cover for nearly 13 years that was made by another company.  It wore so well that I said I'd never use vinyl again.  For the last five years I've been searching for a similar cover but was unable to come up with one that felt so supple while maintaining a quality firmness.  I like the way the edges are hemmed under and are not exposed.  I chose the tan color which was perhaps a little oranger than expected but hey, I can always see where I laid it down now.  Jef 
 For any woman and possibly any man for that matter who is still questioning who they are and why, this book helps put it in perspective with GREAT detail and accuracy.  This book helped put my mind at ease about a lot of things about myself and my relationships with friends and family 
 It was my first time having these little treats and they were DELICIOUS! I'll probably order more! It IS a good idea to refridgerate them before trying, even though mine arrived cold along with the Ramune soda 
    Regrettably, I have not yet read this book as I have been too busy taking pictures. My photographs illustrate the cover and year dividers so I feel like I was as much a part of the production of this volume as was Ed Bearss.  It took a long time to get this volume out, but in the final analysis I like the way the book looks. My pictures in this book show only a few of the battlefields I have shot but these images are among my favorites. 
 This type of movies are a must for everyone who claims to live in a modern world. Covers a great deal about the rise and fall of population in many countires accross the world like India, China, Japan and U.S. Discusses the cons and pros of increasing as well as decreaing population in some of the above mentioned countries. Also includes the extra feature about China that covers the industrial revolution in China over the last 25 years, its merits and deadly effects on envoirnment. All in all a must see 
 Type H is noticeably faster than type M when taking pictures in RAW mode on my Fuji S6500.  It takes 7.9 seconds with type M but only 5.2 seconds with type H.  That makes type H about 1/3 faster in the write mode than type M.    I haven't tried timing it in the read mode (downloading pictures from camera to computer), but I expect similar time advantage with type H.  One thing may concern someone using it to take movies is the little warning on the back of the shrink wrapped case that says this chip may cause interruptions when recording movies in the 640 x 480 pixel mode.  I don't recall seeing the same warning on my 1 GB type M chip.  On the other hand, I used the 2GB type H chip to take an uninterrupted movie with no problem using up the full 2 gigabytes for one movie.  But I have not been able to download the 2GB movie file to my computer from my camera.  Even when the computer has plenty of free storage, downloading the 2GB file repeatedly crashes the computer.  I can not state with certainty what the culprit is, whether it's the camera, the type H chip, or the Fuji FinePix software.  Also the instruction for the chip says it must be initialized using the intialization function of your camera.  I take this to mean don't rely on the initialization function of a card reader to be compatible with your camera's initialization requirements.  I suspect some data loss problems some folks have reported with these xD chips (whether type M or type H) could be traced to their not having initialized the chip properly.  My 2 GB type H chip is made in Korea by Samsung.  My 1 GB type M chip is made by Toshiba in Japan.  Both are branded Fuji 
 Rarely have I read a book that leads me to describe it as sobering. Yet,  Mike Bickle does more the deserve it. Just pointing out how to use the  prophetic within the church - and how not to use it. Paul has given us a  great rule, when saying that we shouldn't patronize the prophetic, but Mike  Bickle puts the word into a very Biblical and easy to understand setting,  so that anyone can understand what he is talking about. Since Bickle has  been the pastor of a church where the prophetic has been allowed to grow  for several years - with both good and bad sides to it, this book shows, as  mentioned above, a very sober attitude. I will gladly recommend the book by  all of my heart. PS! I've read the book in Norwegian..., and recommend it  to Norwegian Readers as wel 
 This book was awesome. The characters are well developed and the advice that she gives throughout the whole book is hysterical esp when she goes against it. This is definitely a must read and if you are looking for a book to make you laugh out loud then this is it. This isnt the typical 'chick lit', its way better 
 Mary Chapin-Carpenter built her career largely on public radio airplay for her folky acoustic guitar-based songcraft. This album exploded her into the country mainstream, thanks to the huge hits "Passionate Kisses", "I Feel Lucky" and lesser hits "I Take my Chances" and "He Thinks He'll Keep Her". But while country radio may have loved her for awhile, it quickly forgot about her and the reason why is between the hit tracks: Carpenter has more in common with classic country singers than with the current batch of forgettable pop-country heard on the radio these days.  Carpenter is all about songs: Writing the sentiments of an educated, mature woman who's not afraid to make political statements that buck Nashville's (i.e. she's a feminist and a bit to the left) conservatism. All but two of the songs here were written or co-written by her.  HIGHLIGHTS: The hits deserved to be. Carpenter finds the catchy heart of Lucinda Williams' "Passionate Kisses" and makes it the mainstream smash it was always meant to be. "I Feel Lucky" and "I Take my Chances" both find Carpenter playing it sassy and devil-may-care. "He Thinks He'll Keep Her" reveals Carpenter's feminist streak, in the tale of a woman who leaves her uncaring husband after 15 years ("For 15 years she had a job and not one raise in pay/Now she's in the typing pool at minimum wage..") "The Bug" is the lost album track that should have been a hit. The blue-collar philosophy of life ("Sometimes you're the windshield/Sometimes you're the bug..") is terribly catchy and a nice retool of a Dire Straits album track. The album cuts are what make Carpenter stand a bit above the pack: "I Am a Town" is pure southern Americana ("I'm the last gas for an hour, if you're going 25, I am Texaco and tobacco, I am dust you leave behind"), the tender duet with Joe Diffie on "Not Too Much to Ask",and "Only a Dream"'s taste of the deep bonds of sisters and the hurt that comes when the older one leaves home ("I turned on the light and all that I saw/Was a bed and a desk and a couple of tacks/No sign of someone who expects to be back/It must've been one h*ll of a suitcase you packed")  LOWS: "Walking Through Fire" and "Rhythm of the Blues" are rather mediocre in the end. They just don't stick with you that well.  BOTTOM LINE: If you're a Shania or Faith Hill fan, you'll probably HATE this. If you enjoy singer-songwriters (even if you THINK you hate country), give this a listen. You'll probably be pleasantly surprised. If you're a diehard folkie, you'll probably find this "overproduced" (which seems to be code for "any song with more than just a voice and an acoustic guitar").  3 1/2 star 
 This book is being used by our women's class at church as a study guide. I have received good reports from the class members about the book 
 As an introduction to programming on the Symbian platform this book is excellent. If you require detailed information on C++ EPOC programming then it may appear a bit sparse. You can get the required information from Symbian/Psion directly. If you wish to start programming on this platform then this is a great introduction. After reading it you will be able to make the most of the detailed information from Symbian themselves 
 I read this book several times over the years and each time I get something new out of it. I'm a Christian and though this book derives some of its underpinnings from Eastern philosopy, the book gives a great overview of Western civilization. How the book uses geography, the personal relationships, his past history, and Greek and Eastern philosophy to prove his thesis is fascinating. The book has problems. The main character does not follow his own philosophy in some ways. Pirsig makes too broad of generalizations about the Greek philosophers. Phaedrus's experience at the University of Chicago does not ring true to me. However, the book challenges the reader to think, to ponder life in general and contemplate on how the branches of knowledge tie together.   Pirsig's shows parallels between quality and arete (excellence in Greek) and the Buddha. I think there also parallels between Biblical Wisdom and Quality (See Proverbs 8). The book had a tremendous impact when it first came out and influenced a generation of college students. It should be read just so the reader can understand the book's impact on current culture for good or ill. Pirsig is a very good writer.    
 Actually I saw the movie many years back and, remembering that and recently reading another Doctorow book, I decided to pick this one up when I noticed it in a store. The tale of a ramshackle little western town on the edge of nowhere in the Dakota territory, deriving its lifeblood from a nearby mine, WELCOME TO HARD TIMES grabs us from the beginning with its brutal portrayal of the town's destruction at the hands of a monster of a man who is to remain nameless for much of the tale, a natural force more than a fellow human being. The Bad Man from Bodie savagely rapes and callously kills those in his path including the town whores, the barkeep, the carpenter, the undertaker, the hangers-on, leaving only a few scattered survivors in his wake, after burning the town around them to the ground. In the shadow of his departure, with little hope and much desperation, the handful of survivors rebuild, mainly for want of anything else to do. And the town, after a rigorous winter, prospers. But the mood throughout is ominous and the memory of the Man fron Bodie never far below the surface of the broken people he leaves behind. Doctorow writes with subtlety and irony and his telling is as tight as it gets. Yet I found the ending, deliberately muddled, I suppose, to mimic the sense of collapse, rather a letdown after the crisp narrative that comes before. All breaks down, in the end, in a sudden revelation about the sustaining source of the town's hopes and the Bad Man from Bodie returns without notice, just abruptly appearing in the maelstrom of collapse. This time is a little different from the first in the town's response to the Bad Man, or at least in how the self-proclaimed town mayor and narrator responds. But the results are no less redolent of life's despair and futility. Although the characters are more than the Western stereotypes they at first appear to be, they do not rise above their situations but are sucked sadly back into the storm that blows down upon them from the larger world outside. They are a sad lot and so, we sense, are we all, doomed to live out our lives in hope and desperate striving but never able to gain a foothold in the rock to take us above the level of the town of Hard Times and the life it offers us. This is a fable, writ on Western rock, of living and dying. More subtle and many-layered than the movie it inspired, in the end it is a book of hopelesness and of the raggedness of life itself. -- SW 
 A fantastic book. Thought provoking. Inspiring. Radical. Doubly inspiring. You can learn more about US history from this book than from any textbook I've seen. A real people's perspective which resulted from living a hard life. Even someone under the age of 13 could read it. I truly amazing person. Agnes Smedley had a basic and deep understanding of society - truly the daughter of earth.............. read it 
 This DVD is great.  The sound and Video are very professional with great transitions.  I highly recommend this to all Eagles fans and anyone that loves music 
 A lot of people will say that Chicago is not as good now as they were back in the 70's and that they should've never changed their style.  The thing is, if they had kept the same exact style of music that they started with, they wouldn't of made it through the 80's.  They made the change based on the fact that that style was where the money was.  This album shows that they are a multi-talented group.  Most of the songs were hits as singles.  One little note from another review.  Peter Cetera was not on this album.  He left the group in 1985, three years prior to the release of this album.  The tenor that you hear is actually Jason Scheff who replaced Cetera as both the tenor voice and bass player 
 The film "War Photographer" is probably the best documentary I've seen profiling a photographer. Often these type of films give a cursory look at the photographer's life, maybe mention his/her philosophy and don't touch on his/her techniques at all. While unfortunately it doesn't go into any depth of how Jim Nachtwey grew up, his influences or training, it does explore his thoughts on being a war photographer and goes so far as to attach a mini camera to him as he shoots in various locations. This gives the viewer, and would be war photographer, an intimate look on how Nachtwey shoots his various subjects. From camera technique to positioning to interacting with his subjects, we see how he performs his job. It would be a good film for an aspiring photojournalist to watch 
 This was the first book I ever read by Diane Duane, and I must say she is one of, if not THE, most talented author I have ever read. Like everything else by her that I have read, this book is very intellectually challenging and even upon rereading it recently I didn't understand everything. But who cares?! This book (the whole series, really) is unbelievably creative and breaks the mold in every possible respect. It's just. . . wow. Words can't really describe.     Unfortunately, most people who decide to read this book are going to say "Oh, this is a total ripoff of Harry Potter," upon which I would be tempted to tear their throats out. First of all, This book was first published back in 1983, FOURTEEN YEARS before Harry Potter ever grazed the shelves. And even if HP did happen to precede this series, you have to ask yourself. . . which one is better? Would you rather read about a wizard with rudimentary skills whose ultimate task is to save himself, his closest friends, and maybe eventually a country, from a mere rogue (albeit powerful) wizard, or would you prefer to read about a wizard with the potential to manipulate the very fabric of space and time whose job is to assist in the salvation of THE WHOLE OF EXISTENCE from the very manifestation of death and evil itself?!?!!? C'mon, people, even if your minds have been narrowed and rotted by delving wholeheartedly into the HP craze, you should be able to answer that.     I would like to conclude by encouraging everyone reading this to read the entire series, as well as The Book of Night With Moon and To Visit The Queen, as fast as you possibly can. I would also like to thank Ms. Duane for sharing this wonderful story with us. Although, sadly and wrongly, it will probably never achieve the acclaim and attention that HP has managed, I still wish to congratulate and thank her for showing the lucky few of us what REAL wizardry is like 
 This is NOT your average book with trite advice on "how to make friends"  It is far superior in every way. The author discusses the extreme importance of friendship. (She was inspired to write this book when two of her friends saved her life.)     There is solid evedience for everything she says. (She references 77 sociological 77 which are annotated in the back of the book.) And third, like all Leil Lownds' books, they are so much fun to read. Stories about some of her "friends" had me ROFL.   I love the author's concept of  "you don't just make friends, you EARN them" by being a person of value yourself. She calls it  The First Commandment of Friendship: "You must have something in order to receive." In other words, you must develop likeable and valuable qualities yourself so you can be an important friend to others. Not only does she talk about how to make friends quickly and make them grow, but how to nurture and enrich the ones you have.   The author explores  how different women's friendships are from men's, and whether a man and a woman can truly have a "platonic" friendship and, how to do it, if you want to turn a friend into a lover.   One of my favorite concepts is her exploration of the "in" crowd and that "being popular does not mean being liked."  This too is based on studies. I could go on and on about her insights on friendship that I've never read anywhere else.   I tried one of Leil's techniques which is to dig up a very old friend and spend a few hours with them. She writes, "Whether the friendship continues (or you relize why it ended,") you will both receive a priceless gift. Each of you will come away with a fresh and profound new sense of self."  I did.  I will be forever grateful to the author for the awareness of the importance of friends - how to make them quickly, shed the superficial ones, and keep the ones you want for a lifetime.  
 This book is truly beautiful and will inspire anyone to instantly plan a dinner party, a tea, a wedding or shower(actually, any kind of gathering!) in order to put all the wonderful ideas to use.  There are so many creative and innovative suggestions for setting a table and it made me look at things I already own in new ways.  I also appreciated the suggestions for borrowing from friends and family or purchasing inexpensive pieces to make my old presentations look fresh and new.    It is so hard to pick a favorite from among all those shown - but the Day of the Dead celebration and the white summer wedding are spectacular.  The children's birthday in the park will give mothers some great suggestions for a unique party - including menu and recipes.  This book will continue to inspire me for years to come 
 I have really enjoyed using my Labelmaker.  The refills are kind of pricey, but I feel that overall it's well worth the money!  Great product 
 The following is from a review by Prof. W.R.Bidlack, Dean of College of Agriculture at California State Polytechnic University (Journal of the American College of Nutrition (2000) Vol. 19:419-420):  This well-written text integrates the relationships between nutrients from food and the chemistry of living organisms.  The sequential presentation, the figures and tables, the case studies, the appendicies, each contributes to the quality of the work, one valuable for teaching biochemistry, nutrition, medical or health professional students . . . In many cases, the author has included discussion of historically important nutritional deficiencies as well as more contemporary problems that can be controlled wiht appropriate nutritional intervention, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease . . . The layout of the text permits the integration of nutrition into a medical school curriculum.  If first establishes biological structure and its relation to genetic expression.  Next it presents a very systematic discussion of digestion and absorption . . . The chapter on lipids includes important consideration of phospholipids and sphingosine-based lipids, but emphasizes cholesterol, lipoproteins, and cardiovascular disease . . . Protein . . . is covered in greater detail than by most texts, clearly in an effort to provide good understanding of the concepts, basic and applied. . . Both the vitamins and minerals are presented in standard formats.  However, the vitamins are presented in terms of their role in metabolism, rather than simply water soluble and then fat soluble vitamins . . . Throughout the book, the author underscores the importance of nutrient interactions--some positive, some synergistic, and some antagonistic.  In addition, major emphasis is placed on interorgan relationships . . . The book can be recommended as a teaching text.  It is pleasurable to read . . . There are stimulating exercises in most chapters and a large number of references . . . (From review by Prof. W.R. Bidlack, Dean, College of Agriculture, Calif. State Polytech. Univ. Pomona 
 I read this book several dozen times when I was a kid, vicariously living my dream of making it in the wild.  Some kids are bored with it (it goes into quite a bit of detail, and is slow-paced), but others love it.  It tends to interest kids with a lot of imagination or an inclination to be a writer.  The sequels don't hold a candle to the original 
 I think this book is a lovely story and is entertaining for a child who enjoys a little trouble-making 
 This book is a treasure trove of information for publishers and authors on the subject of promoting books. Not only does it give the reader specific steps and actions to take, but it provides excellent supporting information in the form of web addresses, names of organizations, people to contact, etc. This book stands head and shoulders above any other book I've read on the subject 
 Exciting and highly entertaining story about 3 men who travel to the centre of the earth through an extinct volcano. Here they come across prehistoric forests, a giant subterranean sea inhabited by prehistoric marine dinosaurs, and some ancient offshoots of man. Although some of the science bits are outdated, implausable and sometimes drag a little, the book is still surprisingly modern and fresh after 140 years. Maybe the first adventure novel of this kind and certainly of influence on modern culture. 
 This book - A Whack on the Side of the Head, even with its subtitle (How You Can Be More Creative) - conveys an exclusively humorous message. That is what I thought. However, while the writing is clearly entertaining and relaxing, the message is a serious one and the author communicates it effectively. In ten brief chapters the book describes essential blocks for creativity.  Creative thinking allows for the possibility that the right answer can be illogical, and one get that answer only by following some rules of thumb while breaking others, as long as in this frivolous play people do not lose more than they gain. This is the gist of Chapters 1 - 5.  Subsequent chapters recognize that specialization aids productivity and hence gains from exchange. However, there is the obvious caution that too narrow an area of specialization stifles imagination. Thus, it does not hurt to "occasionally, let your `stupid monitor' down, play the fool, and see what crazy ideas you can come up with" (p.128). The reason is that in creative efforts ambiguity pays; to err is not to do wrong. Temporary failure is sometimes better than temporary success, for `if you hit every time, the target is too near or too big' (p. 154). And so, creativity is not the lack of ideas, it is absence of action on the many ideas we all have.   I like this book and would not hesitate to recommend it.

  In 1981, I was asked by a friend of mine if I'd like to go and see Bruce Springsteen in concert. He had an extra ticket and I dropped a couple of bucks to him and went to the show. The crowd was entering the arena laughing and thrilled to be at the show. Over the next few hours I was released into a world I had only dreamed existed. It was one of a rock-n-roll revival show. Except the band was young and full of an optimistic energy that was so genuinely sincere it engulfed every single person in the crowd into a sweaty dance party from some old 50's movie and equally brought you to a variety of scenes from the classic film noir cinema of the same era. The songs though, were brand new or very recently released within a ten year period. I had never, ever seen or heard anything at this level of quality.  For the only time in my life I went to the local music store the next day and bought every remaining Bruce album I hadn't yet bought. A worthy investment to say the least. I am to this day an avid Bruce Springsteen fan. The River was the tour and the album that made me a fan for life. On another note, Bruce Springsteen is a true patriot.Proven, tried and true. Anyone who dismisses this purely because he has the freedom as an American to speak out about what he believes and does. Is wrongly accusing and misinformed.Above all else, anyone with this opinion about Bruce's music. Isn't listening to it. Simply put, nothing more and nothing else 
 David LaChapelle has a style that is all his own, and is best described as a unique blend of fashion photography and pop art. I liked this book especially for the intriguing and occasionally shocking potrayals of famous people (Eminem, Lil' Kim, Madonna, and more) who leave themselves at the mercy of LaChapelle's imagination. 
 This book tells teens everything they need to know about teenage relations. From friendships to dating, from relationships and sex. This book tells you more than your Health class. I found this book to give every situation on dating, relationships, and sex. It teaches you how to kiss, survive a breakup, and know when you are ready for sex. Plus, this book has quizzes like "Are You Ready To Date", "Top 10 Turn-ons", "10-Step Guide to Giving a Killer Kiss." This book has actual letters from real teens about almost every topic so show that you aren't the only one going through that. Everyone does at some point 
 I couldn't put down My Year of Meats, so I decided to see what else Ms. Ozeki was thinking about.  Wow, I really enjoyed this book.  I loved the characters, each fallible in their own way.  I felt like I was part of a wacky family for a time, and was absorbed into their world.  The way the story is woven together is wonderful, at times quirky and often moving.  I didn't want it to end 
 The Character Of Organizations identifies sixteen types of organizational character using the framework of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator instrument and clarifies what people actually experience on the job. Utilizing "real world" corporate examples, William Bridges shows that an organization's character shapes how decisions are made and new ideas are received, how employees are treated and how change is accepted or rejected, and how such things affect company performance. Written in a lively, contemporary, and completely accessible style, and in a new edition enhanced with a foreword by Sandra Krebs Hirsh and a new preface by the author, The Character Of Organizations is highly recommended reading for anyone seeking to transform their own business to take advantage of their strengths and become aware of their weaknesses with which ever corporate character style they are employing 
 This book is everything you would want in a travel guide....easy to read and understand, entertaining and interesting, and best of all, accurate!!  It's the perfect companion to a GREAT place! 
 From the very beginning of Jeanne Feldman's Best Buys and Bargains in Paris you realize that she is acutely aware of the cultural differences at play in France.  Her advice is sure to make your shopping experience the pleasure it is meant to be and should appeal to everyone, from tourists eager to do a little shopping in Paris, to long-time expats who will certainly find some old and new favorites 
 John Cleland's Fanny Hill is a must read for anyone who admires good writing.  The author can makes you sizzle with every sentence without using  one vulgar word. Most incredible! A master of the English Language 
 I have read everything I can get my hands on from Seligman - although a faithful scientist and researcher, he understands the practical application of his discoveries into Optimism, and works diligently at making those concepts understandable.  The application of Learned Optimism, properly and easily applied, will effect every aspect of your life.  As a father I have seen in my children learned behaviors and have been able to help them understand events - as momentary not permanent.  The greatest benefit of learned optimism is at work - even some simple advice on how to change an employees outlook changes their approach to their work, the quality and their committment.  I've stopped trying to teach traits - and started teaching "Outlook".  This book is fabulous - the only dissapointment I have is that I can't find a new one in a hard cover 
 I have only gotten to use my new Gardenmaster once so far but it is great!   I have a FD-50 from about 15 years ago with 12 trays that I have used many times a year.  I've always wanted the 30 tray professional model but couldn't justify it because my old one still worked fine.  Well, I was ordering a jerky gun for a Christmas present so that became all the justification I needed.   I have 24 trays for mine at the moment and I was able to do my whole allotment of beef jerky at one time where it would have taken 3 different batches with my old one.  All I do is beef jerky and it usually takes me about 6 hours per batch with my FD-50 and it took the same amount of time with the Gardenmaster but with 24 full trays!  You can't beat this!   Everyone always wants me to make jerky and it is very time consuming but this certainly makes the end result get here faster.  Do yourself a favor, buy one.... 
 Following her book "Knitted Babes',( this book which includes toys for young boys), is a joy to work with.  The dolls are hard to part with, But my grandchildren enjoy them almost  as much as I do

(A)  80+: LOCK THIS BABY IN A SAFE PLACE! (A+)   LANCE STORM VS. CHRIS JERICHO THIS WAS A NICE, QUICK PACED PURE WRESTLING MATCH TO OPEN UP THE PAY PER VIEW. I WOULDNT HAVE MINDED ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES, BUT THE ENDING WAS A BIT DISSAPOINTING. I DID ENJOY THE IMPACT PLAYERS REUNION. BUT IN THE END I FELT A BIT CHEATED. WINNER: LANCE STORM RATING: 7  THREE WAY DANCE SUPER CRAZY VS. TAJIRI VS. LITTLE GUIDO I ENJOYED THIS MATCH. IT WAS A VERY GOOD HIGHFLYING MATCH, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ONLY ABOUT FIVE MINUTES LONG. THERE WERE SOME GOOD SPOTS HERE, BUT THE MOST RECOGNIZED WAS THE HUGE MOONSAULT BY SUPER CRAZY FROM THE BALCONY ONTO THE FBI. AFTER GUIDO WAS ELIMINATED WE HAD A NICE SHORT BOUT BETWEEN TAJIRI AND SUPER CRAZY. OVERALL A GOOD MATCH. WINNER: SUPER CRAZY RATING: 7  PSICOSIS VS. REY MYSTERIO EVEN THOUGH THIS MATCH WASNT AS GOOD AS THE 3 WAY DANCE BEFORE IT, IT WAS STILL A DECENT MATCHUP. DISSAPOINTING TO SEE PSICOSIS SLOW THE PACE OF THE MATCH DOWN, UNTIL THE POINT WHERE HE WAS BOOED. BUT THESE TWO MIXED WELL, AS THEY HAVE FACED EACHOTEHR SO MANY TIMES BEFORE. I DID ENJOY THIS MATCH, BUT I EXPECTED A LITTLE MORE FROM IT. WINNER: REY MYSTERIO RATING: 6  SABU VS. RHINO HERE WAS AN IMPROMPTU MATCH, AFTER AN ENJOYABLE SHOOT PROMO BY ROB VAN DAM, WHICH WAS ENDED WITH A GORE FROM RHINO. THE MATCH COULD HAVE BEEN LONGER, BUT FOR WHAT TIME IT WAS GIVEN, THEY MADE THE MOST OF IT. THE FIRST USE OF A WEAPON WAS IN THIS MATCH. NICE ENDING WITH THE SUPER ARABIA FACEBUSTER THROUGH A TABLE, TO END A PRETTY SOLID MATCH. THIS WAS YOUR AVERAGE SHORT BUT SWEET ECW MATCH. WINNER: SABU RATING: 6  EDDIE GUERRERO VS. CHRIS BENOIT THIS WAS ANOTHER GREAT ENCOUNTER BETWEEN THESE TWO GREAT ATHELETS. THE BEST PURE WRESTLING MATCH OF THE NIGHT. BUT ONCE AGAIN, IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH LONGER. ANOTHER 10 MINUTES WOULDN'T HURT ANYONE. IT WAS HARD TO FOCUS ON THE MATCH, AS EARLY ON IN THE BOUT, THE CROWD STARTED BERATING EDGE AND THE OTHER RAW SUPERSTARS. ANYWAYS, THIS WAS AN AWESOME WRESTLING MATCH. WINNER: CHRIS BENOIT RATING: 8  MASATO TANAKA VS. MIKE AWESOME HERE IS A GREAT ECW MATCH. THOUGHT IT MAY BE A SPOTFEST, IT IS VERY ENTERTAINING, AND KEPT YOU ON YOUR FEET THE WHOLE MATCH. SO MANY TABLES WERE BROKEN IN THIS MATCH, AND IM SUPRISED MASATO IS STILL BREATHING AFTER WHAT HE WENT THROUGH IN THIS MATCH. I THINK THIS IS THE LONGEST MATCH ON THE CARD, AND IT WAS WELL WORTH WATCHING. THIS WAS MY PICK FOR MATCH OF THE NIGHT, AS WITH MANY OTHER PEOPLE. WINNER: MIKE AWESOME RATING: 8  DUDLEY BOYZ VS. SANDMAN & TOMMY DREAMER THIS WAS A DECENT MAIN EVENT, BUT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IN MY MIND. THOUGH SOME ENJOYED IT, I DIDNT LIKE HOW THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE INTERFERING BEFORE THE MATCH COULD GET STARTED. BUT AFTER THE BELL RANG, WE HAD A NICE ECW HARDCORE MATCH. AND YES, THE CHEESE GRATER IS INCLUDED HERE. A LOT OF VIOLENCE HERE, AS TO THE PLEASURE OF ALL THE ECW FANS. NICE ENDING WITH THE DUDLEY BOYZ POWERBOMBING TOMMY THROUGH A FLAMING TABLE. GOOD ECW MATCH. WINNERS: DUDLEY BOYZ RATING: 7  PAY PER VIEW RATING: (49/70) = 70  OVERALL, ECW ONE NIGHT STAND RECIEVED A (B+), WHICH MEANS THIS IS A VERY GOOD EVENT. THAT IS TRUE, THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST PAY PER VIEWS OF 2005. THIS WAS JUST HOW IT SHOULD BE. THE ONE FAULT THAT BUGGED ME HERE WAS THE WWE SUPERSTARS, BUT FORGETTING THAT, THIS WAS A GREAT PAY PER VIEW, AND I RECCOMEND IT TO EVERY ECW FAN 
 Everything I needed in a book on diagnoses, interventions and rationales.  This is a great must-have for all new nursing students 
 New Testament Apocrypha provides critically annotated translations of the collected body of extant ancient texts dealing with the life and sayings of Jesus the Nazarene.  The revised edition presents, in English, all the  essential source material for serious study of early gospel versions.  This  book, along with its companion volume dealing with apostolic texts, is  presented in the best tradition of German scholarship.  It is an absolute  must for all students of early Christianity and the New Testament 
 I flew through this book! In a minimum of three hours this book was finished and in the "return" stack to the library. I had read the book "Second Chances" by Debra White Smith,which tellls of Marilyn's story. Seeing her reappear was delightful. I loved Beth and Scott. I cried, laughed, sighed a romantic wish, and felt sooo sorry for Scott and his attempt to romance Beth! Knowing that he loved her was almost imbearable at times! I felt overly sorry for him when Beth kept changing her attitude for Michael. I enjoyed every minute of this book and you will too 
 If you have ever worked with birds that show aggression, this book will be a easy to understand and excellent all-around resource for you.  Great for first time parrot people and experienced trainers alike.  Includes explanations based in science (ethology and behavior sciences) as well as training techiniques.  Sections on bird body language are very helpful.  This book goes into more depth than Good Bird! and is a very useful addition.  I recommend this book to many of my students, and I haven't heard a disapointed comment yet.  I look forward to more from Barbara!  If you've not gotten a chance to check out the magazine, Good Bird! it is also very worthwhile. 
 I am a high school teacher that uses Final Cut Pro on a daily level in and out of the classroom (the class produces weekly programming). Looking for printed materials for FCP usually brings HUGE step-by-step manual-like books. This new book brings a refeshing look at Final Cut Pro. It offers insightful, useful tips, and instructions I can use and share with my students. It reminds me of the Photoshop WOW books. Since I have shared this book with students, three purchased it immediately. Other reviews offer great details about this book; I HIGHLY recommend this book. It is a must have in your FCP library 
 Robert D. Richardson takes the busy-bodied world of Thoreau and places each of his accomplishments into context starting with their respective intellectual origin.  In the process of doing this, Richardson constructs  the world of Thoreau's Concord and creates it for us vividly and   realistically.  This is by far the best Thoreau bio out there and serves a  perfect book-end with his Emerson bio, The Mind On Fire 
 I first read about Rebecca Rather in a magazine article. I was so intrigued by her simple manner with a recipe that focused on baking from your heart and producing food of the highest  quality. Many so-called chefs utterly lack the zest for life (or is it love of great home cooking?)  that I immediately sensed in "The Pastry Queen". So I did the logical reaction and bought the cookbook. An action that I will never regret! Every recipe I have made was extremely easy to put together yet came off looking fantastic. As a person that admires the arts, I was equally enthralled by the generous dose of lush and scrumptious photography.     This is a cookbook to read and then read again. I'm betting that y'all will have a hard time keeping away from these great recipes from the Lone Star State. Way to go, Rebecca Rather!  
 I bought this a while ago, in the tape format.  So I just relistened and again was blown away by the zest and warmth of Zig Ziglar's spirit to really help you.  He offers a seven-step formula for helping you clearly lay out a plan for success.  He sprinkles it with wonderful inspiring stories.  It makes want to start now so you can reap the rewards as soon as possible.  Wonderful stuff 
 This was one of the first rock & roll records I ever heard. My brother  bought it when it first came out and he played it to death. His record had  so many scratches, hisses & pops on it, that I decided I needed my own.  This is a classic album. I wasn't looking for this "High On The  Hog" disc, but when I accidently stumbled apon it in the cd shop  recently - I had to buy it. What a throw-back this was - to the good old  times when nothing mattered... no bills to pay, no job to worry about...  just school and your friends. Now almost 30 years later, I listen to this  disc and it still sounds great. Jim Dandy is a one in a million singer with  a unique set of lungs. The other band member I remember was drummer Tommy  Aldridge - who went on with other classic rock bands like Whitesnake, Ozzy  and Pat Travers. BOA could rock with the best of them. I feel that they  were a highly underrated band. They were at their best with their hard  rockers, but every once in awhile they'd come up with a slow ballad that  would just knock you back a few rows. Classic songs here: "Swimming In  Quicksand", "Why Shouldn't I Smile", "Moonshine  Sonata", and "Jim Dandy". Great album cover too... and who  knows, Jim Dandy very well could have been the precurser to David Lee Roth.  The attitude, hair, open chested shirts and stylings were all there with  him & BOA 
 The Ultimate Bond Collection is sure must in any Bond fan collection, or even in any Action Movie collection.  Not only do we get all the movies, and I mean all 20 of them, in a fully digitally restored image, but also in full Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound, not forgetting the DTS system also included...  Can you imagine watching Dr. No or Goldfinger in this manner? Or even Live and Let Die or The Man with the Golden Gun this way?  Simply spectacular.  Although there are some differences in the special features included here, compared to those offered in the equivalent Special Editions, which I would keep just for this reason, if you, like me still have them, instead of simply discard them from your shelves.  Also, the accompanying booklets are nice, but not as colorful as their Special Edition counterparts.  But as far as the main content, which after all are the DVDs, the Ultimate Collection is light years away from their previous releases.  Unless you want to wait until the entire collection is once again re-released, and this time on HD-DVD, which I sincerely doubt, I don't think they will give more impact to the movies themselves (you will still have to wait a couple of years, before the HD-DVD revolution truly takes in the hearts and minds  of people - besides, there are even newer developments... so don't hold your breath for this).  The only two negative points here are just minor ones.  One is the everlasting question about the final scene in "From Russia with Love", on the Venice canals, in which James Bond (Sean Connery) and Tanja Romanova (Daniela Bianchi) are scrutinizing the secret "blue" movie taken by the Russians in the Hotel room in Istanbul, earlier in the movie, when Bond meets Tanja for the first time.  The full scene included some additional comments which were cut at the time, due to censorship problems. But today we are all grown-ups and therefore I would have appreciated, if they had it reintegrated as it seemed to be in the intentions of the Producers.  But then again, who knows, maybe the material was lost in the meanwhile (although I doubt it, because on at least on a videotape release I used to own from England, the entire scene was shown, unfortunately I don't have it anymore).  The second point is that they left Madonna's videoclip of her song for "Die Another Day", together with the "Making Of" of the same, out of this DVD release. So, if you still own the Special Edition of "Die Another Day", do not get rid of it as yet, unless of course, you don't really care for that particular videoclip.  That's all.  The DTS soundtrack is a plus in this collection. If you own a DTS capable DVD player, put it on and you will experience these movies as you never have before, it is far better than the just conventional Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound also included.  What can I add beyond all of this? Absolutely nothing.  If you have appreciated the Special Editions, you will absolutely be overjoyed in having the Ultimate Edition.  It is well worth the money.  Bravo Sony, you are doing an exceptionally good job 
 I've read many different versions/translations of the Tao Te Ching, which is a difficult book to translate. It appears as though many authors loose the original intentions and meanings while trying to get their ideas across... Stephen Mitchell does an outstanding job! He does not take away the simple, elegant meaning of Lao Tsu's masterpiece.  I recommend this book to EVERYONE 
 This is one of the best Hip Hop soundtracks, I never saw the movie but the music is just CHILL. Especially like 'Politics of The Sneaker Pimps,' which is anti-pompous-sportsplayers-wearing-brandname-shoes. 'Supa Agent' has the beat like that, and the all time mostest bestest Flavor Flav song in the whole wide world is the one right on this album, 'Shake Yo' Booty,' for all those Flava (I know you're out there) fans. 'Is your God a Dog' gives out some food for thought, not reccomended for any die-hard christians out there, but for them there's christian music, and plenty of it 
 this is a collection of case files, pages from bruce's diary, and a how-to, it is also so a warning. do not try this at home! it is a  execellent book the only two flaw was on the second or third page 1. it refers to jim gordon being commissioner, he retired by the time this book was written, you could argue when bats wrote this will gordon was head of police but bats is the type to update these kinds of things 2. he says he thinks the possiblity of a successor being remote but with tim, dick, and cassanda around i think any of them could continue as the Dark Knight.      
 Actually, I thought this "GHOST" film was excellent. The acting was good and it really had so many shock moments in it. I watched it alone and wished I hadn't! Brilliant film. I would recommend it for the constipated among you!! Wonderful story, great SpecialFX. A definite must for horror fans.  Meryl Heasman (songwriter) CATFLAP MUSIC 
 My husband has read this whole series, and he really loves all the books. Ringworld is an amazing setting, and the stories are awesome.   This is one of his favorite series, and we both recommend it 
 After reading many books throughout the years, I have finally found one that is very outstanding to read.  In reading many books, they seam very boring, but C is For Corpse is a very interesting read.  It is part of a series that starts with A is for Alibi, and is currently at R is for Ricochet.  It is a murder mystery that goes way beyond the normal mystery that viewers see on T.V.  This book gives an in-depth look at all the people involved.  From the sister who is either smoking, doing drugs, or drinking, to the actual victim who was committing adultery before his death this book has a wide range of people. The part of the book that really makes it above and beyond the normal read is that it has real life people.  Kinsey Millhone, who is the detective, is an average middle aged woman who is concerned about her weight, and has a polite side to her.  She finishes the case even when Bobby is dead, when easily she could of stopped caring, and stole the money.  She lives in a very rich town, yet she lives in a trailer park, which further adds tot the fact that this book is full of diversity. The only negative part is that there is too much detail, but if a reader doesn't mind an excessive amount of detail, then this is a good choice.  With taking this all into consideration, I would recommend this book, and give it a score of 4 stars out of five.  It is worth the time, and I once again strongly encourage people to read C is For Corpse.    
 I like this book very much ! I followed this diet with a friend and she an I were trying to lose weight . Guess what, THE DIET DID WORK ! The book tells you what you have to eat threw the course of the day with foods that are low in carbohydrates. You can decide which meal of the day you choose to have your goodies (TREATS).For EXAMPLE: If you want a Treat for breakfast it can only be with that meal. You can decide when you want to eat your treat, either it be lunch or dinner its up to you. But It will only be that one meal of the day that you choose. You CANNOT eat your TREATS in every meal. Of course, we incorporated EXCERCISE which also helped in the process to lose weight. I'm the type of person who likes VARIETY, so I have many books on diet and nutrition. So when I get bored with one diet I can choose another. When I do find the BEST diet for me, I will tell all you readers out there about it! Stay motivated and be forever fit 
 as a drummer myself I think Scott Travis is as solid a rock drummer as there is but I gotta tell you that the guitar playing on this CD absolutely smokes! These guys tear it up at every turn and don't miss a trick. You guitarists out there, get his CD, fasten your seat belts and crank this sucker up!   [... 
 Many years ago I made the investment in Zig Ziglars book, finally the pages wore out from my numerous readings so I re-ordered and would not be without it.  Although I do not sell pots and pans, I took Zig's techniques and put them to work in creative real estate investing, just pluged in real estate instead of pots and pans as I like to relate.  If you are in sales or just want the ideal way to handle situations then make the investment in this book.  Thank you Mr. Ziglar  John $Cash$ Lock 
 I will start by saying that I have not finish reading it. It took me over a year to complete Art of the Start, and the reason is that there was so much inspiration, that I felt it was going to be eclipsed by the excitment of the next chapter.  Its not a how-to book, is how to face yourself and ispire you to get throgh the obstacles, inner or outer, that will surge along the way.  
 Edward Sakura sees the man in his shodo hut on his Brooklyn estate and knows the intruder is going to kill him.  Before he dies, he creates a message in calligraphy that reads "spring wind".  The police think it is a clue to his murderer and one of the lead detectives brings his brother, martial arts expert Connor Burke, is called into the investigation  since he is an expert in things Asian.  It is learned that Sakura has sent a calligraphic scroll to Professor Hoddington in Georgia for an evaluation.  The evidence shows the professor ends up murdered by the same person who killed Sakura.  The school journalist Kim who gave the scroll to Sakura is found tortured and dead.  The man Connor suspects killed the three men is also interested in Connor's Sensei's friend Tibetan monk Changpa Ripache.  The killer has ties to the People's Republic of China security forces but they don't know why China would be interested in one outspoken monk.  All these events seem to tie back to Kita Tekenobo, an expert in martial arts who wants the scroll destroyed.  At an isolated gathering, all the principal players come together but not all of them will leave alive.  DESHI is a fascinating thriller that gives readers an in-depth look at those who practice the martial arts and how mysticism plays a role in the making of a warrior.  The protagonist has been tutored by his sensei for many years yet still realizes he has a lot to learn especially how the interaction of eastern philosophy and mysticism creates warriors.  The plight of Tibet and the Chinese attempts to destroy Buddhism and the monks who practice it add depth to this creative work of suspense.  Harriet Klausner 
 A Jules Vernes classic, this is one of those novels that has stood up well against the test of time.  True, there are some items that may seem a bit dated, and of course the whole scenario of the fantastic adventure to the depths of the earth is impossible.  Yet, this novel is still a joy to read.  With a stoic Icelander as their guide, a renowned professor and his reluctant and skeptical nephew descend into the depths of a volcano in the vast frozen tundra of the Arctic, as the adventurers attempt to retrace the steps of a renowned alchemist.  Contrary to popular belief (and scientific reality), the party descends deeper into the bowels of the earth, which is remarkably of a mild climate and not a boiling inferno.  I won't serve as spoiler, but sufficed to say, that they uncover vast new worlds and creatures living in the subterranean world hundreds of miles beneath the terrestrial crust of the earth.  Vernes does attempt to make their descent seem plausible from a scientific standpoint.  Their instruments, a crude electric light and others, would be considered state-of-the art for their time.  Vernes also goes in great detail to describe the geological formations and fossilized remains contained in the earth.  Vernes also attempts to explain how it is possible to travel so far under the surface of the earth without increased pressure harming the body.  And if you take Verne's theories to heart (although modern science refutes them), their journey is plausible.  However, I do have a couple minor gripes.  Vernes goes into great detail describing fossils and rock formations, which no doubt lend scientific credence to his novel.  Although this may interst a geologist or paleontologist, the rest of the masses (myself included) probably find this too tedious and distracting from the main story line.  Also, there is one glaring scientific discrepancy with Vernes logic. During their rapid ascent (the details I won't reveal), the adventurers would have surely perished from decompression sickness (a.k.a., "the bends").  Although it was still a new phenomena at the time, I believe Vernes should have taken into account the rapid change in pressure, as he did during their slow descent into the abyss.  The nitpicking aside, this is a superb novel that has withstood the test of time.  A modern reader will no doubt be entertained and enthralled at Verne's vision of a subterranean world.  Nearly a century and a half later, Vernes' works still inspire awe and imagination 
 This is a great book to bring back long-since forgotten memories as well as add a whole new dimension to the natural coolness of living in the trees, literally. Not recommended for the lazy person 
 To me, as a developer, Bob Martin's "Agile Software Development" deserved the first WOW! As a manager, Jim Highsmith's "Agile Software Development Ecosystems" merited that WOW again 
 The material is presented in a way that will help medical writers understand clinical trials more fully, and answer questions that come while writing 
 At $ 3.99 a copy you can't go wrong. I found this in the bargain bin at a local bookstore and thought I was in an absinthe delirium. The brilliant beginning of avant-garde theatre. Don't miss it 
 I have read a number of Deavers books and he always keeps me in suspense until the end of the book.   I would definitely recommend this book and put it up there with Michael Connely, James Patterson and other such authors.   I thoroughly enjoyed this book 
 As I read this book,  I remembered back to when I was a child. The very first time I read this book I was filled with anxiety. I always told my mom to get to the end because I really wanted to see what the dogs were up to. This book has a various amount of imagination inside of it. I recomend that parents should read this book to their children.  Parker 
 Despite the very obvious issues with overdubbing, this is a GREAT release form the sisters. An album after being absent for 14 years?! What more can any Clark fan expect. I'm surprised to see contributions from Karen and Dorinda in terms of writing. Since Twinkie has been writing the music for 30 years, I figured that the case would be the same. What a nice surprise. Karen and Dorinda are both great song writers. 
 I read this book, quickly, in California. I bought a copy and read it again, in Idaho. I am now buying copies and giving them to my friends, and particularly to my enemies, and to everyone literate. This book contains gems, nuggets, pearls on every page. It is too good to believe, too good to describe. Just read it. And near the end, make certain you have a box of kleenex at hand.  
 The Wailin' Jennys are simply remarkable.  I hear them on A Prairie Home Companion and fell in love!  I immediately went to Amazon and purchased both cds they had available, and literally have not been able to stop listening to them for the last 4 weeks.  I have highly suggested them to several friends, of whom 5 of them went out and purchased both cds after hearing mine.  In fact, I think I'll purchase one more of each to send my sister for her upcoming birthday.  Their harmony is remarkable!  My new favorite albums and favorite singers.  I haven't heard a group blend so well together as these three in a long time.  Usually you purchase an album where you like two or three songs.  On both albums, 40 Days and Firecracker, every song is perfect.  It also doesn't help that all of them are really HOT!  : )  Get both albums.  You won't be disappointed!  Look at me, I'm writing a review and I never write reviews 
 I really enjoyed reading this book, even if at times the author did seem a bit lofty. It was funny and gave a nice peek into some of the mannerisms in Japan. Though there were a few slow areas of the book, for the most part, it flowed nicely 
 This is a great bio of a great company.  Though it is somewhat dated, this book will set the standard for every deep inquiry into how McDonald's operates.  It is simply a remarkable story.  In 1954, salesman Ray Kroc had traveled from Chicago to San Bernardino, California to visit a local restaurant, which was called "McDonald's Famous Hamburgers".  Its owners had bought 8 of his Multimixers; with five spindles, he calculated, those Multimixers could churn out 40 milkshakes every few minutes.  Why, he wondered, did they need so many?  Arriving just prior to the restaurant's opening, Kroc parked his car outside, and waited for customers to arrive.  What he saw left him thunderstruck:  it was like an assembly line for food that was affordable, good-tasting, and fast.  The restaurant was also very clean, the service friendly.  Kroc spent that evening with the owner-creators of restaurant, Mac and Dick McDonald, discussing the mechanics of their system.  The following day, with a business plan in his mind, Kroc secured the exclusive right from the McDonald brothers to franchise their fast-food system in the U.S.  Irrepressibly optimistic, Kroc was 52 and a veteran of several ventures in the food industry.   McDonald's was not the first fast-food restaurant chain:  there was A&W Root Beer, Dairy Queen, and scores of others.  Each depended on the use of the automobile, in which suburban families could travel to obtain a convenient and inexpensive meal in a clean setting.  As part of the contract with the McDonald brothers, Kroc had agreed to follow the basic model of their original restaurant, though changes could be approved in writing.  (That would prove an enormous problem later on.)  Where Kroc differed from his competitors was in the franchise system that he created.  His approach was long-term, based on what he judged to be equitable relationships with suppliers and the owner/operators of McDonald's franchises. Not seeking to make a quick profit, he charged relatively lower startup fees from carefully selected franchisees.  Kroc's business model included:  1) A gradual, restaurant-by-restaurant expansion to maintain control over restaurant standards and design; 2) Owner/operators who were expected to act as local entrepreneurs and were directly involved in the management of the individual restaurant; 3) The development of supplier relationships based on trust and the promise of future growth together; 4) A relentless focus on experimentation to enhance operational efficiency; 5) Consistent training and monitoring of personnel to maintain the company's philosophy of QSC&V (quality, service, cleanliness, and value).  Profits of the McDonald's chain came as a direct percentage of its franchisees' gross sales.   While certain aspects of the model were tweaked - from the early 1960s, corporate revenues came to be based largely on leasing fees from franchisees on McDonald's property - Kroc's basic structure and practices survived.   As Kroc wrote:  "My belief was that I had to help the individual operator succeed...His success would insure my success."  The same logic applied to his suppliers.     For their part, McDonald's competitors tended to treat their franchisees like captive customers rather than trusted partners.  For example, Dairy Queen and Tastee Freeze became suppliers to their franchisees, forcing them to buy equipment and other products at a profit for the corporate offices, in effect creating a structural conflict of interest.  Not only did this divert the attention of the central headquarters from maintaining the quality and operational efficiency of their restaurants, but it frequently led to price gouging for less than optimal equipment, which undermined the loyalty of franchisees over the long term.  Moreover, they sold "territorial franchises" for huge initial profits to local businessmen, relinquishing control over large geographical areas, which often led to the neglect of standards and brand consistency.  Finally, their relations with outside suppliers tended to be short-term, based more on cost savings than on quality or innovation within the system.   Over time, the McDonald's chain grew up as a kind of ecosystem or coalition of partners, in which the interests of its members - the central headquarters, the owner/operators, and the suppliers - coincided over the long term.  Suppliers were also encouraged to innovate:  to perfect the pre-frozen french fry, for example, Fred Simplot invested over $3.5 million (!) of his own funds; as a reward (upon success), the Simplot Company grew into the world's largest supplier of potato products.   In the same way, it was owner/operators who invented some of the most popular new menu items, including the Big Mac, the Filet-O-Fish sandwich, and the Egg McMuffin, which eventually were offered in all McDonald's restaurants.   Unfortunately, the book does not go much beyond this promising beginning.  While this made for a cohesive system that was self-reinforcing and -improving, it also complicated the task of managing it from the national headquarters of the McDonald's Corporation.  For any new policy, McDonald's execs have to convince franchisees and suppliers that it is in their interest to implement it.  As the saying goes, "if it doesn't happen in the restaurants, it doesn't happen."  For years, the company reacted to outside pressures, though this is now changing with new proactive policies.  Furthermore, as McDonald's grew into the world's largest restaurant chain and indeed into a cultural force, it became a lightening rod for criticism.  The accusations of activists have taken a heavy toll on the McDonald's brand.  For example, McDonald's had become a specific target of anti-globalist vandalism during the 1999 meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle.  Other critics included Jose Bove, the organic farmer who achieved world renown for his role in the destruction of a McDonald's restaurant in the French countryside.  Finally, for many the moniker "Mc" had become synonymous not only with low quality and cheapness, but also with the American form of capitalism.  This represents a reversal of the wholesome, family-oriented image that the company had long nurtured.  The company is struggling to deal with these challenges to its brand at the moment.  Even more important, the company's strategy for growth - just planting more and more restaurants - has ceased to function as well as it used to:  there are too many McDo outlets so they compete with eachother in addition to other brands.  Now, the company is attempting to attract new customers and get old ones to buy more at each visit.  While this is working with menu changes for healthier fare (which mothers, many of whom did not like the old menu, feel good about buying when they come with their kids) these issues represent major challenge for the future, in particular the distrust of the brand that has become almost visceral.  Nonetheless, this book covers the basics, to about the mid 1980s, with genuine excellence.  It is well written and does not pull too many punches though it was authorised by the company.

 Richard does another excellent job describing the seven levels of consciousness model and how this framework can be used to effectively measure an organization's culture.  This process provides a values-based approach within a whole system perspective.  Regardless of the status of an organziation's cultural health, this whole system approach provides the opportunity to integrate where an organization is (its current strengths, opportunities, systems and resources) and provides a map to get to where the organization wants to be.  A great book that helps make sense of the complexity of organizational culture and how to improve it.  Nice work 
 These were very soft and comfortable, they feel great and keep my ankles warm 
 I wasn't even shopping for a T-shirt reconstruction book at the bookstore last night.  In fact, I didn't expect to be interested in this book because when I browsed through Generation T before, the projects didn't seem all that compelling to me.  However, with every page-turn, I saw a different project in Tease that I would love to try.  Some of the ideas were completely new to me; some offered ways to execute ideas I've been chewing on for a while; some seemed pretty standard but still helpful in their instructions.  I love the different ideas for lining cuffs and collars, and one of the shirts I hope to do soon is the one with the crocheted bits, not to mention the T-shirt button-down and some of the totes and the Marilyn shirt for some easy, fast gratification.  I bought the book and stayed awake thinking of the projects I would work on the next day if I didn't have to go to work.  I can't wait to begin breathing new life into my old T-shirts and plundering Good Will for more project Ts 
 This is a simply marvelous book: well written, interesting, and informative. Prof. Kelly is that rara avis, an academic who can write. I highly recommend this book to the operatic newcomer and professional alike 
 I first viewed this version when it came out in 1985. I was enthralled by it then and still love it today (I have a well-worn VHS copy from the tv.) It brings the story to life in a way that no other attempts have achieved.  A few friends and I have been searching for this version for ages and are thrilled to have finally found it. It's strange, but I would almost place this particular "Alice" into the cult classic category. Children and adults alike will completely fall in love with this classic, I'm sure 
 a tremendous work of explaining the imagery found in the bible.  The range of subjects are vast in scope.  A must have reference resource for serious bible study.  Goes a long way towards helping one to understand the various levels and ways that symbolic and picturesque meaning is used and construed in the bible.  Deals with individual concepts, broad ranging themes, people, places, books of the bible, events and more.  Top notch resource!! 
 This book had a lot of technical stuff, but I still really enjoyed it.  I'm more excited by the new book by Osama Bin Laden's mistress, Kola Boof--"Diary of a Lost Girl".  I've read an advance copy and it was absolutely stunning.  I think her portrait of Bin Laden and his inside world should be widely discussed by the Bin Laden experts.  She really shows a new side of him and his friends and family.  I just found it so fascinating and detailed and marvelously written.  
      Anyone working on cognitive systems will want this book in their library.  In reviewing THE EMOTION MACHINE there are two lines of criticism that seem important.  Firstly, with the behaviorists I would argue that introspection is both frequently inaccurate and unscientific.  Secondly, and more significantly, most of Minsky's theories have not been developed to the level of detail needed in order to formulate  actual algorithms.  (To be fair there is Riecken's  "M system" (in SOFTWARE AGENTS, J. M. Bradshaw, Ed., MIT Press, 1997) and Singh's thesis (EM-ONE, PhD  thesis, MIT, June 2005) which are at least a start in  that direction.)      On the positive side I am in general agreement with Minsky that thought can be decomposed into subroutines like:    remembering (search)    generalization    comparison    explanation    deduction    organization    induction    classification    concept formation    image manipulation    feature detection    analogy    compression    simulation    value assessment My list appears in Asa H: A hierarchical architecture  for software agents (Transactions of the Kansas  Academy of Science, vol. 109, No. 3/4, 2006). Minsky calls these "ways to think" and a partial list appears on pages 226-228 of THE EMOTION MACHINE. My own Asa H software uses exactly these mechanisms but my architecture is not nearly as complex as what Minsky is looking for. 
 I don't understand how people could complain about this book being too complex, poorly-written, or poorly organized. Everything is presented clearly and logically, and the case studies are relevant and interesting. I found it simple to read, informative, enlightening, and actually fun for the most part. My only criticism is that the authors don't, in my opinion, give an entirely neutral treatment of some of the politically-charged issues raised in their book. It seemed as though they would sometimes more heavliy emphasize one point of view (their point of view, quite obviously) over others. 
 I just love every book that Danielle Steel has wrote but this one always stands out to me, for some reason this has always been my favorite, this book had me in tears, really draws you in, its great 
 I have always liked Rod Stewart, right from the early days. My collection includes a couple of the Jeff Beck albums that include his vocals, and Rod's Gasoline Alley is another of my old favorites. Then of course we all know the Middle Period Rod of songs like "Sailing", "This Old Heart of Mine" and "I Don't Want to Talk About It".  However, I also love these songs, I love Sinatra, Bennett, Fitzgerald, and the great singers of the classic American songbook era, so I was a bit apprehensive about what Rod might do with these songs.  So what is the verdict? My first impression was that this album was more soporific than anything, but it has grown on me. I would never, ever claim that Rod's version of any of these songs is the definitive version of the song, or that the arrangements grab you by the throat, but it IS nice to listen to, more as background music than anything. I guess, if you really  want to get precise, you could say this music is more about mood than about emotion. Does Rod's treatment of this material match up to singers like Sinatra or Fitzgerald? Absolutely not, but that is OK.   The main target audience is no doubt existing fans of Rod Stewart who (like me) are reaching their mature years.   However, this would be a good background music album for any office or public setting, because it is hard to think it could offend anyone. It would also do well as music for a cocktail party or a seductive dinner(if there is still such a thing). It makes nice late night driving music as long as you don't need something to arouse you, and in fact it is good all round late night listening.  Not bad at all.  It would make a fine Christmas gift that would give many people lots of pleasure 
 I bought this book some years ago and let it languish on my bookshelves.  But this is a book to read and *do*.  There's no way you could read this book and do the exercises without changing your life.  Maisel is my hero because when he gets an idea for a book he actually writes the book.  He's written lots of good books but this one is my favourite 
 Oh my God! This is truly a book that needs to book on the book shelves of every school library and in the hands of all teachers, whether they teach european history(plagarized african history) or are an african american studies teacher! Every parent also needs to add this to their book shelves and teach their children what the system won't! Don't be blind anyomore and stand up and take your place as the Pharoahs and Queens that we ARE! I have already begun and recommend that you do the same. Mr. Browder's daughter, Atlantis Browder, also has a chilren's book, for beginning, that is a good basis to start your children off with, I did! You feel betrayed for not being taught this in school, I know I did! Peace My Pharoahs and Queens of the World 
 I first saw this movie around 1980, when the Cold War was still on. I had been inundated with propaganda from birth, that all Russians talked about was political, that they didn't do "normal" things or live a normal life. All politics you know. Well, here was this movie about the lives and loves of three women. It was very well acted, and basically, just a long soap! I loved it--and not one word about Lenin, Marx, or anti-Americanisms. I recently saw it again, and liked it just as much. For those who say it is unrealistic--well, how do you know? Do you think that all Russians lived the exact same life? Or because American Cold War propaganda stated that all Russians were totally miserable 
 Even the "B side" material on this CD is mostly top-notch early 90s alt rock. This album is just bursting all over with manic psychedelic energy--in some ways quite similar to Bob Mould's early 90s band, Sugar, yet with its own unique flavor. Ned's is not as famous as some of the other punk-influenced bands of the era, but this CD is worth listening to many times over 
 Catherine Clinton's biography of Harriet Tubman is a major addition to the American historical corpus. She has fully and magnificently brought to life for adults a woman who before now generally resided in children's books and half-remembered stories from elementary school. Harriet Tubman was an amazing woman and a pivotal figure in antebellum American history; Clinton has produced a biography worthy of its subject. It is eminently readable, well-researched, and deserves to stand alongside her other books, including her fascinating works on Fanny Kemble 
 The music of Hildegard Von Bingen is, without question, some of the most important we have from the Middle Ages. This album has a very capable set of performances by Anonymous 4, but the drawback is the very sameness of sound to each and every track. Yes, they sing well, but where is the variety of timbre? Where are the percussion instruments that have been used in other recordings and performances of these works? They could have used some help from some men's voices, too. Otherwise, it's perfectly recorded, but with repeat listenings becomes more trying 
 Of all the classic Lee "Scratch" Perry produced albums of the '70s (i.e., Junior Murvins' "Police and Thieves," Max Romeo's "War Inna Babylon"), this is hands down the best.  Believe all the hype you're reading in all the reviews on this site.  Cedric Myton's angelic falsetto, Roy Johnson's vibrant tenor, and Scratch's insane, towering production (is that the "Reggae Cow" I hear?) join together to produce an epic work.  Are you skeptical when you hear me use the term "epic" when describing a reggae CD?  Listen and you will understand.  This CD is 100% essential.  As an addendum, if this whets your appetite for more Scratch Perry, it would pay for you to track down a copy of Perry's close-second best title, the Upsetter's "Super Ape" which is, inexpicably, out of print at the time of this writing 
 This is the first Danielle Steel book i have ever read. Honestly, I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed the moving and emotional plot that Steel created in this novel, Johnny Angel. At the begining of the story it is learned that Johnny Peterson is an athletic, smart, well rounded highschool boy. Not to far into the story Johnny, his girlfriend, and a few friends are in a car accident. Not just any car accident, they were on their way to the prom, and Johnny was the driver. He is instantly killed and his whole family is devestated. This was the peak of my tears. Throughout the story, as a reader, I found myself laughing to the extreme, or crying to the extreme. This was a point where I was in tears. Now, Johnny's mother is left alone to deal with her 2nd child who is mute, her 3rd child who is dying for attention, and her alcoholic husband. As little time passes, Johnny's mother finds herself in the hospital because she has been starving herself. After a day of being in the hospital, she sees an Angel. She communicates with this Angel and realizes it is her beloved son, Johnny. He tells her that he is her Angel, and he is there to guide her and help her overcome her struggles. Johnny puts a lot of effort into bringing order back into everyones lives. He wants everyone to go about their lives and only remember the great memories of his life. However, he is having a hard time doing this, ecspecially while watching over his girlfriend. Danielle Steel does an amazing job showing the true reltionship that a mother and a son have, she illistrates the grieving and the healing process in such an understandable way, where you find yourself nodding and agreeing with the charcters emotions. Steel brings the reader a very emotional reading, which is why I say it is a book that women and girls will specifcally enjoy. Although it is not very realistic, the issues and relationships that are presented are very real. The emotions, the experiances and the morals are all very genuine and relatable. I really loved this book and think other girls my age will too. 
 I would like to congratulate the author Michael Schmalz on writing a book that is actually beneficial to a great number of Office users who have to manually integrate data between programs.  In the book's preface, Mr Schmalz explains his experience and how he came to write this book. If you are like me, you often read an Access book and find that many authors write based upon theory not practice and only serves to whet my curiosity. I then ponder the question I know this can be done, but how?      In any event, I am sure that everyone who reads this book will find helpful information and ideas in all twelve chapters. At this time, you can sample chapter three in .pdf format available at:  http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/integratingea/index.html 
 I have attempted reading several books on how to organize my life or home in the hope that I would become more organized. In all honesty I have never finished any of the books due to them being too time consuming and boring. Not so with "The Well Ordered Office" it was very easy to read from beginning to end. I loved that each chapter although very informative was kept short and to the point.   Dr. Kendall -Tackett has managed to cover every issue of having a more efficient office. Many of the things that she has written about in this book are practical techniques that can be used in your home office. As a matter of fact this book motivated me to organize my home office as soon as I finished reading it.   I highly recommend "The Well Ordered Office" to anyone looking for a book that will be quick, entertaining and full of fresh new ideas about organizing your office.  
 I strongly recommend Dr. Lewis's book.  It helped me take charge of my infertility issues.  I followed the book closely, starting about two years ago.  I changed my diet, did acupuncture for more than a year (with a great acupuncturist) took herbs through my acupuncturist (in between the western treatments I was trying) and just persisted despite the hard statistics (will be 40 soon).  I also did hypnotherapy, and yoga.  And even though my endocrinologist kept telling me I had a low ovarian response, I continued my regimen.  I am convinced that in addition to the different IVF protocol that my endocrinologist tried with me (twice), Dr. Lewis' suggestions were instrumental in helping me to conceive.  I now have a 6-month-old beautiful baby boy!  So thank you so much Dr. Lewis.  
 Though this story of colonial Connecticut was first published in 1958 it is still a wonderful story for middle school aged students.  Kit makes a spunky attractive heroine and the story illustrates colonial customs, beliefs and conflicts.  And there is plenty of both adventure and romance to please all readers.  A Newbery medal winner that really deserves the honor 
 In a time when our own children are shooting their classmates to relieve their sense of isolation, this book is a must.  By a Nobel Prize winner, it is a study of youth's disaffection and how it is created by that youthful tendency toward idealism - idealism that is often simply idealism against society instead of for something - and class differences.  Although it takes place in a particularly drifting and disrupted time and place, those years after the second world war in Europe, it seems pretty topical. The events of this book not only can happen, they do happen.   For writer's this book is fascinating as well.  It is written in an almost anti-modern third person. One that is fully  omniscient and dryly reportorial.  And yet, that distance is the what allows us to fully understand the inner and outer lives of the characters.  It's brilliant. 
 "Independence Day" made Martina a Super-Star, but after listening to this album many times, my favorite is "That Wasn't Me", a true masterpiece 
 It's a good book. There really is no room to be Agnostic during times of emotional crisis. The unconditional love needed during these times might only come from God himself. Who knows? I gave the book only 4 stars because during her recovery, she still lacked empathy, a prerequisite for love. Maybe this proves one can never be 'recovered' but rather 'in recovery' which is a life long journey. Again, I don't know. If you don't have a conscience, can you grow one after years of therapy? Again, I don't know. I have a lot of questions fellow book readers 
 I just love our snack trap cups!  My 19 month old has been using them for 4 or 5 months and enjoys "doing it himself".  They're great for shopping, driving, or anywhere!  ABSOLUTELY NO SPILLS!  Highly reccommend this product!  -Happy mom of 1 so fa 
 I had always admired Sadaharu Oh from afar as a kid, simply because I knew that he put up incredible home run totals every year while playing only 130 games a season in Japan.  After I read this book, I became a huge fan...both of Oh the ballplayer and Oh the man.  If you're a baseball fan, you'll find what you like.  He was, after all a ballplayer, and a great one who deserves to be in Cooperstown.  His is a great story, and there's a single chapter devoted to the unique batting style that changed him from disappointment to superstar.  I've monkeyed around using his flamingo-style batting stance, and I can tell you it added 25-50 feet to my own hits...and I'm no ballplayer.  It works.  More important, though, is that this book shows what a truly class act Oh-san is.  Although he became the greatest home run hitter in world baseball history, he remained very humble and gave credit to hard work and the guidance of others for his success.  There is no Barry Bonds in this man.  He is truly worthy of being called a "hero," and that's a word I almost never use.  Get this book!!!  I have three copies of it myself, and would never part with any of them.  It is one of the best and most uplifting autobiographies I've ever read on anyone, in or out of sports 
 I really like this book and am glad that I bought it. It has lots of useful ideas for me and I'll be paying close attention to Mr Strauss's suggestions. I've also recently read Untapped Wealth Discovered by Jeff Marquis and Kerry Harrison and this book is extremely different, refreshing, and brings a new approach to the business world. I like this book too and strongly recommend that if you've recently lost your job then read it 
 Very pretty and comfortable. Vanity Fair is my favorite brand for sleepwear 
 Check the company's website. They select & cook their tuna differently, and that's what makes their tuna the best. It has the lowest possible mercury (same as salmon and much lower than regular tuna) plus they cook it only once, after it's canned, so all the healthy vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids are still there in the can! Plus, Amazon has it for a great price 
 The book was well written, interesting, and informative.  Color plates depicting Wyeth's paintings were bright and clear. The book arrived timely and in excellent condition.  Well satisfied.  
 Without a doubt, the finest collection of essays on V.W.'s essays.  The editors are to be commended.  This is not for everyone, but for the true scholar, this is extremely fine work -- particularly the first half of the introduction 
 An engaging and well-written account of the famous biologist's intellectual development from his early to his mature years and most important achievements. Nice discussions of some of his most interesting and important ideas punctuate this history. For example, there's a good section on the origin and development of his ecological ideas and the theory of island biogeography. Wilson is always a cautious but careful writer and thinker, but in a couple of the sections, he gets at least a little bit speculative and is all the more entertaining for it. For example, his discussion of the innateness of our fear of spiders and snakes is entertaining (Wilson himself is very phobic about spiders). Equally entertaining is the section where he discusses people's preference for a particular type of environment or ecology (subalpine or montane foothills parkland or partially wooded savannah with some lakes). Wilson attributes this to it being the environment where we originally evolved. Overall it counts as one of the best scientific biographies I've ever read 
 This movie falls on my list of unusual war films like "Apocalypse Now" and "The Thin Red Line".  I enjoyed both of those films, and I think it's safe to say that if you enjoyed both of those "Jarhead" is worth checking out.  Visually this film is astounding.  The cinematography captures beautiful desert vistas, the horror of burning oil fields and black rain, and the endless flow of time.  Costumes, special effects and sound effects are also top notch, putting you in the period and in war itself.  I also enjoyed the music selections from the early 90's.  Not only did they fit the scenes, but they brought me back to those years.  The score was also noteworthy creating a kind of dreamlike ambient mood (much like the score from "The Thin Red Line")  The acting was excellent all around.  Jake Gyllenhaal has a difficult part, creating a soldier who has been trained to kill, and is not allowed to do his job.  Gyllenhaal lets his anger seethe, and boil under the surface.  We can almost taste his frustration, and feel bad for him.  At the same time he's a frightening figure; his intense need to kill almost coming across as psychotic.  Peter Sarsgaard is always good, bringing more depth to parts that seem to be surface only.  He gives Troy added dimensions.  His confrontation with the Major at the end of the film is expected and yet explosive at the same time.  Jamie Foxx turns in a good performance.  His part is by the book, but his charisma and skill make it memorable.  The supporting cast measures up just as well; but in the end this is Gyllenhaal's movie.  The script and direction are what will make or break this movie for viewers.  If you go in expecting a traditional war film, with plenty of action and heroics, you'll end up disappointed.  This movie takes a very personal view of a unique aspect of modern war.  It's a character study more than a war film.  It is more thematic than plot centric.  The theme is about frustration and boredom.  It takes guts to make a film about these topics, and Sam Mendes does the best he can.  In the end "Jarhead" is an excellent film, but not an enjoyable one.  It takes the right frame of mind to get into it and absorb it.  Those looking for action thrills will be disappointed.  Those looking for a meditation on one man's experience of the Gulf War will be rewarded 
 Another reviewer here states that the "Big Bang" as the "beginning of the Universe" has "pretty much been proven by scientists"......what nonsense! The "Big Bang" is ONLY a constructed "MODEL" - an attempt to explain what the human organism PERCIEVES as "reality", it is NOT proven by any means, and neither is Evolution. This other reviewer states that the only people who don't buy into the "Big Bang" are crack-brained Fundamentalists. Well, I invite you to consider visting "stangrist.com" and once there, click on the yellow "Library" icon halfway down the page. When in the Library, click on the Topic "Giant Human Remains" at the top of the Archive list. Read the whole article - its short, but shocking - and THEN consider the "Big Bang", Evolution, and what people have been PROGRAMMED to "believe" and what is true. Then, for more "proof" of the Vedic position, read "The Holographic Universe" and "Mysticism and the New Physics" and see how out-to-lunch the whole "Big Bang"/Evolution cult is.  This is a good book to ponder over after you've absorbed the above-mentioned information because its content will have much more profound impact and make much more sense than if you don't have the proper back-up in the form of well-documented information from sources that don't beat the same dead horse, so to speak 
 In this 1957 film directed by Akira Kurosawa, Lord Washizu (Toshiro Mifune) and Lord Miki (Akira Kubo) encounter a spirit in a maze-like forest that prophesies great things for the two comrades: the former will someday rule the imposing Spider's Web Castle and the latter will take his friend's position as commander of the First Fortress. Even beyond that, the spirit predicts that Miki's son will one day succeed Washizu as the master of Spider's Web Castle. Although the two men are initially reluctant to trust the spirit's words, preliminary parts of the prophecy come to pass, thus setting into motion a bloody chain of events that explores the differences between active and passive destiny. Lady Asaji (Isuzu Yamada), Washizu's scheming wife, prods her husband to seize the reigns of power at any cost. She insists that Washizu's only restraint is his own ambition and that heaven itself had preordained his rise.  Here, of course, is where the trouble begins. Asaji is initially convinced of the legitimacy of the spirit's words and points out to her husband that without his doing anything, part of the prophecy had come to pass. She then declares that Washizu must take the next step of killing the Great Lord in order to fulfill his destiny. And yet there is an obvious question that arises at this point...Miki's son, skeptical of the prospect of his succession to the throne of Spider's Web Castle, tells his father that the spirit's prophecy is only coming true because he and Washizu took it upon themselves to make it so; was it fate or was it a series of man-made coincidences? Asaji paradoxically takes both views as she becomes enraged at the thought of Miki's son and his posterity being the ones to benefit most from Washizu's deeds. Now discounting the inevitability of the spirit's words, Asaji demands that Washizu put an end to Miki and his son to clear the way for their own unborn child. Will Washizu trust the spirit and remain passive or will he actively take matters into his own hand? Will he succeed in rebuffing the spirit and shaping his own destiny or will he fail and fulfill the prophecy anyway?  The film itself is excellently done (it doesn't get much better than Mifune and Kurosawa working together) and as with most Criterion Collection DVDs, this one is filled with extras. My favorite feature is the two separate English-language subtitlings. The first is a bit more literary and not quite as literal (I'm so clever sometimes). The second is more conservative and stays closer to a truly accurate translation. Compare these sentences: "he has imbibed too freely" as opposed to "he has had too much wine." Because this is a period drama, the first feels more appropriate to me, especially since the status-based honorifics of Japanese culture (-san, -sama, -dono, etc.) generally lend themselves to older modes of the English language when translating them. The more lyrical translation can be a bit much at times, however, so I can certainly understand why someone would be inclined to prefer the more accurate one.  Though I was not particularly enthusiastic about the price-tag of this film, I was satisfied with the results. Highly recommended to all those with a penchant for high quality cinema 
 This is a good book for anyone interested in the aspects of environmental science related more to the preservation of animals. It presented facts with an informative and optimistic tone, focusing on what can be done to help endangered species as opposed to what wasn't done. It is very easy to read, the style making it accessible those who aren't scholars. 
 Even if you're only dreaming of a Jamaican vacation, this Bob Marley album should be a part of your play list.  Who knows? Your music choice might just inspire that lotto win, and then off you go to Mo Bay and Ochie, sunning yourself (with sunscreen on of course) and sipping rum-laced drinks in Paradise....but I digress.  Brother Bob has many other great songs, but to the credit of this album, they've picked some of the best - a great selection to start you on your reggae explosion.  The next step would be "Songs of Freedom", which is a four disc set, but by then you'd already be hooked on Bob.  If you've ventured into the water to watch "Shark Tale", you would have heard Sean Paul and Ziggy Marley doing their version of "Three Little Birds", the original of which is right here on this album.  And if you thought that "I Shot the Sheriff" was an Eric Clapton thing - think again.  Songs like "Stir It Up", "Buffalo Soldier" and "Jammin'" are guaranteed to have you up and skanking in no time (no relation to "skanky" which is a bad thing) and the slower and insightful "No Woman, No Cry", "Waiting in Vain" and "Redemption Song" will have you quietly contemplating your tropical island dream.  See you in Jamaica mon - irie?  Amanda Richards, November 17, 2004 
 this one i think is pretty good, much better than ''weird revolution'' this one got me into the butthole surfers  12 albums ago. not their best but still a good album 
 This book is one of a kind....brilliant, great, adventurous, a classic.  Words do not describe it.  Isherwood lays evertything on the table.  He shows all his cards.  This is one of the most exciting books I've ever read.  I'm a college student and I skipped all of the ten thousand other books I have to read in order to read this one.  It was not a waste of time.  Once you get into this book it's a blast.  The best part is following Isherwood across Europe.  If you want the definitive feeling about the Modern Era read this book.  You will get to know such characters as EM Forster, W.H. Auden, and Virginia Woolfe.....Gee, ever heard of them?  This is the last great classic Isherwood wrote.  I was so entranced by the words that I stayed up all night to finnish it.  It's defintiely on my all time favorite list 
 I redid my review (now July 2006) after your 50:50 votes on helpfulness.  I think you needed more content to the review and less ebullience.  So here it is...  In the interim, I have read other treatments of Gödel's proof (including the Dover book of Gödel's article itself also with an introduction, Beyond Numeracy, The Advent of the Algorithm [ref below], and several others).  What stands out in THIS book, though, is the extreme thoroughness of explaining to you the context in which Gödel was working at the time.  This book is unique in its dedication to getting you to a concrete understanding of -- and appreciation for -- the background and context.  In fact making sure you get the context appreciation takes up about 2/3rd's of the book!  Of course the book is thorough on the Proof itself too.  Is that part easy?  No, it's still not.  But you won't be left at all vague on what the proof is like.  The only other book that is as good on the CONTEXT of Gödel's proof is The Advent of the Algorithm.  The Advent of the Algorithm is also excellent on how others took, and "ran-with", Gödel's results.  As for which edition of this book (Gödel's Proof) to get, the new addition has Hofstaddter's introduction.  That intro adds value for sentimentality (if you should so find his story about his reading the book and his subsequent friendship with Nagel) and Hofstadter's own ebullience, but the book is virtually identical otherwise with its 1959 edition.  It would be perfectly good -- you'll miss nothing -- if you bought a cheap 1959 edition.  For a good complimentary book, get also The Advent of the Algorithm by David Berlinski (2000) ISBN 0 15 100338 6 or ISBN 0 15 601391 6 (pbk).  You can read my review on that book too if you like 
 Theodora and Kevin return from their honeymoon with more than trinkets for the family and Theodora can't eat chocolate.  What is a newlywed to do?  I have read all of the books in this series and I must honestly say that I have enjoyed all of them.  I think that each book gets better partly because you know the characters.  Everyone is up to their usual antics and there is hilarity that ensues as a result along with lessons for the characters.  It was also good to see Digger return briefly.  Of course, we are left with a slight cliffhanger which lets me know that there will probably be another book which I will happily buy when it comes out.  
 This is the second book in the series, _A Princess of Mars_ being the first. I like this one better. Again, John Carter astral-travels to Mars, and instantly finds himself in a battle with the plant men, alongside his old friend Tars Tarkas. A new  resourceful female character, is introduced. Surprisingly, Burroughs does a hatchet-job on fanatical mass religion and corrupt priests, which is something I didn't expect in an action-adventure novel [...]. Burroughs is generally an adequate, workman-like writer, but, boy, could he tell a story! This book is just one action-packed adventure after another. And even though Burroughs wrote most of his Mars novels right around 1912, they still hold up today 
 "We live in the flicker."  Need I say any more?  As much meaning as can be packed into just over 100 pages.  Best read in a quiet place with a good bottle of red wine at your side.  Not for the weak of mind or heart. Be prepared to discover.  
 Envy is a flat-out hilarious movie. Ben Stiller and Jack Black play off of each other perfectly, and Christopher Walken is absolute comic genius - you'll be quoting his lines for days after you see this, I assure you. That is, if you *have* a sense of humor, which some people evidently don't.  The plot has already been detailed by several other reviewers - Jack Black gets rich from his Vapoorize invention, and Ben Stiller (his best friend and neighbor) drives himself crazy with envy, to the point where he loses his job, shoots Jack's prized horse Corky with a bow and arrow, and befriends The J-Man (Walken), which is a whole other kettle of fish.  The problem people seem to be having with this movie is that it doesn't fit into their perfect little definition of what a comedy should be - well, that's just too bad. Envy marches to the beat of its own quirky drummer, and if you lighten up and stop trying to analyze the movie critically, you'll enjoy it for what it is - a silly, simple comedy with likeable characters and instantly-memorizable dialogue.   Have Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Christopher Walken all appeared in "better" movies than this one? Sure, but that doesn't mean that this movie is bad. It's a shame that Envy has received such poor reviews, as I find it to be a feel-good movie that one can enjoy many times over, and as such it has become something of a classic in my group of friends.   The soundtrack is also excellent - completely odd songs which perfectly match the movie, including the marvelous use of the traditional "Happy Wanderer" song during the scene in which Stiller and Walken attempt to get rid of Corky's body.  If you're still unsure, go ahead and rent this. But I'm willing to bet that if you have a lighthearted sense of humor, you'll end up buying it anyway :) I highly recommend this movie 
 When MADAME BOVARY first appeared in bookstores in 1857, Parisian readers were shocked by the realism that Gustave Flaubert pictured in the very ordinary life of a heroine who was guilty only in not being able to control her overarching desire to be more than what she was.   These readers were not quite sure whether Flaubert was romanticizing the life of an immoral upward climber or was demonstrating the inevitability of her fall.   In the opening chapter when we first see the young Charles Bovary, Emma's future husband, entering school as a painfully shy boy, he is instantly made fun of by the other boys who take great fun in ridiculing him in a manner that foreshadows a similar debasement by Emma. Charles grows into an adult version of his childhood self, a basically decent but totally clueless man who is a marital train wreck waiting to happen. That wreck is Emma Rouault, a young and pretty girl whose views on love and marriage, which come from trashy novels of romance are, in their own way, based on the same non-existent foundation as are his.  Charles' first wife dies, leaving him to marry a girl that sees in him the answer to her dreams of romantic adolescent foolishness.  These dreams vanish quickly enough, leaving what any bored wife would do in a novel of realism: have an affair. Emma's affairs were shocking enough to an audience that did not like authors to peek under the blanket of smug marital complacency that most French wished to believe was the norm.  Once the shock wore off, they were profoundly depressed over the apparent foolishness of a woman who had such limited aims.  After all, it was not as if Emma had some Grand Design in mind. From Emma's first fling with Rodolphe Boulanger to her last with Leon Dupuis, Emma sought no more than a man who could fill her life with meaning and her purse with francs.  Of course, she got neither. What she did get was a loss of self-respect and a mountain of debt that in the best melodramatic fashion was the impetus for her taking arsenic.  Flaubert was careful not to judge Emma.  In his realistic portrayal of the consequences of boredom mixed with infidelity, Flaubert has created a woman whose name even now rings with false dreams. 
 I hate to exercise, always have. However, this program is amazingly effective. I have used it 3 times over the last 20 years and it has always worked great. Just finished up the basic 6 month program and  can, for the first time in my life, do 3 or 4 one arm pushups with either arm. For me that is almost unbelievable.  Tips to others, don't get too enthuastic. Do only what the book suggest and no more. Don't hurt yourself, don't get fit and drop the program for something more aggressive. Both were reasons I stopped using the program in the past.  The best exercise is one that the person can keep up with and make part of his/her lifestyle. I know no better program than the one in this book. I recommend it highly 
 Short Circuit has to be one of my favorite childhood movies. Back then I didn't even understand most of the keypoints in the movie or a lot of the dialog. I love it more each time I watch it. It's one of those movies you just grow up loving. Even though it's old, and you can tell, you'll still be entertained greatly by the lovable robot Jhonny 5, and his great robot personality. It gives you a good feeling when you finish watching, and leaves you smiling.  I bought both Short Circuit 1 and 2 from Amazon and am very happy I did. Both were in excellent condition and very fairly priced. I was so surprised to find both in DVD form at all. So thanks 
 These small Osprey books on various historical events pack in a lot of information and present it in a very easy to understand language that the casual reader may find a good source for research.  David Nicolle is a good historical writer, speaking in plain English and keeping the reader interested.  The material in this particular offering is well balanced.  There are books that have focused on one side of the story, or the other.  Nicolle very successfully attempts to keep both sides focused, discussing the pros and cons of each leader, giving each side to the story and a very well rounded look at the events.  However the book, because of its size, does not go into some of the finer details or "in depth" examination of events and situations that some might be looking for.  To  be honest, these books are not intended for that purpose.  There are volumes out there that you can spend years going through.  This book is meant as an overview of the topic and should be taken as such.  The battles do not go into as much detail as some of the other books put out by Osprey.  The usual focus of these books is to look at a particular historical event or aspect and go into details.  But in choosing a large historical event like The Third Crusade in such a small presentation, there will be a lot left out.  The book focuses on a singular year, 1191, in which the whole Crusade came to a crashing close.  While the lead up to this year is examined, the focus is more on the battles fought that year and how it brought about the end of that era.  And even this is a lot to cover in such a small format.   Not to be left out are the graphics, photographs, maps and the artistic renderings of Christa Hook.  These elements are included to keep the interest of the reader.  There is a lot of photographs to go over, giving the reader an overview of the art, architecture landscape and battle fields of the time.  Christa Hooks paintings give the book a feeling of action, and adds interest to the story.  The maps are valuable and in this book they have included what they label as "3D views" of the particular battlefields.  While interesting, I didn't find it added anything to the overview of the battles.  However, they are nice topographical additions to the book.   Going over this book, I would have to say this will appeal to the school aged reader who is looking to write a book report for school, or augment their studies of the Historical Crusades.  It will even appeal to the casual reader who is curious, but not a serious student of the Crusades.   This is a good look at the cultures of the time, both the Crusaders as well as the forces of Saladin.  Some of the key battles are examined.  And it favors neither side.  We are presented with a fair view of the events.  A good overview and presentation of the material. medievalcrusadesbab 
 Is this the best thing to happen to philosophical studies?  Probably not.  Nevertheless, it is of immense value and relatively inexpensive.  While edited by Mautner I found most of the articles to be quite clear and informative; only a few were laborious.  Mautner even allows a few more "radical" ethicists (wrong word, I know), like Peter Singer to write.  This will throw a few people off (myself included) as Singer sees nothing inherently wrong with killing infants, for example (Singer, p. 522).  Quite frankly, I would not have allowed him to write in the book.  But, you get first-hand what a non-speciest will say on ethics and euthanasia.  This shouldn't tar the book.  It is very clear and useful 
 This book has all the basics and most important things you need to get. It's a book full of all the things that you need to master, and full of great information, and is formatted really nicely. People who are really out to share the good stuff without the fluff. Giving it to you strait really teaching you how to fish for yourself so to speak. Having read many of bandlers great books I would say this is one of the greatest books on NLP/ hypnosis that I have read and give you great understanding about trance phenomena etc. 
 I first read this book when I was begining my teenage experiences. Then I got another copy and read it again recently. I am amazed at the lasting influence this book can produce on an impressionable mind.   It seems Dostoyevski wanted to recreate a modern literary Christ and and  place him in his contemporary Russia and expose the ridiculousness that he felt was blighting his beloved Russia. For this purpose he created a microcosm of Russia of latter part of nineteenth century in his book with characters from all social classes with varying levels of intellegence. This recreation it self would make any lesser book a classic. But this is not all. He places a Christ figure into this turmoil and allow us to observe the mental, emotional and overt social respose it produces.  This book can make an impressionable teenager to embark on a search for Natasyas to rescue and psycho-analyse the strangers he meets on streets to understand their problems and offer them sympathy and help all because he feels Myshkin deserved better in the modern world he tried to help. A must read for anyone interested in assesing the power of writing to change lives.       
 It's a great dvd, but a bit hard for step beginners.  I can do parts one and two, but after that I am spent.  I know that leaves me time to strengthen up but I was looking for something a little easier to start off with.  I suggest watching the warm up and sections a few times before trying them out.  I watched the warm up and section one about 4 times before I tried it out and just started on section 2 today.  I watched the whole tape and you must be pretty fit to go all the way 
 The product i bought was great.  It was here before it was even suppose to be.  Everything was sealed and in tact like the description said. I am 100% satisfied 
 As a Southerner exiled to the frozen tundra of Wisconsin, John Egerton's SOUTHERN FOOD has been food for the soul.  And no matter where you are from, this book offers fascinating historical and cultural information about Southern food and many, many wonderful recipes.  I have learned as much about Southern cooking in Wisconsin as I did in all my years back home, all because of this wonderful book.  It's charming and often lyrical, immensely well-informed, and points the way to both restaurants and recipes.  The barbecue instructions have been a lifesaver.  I have bought five or six copies of this book--one because I wore out the first copy, and the others because it makes a great gift for practically anyone 
 The best of its genre, and the standard in visual identification guides for field work and species' recognition. Almost every item is illustrated with color photographs, though I wish there were more images of each item, for year-round accurate ID. If I could afford to, I'd own the entire publication list of "A Field Guide To...". :-)  I'll share a secret to successful purchasing. I borrow books & titles I'm interested in buying, from local library--this has proven the BEST method for being sure one's needs & expectations are met, especially in non-fiction reference materials. 
 AWESOME BOOK!!!  It is the whole truth and nothing but the truth!  Having a baby is a wonderful thing, but its HARD, and no one is really honest about how hard it is.  This book tells it like it is and allows you to laugh at all those terribly difficult times.  It also helps you realize that you are not alone - most women have felt the same EXACT things you are.  I wish I had read this before having my baby - I wouldn't have been so hard on myself.  I now buy this book for all my pregnant friends.  If you are pregnant or have a newborn (even if its not your first)... you really should read this.  I think you'll love it 
 Its a good cd although not the greatest Blind Guardian has ever done 
 Upon first reading a brief synopsis of this book, I honestly thought it seemed a rather boring story line, especially for a master like Crichton..."A book about turbulence on an airplane?" I thought. It didn't exactly sound "gripping." I was wrong! He never fails to entertain. His works are always thought-provoking, and so well written and researched as to almost make the "unbelievable" seem well within the realm of possibility.  This particular work could IS quite possible. It seems to be a pretty accurate, albeit cynical insider's look at the TV news media.  It reinforces the old saying "Don't believe everything you see on the news. 
 Very interesting book - can't wait to see if it's as straight forward as it appears. The directions are clear and encouraging. Some of the covers are really beautiful. Great value for money and the fabric calculator is very helpful 
 Suzanne Somers has done it again! This book states what I have been telling my patients for the last 8 years, which is that bio-identical hormones do work. Women feel better, look better and are more able to control their lives. Suzanne's book is very readable, and as usual, Ms. Somers is very honest and exceedingly helpful for the menopausal woman.

 I really liked this story and can't wait for the movie to come out. 
 An insane story, made up mainly of character sketches. The audio version is superior to the written format primarily due to the superior performances by the authors.  You do miss out in seeing photos of Stephen Colbert in drag, however, so  you may want to skim through the hardcover version the next time you're at the book store. If you're a fan of Tom Bodet or Garrison Keillor, you'll enjoy this spoof on their type of storytelling 
 Do you have a row of favorites in your collection? This will be one of them. Whether you are a new Christian or come from 10 generations, you will always refers to this classic from Swindoll. Chuck speaks on a variety of topics dealing with perseverance in this game of life. Do you wonder how to cope with stress, patience, loneliness? What does the Bible say about defection from the faith? Is it wrong to be tempted? How do individuals handle a crisis? I've owned this book for over 7 years and I still refer to it when I'm seeking new insight into making the right decisions. Swindoll is a very practical easy to understand pastor and his radio ministry "Insight for Living" is heard all over the world by millions in different languages. He is ranked as one of the most well sought after preachers' right up with none other than Billy Graham 
 I really enjoy this series, it's a great to read while waiting for the next Harry Potter book.  These books are written for younger children, so there is pretty much no thinking involved (always a plus) and it is a breeze to read.  I will admit that it is very much like Harry Potter, but Charlie Bone is a fun read anyway.  The only thing that kept this book from being five stars is the annoying fact that they still haven't got a clue who Charlie's father is.  I haven't read the 4th or 5th one yet, but it is still painstakeingly obvious that Mr. Pilgrim is Charlie's father.  Anyone with half a brain could figure that one out.  Just think about it, and you have to admit that it totally makes sense.  It just bugs me that these people who are always solving all of these other mysteries can't see what is right in front of their noses.  How stupid can you be?  How on earth can you not see that Mr. Pilgrim is Charlie's dad!  AAARRGG!  Another thing that bugs me is the fact that even though the setting for this book is England, no one says any English stuff, like mum or whatever.  They are so American sounding!      And for you harry potter fans out there:                         J.K. Rowling was on a talk show a while back and made a statement that two of the main characters are going to die in the final book.  She also "hinted" that harry would not survive book 7.  Actually, she all but stated harry's imminent death.  She said that it would be a clean way to end the series, and harry's death would also prevent any future harry potter books from different authors.  She also talked about how all great authors kill off the main character and so on and so forth.  I think that the only thing that stooped her from making it official was the fact that she didn't want to get any hate mail from potter fans, who would be scarred for life by harry potter's death. 
 I loved this book, I vaguely remember these Browns teams as I was only about 10 years old, but I knew how much they meant to people around me.  Reading this enable me to learn how this team connected with the city and how much heartbreak there was.  I couldn't pt the book down wanting to relive everybit of the history 
 When Struggle Surrounds You, When Life Seems Uncertain, In the End there is...Nothing To Fear   
 This is yet another fantastic book from James Patterson. A real page turner. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes Patterson's books or even to those who have just started looking for a great thriller to read. Patterson has a way of grabbing ahold of you. Laur 
 Line by Line: How to Improve Your Own Writing is a classic, and with good reason. If you like words like "gerund" and "prepositional phrase," Line by Line has a lot to offer. Specific instructions on how to tell if a sentence is wordy, for instance, even if you don't have an "ear" for it, include such factors as the ratio of nouns to active verbs, and how many prepositional phrases are used. Examples throughout the book soften, but do not eliminate, the academic style. If you prefer something in plain English, read the excellent Woe Is I, by Patricia T. O'Conner.

 This was a good book. Very well written and enjoyable. I look forward to reading more from this author 
 This is easily my favorite cyberpunk novel, for several reasons:   The plot line is interesting and not simplistic. Another reviewer wrote that it was hard to follow. I disagree, and thought that the interweaved story telling added quite a bit and made it a much more interesting story.  The references to the golem stories, and for those who have studied them, the related ethical dilemmas are quite interesting.  Marge Piercy is a great writer. You won't find places where you trip over sentences, or struggle with flat characters.  The primary character is female, and I find that adds a lot to the perspective. 
 The fact remains that this book offers a very solid and accurately researched survey of the development of the "phenomenon" of devotion to Mary, the mother of Jesus. It is not exhaustive by any means, but traces all the major strains of development from at least the third century. What the book fails to do adequately is critically delve into the real roots of Marian themes as found in the New Testament records. Indeed, what we see in the very first century of the Christian/Biblical era is a rather rapid (and radical) development of attitudes about the Mother of Jesus, a shift from early indifference and ignorance of Mary's role (the Marcan Gospel, Pauline letters) to an outright "lifting up" of Mary as the Ideal Christian, the First True Disciple, worthy of loud praise (Luke), and even iconic status as Eve-Israel 'Mother of believers'(John) and glorified symbol of the Church itself (Revelation). I wish Werner had spent more time drawing attention to how swift and startling these developments in the understanding of Mary were when the New Testament writings were being composed. Also, how did these "arcs of thought" regarding Mary take root geographically in the 2nd century church? Werner could have noted that it was no coincidence that Gospel communities giving great prominence to the figure of Mary(Luke's Antioch, the Johannine churches) in the first century continued to preserve these emphases in the 2nd (Ignatius of Anioch, Irenaeus-Justin, etc). Otherwise, Werner gives a solid depiction of how formative ecclesiastical motives (asceticism, Christological controversy) rattled the chains of Mary's rather flexible image in the patristic age, and how her mystique lent itself so readily to mythical, legendary rumblings about her death, intercessory powers, etc. A fascinating handbook and not even remotely [a] feminist manifesto ... It seems that some would have a hard time handling the reality that much of what Mary represents was a complex combination of iconic mythologizing that began in Scriptural/Apostolic times and only grew in succeeding centuries according to the demands of the age and normal human piety 
 This cd grabbed me hard and hasn't let go.  It's been way over a year now and I STILL am mesmerized by it.  One reviewer said that 20 years from now this would still be talked about and revered.  Indeed.  Innovative, and Panda and Avery should have their pictures in the dictionary beside the word.  It's powerful and soulful and sweet.  And definitely not for everybody.  "Feels" is also good, but "Sung Tongs" is the best thing I've heard in at least 10 years.  'Mouth Wooed Her' is exceptional and is my favorite cut 
 I love the Mummy Series, and this HD Transfer of the Mummy Returns is all I could have hoped for and more. This is what HD is all about the visuals on this transfer are cracking and the sound pumps too, if you enjoy this movie as much as me and have HD buy this as its about as close as your going to get to perfect! A must have for showing off you HD TV and HD Player!! 
 I have completed the enlightening task of reading Witchcraft Medicine and this tome of knowledge will be invaluable to my research and spiritual evolution!  Bewildering numbers of herbs and deities are discussed, as is the history of the strategic demonization and persecution of herbal healers. Cannabis and other sacred sacraments are related to the gods and to historic texts throughout the book, including many wood-cuttings and even color photography. The author's have a tendency to describe in great detail some artwork that didn't make it into the book. I assume the problem was copyright law.  Thank the gods this book was translated into English! The Great Mother Goddess is likely pleased 
 If you are in business or are thinking about going into business, this book is a must. No matter what else you know or think you know, these core concepts are the keys to success. Real examples from real life with real meaning. And Betsy Sanders has a way of making it understandable and simple 
 I really enjoyed reading this book but, as a parent of two children with Asperger's Syndrome, a form of high-functioning autism, it seemed obvious to me, at least from reading the description of David in this book, that David  also must be on the autism spectrum. His behavior is text book Asperger's--mono-monomoniacal focus on one subject, high intelligence but not doing well in school, lack of social skills and, most telling, his inability to understand the possible dangers in what he was doing.   According the the book, David' father did have him tested for ADD--and the person doing the testing said that he didn't have ADD--and he didn't know what was wrong with him. Too bad someone didn't!  Rather than treating David like a freak and a criminal, (and writing about him the way the author of this book did) the adults around David should've been more tuned in to David and gotten him some help. 
 This is the book "Christmas with the Kranks" was based on.  This was a surprisingly enjoyable, cute read about Christmas and the desire to skip it all together, and avoid the mega-hype for a year.  Totally different from anything Grisham has written, as far as I know.  Short and sweet, you'll smile along, laugh and relax while reading this book 
 While I often work out in the gym using a treadmile I do occasionally run outdoors and I will do more outdoors as the weather in MN improves as we move into spring and summer. What I really like about the 305 is its ability to track what I do outdoors using the GPS (location / distance / heart rate), and indoors on the treadmill using using the foot pod (purchased separately) and then upload the data to my PC so that I can track my progress (and for the outdoor runs see on a map where I went). It's very encouraging as I lose weigh and gain stamina to actually see how my heart rate is now lower with higher levels of exercise, and how my average speed is increasing as well. I also like being able to always monitor my heart rate - which while I'm running outdoors is important for me to know as I don't want to exceed the maximum rate for my age (and before I got this unit I wasn't sure how close I was getting). So the combination of all these things makes this a winner for me. The only downside I've found so far is that I'd rather see my speed in MPH vs. my pace in min/mile but that's pretty minor. Also you can't display maps on the 305, just show the track of where you have been. I wasn't expecting to be able to load maps so this was not a take away for me, I just wanted to mention this for other potential buyers 
 Bill Sweet manages to give you a feel for the idealistic and tragic story of the Klingbiels, two Christian Science believers who decided to attempt rigorous field tests of prayer. Sweet's love for the protagonists allows him to treat their foibles, moments of inspiration, and occasional discouragement with a gentle hand.  The story is well presented but not an "easy read"; the topic is so personal and the story so engaging you'll want to digest it slowly. Buy the book and take a few days to consider ot carefully 
 Cary Grant was a Great actor with countless memorable films. Although that this film is not amongst his very best, it is a fun movie with a good plot that may be watch by the whole family with pleasure. It is a war comedy with kids in main roles and one may see some Disney influence. But Grant offers us  one of his typical (in a good sence) perfomance that wilkl satisfy his funs. Enjoy it 
 Now I've actually ENJOYED (in fact REALLY ENJOYED)both Operation Hell Gate and Veto Power, finding Veto Power to be my favorite of the book series so far.  They're not the best, like all prequels, sequels (AKA inbetweenquels) are.  But they still fit into the series of 24.  For continuity's sake, OHG takes place BEFORE 9/11, while if you read Veto Power in the beginning you will see that months have passed and now 9/11 has passed and Jack has been temporarily demoted.  Makes sense to me.  I have no doubt that Trojan Horse, the next Declassified will take place a little more into the future coming further closer to the time when Day I (Season I) of 24 takes place.  The struggle of Jack panicking makes sense to me.  If you read the book, Jack constantly finds a lead only to be further confused with what actually happens as the day progresses.  We've seen Jack unsure of himself before in the series, especially Day I - but we have never (I repeat, NEVER) have seen jack give up during the day, whether it's been on TV, in a comic, the books, and most liekly the Game as well.  Jack's first scenes in Day II are debatable of course, but I'm refering to Jack while "in the zone."  Bad way to say it, but I beleive you get what I'm saying.  For real nerds of the series, we find out who was President before David Palmer, a pitiful man named Harold Barnes.  Just to remind you - David's opponent Governor Hodges in Day I was his opponent in the PRIMARIES.  We have to assume that Barnes chose not to run or couldn't run due to two terms.  Knowing there are a total of SIX Declassifieds planned to come out, I am curious how they will fit in the "24 Canon" where major fans know that the two books wriiten so far take place before Day I, but AFTER Operation Nightfall, an event in Jack's life that only took place two years before.  Could ALL six Declassifieds take place before Day I?  Mind you, 24: One Shot, one of the three comics take place in this time period as well, so this little slot is beginning to feel cramp.  In the end I would really enjoy if the book series is scattered around the 24 Canon:  Some before Day I, a few between Days II & III, maybe a few after Day III but before Day IV . . . it's all the author's decision!  And so far I am really pleased with what's come so far 
 My son and I loved the book.  It was great to have so many favorites compiled into one collection, and we loved the stories behind the stories 
 The Life of Pi is one of the most intellectually stimulating books that you will find anywhere.  It weaves an amazing story that makes you think about what really matters in life.  It all starts with Piscine Molitor, a boy whose dad owns a zoo.  He has special connections with the animals there and he has interesting points of view about the animal's lives in their exhibits.  One day, his parents decide to move to Canada and Piscine is not happy.  `What is there to do in Canada?', he wonders.  Nonetheless, his parents load up all of the zoo animals that they cannot trade or sell onto a large ship and they set off for Canada.  Along the way, though, the boat encounters serious problems and it sinks.  Piscine makes it off the ship alive and makes it to a lifeboat, but its inhabitants are not the type of company that you want in the middle of the ocean.  They consist of a fully grown Bengal tiger, hyena, zebra, and orangutan.  I think this point is where the story starts to kick into gear.  The action that ensues is intense and very hard to read, but it is brutally honest and life-like.  This may sound a bit clichï¿½, but the details of Piscine's life on the boat made you feel like you were right there with him, experiencing the highs and lows of every day aboard the boat with him.  The story goes on with surprising twists and I think the ending is absolutely fabulous, but I'll leave that for you to decide.  This is probably the greatest book I have ever read and I highly recommend it to anyone 
 Daddy Day Care is a family movie must have.  Eddie Murphy shares nice clean comdey for the whol family.  It's perfect for younger childrens slumberparties too, because it's so light and hilarious that it'll make it easier for some kids to forget that they're away from there parents.  It really works too 
 Jive Bunny "The Album" contains the original hits, it's a really great party record, it gets people up and dancing.  The editing of old rock and roll hits (original versions) is very clever and appeals to all ages.  Any 'Jive Bunny' records released on the Atlantic / ATCO label are the original hits.  However, I recently purchased "The very best of Jive Bunny" on the Music Club label which, although it uses the same formula, does not have the same impact because it is not made from the original hits.  Beware. 
 For people like me, books like this are a great benefit. I'm not a philosopher, but I frequently run across references to ancient philosophers in my reading. At the same time, reading pre-digested summaries or histories is usually not as interesting or challenging as reading extended, essential exerpts first-hand. "Geek and Roman Philosophers After Aristotle" covers Hellenistic philosophy from ca.322 BCE to ca.300 CE. The book is divided into six sections: I.Epicureanism, II.Stoicism, III.Skepticism, IV.Philo of Alexandria, V.Plotinus, and VI.Early Christian Thought. There is a 12-page general introduction, and a short introduction for each of the six sections. Jason Saunders lets the philosophers speak for themselves, sometimes at length, particularly Lucretius, Philo and Plotinus. The book may seem to some to be overly Christian, but that's at least partly why I wanted it. The translations vary from the classic (McKenna) to clunky antiques, but as noted above, it's a handy, concise, 360-page collection, so my thumb is up 
 Reading this book gave me a reasonably educated understanding of the sociological, historical causes for the differing views among nations on guns, gun control, self-defense and the government's role in the lives of its people.  The last three chapters on the U.S. explain a lot about our sense of individualism and the roots of our proud gun tradition.  This is a level presentation of an emotional issue.  It is that lucid proof that all Second Amendment supporters wish they had been able to make and always knew existed, and it is a reasoned argument capable of changing the position of gun control advocates, if read with an open mind 
 If you are a basic sort of person who enjoys plain, down-to-Earth meals, and do not like to spend a lot of time in the kitchen, this book is for you.  Not only does it suggest what basics to stock on your shelves, but the recipes turn out very well if fresh ingredients are used.  One will not be caught off guard when unexpected guests arrive, if you follow the suggestions offered by Hay.  I did, however, find the recipes were not quite as original as anticipated.  Many are variations of recipes found in other similar cookbooks, particularly the Asian noodles; however, the recipes are still tasty and the book will be particularly valuable to those inexperienced in the kitchen 
 OK, first of all, "GangstaLawya" seems to not be taking into account the fine work of Kepler, Newton, and Einstein when he suggests that we "remain agnostic" on the issue of heliocentrism. True, Copernicus himself does not excactly refute Ptolemy here (he actually was more worried about how other astronomers and Protestant theologians would react to his heliocentric system than how the Catholic church would see it... and his model wasn't fully accepted until over a hundred years after his death), but this model was later augmented by Kepler and Newton to the point where it does work better than Ptolemy's. And with all due respect, the Ptolmaic system is extremely convoluted, needlessly complicated, and downright ugly at times... so even if there's a simpler way of looking at things that works just as well, that's still a conceptial improvement. Occam's razor, y'know?   But I digress. As with most of my reviews of books like this, my concern isn't necessarily the actual book (which is usually self-evidently worthwhile), but with the presentation. I must say that it's a little awkward to see Stephen Hawking's name appear on the cover in larger type than Copernicus' and not get anything more than a very short introduction by him that doesn't say very much. In fact, there is not very much of a difference between this edition and the one published by Prometheus Books; the text is exactly the same and contains all the same diagrams. The cover is flashier (and says "Stephen Hawking!") and the type is cleaner. That's it. Those are the only real differences. In fact, the only reason I can see for this edition existing is Running Press (and Stephen Hawking) making a few bucks.  Despite all this, there isn't really anything here that detracts from the work. So basically, you can buy this copy or the Prometheus Books edtion and it won't matter; you'll get pretty much the same thing and pay pretty much the same price either way. I'll leave it up to you whether you want the flashy cover (complete with Stephen Hawking's name on it) or the plain one because that's really about as deep as the choice goes.  
 The earth is surrounded by a sinister presence - a dark, foul fog that is the tool of an ultimate evil - whose ambition is to enslave the planet with the complete removal of free will. Three magical beings, Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who and Mrs Which - witches, angels, demigods perhaps - appear to Margaret and Charles Wallace Murry and their friend, Calvin O'Keefe, to persuade them that it is their destiny to battle this evil on its own turf and to rescue Margaret and Charles Wallace's father. Dr Murry has been missing for some months and the kids learn that he has been captured by the evil while he was "tessering", traveling time and space in the course of his scientific research.  While the writing is straightforward, well crafted and obviously aimed at a younger audience, "A Wrinkle in Time" is nonetheless a fast paced enjoyable tale of good vs evil that combines elements of science fiction, fantasy and magic even adult readers will flip through relentlessly. But there are lots of life lessons, issues and moral themes sprinkled throughout - low hanging fruit just waiting for the eager child, the observant questioning teen, the confused parent or thinking adult to pick and chew on, as it were - the coming of age realization that parents are not infallible; the cruelty of malicious gossip; God and evil; the awkwardness of romantic adolescent relationships; the potential destructiveness of pride or vanity; the marginalizing of people who are different; the enormous difficulties of selflessness; the understanding that all life's questions will not be answered; and more.  While some readers criticize "A Wrinkle in Time" as being overtly moralist, I felt somewhat differently. It was clear to me that religion and, in particular, Christian symbolism was present but I felt that L'Engle let it sit quietly just beneath the surface and the story never became even remotely preachy.  It is little wonder that "A Wrinkle in Time" has been elevated to the status of children's classic and continues to be enjoyed by adults and children alike more than 40 years after it was first published for a grateful reading world.

 In this book, Hawking definitely succeeds at making one understand the very complex side of physics. I chose it in the hope of understanding Einstein's theory of relativity and black holes, the latter of which he describes well and the former of which he names often but does not explain. I found that although everything he mentions is fascinating and totally mind-boggling (such as the make-up of what we thought were indivisible atoms, the difference between real and virtual particles and waves, and his discussions of space-time and singularities and the expansion of the universe), many times it is not well-written  and can take a while to decipher, although the diagrams and other illstrations are, for the most part, pretty helpful. One thing that I found particularly annoying was his constant assertion of credibility - "... a position that Isaac Newton once held, and which is now my own ..." - we all know how ingenius Hawking is, its part of why we chose to read the book, right?  As the heading to this review implies, the book is gripping in a few parts but, in most, it requires a large amount of determination and a "want-to-know." If you're not interested in physics and astronomy and essential theory without proof (which can be quite frustrating), this book is not for you. But if you're looking for a better understanding of the when, where, how, why of the universe, I'd say give it a shot - you may enjoy it 
 "The fog comes on little cat feet.  It sits looking over the harbor and city on silent haunches and then move on." ~Fog, Carl Sandburg  100 Best-Loved Poems presents poems from the Middle Ages to the 20th Century. The poets are all familiar, but the poems are more varied and quite a few are poems I'd never read before. In a compilation like this, you'd imagine to find quite a few familiar favorites from high school or college and those did appear throughout.   There is comfort in reading poems we tried to understand in school, but didn't have the emotional maturity to fully digest. Now upon reflection, how could we have truly understood "To His Coy Mistress" at 16, a poem born of mature desire. Now nearing forty, I feel I can linger in these poems enjoying every nuance.   This classic collection includes brief introductions to each poet and includes some information on poetic forms. In the section of Ballads, you can hear the singsong rhymes as you read so the first poem was a good choice.   The poets include: Lord Randal, Sir Patrick Spens, Sir Thomas Wyatt, Christopher Marlowe, William Shakespeare, Thomas Nashe, John Donne, Ben Jonson, Robert Herrick, George Herbert, Edmund Waller, John Milton, Richard Lovelace, Andrew Marvell, Henry Vaughan, Thomas Gray, William Blake, Robert Burns, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Leigh Hunt, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, William Cullen Bryant, John Keats Ralph Waldo Emerson, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, John Greenleaf Whittier, Edgar Allan Poe, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Robert Browning, Walt Whitman, Matthew Arnold, George Meredith, Emily Dickinson, Christina Rossetti, Lewis Carroll, Thomas Hardy, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Robert Louis Stevenson, A.E. Housman, Rudyard Kipling, William Butler Yeats, Edwin Arlington Robinson, Robert Frost, Carl Sandburg, Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams, Ezra Pound, Marianne Moore, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Wilfred Owen, E.E. Cummings, W.H. Auden and Dylan Thomas.   While the poems are not overly culturally diverse and seem to focus on English and American poets, there is a wonderful early translation for "The River-Merchant's Wife: A letter." It was fun to find "The Tyger" by William Blake and Lewis Carroll's "Jabberwocky" makes a little more sense to me now. "Ode on a Grecian Urn" makes more sense when you can see a picture. Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Ozymandias" is a reminder of time's destructive powers and William Wordsworth's "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud" speaks of the human condition and the way we connect with nature. William Butler Yeats has a different take on age in "When You Are Old." He speaks more of appreciation than destruction.   "For oft, when on my couch I lie In vacant or in pensive mood, They flash upon that inward eye Which is the bliss of solitude; And then my heart with pleasure fills,  And dances with the daffodils."  ~I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud, William Wordsworth   The selections by Emily Dickinson are playful and they made me want to read more of her poems. There are quite a few life lesson poems that are profound in content, like "If-" by Rudyard Kipling, where he speaks of what it takes to me a man. Robert Frost also presents intriguing notions and life choices in his "The Road Not Taken."   This collection offers recollections of poetry you may remember and introduces quite a few poems that are less familiar. John Donne's Holy Sonnet XIV was new to me, although I had read Holy Sonnet X..."Death be not proud..."As far as romance goes, Ben Johnson's "To Celia" stands out as does Robert Burns' "A Red, Red Rose."   100 Best-Loved Poems is a lovely classic collection and it is nice to have all these poems in one book for future contemplation. I will have to agree with everyone else who made comment as to the lack of cultural variety. For this, you may want to seek out poetry collections by Sam Hamill. For me, this was an inexpensive way to expand my poetry knowledge and to remember some of the poems I learned in high school and college.   "The woods are lovely, dark and deep. But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep."  ~Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening, Robert Frost  ~The Rebecca Review  
 Cisco IP Communications Express: CallManager Express with Cisco Unity Express (ISBN 1-58705-180-X) is an all-in-one resource for configuring, managing, and troubleshooting the Cisco CallManager Express (CME) solution. It is almost 900 pages and is well organized into five parts: overview, feature operation and applications, administration and management, maintenance and troubleshooting, and appendices. If you are involved in configuring or maintaining the Cisco CallManger Express, this book will provide you with all the information you need to get your work done.  Cisco CME is an integrated solution offered by Cisco for meeting the IP telephony needs of small businesses or branch offices. The CME solution, which consists of the call processing feature and the voice mail feature, runs on the Cisco routers ranging from the 1700 series to the 3700 series and beyond. Whereas the CallManager suite offers centralized approach to building out an enterprise wide VoIP network, the CME is meant to serve the needs of smaller businesses or to integrate seamlessly into the larger, enterprise solution.   The book is well written and starts out with a high level architecture of the deployment scenarios for CME. The second part gets into the features and applications side of the solution. This part is where the crux of the book lies. It presents a detailed coverage of the commands used to configure the CallManager solution under various scenarios such as implementing different call features, integrating VoIP with PSTN, and deploying CME as part of a larger CallManager solution. This part presents a thorough coverage of Unity Express (UE), the voicemail module of the CME. The third part relates to the management of CME. Particularly useful in this part is a real-life configuration example as it illustrates and brings together a lot of the material covered in the earlier part of the book. Part four gets into the essential topic of troubleshooting the CME solution. It provides useful tips and solutions for common problems found in deploying the call processing and voice mail aspects of CME. This is definitely a very useful section of the book. The last part, the appendices, has reference materials and scripts used in the book to make daily tasks easier etc.  One of the strong points of the book is a multitude of sample configurations. The authors provide sample configurations throughout the book to help illustrate the concepts being presented. This sample configuration goes a long way if the reader has the task of actually configuring CME. The other strong point of the book is the depth of coverage given to each topic that is discussed. With the exception of a handful of topics (one in particular which I'll mention), the book never glosses over any topic; rather it covers it in detail, ensuring that most aspects of the topic are addressed. The exception to this was the coverage of the D/A module(s) used for attaching analog devices to CME, such as a fax machine. Given that analog fax machines still constitute a critical part of any business, I would expect this topic to be covered in detail. However, I found that no configuration examples were provided on how to configure this in the CME suite.   In summary, this book is a great all-in-one reference for configuring and managing CME. I would highly recommend it to any professional tasked with working on Cisco's CallManager Express. 
 This book is great! I am half way through and I have already learned tons of stuff.   What I really like is that it's totally written for the guitar.  Everything is related to the guitar with neck diagrams and tab so it's really easy to understand.  It has total application to the guitar.  It covers all the basics, and goes beyond.  It makes learning music theory fun. 
 Excellent compilation, sensitive performances by a still-brilliant selection of artists presenting a fine range of compositions that are all new to me 
 I am a big Country music fan and I am always looking for new people to listen to. I quite by accident came across the "Lost Trailers" and I have to say I was very pleased with my new find. This new self titled CD is just Great. I can't stop listening to it. It is rare to find a CD that you love ALL the songs on it, but with this one that is exactly what I found. I do have some I may love more than the others. This is a fun up tempo CD. My favorite is the last track- Simple life- has a great message, Why me is another one that tells a powerful story. I can't say enough how much I love this new CD- everyone should give it a try  
 Released in 1982, Prince's hard-driving double album was his first recorded masterwork. "1999" holds up beautifully and features a wealth of terrific music: "Little Red Corvette," "Delirious," "Automatic," "Let's Pretend We're Married," "D.M.S.R." and the apocalyptic title track. Breakthrough rock and funk from one of the medium's few geniuses 
 I'm glad someone came out with a behind the scenes look at Bob Thiele & Co. since I had not known much about him or read his book "What A Wonderful World" that came out a few years back.  The pictures of Van Gelder's studio are beyond words and some of the mini-reviews have inspired me to check out the likes of artists such as Sam Rivers, Pharaoh Sanders and Alice Coltrane.  Even if it lacks any in-depth information about them, it gave me a taste for further investigation.   I guess if you are looking for a musical theory book, or a tome on race relations & guilt trips from the 1960s, then this book isn't for you.  True, the music matters, but this is about a specific record label, not just any specific artists that were on it.  Do a Google search and you will find plenty of other books out there about that.      Besides, if it weren't for the likes of "head white men in charge" (as another reviewer contemptuously put it) like Bob Thiele or Creed Taylor, Impulse would never have happened in the first place.   I consider it a valuable book for a newcomer who wants to be introduced to the subject 
 This book is all about how life changes for all the people that loved Jeremiah after two policemen shoot Jeremiah by accident.  Each chapter is in the eyes of someone who loves him: his girlfriend, Ellie, his mother, Nelia, his father, Norman Roselind, his friends, Carlton and Kennedy, and his grandmother, Desire Viola Roselind, who is no longer alive. 	Jeremiah explains that when you die you become the wind, and you go to each of the people that love you, and you whisper into the wind, "I will always remember you".  Once you have gone to each of the people that loved you, you move on into your next life, but for Jeremiah it's too hard to leave behind the world that he was in before. 	Desire Viola Roselind is now with Jeremiah, because neither of them is living.  Desire Viola Roselind always says that Jeremiah "won't move on" and "he's always looking out on the world".  Desire Viola would also talk about how Jeremiah could do whatever he wanted to.  He could fly to the moon, or swim to the bottom of the ocean.  Desire and Jeremiah could also choose what season they wanted to be in.  Desire would always be sitting in spring, in her lawn chair, surrounded by a beautiful, flower filled, garden.  Jeremiah always sits in the summer in the shade of a tree, holding a basketball. 	Jacqueline Woodson is the author of this beautiful, bittersweet book.  Behind You won the Coretta Scott King Award.  I'm so surprised that there isn't twenty awards on the cover of the book, because of how beautifully Jaqueline Woodson writes.  Here is a passage from Jeremiah's last chapter:  "Ellie. You're loved. Carlton. You're loved Mama. You're loved. Pops. You're loved. And Kennedy...hey, Kennedy...you got game yo! And when each of the people you left behind has heard, you turn slowly, and begin your long slow walk into your new world.  But some every now and then you stop, look behind you.  And remember." 	In this place in the book, I actually did start crying.  Behind You is probably one of the best books I have ever read.  Any book that has the power to make me cry must be an extraordinary book.  This book makes me feel that the people that I have lost aren't gone forever.  I also learned in this book that there is still a lot of racism against blacks, just like Jeremiah.  I learned that if a policeman shoots a black person, they simply end up on desk duty, until things cool down.  	             
 This is a very absorbing read full of adventure and history in parts of the Islamic world I basically knew nothing about before reading this.  My main complaint is that the author who gathered different real stories from explorers books did not write more of the book himself.  His writing was riveting and did great set ups for the chapters which are taken from original accounts by Westerners Americans and Europeans who opened the Muslim regions. It was interesting to read the writings of those who went into the Muslim countries over the last 200 years and see how many of their names were famaliliat, like Lawrence but others, even more exciting I never heard of.  
 Eric B & Rakim changed the whole hip-hop game with Paid in Full and took it to a whole other level with Follow the Leader. The title track "Follow the Leader" is perfection. Let me repeat that again, the title track "Follow the Leader" is PERFECTION. The lyrics and flow are flawless. If your a young buck and just getting into hip-hop. Get yourself a good education and buy this album 
 C. McGhee Livers has done tremendous work in taking the original language from 4,000-year-old Greek & Hebrew texts and researching the semantics & language to reveal the true meaning of important Biblical scriptures.  She introduces her work through vocabulary and geneology lists & a map; and then it is a comprehensive, though highly readable exploration of word usage and sentence structure, with a focus on the Book of Genesis.   Chapters include The Garden of Eden, The Queen of Life, The Fall and Adhaim's Three Sons. Livers begins to bring everything together in The Curse of Cain and the summary contained in God's Word to Black Mankind is actually the penultimate coda. Please do not pass up the final chapter, The Story (Written For Children), which could have easily been an introduction to her work.  Documents do not lie, but the manipulation of interpretation has twisted the real meaning of the Holy Scriptures. Livers delivers a vitally powerful book that provides real meaning to the Bible. 
 I could spend a paragraph or two telling you what the plot/story of this movie is about. Or you could read any one of the hundreds of other reviews for this film, and find out that way. Most of you probably know it by now, as it is. A Few Good Men is on my (and my wife's) list of Top Ten movies of all time....with plenty of good reasons. As it has been said in many other reviews, the acting in this film (from all the supporting actors as well) is excellent. The story is good too....very interesting, actually. It would be easy to look at this movie as simply a "blockbuster" kind of movie....which, essentially, it is. It's got A-list talent in front of, and behind the camera....it made a hell of alot of money at the box office, so yes it's a "blockbuster". But it's also a damn good story, as  mentioned before. Another thing I liked about this movie, was the fact that the writers avoided any romantic involvement between Tom Cruise and Demi Moore's characters....something most other films on this scale would have done. And I know it's been said in many other reviews, but I'm going to say it again anyway....Jack Nicholson really is the cornerstone of this movie. No, not because of that famous "You can't handle the truth...." line. But because his acting really is that good. It seems so natural. His mannerisms are so natural, that he could pass for a real life military leader....I am in the military myself, so I can vouch for this. And even though this movie is over two hours, I was never once bored....you won't be either 
 I thoroughlly enjoyed this book, and learned a great deal about the dark side of American politics and the warfare state in the process. This is one of the best books I have ever read, bar none. The chapters on CIA covert ops are especially informative 
 I received this for my 3 yr old daughter and she absolutely loves it.  The price is great right now, especially with free shipping. She loves to dress the doll and use all the accessories.  More than worth the low price...I'm going to stock up on a few more for misc. gifts.  The package is large and comes with a lot of accessories 
 This pregancy organizer is pretty cool.  It's basically a journal which is a practical thing to have when you start seeking medical care, but I think it will also be a great memory booster later when you wonder how it all went down and you can't quite remember the details anymore.  There are some cool checklists, like what to get for nursery, what to take to hospital, who to call and announce birth, etc.  Pretty good value, cool little keepsake, functional organizer.  I would recommend it regardless of whether you are a fan of the What to Expect books.  It stands alone as a great helper for mom to be 
 I just received Marlene Bagnull's book, Write His Answer, and can't seem to put it down!  Although I am certain about my call to be a Christian writer in my life, I also struggle with feelings of inadequacy.  As a striving young Christian writer, the sound advice and tips from this book along with the sound Scripture references have truly been an answer to prayers.  God used "Write His Answer" to provide a nudge in my own life to take a more active role as a Christian writer.  I recommend this book to any Christian writer 
 I was very skeptical and didn't think it would work. I have been proven very wrong and haven't touched a ciggarette in over 4 weeks! Trevor H. Scott is a miracle worker. I have smoked a pack a day for over 10 years and his cd's helped me say goodbye to smoking forever! I highly suggest this cd set and I am going to purchase his others as well 
 I tend to be very wary of astronomy books.  I enjoy going out at night and looking at the night sky, but don't like to get a whole lot more technical than that.  After having learned to identify some of the constellations,  this book provided me with the perfect next step.  It gives you just enough  background knowledge to make your tour through the sky infinitely more  enjoyable.  The author presents simple and easy to understand information  on both classic and modern constellations.  I would recommend it as the  perfect "not too technical" book about the lore surrounding the  night sky 
 Nobody among the Haight-Ashbury bands came out with a better first album.  Producer Nick Gravenites (Electric Flag, many collaborations with Mike Bloomfield) was a big part of it, and he seemed to be trying here for a hit single.    Although many of their San Francisco compatriates improved in their later efforts, Quicksilver's recorded output went downhill soon after this.  Shady Grove was undisciplined, but Happy Trails caught a bit of their live spark.  Later, sadly, their druggy haze weakened even the efforts of brilliant pianist Nicky Hopkins and great folksinger Dino Valenti.    This album does not get better reviews because it was pretty much a straight ahead power-pop album.  Dino's Song has as good a hook-laden AM radio sound as anything from this era.  Dance and smile!  And check out Cippolina's great tremolo on his chords... 
 This book brought tears to my eyes the first time I read it.  It is warm and comforting.  A wonderful message for children that their mama will always be there no matter what.. 
 This book explains the advantages of investing in DFSS; it emphasizes that stopping at Six Sigma is not good enough because one can not go beyond 5 Sigma. Subir Chowdhury narrates the DFSS process in a very refreshing and anecdotal way. If you like reading stories and upshots, this is the book for you. Prior knowledge of Six Sigma is not required. This book only gives a high-level overview of how DMADV or DMEDDI or IDDOV was applied by a restaurant chain. I would recommend buying another thick book to get all the nitty gritty details like QFD or Robust Design Optimization because the method is as important as the resul 
 Read this book to see how an American writes in  that obtuse French post-modern style. She covers the psybernetic/media territory from 1943 to 1999 the best I've ever seen. Zig-zags from Gregory Bateson & Alan  Turing on to William Gibson and covers the very interesting idea that  "information" probably does not exist like we generally think of  it...a la Franciso Varela.  Most importantly, She retreives Embodiment as  the  fundamental ground of all consciousness..that no feature of  consciousness is ever not physical and even "information"-bits  & bytes on/in the 'Net... cyber"space" is always embodied in  servers/fiber optic lines/memory storage magnetic fields,etc 
 Opeth has never released a bad album, but this is my favorite, as its their heaviest and most melodic.  Mikael Akerfeldt is one of metal's best vocalists, as he can do harsh death metal growls yet sing so beautifully; Mikael's rhythm guitar work is very good, as he plays acoustic as well.  Peter Lindgren's beautiful melodies, heavy riffs and solos are jaw dropping.  Martin Mendez delivers crunchy basslines that add even more heaviness to the guitars.  Martin Lopez's drumming is fast yet melodic, very good drumming.  Here's the song scores:  Wreath:  1000/10 Deliverance:  1000/10 A Fair Judgement:  100/10 For Absent Friends:  100/10 Master's Apprentice:  1000/10 By the Pain I See in Others:  100/10  Score:  3300/60  Like what Eddie said, Opeth cares about quality, not quantity.  There's only six songs but they're all great, and they clock in at over an hour.  Get this instead of a Cold or Mudvayne album! 
 I looked forward to reading this second book in Far Wychwood Mystery series.  I wasn't disappointed.  I must admit however, I thought some of the pretentious dialogue between the characters in this book was a bit much and quite frankly tiresome (a little editing would have helped) However, the storyline itself was delightful.  So happy Catherine decides to stay on in England and not fall back into the arms of her ex-husband.  She is far more interesting on her own.  
 No family should be without this book!  With all the new medications available today it is almost critical to check for side effects, interactions, proper dosages, usages, etc. I get this book every year, and  every year it is so expanded!  I take quite a few meds and most of them  aren't in the older books, even last years edition!  This book is the  "Bible" of prescription drugs!  It lists brand names, generics,  U.S. and Canadian names of all prescription medications, proper dosages,  proper storage, and even recommends foods to avoid while taking certain  medications.  This book may very well save your life one day 
 This is my vote for one of the best greatest hits, best ofs, very best ofs (what EVER you want to call it) collections out there.  Maybe some of the song choices here will raise questions (such as "jealous lover"- a short Clapton-like rocker)  but the thing is, we're talking about a disc that has almost 80 minutes of music here, and I'm not let down at ALL by the choices.  What a flawless collection!  "street of dreams" was the reason I wanted this CD in the first place.  Little did I know at the time that Rainbow was capable of so much more.  I had no idea they were almost a heavy metal band in the 70's, or more specifically, a SPEED rock band.  Those early songs are fast and provide lots of satisfaction for people craving good old-fashioned rock music.  The first half of this collection is dominated with songs like that.    However, the second half of the album is more like "street of dreams".  It's early 80's rock with a much lighter tone and not NEARLY as rockin' and heavy as the first half of this album.  What matters here is if these songs are actually good.  Are they?  Yes, I think so.  You probably remember "I surrender".  It was a big hit back in the day.  You also probably remember "since you've been gone" which is another highlight.    I love every song here, and totally agree with the selection of songs.  Get ready to rock out for the first half of the disc, and just enjoy melodic commercially-appealing songs for the second half.  
 Kirk's book is supposedly the bible of Conservatives. Not neo-conservatives, but Conservatives. He sets up the long standing debate between the French, and Voltaie, and the English, using Burke as it's spokesman Supposedly Kirk would limit the vote, have a professional class of government officials, reduce if not eliminate most taxes, and let each individual strive for success. This is the basic mantra of classical conservatives, and is all well and good as far as it goes, but only a few of the many ever succeed this way. One of the surprises is how young Kirk was when this book was written; it's as if he had some inspiration for on high (probably not), or was cherry picking history (probably closer to the truth).  After reading this book I had a better understanding of where the Conservatives are coming from, althohgh I still don't understand why an obscure Royalist politician from the 18th century should be their flag bearer. Royality as a form of government most likely will never occcur in the US, although we seem to flirt with it from time to time.   Conservatives seem not admit of a meritotocracy, as we currently have in the US: they would rather rely on accidents of birth, cronyism and college organizations to select administrators, rather than people who have succeeded in other venues. A very informative, albeit frightening, book. 
 If you have shot 0-4 weddings then there is plenty of good information.  The book is very detail-oriented around the business aspect of wedding photography along with some coaching around events, shots, etiquette, etc.  So if you are new to digital photography and want to shoot weddings this is a very good resource.  However....  If you are looking for lots of ideas for shots this is one place where the book is adequate but really missing a big opportunity.  For all the 336 pages you get lots of text and relatively slim numbers of photos. If you are looking to shoot a wedding what you need as much as business sense and technique is.... ideas.  Creative ideas are one of the most important things you can have.  And for most of us who do not hallucinate about weddings all the time what you really need to seed your creative juices is lots of photos of what others has done.  In this specific respect this book did miss this opportunity and hence 4 stars instead of 5.  (Twice as many photos would have been the minimum for 5 stars IMHO.)  If you want something to seed your creativity that is slightly better than this book (for concepts) then check out 'The Best of Wedding Photojournalism: Techniques and Images from the Pros' by Bill Hurter 
 I think perhaps the wasteland has been to long interpeted as a lament, our a lecture, or even a statement about disillusioment. To me it seems to be the story of a non commital spiritualist lingering on the edge Nihilism, confused in pain and feeling empty as if no philosophy has prover satisfactory in his thirst for truth. I have known the morbid and dark mindstates Eliot describes, and I think that is what the wasteland is: a portrait of intense mental and spiritual torment, embellished with symbolism and shifting voices. But that is essentialy what it is, though each voice is distinct it seems to me that the torment of one man leaps between changing but always hinting that they are all his. It is in a way a dramatation of the utimate feelings of man between rationalism and Nihilism and hating both. Feeling that they are frauds and that the only truth is in the empty tired nothingness 
 I just wanted to let Miss Angelou know that I really enjoy her books, all of them. But Phenomenal Woman is very important poem to me because it describes what my mother and grandmother are to me and my family and hopeflly one day I will learn to be a phenomenal woman 
 Dolly continues to explore her roots with Blue Grass and it's just fantastic.  Songs like "Sugar Hill" really feel down home while telling the story of teenagers exploring their sexuality with nothing but pure honesty 
 As a co-leader of a  Magdalene Circle, I found this book a wonderfully helpful  guide to developing ways to publicly honor Mary Magdalene as Sacred Complement and Divine Partner.  Siobhan Houston has given us the next step to take after immersing ourselves in study about early Christianity and Mary Magdalene, when we find ourselves wanting to express devotion to Her. Suggested prayers, a nine day devotional practice,and  a July 22 Magdalene Feast Day ritual all serve to bring the devotee into an experience of gnosis of the Divine Feminine Wisdom. The book satisfies both a thirst for knowledge about  Mary Magdalene the women  and a thirst for experiencing the dimension of consciousness where She is available to us all. Accessing this dimension is facilitated by the book's  wonderful CD of guided meditations. Thank you, Siobhan Houston, for creating a bridge upon which deeply intuitive/feeling women can walk again into Christianity.  
 I was required to read this book for a Law Enforcement class I'm taking in  college.  This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  It  offers a great perspective of the police for people who don't know anything  about the police, or only know what they see on television.  I look forward  to reading more of Wambaugh's books in the future 
 Like most people in the business world today, my position entails multiple jobs and responsibilities. One of those is an in-house training program.  Because I have little teaching experience, this was a great book to help me  get started by presenting the basics of everything from classroom set-up to  learning and teaching personalities. Great book for the novice, and gives  great ideas for the old-hatters 
 Let me start by saying that my husband and many of my friends say that I am the most organized person they have ever met. I bought this book after a great review by Mary Hood. This book was worth every penny! Sure, it's just a bunch of forms that someone could easily make, but who wants to when you can have them made for you? Everything is organized into appropriate sections and it all applies to 'real life' homeschooling. I can tell that this product was thoroughly tested before it was marketed. It is very list-oriented, which works great for me. I highly recommend this book to any homeschooler - new or veteran 
 A lot of us are familiar with John Bunyan as the author of The Pilgrim's Progress, whose influence in Christendom is second to the Bible. Bunyan was a preacher, a prolific writer and a shining saint for God. However when we read this book we find out that he was an atheist and infidel in his youth, enjoying sin and rebellious towards God. Inwardly he suffered from tormented nightmares of demons and judgment, but outwardly he went on pretty much as any other sinner, taking delight in sin and being the ringleader of mischief. Several times he nearly lost his life, and even though there were several close calls, still he did not turn to God. After his marriage, he participated in religious activities, went through the motions of attending church and generally lived as he pleased, each time successfully shrugging off pangs of guilt. One day, after church, while playing a sport, a voice seemed to call out to him from heaven to his soul, which said, "Wilt thou leave thy sins and go to heaven, or have thy sins and go to hell?" Bunyan was convinced it was the Lord Jesus looking down on him in displeasure. What follows details his sinking into despair, his desparate attempts at working his way into God's good graces, and his struggles with temptation and doubt. In a strange sort of way, it is comforting to read about Bunyan's struggles and identify with them because you can see how he turned out so greatly used by God. He rationalized, made excuses and tried every way to justify himself. Bunyan did not try to gloss over his motivations but gave an honest account of his struggles from avowed sinner, to religious hypocrite before he was finally converted. He describes in great detail his doubts and despair, his yearning to be converted to Jesus Christ, and then being assured of his salvation by reading the Bible and praying. Reading this book will help you realize how God's grace can abound and save even the most wretched of sinners and gives us abounding hope.   
 In the end, Ry Cooder and 'the boys' of the Beuna Vista Social Club bask in the applause at Carnegie Hall. They found their bliss. This is a great documentary from Mr. Wenders. Cuba is an appropriate backdrop with its faded elegance, its warmhearted, island soul, its waves crashing onto the promenade.   I don't know a word of Spanish but understood the music. This movie is about living a full life, about seeking happiness and joy, about finding your particular bliss and never letting go of it. 
 Like with most short stories, the scenario is fairly simple, and the story itself fairly straight forward.  However, where as many short stories feel, sanitized and polished, this tale comes across as a delightfully gritty piece of work that throws you into one of the most disturbing scenarios imaginable and makes you deal with it.  There are no kid gloves, no mincing of words, just cold hard mortality delivered like a spoonful of bitter medicine.  That might sound like a bad thing to some, but it actually works, and works quite well.  The story may make you cringe, but it's occasionally refreshing to be forced to deal with such concepts, especially when the ideas aren't being toned down for the weak of heart 
 I caught parts of this on PBS last night. It was very interesting to see, they did a good job of cleaning it up. It looked and sounded very good for all it's been through and being 39 years old. At one point I came in halfway through what was I guess the Yoko sitting in w/ John's group part. Makes you hate Yoko that much more. She's screeching through what could have been a cool instrumental piece considering the talent of the musicians in the group. Brian Jones does seem distant and barely there compared to his enthusiasm in the early days. Must have been a little rough to see the band you formed get taken over by Mick and Keith (mainly Mick). He sleeps his way through a couple of the tunes lamely playing the maraccas and staring into space. Definitely captures the swinging London scene of the late '60s. It's always cool to see the young Stones playing, pretty much still during the height of their creativity. And it IS Brian's last public performance with them, that is worth a watch in itself. 
 Perfect for a newborn in winter. These rompers are well constructed, inexpensive, and not too thick to prevent layering under other clothes should the need arise. The Orange and Yellow ones are especially cheerful. I should note that the legs became too short for my son long before the rest of the romper ceased to fit, so if you have a long-legged baby perhaps try a size up 
 Ths is quintessential Firesign Theater!  The wordplays are here - "The Department of Redundancy Department", "The Natural Guard", Ersatz Brothers Coffee - "More coffee, warden?" and then "More coffins, warden?", and being sworn in "Do you promise to covet property, propriety, and not hurt that State? Say what." "What?" "Take your stand."  And much more.   The underlying commentary is there on (Pick one) (a) our consumer society ("Eat, Eat, Eat ..." and "It's good to eat a friend, my friend"), (b) advertising [same thing?] ("Well you can believe me because I am always right and I never lie"), (c) religious fundamentalism ("Where can I find a good upbringing in a Christian environment?" "HERE, friends, right Here! [Pull the curtain, Fred]"), (d) our dependence on drugs ("Anguidrene" and "The chief himself's been on them for a week and he's a changed person"), as well as more.  Then there is the big picture - What is happening in the recording?  Someone is watching TV, and then running off to an Ice Cream truck (while being transformed into a child (again?).  At the end, we find out that _he_ is George Tirebiter when he gets a phone call from his answering service and says 'I've been watching myself on TV all night', and then receives messages that all kinds of old film stars have left.   But while George Tirebiter, who is named for the mythical University of Southern California dog/mascot, is the one who is said to have received the Good Sport Award on TV (while he is watching it, competing in the game show 'Stab from the Past'), he is also somehow related to Porgy Tirebiter in the 'Howl of the Wolf Movie' called High School Madness.    On TV - Fred/Adolph is Porgies ... stepfather(?) but is running for office as George Tirebiter later.  And 'Lieutenant' Tirebiter is in a movie on TV.  Could this be a commentary on being self-absorbed?  As Porgie sums it up "But, Gee, Dad - I still don't understand how you can be the Peoples Prosecutor and my defense lawyer at the same time..."  "Easy, son.  That way I can see that you are persecuted to the fullest extent of the law."  "That's my Dad! 
 I have many books on tactics (mainly including examples to solve: Lein's Sharpen Your Tactics, Hall's Combination challenge, Alburt's Chess tactics, to name a few) but this one really stands out. Unlike mentioned titles (also intended for beginers/improving players), "Understanding chess tactics" really teaches how to spot and introduce particular tactical motifs rather than just "forces" to solve numerous examples without initial clue how to solve them (esp. more difficults ones: x- rays, reloaders, intermediate moves etc). Best if used together with CT ART - see your tactical ability improving instantly. Highly recommended !!!! 
 `Principia Ethica' by the very influential Cambridge philosopher, G. E. Moore may easily be one of the very few philosophical works in English written in the 20th century that is widely known outside circles of professional philosophers. The only other works I suspect can fall into this category are Russell and Whitehead's `Principia Mathematica' and Wittgenstein's `Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus' and `Philosophical Investigations'. Oddly enough these last two works were originally written in German; however their influence has been based almost entirely in the English speaking world of intellect.  Moore was very fond of high faultin Latin names for books. This volume was not named after Russell and Whitehead's work, which was published around 1918, but after Isaac Newton's `Principia Mathematica'. Talk about hubris! Being a major influence on Wittgenstein in his early days at Cambridge, he was also the one who suggested the English name for Wittgenstein's first major philosophical work.  What is so nice about approaching this work is that its primary thesis can be boiled down to a relatively simple statement. Moore is claiming that statements about good and bad cannot be reduced to statements about facts in the physical world. Those philosophers who claim that you can do this are committing `the naturalistic fallacy'  The primary object of Moore's argument is the eminent 19th century British philosopher, John Stewart Mill, whose pamphlet, `Utilitarianism' is one of the four or five most important writings on ethical doctrines, along with Kant's `Groundwork...', Thomas Hobbes `Leviathan', and this work by Moore. Mill's doctrine, refining a cruder statement of Utilitarianism by his mentor, Jeremy Bentham, is that all good must be based on observable pleasure. If there is no way that an action can be traced to the pleasure, it cannot be considered `good'. To be sure, Mill, being an exceptionally smart man, put a lot more into his argument than this statement, but you get the idea from this.  Before Moore, Mill's biggest difficulty was the classic dilemma in ethics between `the right and the good'. In many ways, this is the ethical analogue of the dual nature of light, where sometimes it exhibits wave properties and sometimes it exhibits particle behavior. Before Mill, the greatest proponent of a theory of right and wrong was Immanual Kant, who outlined his ideas in his `Groundwork on the Metaphysics of Morals' and laid out the categorical imperative. Looking at Mills' and Kants' basic principles, you would hardly know they were talking about the same thing, as Mill reduces everything to pleasure while Kant reduces everything to the `good will'.  Moore's writings bring him down squarely in the camp opposing Mill, however, his reasoning may not be too familiar to Kant and Hobbes. Moore was one of the founding fathers of what was to become the `ordinary language' movement in Anglo-American philosophy, which was ultimately to be inspired primarily by the later writings of Ludwig Wittgenstein of Cambridge and John Austin of Oxford. Aside from this `Principia Ethica', Moore's most famous philosophical argument was his defense of common sense when he demonstrated the existence of everyday objects by pointing to first his right fist then his left fist as two examples of real physical objects. One can't appreciate the power of this argument until you try it out in a philosophical argument as I once did in a friend's introductory philosophy class.  Moore's naturalistic fallacy says that all statements about good and bad and right and wrong must, when they are reduced to their basic meaning, involve some irreducible statement(s) about duties and right and wrong. There have been philosophers who build whole careers on extrapolating this analysis to fill several books, as in the case of Oxford's R. M. Hare, writing in mid-century under the influence of Austin and Wittgenstein.  If Moore's argument has any problem at all, it is in having been trivialized by so many writers taking the same tact by turning doctrines they don't like into `fallacies'. Simply saying something is a fallacy may have enormous rhetorical impact, but it has no substance to it. Being accused of committing the `ad hominom' fallacy of attacking the person rather than the position can really destroy a position, since this is so universally accepted as a mistake. On the other hand, very smart people have claimed that all questions of value are reducible to questions of pleasure.  Therefore, Moore must put up a fairly detailed argument to show why Utilitarianism, for one, is wrongheaded because it violates this fallacy, thereby showing that it is, indeed a fallacy.  This is a difficult book to read. It is certainly more difficult to read than the average political polemic, but not quite as difficult as Wittgenstein's principle works or of works by European phenomenologists and existentialists after Nietzsche and Kierkegard.  But it is well worth the effort!   
 If you're relatively new to this genre, you'd probably give this a five. If you've read some, you might lower it to a 3-1/2 or four.  It started strong, introducing similar elements to G.R.R.M's Fire and Ice (the first three books in that series I consider some of the best I've ever read), but then it lost some vigor, or sense of purpose. It lost some sort of spark; the thing that keeps you turning pages when you ought to go to bed.  In spite of that, this is a good series so far, and it's worth your time to read it. Some things the characters do are emotionally puzzling, but that may be explained in future novels

 THIS BOOK IS EASY TO USE AND UNDERSTAND, WHICH I FIND MOST HELPFUL. THE STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS ARE EASY TO FOLLOW AND THE RESULTS ARE AMAZING. I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR EITHER A BEGINNER OR AS A HELPFUL REFRESHER. THE TECHNIQUES ARE PROFESSIONAL AND INFORMATIVE AS YOU GO ALONG. 
 This book contains all you need to know regarding the preparation of a consultancy appraisal.  Alan Weiss is truly the expert when it comes to this.  I will say this, however.  Unless you require the additional "hand holding" contained herein, you can get essentially the same wisdom from his book "Million Dollar Consulting Toolbook".  I agree with another reviewer that if you cannot afford spending a hundred bucks or so to help get your business started, you probably are not adequated capitalized.  However, there is no sense in spending a hundred more than you have to.  If you can afford it, buy this one, if not, get the other one i mentioned 
 Marvelous. Very twisted, slowly captures you in a world that reminds you of those insidious thoughts that you had trapped in a bad history class...and the plot only comes into view in the corner of your eye, but when you try to focus on it.. 
 I've never been a real big Christina fan.  I remember her from the Mickey Mouse Club.  She's always been a great vocalist.  I've thought her music was a little bubble gum to me.  She kind of caught my attention with her Stripped album.  I thought two of the hits from the album were pretty good.  But now...  I must say that I have enjoyed this entire album!!  She's all grown up.  If you like Christina, you won't be disappointed.  If you're not a fan, I recommend you give her another chance.   I really liked her swing style on some of the songs.  Again, A+ for this album.  Hey, I might even go see her in concert now.  :- 
 This book was bought because my hubby lent out Books 1 thru 3 of this series.Since he never got them back, he definitely wanted them replaced!   He is a Stephen King collector! Since all the other books were in hard back, this one was bought as a hardback, to replace the soft cover one.   This series has gotten my 19 year old son, who doesn't like to read, to read. He and my 16 year old avid reader, are having to share, as they are BOTH reading it!  Cudos to Amazon for getting it here so fast, while their interest in the series was still there!  Thanks again,  Jea 
 For many people, the singer's voice is too saccharine, the lyrics too sentimental, the sound too poppy to be considered rock. To which I say: true enough, but I rather like them for it! This album, a long-awaited third effort, would be flawless minus three or four songs that I found superfluous. But the rest ten or so songs make for great listening. Lyrically and sonorically, sentiments like melancholy, hope, and irony are evoked. Vocally and instrumentally, the melodies are damn catchy. The album is brilliantly mixed and has a slight '80s feel - which for me definitely works. (Their talented keyboardist deserves some props!) All in all, a worthy effort 
 "A Walk through the Fire" is the 20th Sharon McCone novel. ...I think this is one of the best of the Sharon McCone novels. Glenna Stanleigh, a friend of McCone's, is filming a documentary on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It appears that someone is trying to sabotage the project and Glenna fears that someone is trying to kill her. She asks McCone to come to Hawaii and investigate. She and her lover, Hy Ripinsky, go to Hawaii. Glenna's project focuses on the Wellbright family, a wealthy family with quite a few dark secrets. Sharon almost becomes involved with helicopter pilot Russ Tanner, and her relationship with Hy is put to the test. This is a different kind of McCone novel. I did miss the San Francisco crew, but all in all I thought this was an excellent novel 
 This is very good information that is to follow.  He has done a good job on focusing on wellness and how to achieve this.  I like most because anyone can do it and it does not take a Doctorate degree to follow.  Thanks for putting this together.

 Unlike all the bad reviews on this doll, I want  to say how wonderful this doll is she does everything it says on the box, I know a lot of people says she doesn't cry but she does it takes a while if your child plays with her a lot and feeds her the right way she will cry, our doll cry's every time my daughter squeezes her hand, even my 8 year old son loves to make her cry, it is over all a great doll my daughter dresses her in different outfits and take her everywhere she goes... 
 I have no idea who Elisabeth Vincentelli is but she has not polled the U.S. on the L Word theme song. My poll of 100 people was 90% loved the theme song and 10% liked it. Hate reviewers that put their opinions in print as fact.   CD is great and if you haven't seen or listened to Betty Rules do yourself and favor and dive into Betty -  
 Really fun to read, great pace and highly entertaining. The thrilling and complex story has great characters and ample twists and turns. I stayed awake for long hours to read the book and the story kept me guessing until the very end. Unfortunately I cannot say that the solution for Web London's misery is completely convincing or really believable for me. Therefore I could not rate the book with the full 5 stars. Nevertheless I really recommend to read the book - you wont regret it 
 I just love this. It is well made, very easy to install. My kitchen is small and I found a need to utilize wall space for storage. I looked at several ideas and this is one of the things I found that not only looks good but takes up little space and keeps all my tools handy. 
 This is a wonderful Bible. It is great for understanding how God's Word is as rellvent today as it was in Old Testment times. I love it. And thanks for the great price.  GOD BLESS, Wand 
 This is a book you should read, and unlike many "should" reads, this one is a real pleasure.  Stephen has taken on a huge task with this book, and almost tries to cover too much ground, but he pulls it off with style and art.  Once you get past the wonderful language and the perceptive viewpoint you will stumble on a scathing and accurate depiction of what mainstream medicine is doing to the environment.  It is a picture that makes "Silent Spring" seem tame in comparison, and the book as a whole will lift you up out of your chair and get you moving to find answers 
 Afternoon Of The Elves is a mysterious book about a girl named Sara Kate who is very poor and has an elf village in her backyard. Sara Kates neighbor Hilary is very curious about the little houses in Sara Kates backyard. During the Story Sara Kate and Hilary become friends.Sara Kates mother is very old. This book is very magical. I reccomend this book to everyone. Dont judge a book by its cover. I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I did 
 I really liked this book. It told me a lot about things that were done back in the 1900's. I believe Bigger Thomas was not looking for trouble, but it always seemed to find him. It was an excellent book. I would definitely recommend this book to others! 
 My, what a little cat fight we have hear. Hisssss 
 This is a wonderful book to use in patterning, multiplication, and  creative thinking!  I use the book in my classroom in so many ways, with  children up to third grade!  We read it, then make up our own "Math  Riddles" to put into our own class book.  Example, Three fish had four  fins each, with eight dots on each fin.  How many fish?  How many fins?   How many dots altogether 
 This mini-series is based on one of the most complex books I have read - dealing extensively with the inner demons of a man on an inexorable path to self-annihilation.  I am happy to note that this mini-series does a superb job of translating the story from the book to film.  Yes, allowances have been taken - I don't think one could have made a film of this book without taking such allowances.  Purists will object, and I'm sure each of us can find fault in some of the choices made, but these choices, by definition, are very subjective.  As a whole, on its own the mini-series stand as a brilliant achievement - a great character study of a man's loss of his own character as he descends into dark abysses of continuous duplicity.  Peter Egan, a surprising choice for the role, does an outstanding job in the title role.  A number of users have commented on how inappropriate he is for the role.  I disagree, and again, I think the problem is the subjectivity of the subject.  So much of the movie is based on his inner feelings and it is hard to convey that to the viewer.  Some might prefer a more robust expression of his inner turmoil, but that does not really fit well with the character.  I think, his more subtle approach is much more engaging and truer to what I imagined in the book - of course, others may have imagined differently and for them this may become a problem with his portrayal.  Overall an outstanding adaptation of the Le Carre book. Be forewarned that, just like the book, it is long and deliberately slow moving and may not be for everyone. Very little 'action' as such, but an exceptional character study of what makes a 'Perfect' Spy. There is a certain sadness which permeates the film, and becomes quite powerful at the end. Highly, highly recommended for those who prefer thoughtful, deliberately paced movies.  IMDB users have given this film an extremely high 8.8 (out of 10) rating as of January 2007 
 My knowledge of Richard Rodgers was limited to the fact that he wrote the music and Lorenz Hart wrote the words to a favorite song of mine entitled Manhattan.  I wanted to learn more about the partnership of Rodgers and Hart and found them to be an odd couple of sorts.  Hart was a genius in writing lyrics, but was a difficult man to work with due to his problem with alcohol.  Rodgers finally had to find a new partner when Hart's health failed him and he could no longer be depended upon.  Rodgers then hooked up with Oscar Hammerstein and the two of them gave the world Oklahoma, South Pacific, The King and I, The Sound of Music, and other treasured musicals.  Rodgers also had an alcohol problem at this time when drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes was common in society.  I suppose it still is.  Rodgers and his lifelong wife, Dorothy, did not have a very happy marriage although they did their best to keep their marital problems hidden from the public.  One of their children, a daughter Mary, was often ridiculed by her father for being what he considered to be fat.  Retirement was not something Richard Rodgers would consider for himself.  He always wanted to write the next musical.  Irving Berlin lived in fear that he would never be able to write another hit song.  Rodgers lived in fear of not be able to come up with another musical.  Both showed their insecurities in their line of work.  I feel the author does an excellent job in researching her subject.  I rate the book four stars, not because I feel the book is lacking in any respect, but because it is a subject I had no knowledge of and my interest was held to about a four star level 
 "Because they could not seize my thoughts, they decided, to punish my body...": this sentence was the first,which remaind in my memory, consolidated in my soul, reason enough, to explore more about this Henry David Thoreau (12.7.1817-2.5.1862). He moved in the same circles of society-critical network as Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882), in the middle of the 19th century at the American east coast. Thoreau's "On the Duty of Civil Disobedience" has left behind world-wide effects: Gandhi carried it during his frequent prison stays in his pocket (later India attained home rule and racial integration), Hermann Hesse (Siddharta) was influenced, the resistance against Hitler-Germany used it for backbone-stabilization, Martin Luther King Jr. or Joan Baez were inspired by him, Bertrand Russell, Nelson Mandela or the philosopher Herbert Marcuse (19.7.1898-29.7.1979) took possession of Thoreau's patterns of thinking. Thoreau was ever convinced that he was not on earth to please anybody, but rather to be authentically. Of course Thoreau's rugged individualism is not the very first in the history of philosophy. Forerunner structures can be found in the "Antigone" of Sophokles (translated in earlier years by Thoreau himself) or in the thoughts of Confucius (well known to Thoreau) or in the essay of Boetie, a friend of the french philosopher Montaigne: Boetie wrote about "discours sur la servitude volontaire". As a guidance to nowadays political actions Thoreau's spectrum of opinions probably is no longer suitable. One should reflect on the more and more complicated administrative systems, the clever governments and political leaders, their artfulness of subterfuge, their underhand stratagems, the many snares layed out by laws and remissions, injunctions and decrees; don't forget the sometimes dull executive. They made themselves fitter than ever to overcome all sorts of social resistance. Instead of paying a poll tax Thoreau once upon a time spent a night in jail. Inspired from this classic treatise on passive, nonviolent resistance you may decide to make a sit-down-strike against crusaders and reverse-crusaders or an action, refusing to pay money for the electricity, because you like to restrain the atomic age: be sure: you will not change the direction of the politicians passing by. They will think you are a little bit farcical. To retreat obstinately into the wood living in a block hut alike Thoreau: I don't advise this method to the broad of the population in the present days, at least take a look at the medical supply situation thus worsened. Linguistically however could start a new era of Thoreau's effectiveness, if there were increasingly sensitive readers. A futile hope? Think about the sentence "I do not lend myself to the wrong which I condemn." What sort of consequences and changing the rules of behaviour are TODAY necessary to realize such a direction of sef-reliance? Let's finish with another quotation of a sentence, which this extraordinary American philosopher wrote - and I never can forget these words like the one in the beginning of my review. He noted in his laconic style: "The lawyer's truth is consequence." Means: Without action following a decision, supporting something is useless. It inspired me to write a book concerning "The Persistance of the Philosophers" - and to take a daily walk down by the riverside ... 
 I loved this book.  As the daughter of a professor and an adjunct professor, I found humor and truth in the book.  
 I bought this one for two months now. It's pretty precise and clear. 
 This is one of my all time favorite books.  Wise, funny, and true.  Lamott is a one of a kind writer who makes all of us mothers feel like we are in a good company.  Get this book if you are a new parent 
 Let me first say that music like this normally isn't my thing. I pretty much just listen to melodic death metal. Well my girlfriend had this cd and everytime we took a drive she played the album. At first I was like what is this happy jumpy music. Than after a while this album stuck on me and I couldn't believe it. Their is just something about this band that I love. Anyways, out of all the punk bands that are out right now Tsunami Bomb are in a league of their own. I love Lemonade. If my friends catch me listening to this oh oh!!! LO 
 I received this book as a gift.  Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.  The mix of humor and information in it is perfect.  Not only do you learn things, you have a good time learning them.  The mix of literature, art, politics, history, etc, is perfect.  If you like to read and love to learn, this is the book for you 
 It is amazing that Michael Franks literally belies age. On this wonderful CD his soothing and hypnotic vocals and elaborate musical compositions are as good as ever. He mixes songs of love, loss, yearning and remembrance. "Under The Sun", "The Cool School" and "The Critics Are Never Kind" are superlative songs. The closing song "Songbirds" is a poignant, evocative and contemplative marvel. Many of the last songs on Franks' CDS are the zenith of the recordings. For that matter if he released a CD comprised of the final song on all his CDs it would be incredibly dynamic. Franks is a multitalented and eclectic artist. At heart Michael Franks is a cerebral Flower Child aptly based in Woodstock. He supports humane organizations including PETA, Hearts United For Animals and Farm Sanctuary. It's great to know that an immensely talented and brilliant recording artist also has a heart of gold 
      K-19 The Widowmaker is a great dramatic depiction of this real life event from 1961, when a Soviet nuclear sub almost had a meltdown.  Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson rise to the occassion by making it believable and intense.  Ford portrays the overly harsh commander and Neeson the captain in touch with the men.  Probably the best submarine movie there is, especially when compared to the ridiculous "Crimson Tide" and "U-571".  The cold war aspect pervades the film and the men heroically risk their lives stopping a nuclear meltdown. 
 Well, I never would have guessed the ending in a million years! In this great edition to the Alex Delaware psychologist/mystery solver series, a girl he treated many years ago visits Alex to ask for help for her mother. Gina, the recluse mom, was model-beautiful until someone threw acid on her face, and she never knew why. Get ready to find out why in this gripping thriller.   Kellerman likes to show us that the most ordinary-looking and -acting of people often have a devious, frightening side. Gina doesn't have to look too far from home to find her kidnapper. That's good for her, since she's a recluse!  It's an understatement to say Kellerman is a master at the psychological thriller. He created the genre 
 It's been 6 years since this book was published, and I believe that many of the fundamental items identified by the author still apply. Most investors are looking for rules for identifying good stocks, and using these techniques offers someone a way to actually test the results they could expect - at least if you're willing to use a service like ValueLine.  The only downside of the book was in the lack of exploring additional ideas - things like shorter holding periods, stop-loss strategies, diversification across industries, etc.  For the price, buy it 
 I find myself preferring the JP Beaumont over the Joanna Brady series by Jance. This book is a perfect reason why. The character is much more developed, JP's attitudes are much more entertaining, the novels clearly better written. This is actually 2 murder mysteries under one cover. The book moves back & forth between the two and does it well. Each mystery comes together well at the end. JP finds himself with a new female partner & possibly a new interest? The last page leaves that thought entertainingly hanging 
 This book is a hundred times better then Guilty Pleasures. It had a good gripping story, Jean-Claude, and not a lot of corney cliches that the 1st book had.  Anita sometimes gets a little irritating, you don't have to say your a 'tough as nails vampire slayer' twenty times, we got it. I also don't quite understand how bloody murder scenes make her puke but she can lop off a vampires head without a hint of an upset stomach ... vamps bleed too.  Anita also had her good moments ... that and the story line kept me reading and I'm glad I did 
 I really love this whole line.  I made Cuban Sandwiches with mine and was really pleased with how they turnes out.  I am also big on the aesthetic look of my cookware along with functionality, and this line offers both aspects at an incredibly reasonable price 
 This is a very good self help book, just start with part two becasue part one is just all information.  People who didn't like this book probably didn't really have the dirve to stop cutting anyway.  You have to want to change, and it says that a million times.  Yes, of course they promote their own program, but who wouldn't.   It provides a ton of useful tools to quit self injuring.  It even provieds sample impulse control logs and ways to interview a potential therapist.  The only thing I dissagree with is that they do not consider SI to be an addiction, and I think that it is.  Either way, the book is amazing 
  Best camera I've ever owned.It has features found on larger SLR's such as shutter speed & red-eye reduction.The several shoot modes such as portrait allows for close ups as well as a scenery mode which allows for sharp vivid photos of foilage as well as sunsets.A marvelous little camera and the size being slightly bigger than a pack of cigarettes allows you to take this anywhere without the bulk of some of the SLR's and their required lens.Too many features to list here.Try one for yourself you'll be amazed 
 I bought this for my son. He and I love playing the Halo game on X-Box and he wanted to read about the whole story before the time when the game began. He enjoyed it very much and liked the way it complemented to gam 
 I have been a Batman fan since kid, almost 30yrs.  I was looking for this compilation awhile ago and definitely found it here.  This is one of the most emotionally comics ever seen.  You can feel the soft human side of the Bat.  I will treasure this one as one of my fav 
 Always think twice. Never jump to hasty conclusions without considering ALL the effects of an act or decision. That's the essence of Economics: "looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy."   Most economic fallacies are the result of ignoring this lesson, as Henry Hazlitt clearly shows with many examples throughout this witty short book. Are there benefits in destruction (let it be a humble broken window or a bloody war? Is government spending the solution to unemployment or industries in trouble? Can taxes benefit the economy of a country? Do inflationary policies really encourage a well-functioning economy or are they just a smokescreen to conceal otherwise unpopular decisions? Are all labor union practices truly justified? And, what about tariffs, subsidies, parity prices, rent control, or minimum wage laws? These are the kind of issues the author analyses beyond what you can usually hear, read, or see on the media.  Beyond what you may think about the government's role in the economy, whether you agree or not with the author's liberal views, "Economics in One Lesson" shows how one should always try to see beyond the obvious and avoid missing the forest for the trees.  As the author points out, half-truths presented as complete truths are behind most economic fallacies. Demagogues and 'rogue' economists try to divert our attention by focusing only on the most visible effects of a given decision (or, in the worst cases, on the only effects that should be seen not to discredit an already decided course of action). Learning to supplement and correct their half-truths with the other half is the most reasonable thing an independent thinker can do. BTW, "Economics in One Lesson" might be a good place to start.. 
 The Tupler Techniques are wonderful. I got the DVD because I couldn't remember or picture how to do everything. And I got the splint as well for wearing during the day, while wearing a baby, and while doing the exercises. It is so nice to not have to struggle into a nasty nylon girdle! 
     I had only recently become aware of Edward Gorey and his works, and this was one of my first Gorey Books along with "The Gashlycrumb Tinies".  This book is not his most macabre work, yes, but it one of his most charming.        The story may seem relatively simple, and to a simple mind it is nothing more than a witty story that is full of nonsense, but to others it is slightly thought provoking.  The chapters are numbered in a strange order for a reason, and many small details of the book hold some significance.  Without giving too much away, if you stop and think about it, and if you look at the first illustration and then the part where the main characters reach the bush, you will begin to see what this story is, or rather may possibly be, about.  I'd rather not say what my interpretation is, but suffice to say this book cannot be reduced to a chronicle of nonsense which some narrow-minded people might say.      It is true that not a lot of people will interpret the story the same way, but that's part of the appeal of it.  Other than its thought-provoking aspect, it is an extremely charming children's book.  The illustrations are delightful, the humor is subtle but funny, and the book is overall just a fun read.  Who can forget lines like "It was too dark to hear anything" or the alligator's emotionally deep verse, "I die"?        This book is amusing for all ages, whether your child is 8, 16, or an adult.  Even I, being a teenager, can't help but laugh at it.  While many may consider it inane, if you approach it with an open mind, you're in for an interesting experience.    
 Fun to see Brando slim, singing and dancing.  Sinatra entertaining as always.  Vivian Blaine hysterical as Sinatra's doll.  Stubby Kaye excellent 
 This is a very good album.  I almost wish I had heard this before "This Darkened Heart".  This album has a more raw feel to it.  Less production trying to clean up the sound, which I like.  I think both albums are great, but TDH sounds almost like they blended with Killswitch Engage (makes sense, seeing as how TDH was recorded and produced by Killswitch's guitarist, who also produces KE's stuff).  This album definately has a more old school metal/grindcore feel to it.  Either way I feel ATR is one of the best newer metal bands out there 
 I just finished "Malice in Miniature" and was again thrilled by the down to earth quality of the book.  Unlike many so called mysteries, this one contains no obviously upsetting scenes.  Dorothy Martin is my kind  of amateur sleuth.  Not glamorous or "sexy", she uses her natural  curiousities to solve another case. Though often her now husband, Alan,  tries to dissuade her from getting involved, her natural tendency to  befriend people keeps her right in the midst of the action.  I also liked  the idea of a novel with a miniature doll house theme, positively  fascinating. I highly recommend this book to others 
 Of the half-a-dozen environmental science texts I read in preparing a 10th grade environmental science block, this is by far the best written, with the clearest figures.  Highly recommended 
 Stars Kenneth Branagh and Robin Wright Penn.  Branagh plays a cynical playwright who doesn't want children. Clever, well acted, and generally entertaining.  This film did not receive a wide distribution despite the `big name' actors.  Accordingly, many are unfamiliar with it.  
 1984 in the UK: it was the worst of times.  Young British boy Billy Elliott had just lost his Mum.  His Dad and older brother were on strike with the other miners.  Whether they knew it or not, a lifestyle was ending.    But, something caught a spark in Billy--not at the boxing lessons his father gave him 50 pence to attend, but from watching the ballet class of girls just outside the boxing ring.    He joined that class in secret and that spark caught fire.  Despite his father's opposition, he trained til he managed to convince his father he needed a chance at a better life.    While this film is very serious in nature, there's a lightness and a hope even in the worst of it.  This is a very enjoyable watch and one I believe would be good to see again and again. 
 Said it was used, but doesnt look used at all. Came fast and easy 
 My son, 2 1/2, loves Little Bear from the cartoons on Noggin and was thrilled that we found these books to read to him.  He often selects this book (or one of the other Minarik books) from his bookcase at bedtime for my wife or I to read to him.  The stories are brief but entertaining and the illustrations are rich and engaging.  The books are a bit flimsy and I would prefer that they be available in a more durable format but that is a minor issue compared to the wonderful content of these books 
 Like many teenagers, I was under the impression that Frankenstein (thinking it was the name of the monster) was a remorseless brute that got joy from torturing people. But after reading Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, my perception completely changed.   I literally knew nothing about the story save that Frankenstein--again thinking that it was the monster--was repulsive in aspect.   As I read the story I came to find out that Frankenstein was actually the name of the man who created the abominable creature. Also, I would have never guessed that the creature would have been made malicious by human disdain. The "daemon" was at heart benevolent and innocuous, but human scorn turned his ways and he sought revenge.   Altogether, the story was very well written. It did have a few flaws, such as the overuse of the word "endeavour" and the impractibility of a man remembering such long a story and actually narrarating the whole of it, not forgetting to omit a single quote. Despite the few flaws, Frankenstein is indeed a horror classic (although, I failed to find any horror in it) and should be read by the fans of the genre 
 Ok granted Mike Jones is FAR from the best rapper but yet he still manages his flow and sound to be hot. He says his name to the point where you wanna gun butt the nicca, but yet it still makes you shout WHO? And lastly, all the hype is just about worth it cuz he was the one who REALLY opened the doors for the current H town domination of hip hop. DJ SCREW and 'Face and a few others are the fathers but it's Jones who brought screwed n chopped to the mainstream, or rather they came to him. I can't call him a sellout cuz he did it like ol Blue Eyes did...HIS WAY! So now to the album, we all know how infectiously catchy and dope "Still tippin" and "Back then" were and still are! So what if they were played to def, you gonna say "Goldigger" isn't and that's a far inferior jam! There are cuts that are just so so, no doubt, but his bangers like the aforementioned as well as "Turning Lane", "5 years from now" and "Cuttin" are some bangers f*** where ya from! I say you cannot look at Mike Jones for his lyrical ability, its obvious he is not up to the marker, but ahem, neither is a certain Missa West, but it's the beats, the sound, just the whole feel of this album that makes it the undeniable screwed and chopped CLASSIC that it is. They are screwing and choppin friggin Britney Spears and Ashanti nowadays, and that is wack, but the trend had to eventually hit the big time. Mike don't care bout dat he doin his thing and doing it well, with authenticity. That is reason enough, if you LIKE H town screwd n chopped muzik, to support him and cop this and all his albums. And of course, we have to mention that "drank" yup that lean! I never had the chance to lean but I have been inebriated on DXM which I hear is similar to the Codeine Promethezine high, and let me tell you...this album made so much SENSE haha! I won't say that is the reason I bump this and like it so much, but if you happen to be sippin barre, then this is the guidebook right here! JEAH!

 A very good coverage of what Paintshop Pro can do. Although it has for Photographers in the title it is really a general purpose coverage of all aspects of the program. It is a great way to get up and going because it looks at all areas of operation 
 To start off, I am the author of the book so take the "star review" for what it is.  I just wanted to give you a little more depth to what this book is about in case you are looking at purchasing it.  First I will tell you that I've had over 12 years experience of not only performing improv and owning a troupe, but I've been very lucky to teach improv to people of all ages and walks of life.  I will be up front with my statement that no ONE person can teach you everything about improv.  I learned from many people and took what I liked to form my style and beliefs. It is that style that is in my book and I encourage you to look at several books if you are really serious about it.  My book starts off as an introduction for teachers looking at adding improv to their lessons.  This is mostly aimed at school aged children, but I use the same practices for Adults.  The publishing company wanted to add this to their "101 _____ for Children" series so I fitted everything for that.  I got them to add the "Adults" part so potential readers who were older wouldn't turn away.  I've outlined a lot of stuff on how someone who knows very little about improv can teach it (at least teach it my style) and have tried to include everything I would do in front of a class.  This same information can be used by the reader to learn the basics.  I ended the book with tips for Advanced people.  Again, these are theories of mine gained over watching and performing with people 2 to 5 shows a week every week for over a decade.  These tips not only include how to stretch yourself, but also some hints on what to look for when forming your own troupe.  In the middle is the 101 games promised in the title.  This being the first book I wanted to have a strong list of "beginners" games and warm up exercises, but there are still plenty of games for all levels of players to be found.  The games listed are all what would be called "Short Form" games, the type you would find watching Who's Line Is It Anyway?.  There was a second book planned that would include more of the tougher games and a section on Long Form, but I'm not sure if that book will ever be published.  If you are a very seasoned improv actor this book will only have a few games that you might not have tried yet, and I don't know how much you'll get out of the "beginners" section.  But I for one feel that you never stop learning about improv and there is some very good stuff throughout the book.  And if you are in the early stages of improv learing, there is no doubt that you'll find a lot of stuff to take with you on stage.  If you are a teacher looking at having fun in the classroom, this book is... well, it's hard to say "perfect" because I'm biased.  But it works very well in the classroom.  And not just for theatre teachers.  I've had several teachers who tell me that they use it for helping with creative writing and other types of learning that require more imagination.  Another teacher told me that they use improv early in the year to get everyone used to being in front of the class and not being embarrassed about themsleves or speaking in the class.  I have a huge love for improv and that is what I tried to put into the book.  I can't call it the ultimate Bible on improv because there is no such thing.  Improv is like art, everyone knows what they like.  This is not only what I like, it's what I love.  I applaud your interest in improv.  Learning how to adapt to changing situations is not just a great thing for the stage, it's helpful in all forms of life.  I hope that this has been helpful to you in some way and if not I'm sure you can alwayas track me down -- darn internet.  Take Care, Bo 
 WHY...did he take his life? So much comedy and so unrewarded for it. Ricjard Jeni should have been a Comedy Central regular. His humor, from yeast infections being surrounded by helicopters, to pubic hairs escaping on a bar of soap, was incredible. His best bit, is the Belching Gourmet (not here).   WHY...did he not recieve the accolades of much lesser comedians who reached fame? I watched every HBO special he did, and was hilarified.   WHY...hasn't someone put together a collection of his cable specials?   WHY...do I feel so bad he killed himself when I never met him? Because when I watched his shows, I DID feel as if I had met him.  ANY DVD, VHS you can find, get it. Richard Jeni was not one dimensional like Sam Kinison, an icon, and deserves your laughter.  
 What a Classic tale of the Fool coming to age! The story (read: poem) moves along at a quick pace as we follow Perceval through his travails. The story is light and humourous but also is so much deeper at second look. It is too bad Chretin dy Troyes could not have lived to finish this piece 
 The greatest invention since the Steaming Hot. Every household should own one 
 I pulled it off the shelf and held it in my hands like a sacred instrument of sorts. It was heavy and had the appearance of an art history book or a coffee table book, only in this volume, the artistry celebrated is that of intuition - specifically, intuition guided by the Divine - to create a life of wonder, richness, intention and naturally, intuition.  It is filled with fill in the blank contemplative exercises and assessments, beautiful art, evocative questions and beautiful quotations you will want to write in your own quote notebook if you have one.  I only wish their was more white space, only that might make the book more pricey.  (That was another huge surprise - when I felt it in my hands I thought "oh, this is an expensive one and was shocked to see it wasn't expensive at all!)  Lynn Robinson writes in a way that you feel as if you are sitting having a delicious meal and glass of wine with a friend - perhaps with instrumental music softly playing in the background and perhaps other wonderfully connected people sharing your journey.  Even if you think you have "read it all" in the "Create a Life You Love" or "Intuition for Spiritual People" you will really find a gem in this book - for the sensory delight if nothing else.   Revel in this one. 
 After accurately addressing the current state of affairs in the United States government, which can be called by many names - Chomsky uses polyarchy - he radically reframes the last several decades of U.S. history in impressive detail, and his work is to be commended.    My major criticism is that he gave far too little attention to the idea of polyarchy and the problems it attempts to address.  Such an issue bitterly divided the Founders, but is far older than the United States - Plato dwelled on it in "The Republic."  He saw a democracy as nothing but a wreckless mob, and that they must be ruled like children by "guardians," who live apart from the masses and consider the good of the people more important than their own.    Of course such guardians are very rare - for every Marcus Aurelius or Diocletian there are half a dozen Nero's and Caligula's.  Although Bush is particularly odious his policy is merely at the extreme of a narrow spectrum, as Chomsky acknowledges.  So a system run by an elite will naturally reflect the interests of the elite and not of those whom they govern.  Chomsky makes that very clear and that is one of work's best messages.  But what to replace it?  Lenin would have us believe that even a cook should be able to run a country, but I doubt most people would agree.  Jefferson also trusted the people, but was he too idealistic?  What should replace this corrupt polyarchy?  Although Chomsky offers no solution, it is still an important and informative work 
 I travel all the time and I found this to be incredibly helpful with great tips on hotels, airlines, car rentals, etc.  It has saved me a LOT of time - I can go directly to the relevent website rather than surfing around for hours.  Her anecdotes are also pretty funny - well-written. This is great for both frequent and infrequent travellers.  A superb resouce; everything from immunization information to travel travel tips to solo-traveller websites 
 This is a tremendously well-written examination of the structure of power in America.  It continues the ideas of Mills but with more of the empirical and less of the theoretical.  A MUST-READ for anyone who claims to know how America is ruled. Simply stated--if this book doesn't get your blood boiling and move you to action then you have no right to complain about the present state of the American political system 
 You have to have this book if you want to pass the test 
   I have read many books on spiritual awakening over the past 15 years including "Way of the Peaceful Warrior" (by Dan Millman) mentioned by one of the other readers who wrote a review for this book and no other single book reached me in the way that "Initiation" did.   Sure there is the girlie "fluff" but that is to be anticipated considering it was written by a woman and mother.  I guess the effect this book may have on a person is in great part determined by where they are in their life spiritually at the time they read it, but I must say that this book caused me to look deeper and to consider more than any other I had read before.  Yes it gets slow going at times and yes it changes tempo or style wiout prior warning, but such is real life.  Its pages are filled with such descriptive imagery about ancient Egypt that anyone studying Egyptology or Hermeticism will find it a refreshingly different read.  I may find another book that comparitively teaches me more or inspires an even deeper insight than this book could have ever accomplished, but then, I needed this book to unlock the door.  Now that that is done, I can roam all through my spiritual mansion undeterred, exploring what all the new rooms have lying in store for me -for getting past that locked front door was my biggest challenge and this book was the allegorical "key".  This book may not be the end, but it will definately afford one more step towards that end. 
 Many films billed as noir fall short of expectations but "Fallen Angel" delivers on it's promise.  This is an excellently woven web of love, deceit, and murder.  Every character in the film is intricately drawn with enough flaws to have the finger of suspicion pointed at any one of them.  The film is anchored by a terrific Dana Andrews as a shady confidence man and Linda Darnell as a sultry waitress whose allure can drive people to the unthinkable.  This film brought to my mind the work of James M. Cain but in the best sense 
 I'm parent of three bilingual boys. I have read different books on education of bilingual babys. This one is perfect in my opinion. Is simple but complete. Is full of examples and, above all, is full of "common sense": I mean, the book present the bilinguism explaining also its problems and the differences among different babys; it helps you to understand that certain limits and situations are completely normal 
 Easily one of the best books and metrics to maesure the depth and quality of your client relationships. 
 I received this in great shape and on time.  I love using Amazon.com to purchase what I want.  They usually have what I am looking for and it is so easy to do on the net 
 I heve not read the book but I liked the film because of the intense single minded quality that Gene Tierney was able to get through to us, the onlookers. She was magnificent, very stylish and showed once again how weak a man can be when in love with a woman. Even though the film is quite old, it has depth and interesting characters.  
 Honestly, Dee Henderson's other books are worlds better, but this one won't insult your intelligence with bad writing or nothin'... Her style's still nice, the plot's decent, it just doesn't compare to the actual O'Malley Series or even Uncommon Heroes for that matter 
 This is a serious general text on competitive intelligence, and Leonard is a master.  Having said that, I would note that what Leonard does best is work very hard-the practice of business intelligence still lacks a good set  of information technology tools for discovering, discriminating,  distilling, and delivering packaged business intelligence, and most firms  do not have the tools for managing a broadly distributed network of niche  experts who are hired on a day to day basis.  Fuld & Company Inc., and  to a lesser extent the other companies listed in the Open Source  Marketplace, are the first wave in what I believe will be a major line of  business to business revenue in the 21st Century 
 Luke, a third child wanted the population law gone. It was that, because of droughts that nobody was allowed more than 2 children. When he figures out the population police were overthrown he goes to check it out.  What I liked about the book was that it was always exciting. It also had interesting settings. Also the characters were detailed descriptively. Another thing was the characters did things you wouldn't guess. What I didn't like about the book though was that it usually switched topics. Also the characters weren't doing things they liked so it was mostly sad 
 in this movie,it starts off with a cooler,more with it[the times that is] little red riding hood.the wolf is still a cross dressing psycopath.this begs the question"do you think ed gaines was tramautized by this as a child?"anyway,a whole host of fairy tail creatures are here in a "shrek" meets "csi" type movie where the events surrounding "the little red riding hood" story are examined by a private eye type followed by a insanely entertaining little guy.i forget of ges a chipmunk or a squirrell or what but he goes really fast in all mannerisms,speech and actions.my favorite part is when they give him coffee.in my opinion he sort of steals the show.and id also place him  right up there near stitch as one of my all time favotite characters on a kid show ever.this movue is fun for all.watch it 
 If I had only one book to read and re-read, this would be it.  Far and away my favorite translation of the book that is part of my blood and bone.  I've memorized much of it, and have read it aloud onto CD as a gift for my friends.  A treasure.  "Let life ripen and then fall.  Force is not the way at all.&quot 
 "Crossfire" was considered a risky film when it was released in 1947. It was a relatively rare 1940s example of "social conscious" filmmaking that had largely gone out of style after the 1930s. And the film addressed the subject of bigotry in America, which was still considered taboo in some quarters -or at least box office poison. "Crossfire" was adapted from the novel "The Brick Foxhole" by Richard Brooks, which concerned a gay Marine who was beaten to death by his fellow soldiers. The Production Code did not allow homosexuality to be discussed openly in films, so screenwriter John Paxton made the victim Jewish instead, and "Crossfire" became a statement against lingering anti-Jewish sentiment in America and a denunciation of bigotry in general. The message was couched in a stylish murder mystery/detective story, and "Crossfire" achieved both critical and commercial success, including 5 Academy Award nominations.   As the film opens, Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene) has been beaten to death, and Police Captain Finlay (Robert Young) is trying to piece together the events that led to his murder. Four army buddies on leave -Mitchell, Montgomery, Floyd,and Leroy- went out drinking. They met Samuels and his girlfriend in a bar. Mitchell was feeling homesick and had drank too much. A sympathetic Samuels invited him to dinner. They preceded to Samuels' apartment, followed by Montgomery and Floyd. Samuels ends up dead. Mitchell's wallet is found at the scene, and he is missing. Finlay seeks out Sergeant Keeley (Robert Mitchum), who knew the men, for help with the investigation. Keeley tries to protect Mitchell, while Montgomery (Robert Ryan) implicates him. But what possible motive could any of these men have to kill a man whom they'd only just met?  We have a pretty good idea of who committed the murder early on in "Crossfire". The mystery is the motive. And that is where the film's message is found. But this isn't sophisticated writing. The characters are 2-dimensional and seem to exist only to service the theme. And the theme is a little weak. It undermines itself by assuring the audience that Samuels embodied none of the stereotypes that his assailant had assumed of him. But what if Samuels had conformed to a stereotype or two? Would it be ok to bludgeon him? "Crossfire" is sometimes presented as the sole example of a "film noir" social conscious picture and as proof that such an animal could exist. I find this curious because I don't see anything but the most superficial qualities of film noir in "Crossfire". Director Edward Dmytryk made use of low-key lighting because it was cheap and disguised his low-budget sets. This is a crime film. I suppose it's an introverted film, but that just makes it characteristic of the era. In any case, this is an example of overtly "social conscious" filmmaking in the 1940s. The mystery cleverly relates directly to the film's anti-bigotry theme and keeps the audience engaged. "Crossfire" is entertaining but uncomplicated.  The DVD (Warner 2005): Bonus features include a documentary and an audio commentary. "Crossfire: Hate is Like a Gun" (9 minutes) talks about making a "message picture" during the Communist witchhunt of the late 1940s. It includes an interview with director Edward Dmytryk in which he talks about shooting the film in 20 days on a low budget and the resulting visual style. The audio commentary features film noir theorists and authors Alain Silver and James Ursini as well as archival commentary from Edward Dmytryk. Silver and Ursini discuss the film's style, characters, themes, and director. Dmytryk talks about the political climate in Hollywood at the time, the House Un-American Activities Committee, being one of the "Hollywood Ten", and his own experience with blacklisting. He does not, however, discuss his decision to "name names" to HUAC after spending some time in prison for contempt of Congress. Nevertheless, Dmytryk's commentary will interest anyone studying HUAC and Hollywood. Subtitles for the film are available in English, French, and Spanish 
 knocking off one star on this book for the way they packaged the CD it's in a little paper sleeve attached the back inside cover of the book  Now, I like my things to stay as fresh and clean as possible and this book was a highly anticipated gift to myself.  That's where my troubles started... I found it a bit difficult to get the CD out without practically ripping the paper sleeve open.  Ever see a record sleeve that hasn't been cut to the right size, seams all busted out and split open.  Not nice.  Finally found that you gotta wiggle the disk back and forth (wikki-wikki-wikki-scratch-scratch with that fragile digital disc) to get the thing out. Just when you think you've got it, the little white gummy strips of industrial strength rubber tape that are supposed to keep the flap closed smear their sticky gummed up gummy gum crap all over the disk.  Yum.   Ruined the CD.  Won't play at all now.  Would like another one please thank you.  Warning - remove and destroy tape as soon as you buy this book before it destroys you.  I've got a number of books that have CDs packaged in them and this is the first one I've ever come across that was designed this poorly.  You don't put the gas can next to the fireplace - don't put sticky snot like tape on a CD flap 
 While i was reading this book, I could relate exactly to everything Franz Metcalf was trying to talk about in this wonderful book that he's written for our age group. He talks about teen issues like dating, pregnancy, sex, family, friendships, gossip, and how to apply the Buddha's teachings to almost ANY situation you can dream up. In each section is included an inspiring quote from some of the greatest Buddhist teachers, and I found it comforting how open and honest he was when discussing issues that we as teenagers have to face today. He even talks about discovering whether or not you're gay,lesbian,bisexual, etc. but I would've appreciated it if he had a section devoted to gay/lesbian/bisexual teens and the issues they face, such as harassment, etc. Other than that, I thought it was an AWESOME book and I would highly suggest it to anyone 
 Matilda is an extraordinary girl who has read most of the books in the library by age seven (including A Tale of Two Cities).  However, she is stuck with ignorant, mean parents who lie and cheat and who want her to watch television rather than waste time reading.  Through her teacher, Ms. Honey, Matilda discovers just how extraordinary she is and uses her new special powers to help Ms. Honey vanquish her ogre of an aunt, Ms. Trunchbull, and to outwit the witless parents in her own life.  One of Dahl's best along with James and the Giant Peach and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory 
 Sure, the first of the two theatrical ADDAMS FAMILY movies from Warner Bros. had a lot going for it. I was wicked in love with Wednsday Addams when it first came out, and the story was pretty amusing.  No. 2 though ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES was way better. I think that in the first outing the actors tried to potray their characters as they were portayed in the old TV shows. In the second however, they were more comfortable breathing their own life into these roles. Especially Christina Ricci, there was a whole lot more depth to her role as the beautiful Wednsday Addams, which in turn proved her abilities as a serious actress early on... by the way I was about ten years old when this came out, so it was ok for me to think that Wednsday Addams was hot. My love for Christina Ricci has matured along with her movies (when she did CASPER she was in sort of an awkward stage then, so was I, no biggie.. by the time Buffalo 66 came out she had blossomed QUITE nicely and has only gotten cuter with age) however, there was something about that Wednsday Addams... you just knew she was going to grow up to be a lot like her mother, Morticia. This is a wicked sexy role for Anjelica Huston by the way. She delivers a dead pan Morticia spot on. I love it. Christopher Lloyd as Uncle Fester is a central part of the plot in this, as he was in the first. This time around, he marries a wicked psyco chick, played by my baby's mother (just kidding- she is played by JOAN CUSACK, another love of mine) who plans on killing him to get to the Addams Family fortune. I can really relate to Uncle Fester in this one, when he is forced to move away from home and all that stuff.  The kids go to Summer camp, and lots of nutty stuff happens there. Lurch says "awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww" a couple of times, and Thing, It, and that freaky old lady are in the picture too. OH YEAH! And the baby. He's new. The overall casting job these WB ADDAMS FAMILY movies couldn't be any better. Much like their version od DENNIS THE MENACE which was released that same year, high price actors mixed with some new talent and old familiar faces, but PERFECT in these movies, and their abilities to ensemble make these movies what they are.  The later WB straight to video sequels sucked, and the actors in those were piss poor. This is coming from someone who ALWAYS liked The ADDAMS FAMILY too. I'd reccomend just about everything, the old black and white show was GREAT, the old movies were good, the cartoon series were all great, and if you really want to go way back, look up some of the one panel comic strip collections of Charles Addams, those are a real good time too, the original stuff.  This one here though is one of my favorite rainy day movies, you should definately check it out 
 I beleive this is a great book.  It gives excellent motivation in getting started in a business. It helps you to understand how to run your business and get it started.  It even gives you examples of current businesses started by young entreprenuers 
 I have been on a quest.  It is not a quest of time and space, but of clothing.  I have been seeking a truly wrinkle-free dress shirt for women.  Oh, I've tried men's dress shirts, but they look so, well, masculine. I've tried women's stretch shirts (with spandex!) but they wrinkle into a little ball, just perfect for that pitch into the trash can.  I've bought wrinkle-free shirts from Chadwick's, Lands End, Villager and others and was disappointed.  They weren't bad, but they weren't good.  If I washed them with my husband's shirts, there was just no comparison.  There were always wrinkles in my shirt.  Sometimes not wrinkled enough to have to iron them, but never really neat looking.  My friends, my quest is over.  I have found the women's dress shirt that wears and washes like a man's.  This  Women's Wrinkle Free Dress Blouse by the Foxcroft Shirt Co. has met my high standards.  I stays neat all day (even after a brisk walk in warm, humid weather) and washes beautifully.  I washed it with my husband's shirts and some wrinkle free shirts from other companies.  It looked as good, if not better, than my husband's permanent press shirts and it left my other shirts in the dirt (or wrinkles, as the case may be).  The price tag is more than I usually spend, but considering the time that I will not have to spend ironing, it's worth it. I plan to buy it in each color. 
 Excellent way to learn human anatomy.  Almost in the same order as my textbook, with most information exactly the same - bonus 
 This book arrived in a very timely manner and was in excellent condition 
 I have been purchasing Bakery on Main products from the health food store for a while now and find they are the best gluten free granola I have found.  Have shared them with coworkers who have no idea they are gluten free.  Would purchase again from Amazon because the price is much lower than the health food shops 
 This is a thorough, accurate accounting of the tragic events at Ruby Ridge. Now that an appeals court has decided that Lon Horiuchi, the FBI sniper who killed Randy Weaver's wife Vicki, can be charged and put on trial by local prosecutors, it is more important than ever to have the background information needed to put the trial in proper context. Alan Bock's fair-minded journalistic account is the best single source for Americans who want to know what really happened and what Mr. Horiuchi's role was. Highly recommended 
 I've been a Howard Stern fan for about 10 years, and now that he's on sirius he's the best he's been in 5 years. Now that I have listened to him on Sirius, and I hear the people on regular radio try to immitate him, there is just no comparison. Stern is the most entertaining personality, at least in the portland area, period.   and as for stern being a failure..well, he brought 4 million subscribers to Sirius Sattalite Radio in less than 2 years and Sirius is expected to reach close to 6.5 million subscribers by the end of 07. Sirius, before signing on Stern, had less than 1 million.  As for this movie though, even if you're not a fan of Howard Stern, the movie is still hilarious and truly entertaining. I gave the movie three stars because the end left y ou hanging 
 I Loved the book, it helped me a lot to understand my situation.. 
 Many of us have noticed how instead of news, we get more and more sensationalism, opinions, staged news, and complete hoaxes.  We see a few accusations of a "liberal" or a "conservative" media.  But that misses the point; what we really have is a lying media.  A media for which truth has become an enemy rather than a value.  Of course, ratings are the goal, and truth may well interfere with that goal, at least in the short term.  And we see some folks even claim that truth is just relative anyway (and only in the eye of the beholder).  But it isn't.  There is such a thing as honest and accurate reporting.  And we consumers need to have a way to say so, objectively, when we're not getting that.  I think people of all political persuasions need to read this book.  I'm a liberal, and I found myself sympathizing with some of the author's complaints politically.  But I would have sympathized with some of them had I been a conservative.  I was impressed by the way that the author analyzed bad reporting independent of its political stance.  I was especially intrigued by the section on propaganda.  Here, Kitty shows us how the media feed us an overdose of dubious anecdotes, demonization, and material from which relevant parts have been censored.  We see stories with all sorts of logical holes that are simply designed to get a reaction from the audience rather than report accurately, educate, or inform.  And we are misled by straight-faced claims that are utter nonsense, such as that prosperity for one side in a struggle would be a violation of rights for the other side.  I do not know how thoroughly the author takes her own advice.  But we certainly ought to 
 We love this book. My 20 month old daughter and I. We read it every night. It is the last book we read before nursing. It has nice ryhmes and the illustrations are beautiful too. Much nicer than any of the other going to sleep books. I highly recommend this book for small children to add to your nighttime ritual. 
 Many will feel that this book is over the top, but I think that most people are going to wake up around the year 2012 saying, "What happened?"  To coin a phrase from the movie, The Life of Brian... "It's happening Reg, it's really happening! 
 Arden's book is a creative kick in the pants! If you are considering shutting up, shutting down, and fitting in to a corporate soul killing career - you need to read this book!   I read it on a recent 1-hour flight from Portland to San Jose. The real life examples point out how and why you are where you are at this very moment - and encourages examination.  Another book along these lines I would recommend & purchased at the San Jose airport on a recent biz trip was - The Sales Adventure Guide.  The Sales Adventure Guide is full of real world business wisdom that you won't find in text books - and it's got cool travel stories!   Shake up your career and your life & take some chances! You'll earn more $ (I have!) and more importantly - be glad to be alive. 
 THIS LITTLE PLAYER PERFORMS EXCELLENTLY-----THE REMOTE TAKES A LOT OF  GETTING THE FEEL OF IT, IF YOU ARE IN THE DARK.USE THE FORMALA AND IT TURNS INTO A MULTI-REGION PLAYER. THE DVD PLAYER IS EXCELLENT BUT THE ROMOTE COULD DEFINITLY BE IMPROVED 
 I really wish that however disappointed Kathleen might have been with what she GOT vs. what she thought she was getting, she would have rated it based on what it was, not what she wanted it to be.  It sounds like she thinks it's an OK book of plans, but she only gave it one star.  I can only assume that's because it's not a decorating book.  That's a little like going to see Citizen Kane and calling it a crappy movie because there weren't any good battle scenes or car chases. So... even though I haven't read it, I'm giving this 5 stars just to counterbalance Kathleen because it would be a shame if someone looking for a book of plans didn't check this out because of an artifically low rating 
 If by some unimaginible twist of fate, for some unspeakable crime, I were to be condemned to a small, desolate island for the rest of my life and allowed to carry with me but one book, the choice would be easy: Golden Gate by Vikram Seth.  It would be easy for the obvious: reading this book is so pleasurable it makes one feel guilty (as in "Oh god I don't deserve to be so happy!!").  It would be even easier for what is not so obvious: reading the book engenders in one an intense desire to try and re-create the sublime beauty of Seth's verse.  Such a pursuit is a futile exercise over many lifetimes -- one lifetime in a marooned island would go by in the blink of any eye 
 These are very high quality wool suite pants.  They have a have leg liner for comfort and the ruberized piping on the waist band helps keep ones shirt from coming untucked.  JAB offers a long and a short rise in the seat.  A short rise will give you a nice close fit to your bottom.  This may not be to your liking if you carry your wallet back ther 
 I initially saw this film on a movie channel about a week ago. At first I wasn't sure what had come on, but as I started to watch the movie I couldn't pull myself away. This movie was 101 minutes of my life I won't ever regret. As mentioned previously this movie is a modern day Macbeth w/ a touch of "hick" to it. After watching this I went to Amazon the next day to see if it was available for purchase. I would suggest buying this movie 
 Tonya's down to earth story telling of compelling journey not only to the USA but also to raw and live foods is one of the best books on the raw or live foods lifestyle. She combines a beautiful inspirational story with excellent tips and advice for making the transition to Raw yourself.  Raw is a complete lifestyle change, but Tonya makes it easy, understandable and POSSIBLE to do. She teaches you to cultivate your natural beauty, your birthright, in clear, easy to understand language.  She is inspiring, knowledgeable, and gives you the impression that she genuinely cares for your success as you, too, transition to the most beautiful you that you can be...RAW.  She explores, discusses and finally blows wide open many common misconceptions on Beauty, nutrition and healthy eating in an intelligent, no nonsense and entertaining manner.   Her recipes are excellent...food selections, shopping tips and resource lists are healthful and helpful.   It's not just about the diet and Tonya makes that clear...this is a lifestyle and she explores the other avenues of  that as well...with discussions on style, hair care, exercise, behavior...the total mind/body package...  With "Your Right To Be Beautiful"...beauty is MORE than skin deep. With Tonya, you have all the tools to claim that right.   How do I know?   Last year I was mistaken for being in my early forties, BUT....a few days ago...someone mistook me for my 17 year old daughter; AGAIN...I am 37.   These days....according to a popular online health and lifestyle survey, I am 23 years old, physiologically and lifestyle speaking...  Ageing is not a fact of life, in "Your Right To Be Beautiful," Tonya teaches what the facts really are....  "We can all be beautful."  
 Seeing Miami Vice in re-runs really made me wonder what I saw in the T.V. show in the first place.  The music from the T.V. show is a different story.  I originally bought this sound track for Andy Taylor's "When The Rain Comes Down".  After hearing the entire CD I was quite surprised that it transcended my expectations.  A nice merge of divergent music styles 
 I must admit that I never really payed any attention towards L while he was alive but when his unfortunate death occurred, it made me curious to check him out considering how critically acclaimed his only album was. I bought it and I discovered a very talented MC. By the summer of 2000, much anticipation was built for this posthumous release and with good reason.   For the diehard Big L fan, they may have heard some of the material that appears here. "Ebonics" has circulated as a single in the streets and "The Enemy" has appeared on the D.I.T.C. album. But not everything is new. For those not very familiar with L, this will obviously sound fresh to you; but plenty of verses have previously appeared on freestyles but now it's provided with a new backdrop in an attempt to make it sound better. And they succeed.  Primo produces top-notch material for the three tracks touched, particularly "Platinum Plus" which Kane destroys. Pete Rock & Ron Browz do wonders for "Holdin' It Down" and "Size Em Up." Injected for the casual listener is "'98 Freestyle," which is often lauded as the greatest freestyle of all-time. L also shows diversity and impeccable storytelling skills as displayed by "The Heist" and "Casualties of a Dice Game" (despite its weak beat).  What I like about this better than other posthumous albums in hip-hop is that this actually sounds like the style of production that he would rock over. It's a great album and it only supports the claim that he is the "King of the Punchline." The 'ask Beavis / I get nuthin' Butt-Head' has become legendary. He's amazing lyrically. He raps the way he talks and raps with a swagger that Jay-Z would later inherit. He is dearly missed and it's unfortunate that he was only alive for one album to master. 
 i was driving home from work, listening to my local college radio station, and i heard "get myself into it" ... i was awkened from deep thought and was wondering what i was listening to... the "sound" reminded me of NYC 1981 ... but i wasn't sure ... i heard the dj announce the name of the band, i bought the cd the following day, and i can't wait to see this band perform live ... you might not like every track on this cd, but to this listener's ears, the majority of tracks are well worth the purchase price ... can't wait to get ahold of their first record.. 
 I bought the Glannon Guide instead of E&E sort of by accident, but it was fantastic.  The E&E is also a great help, but this one is a faster read and the MC questions throughout the chapter are helpful for appying what you learn.  I spent an entire day during finals week(s) reading this book, and it was the absolute best use of my time.  Thanks Prof. Glannon = 
 Truly, here is a very exciting book. The author clearly, in three long chapters (with appendices) discusses the Trojan War in the evidence of the Epic Cycle and its relation to the Homeric poems. The author has brought together philology, history, archaeology and good sense here. He shares bright arguments and suggestions in these pages that provoke thought for those interested specifically in the poems of Homer or in epic generally. Far from stealing the sparkle of the Homeric poems, this book provides the best discussion I have read of the variant threads of the stories of the Trojan War current in the age of the oral composition of the Iliad and Odyssey. It seemed so improbable that such magnificent, encyclopedic poems would stridently bound from the dark, poetic silence of the early Greek Mediterranean. Burgess shows that they didn't and that already at the time of the composition of the Homeric poems there existed a bounty of versions of the Trojan War that bore no direct relation to the poems of Homer as we know them. I recommend this timely book (timely, for it seems there is enough research to be thoroughly convincing, to me,) to teachers of Homer, early Greek culture and epic 
 The first edition of this book was fantastic. The second edition has given readers wonderful new additions. There is now more information included for budding illustrators. More in-depth insights into the pros and cons of using an agent have also been added. Overall, this is a fabulous resource for anyone in the field--from the inexperienced writers just starting out to the more experienced authors out there 
 Coffee Technology was written in 1963, it contains all the wealth of experience gathered by Mr. Sivetz, a chemical engineer and coffee consultant, while designing, installing, and starting up coffe processing plants all over the world. The subjects covered range from drying the  grain, psychrometric charts, roasting coffee, percolation, aromatizing  soluble coffee, packaging roast coffee. All subjects are covered in depth  in a "Theory and Practice" format where the process is analized  with formulas for pressure drop, temperature and pressure changes, mass  flow and later, experimental results are provided. Allthough it was written  over 27 years ago, the information is valid because the markets for coffee  change but the physics of the process is the same 
 Dean Koontz's Frankenstein books, each of which are co-authored by other writers, are entertaining, quick reads. While I am looking forward to the next installment, and am interested in what happens to the characters, I can't help wondering if they would be "better" if Mr Koontz wrote them alone. The normal Koontz-ian character development doesn't seem as thorough, and the build-up of suspense is not as acute. 
 My Panasonic RV31K is five years old this month and after thousands of hours playing movies it works just as well today as when I first took it out of the box. Panasonic makes quality products and just like anything else mechanical you can get a lemon. If this player ever dies (cross my fingers) I will get another Panasonic. I choose mine after reading all of the reviews here and in epinions.co 
 Malamud's book is the story of a man who moves across the country to try a new life as a college instructor. As a college instructor myself, the politics he deals with rang true. I was mainly impressed, however, with the  thoughts inside this characters head. I often read novels in which I come  across something and think "No man I know would ever think this",  but I never felt that way here. I didn't like the ending (I thought the  character made a bad choice) but Malamud is under no contract to clear his  endings with me first. A good solid read 
 I felt that this was a wonderful film, as we are presented with a naked look at these nude stars. The background discussion about the porn industry was very inlightening, and it told some interesting stories from the horses mouth. Yes there are some tragic tales, but some of the stores are far from tragic. The key thing (I think) is that it is not some activist (from either side of the fence) talking about hoor what the industry is doing to these "poor girls" but we get to hear the views and opinions directly from the ladies who both love the industry as well as feel trapped by it 
 This album deserves to be kept as a gem in my CD treasury.  I suppose one of the strong points about"Safe in a Crazy World" is that it reflects what almost everyone is going through ~ falling down, getting lost, and eventually taking faith in going the right direction.  The melody scripts are very well written,with interesting rhythm where you'd least expect it.  What I also like as well, is Corrine's clear enunciation.  As a whole, this is a rather spiritual and uplifting album, such as  ~angels ~ and a dose of humour  ~If I kissed you ~  : 
 There are forces of destiny in our lives that go beyond chance, like astrology. Everyone is affected by Mercury Retrograde. Chrissie Blaze gives us an effective and practical way of handling its disruptive influence, and even turning it into a gift. Infact, she shows us the Cosmic purpose of Mercury Retrograde - and how to utilize it to produce a happier, more fulfilling life. With the law of karma, one learns that what was once considered inevitable and fated, can infact be changed... and so too the influence of Mercury Retrograde. Chrissie writes with clarity and simplicity of an ancient science that has increasingly of late become all too complex and mathematical. This is a fun, practical, meaningful and eagerly awaited book 
 If you and your partner have the patience to work through this together, it will enhance your understanding of your own motives as well as your partners.  My partner and I are about 1/2 way through and I can honestly say that the improvement in our relationship has been so substantial that I went from depressed/hopeless/thinking of leaving to committed to making it work--together 
 I sympathize with another reviewer who was not expecting a Christian book when she bought this.  I was unsure about it myself. But it turned out to be so medically excellent that I'd hate for readers to reject it on that account alone.    The amount of space devoted to spiritual advice is very small. Most chapters deal with their subject alone ("Phytoestrogens," "Soothing the angry gut," "Skin Hair and Bones," "Menstrual Migraines" etc.).  Even the chapter on Stress mentions God only briefly at the end, and its info on the relationship between stress hormones and female hormones was enlightening.  Part 5, "The Power for Change," talks a bit more about God, but even there, the emotional emphasis is on embracing change and connecting with others.  Christianity is only part of a chapter that, in turn, is only 9 pages anyway.  References to the helpfulness of prayer are sprinkled throughout the book, but sparsely, and many of those reference the Hebrew Bible.  I completely support any readers who want no Christian slant in such a book.  This one just isn't for you.  But many non-Christian readers might not mind Smith's light touch.  She believes that a spiritual center can be immensely beneficial during stress and change, and there's a lot to be said in favor of that.  Though Smith might be horrified by my saying this, a reader can easily substitute her personal spirituality, Buddhism, the Tao, anything, for Smith's.    Smith is NO lightweight when it comes to medicine and nutrition.  She never talks down to the reader or oversimplifies.  I thought I was already pretty knowledgeable, but was surprised by how much biology and physiology I learned.  It's very up-to-date as of my writing this review, and covers HRT studies that have recently made the news.   Boxes in the margins organize and emphasize important points and information.    Coverage of nutrition is thorough and intelligent, not only about what to eat, but also the importance of timing.  There's a nice recipe section for those who like to cook, and terrific general food advice that lets those of us with a cooking-aversion put together a good simple eating plan for balancing blood sugar, energy, mood, and weight.  The only weak point, to me, was the insomnia chapter.  It was the standard advice about making the bedroom dark and cool enough, not using it for work or other stress activities, winding down, avoiding spicy foods, etc. etc.  Heard it all before!  Then again, I'm not finding any better advice anywhere else, and these are sound principles, just a bit wimpy in coping with a perimenopause insomnia.  Smith's blood-sugar balancing diet can help these nighttime problems.  Great book for Christian women, still great for non-Christians who buy it knowingly, and can take the many benefits it offers, cafeteria-style 
 This book, the second in the Dream series, is about Kate Powell, a distant relative of the Templeton's that comes to live with them after her parents are killed in a car accident when  Kate is 8.  Kate is not beautiful like Margo or sophisticated like Laura.  She is an over achiever.  She feels that the only way to pay the Templeton's back for everything they've done for her is to be the best at what she does.  She's a whiz with numbers, so she becomes an accountant at a well-respected firm, with the hopes of soon becoming a partner.  She obsesses over everything, never feeling like she's good enough.  One day at work, she discovers that her father was accused of embezzling money and was faced with going to jail when he died. She also learns the Templeton's replaced the money he took, but never said anything to her.  Shortly after learning that, she is accused by the partners in her firm of embezzling from their clients and is asked to take a leave of absence until it can be resolved.  Destroyed and humiliated, she puts up a wall rather than fight the charges because she doesn't want her father's past revealed.  Enter Byron DeWitt, the new head of the Templeton hotel in Monterey.  Kate and Byron start out detesting each other, but learn to tolerate each other and eventually become friends.  The attraction between them develops over time.  Kate suffers severe stomach pains in his company twice, the second time landing her in the hospital against her wishes.  Kate finds out she has an ulcer and is near exhaustion.  She is taken back to Templeton House to recover.  Byron helps her begin an excerise and weight lifting program and that's when the attraction between them takes off.  With her career in shambles, Kate becomes a more active partner in Pretenses.  She has never been a people person, preferring to be alone with her calculator and spread sheets, but to her surprise, she enjoys her work there.  Of course, she is cleared of the embezzlement charges and is offered a partnership at her old firm, but she turns it down finally realizing that it wasn't as important as she thought it was.  She also realizes how important Byron is to her.  This was a wonderful story.  Nora Roberts knows how to develop her characters.  She is at her best when she writes her trilogies.  I highly recommend this series, but you should read them in order to follow the story from the beginning 
 This is a good high-level book for a first software engineering course. It mentions things like critical systems, object oriented programming, and real -time systems, but at a very high level; so it should not be used for a specialized course. It provides many helpful examples and diagrams. My only complaint is that the chapters are very long, and a lot of things are repeated several times. I think this book could easily be 75% shorter without loosing any important information 
 This is a must have for all LV officianados. I have been collecting and using LV for over twenty-one years. This is an excellent literary and pictorial compilation of La Maison de Vuitton. Cudos! to the author, publisher, and of course La Maison de Vuitton for their continued commitment to perfection, elegance, and extrordinary products. Cudos, to the artisians for their pain-staking perfectionism in creating such works of art. This book is a tribute to over 150 years of leathercrafting, and now within the past 5 years pret-de-porte, couture, and precious metals. Vuitton continues to allow those of us loyal to the House to continue pushing the boundaries of style and fashion,and subtly encouraging admirer's of the House to indulge.   Life is a journey, so why not travel with the best. Well done LV! Tres magnifique!  
 IN A NUTSHELL: 'HOP ON POP' HAS EVERYTHING NEEDED TO GET A CHILD INTERESTED IN READING  1]- It is colorful, simple and attractive in its presentation of shapes, words and sounds.  2]- 'Hop On Pop' makes a kind of perfect sense for the very early reader who has a child's interests rather than an adults, which is as it should be.  3]- For early readers the words beg to be sounded-out and connected to the interesting drawings. This encourages a type of thinking that brings reading comprehension to the child, without the child or parent/educator forcing it.  BOTTOM LINE: A KIND OF MUSIC FOR READING COMPREHENSION TEXT  'Hop On Pop' offers an extreme organized simplicity that allows a young reader to enter a compelling and curious world. A child can gather the meaning of the book as he/she proceeds at their own pace, spending time checking-out and sounding-out the words, images and rhymes because they are fun. In the end, the early reader may reach a kind of full understanding of the book which might make the next book easier and faster to be understood.   
 Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross...Doesn't get much better than that.  Monica Potter ...well, look up cute in the dictionary..Her picture is there.  Anyway, this had some serious plot twists that somehow all seemed to make sense as they got tied together.  Morgan Freeman continues to demonstrate that he is one of the best actors in film today. 
 This is a great buy because I have a lot of space. I use the card on my Digital Camera and I take a lot of pictures without download to the computer. I can go on la large weekend trip and take my pictures and download it until I`m back home.  It's a great card at a very good price 
 THE GANGS ALL HERE is a perfect example of a 1st Class musical film of the 40's.  Busby Berkley pulled all the stops out when he directed this classic.  The extras this DVD is a great insight into the making of these wonderful films. I must congratulate UCLA film archives for resurrecting films such as these, to show this generation how it was all done. 
 Amazingly boring subject for me. Only got it because I had to. It is written well 
 This is a good dictionary for Shakespears terms. I was proven wrong when I thought I would never find many of the words I found. I would recommend it 
 This study helped me a lot with spreading the word to others, I am using this as a Bible study at my teen youth group. I believe that everyone needs to know how to proprerly and effectivly spred his word and save other and this book tells you how 
 Asimov takes it to the next level with Second Foundation. It has more charecter development, more technology, more suspense, more cunning, and an unsuspected ending for once. This book is great. If your reading this book its probably because you've read the other two, but if you ever want to read a great science fiction book, its worth the time it takes to read the first two(which are also very good) to get to this masterpiece 
 my son read this at his school and liked it so much we bought it 
 The book Apostle of the Crucified Lord is a great tool to be used when examining Paul's letters.  It really help to understand the times that they were written in and the culture in the days of early Christianity.  I am currently using the book for a college theology class and I also know of two other universities using it for the same class. 
 I was excited about this collection, but I thought it was 37 dollars and 75 cents, so I was a bit disconcerted to find a $3,775 dollar charge to my Visa.  However, once I started reading the collection, I realized it was worth every penny of the cost -- for all you get, this is an absolute steal, really!  Now I'm sending the collection to friends and family as gifts.  Take out a loan, beg, borrow or steal: Do whatever you need to do to get the money to order this series -- you won't be disappointed 
 What can I say, I can watch this over and over and not feel the same as watching today's ER, and that's a good thing.  Dr. Greene, Carter, seeing the romance and wonder between Carol and Doug, nothing comes close to this first season, worth every penny and full of reminiscent scenes.  
 i have been practising for about 4 months, the first part of the book which consists of learning to feel(kinesthetically) energy(chi) moving thru my body. if u practise about 15 min a day for a few months u will definetly become more sensitve to your body. i have had a lot of stress in my life and as a result i used to get mouth ulcers all the time(like 3 or 4 at once) these would last 2-3 weeks before the would disapear and this is using every conventional medicine under the sun. with my nei gung practise they disappear overnight or even the same day. + i can get rid of headaches real quick. i have also noticed parts of my body opening up and then close up again. i now believe as bkf says that eventually my whole body will open up and stay open and that i will b able to feel different organs in my body and the state they r in, and direct energy to them if need b and hence solve problems b4 they become more problematic. this is so simple to practise)(read the instuctions carefully) no guru is needed if u do this. incredibly simple, amazingly effective!!! 
 When WWI broke out, many artists who had done challenging works decided that what people needed were not grim images but rather happy works to get them through difficult times.  A similar transformation seems to have happened with Varley.  This novel is a cross between a Heinlein juvenile, Explorers and The Navigator.  A group of young adults, aided by a savant's McGuffin, embark on a plan to build a Little Rascal's spaceship.  Folks who expect the old Varley, who could run sexual politics through with a rapier so thin that his books were prominently featured in lesbian bookstores that did not get the joke will find none of this here.  What they will find is a fun, fast-paced, well written, feel-good nostalgic adventure.  A medicine for melancholy.  As a long-time Floridian, I can say that Varley really knows Florida, from the tourist traps to the parts that tourists (we call them Snowbirds) never imagine exist.  Carl Hiassen is a mere hack by comparison 
 A good read if you have an hour and a half to kill.  He has a grasp of tactics with time lag imposed.  He remembers logistics as far as raw materials are involved. I have yet to see fuel requirements addressed. I look forward to seeing how the series plays out 
  Jimmy Nash and Tess Bailey are together again.  Well sort of.  Several months ago, Tess, a computer analyst, helped Nash save his best friend and colleague Decker from a potential hit.  With the adrenaline running high and eyes wide open, Nash and Tess had a one night stand after all was said and done.  Now, they are part of a team sent to Kazbekistan to help recover a laptop with enough information that could put a major dent in the fight against terrorism.  Can these two work together or will their attraction get them killed?  Flashpoint is a fast paced, edge of your seat thriller set in Kazbekistan.  Nash is a bad ass agent who plays hard and works harder.  His nonchalant attitude has gotten him in trouble more than once.  In the case of Tess, his best friend Decker has some feelings for her that Nash either fails to realize or can't resist.  It's an interesting subplot of two friends attracted to the same woman.  At first, I didn't know who I wanted to root for, but as the plot thickened Nash seemed to be the better choice despite his dark side.  He has enough personal issues to fill a book, but with Tess he shows a softer edge.  He begins to care about her as a person rather than a potential lay or fellow agent.  The moments of tenderness he shows made me realize he is a good man.  He just doesn't know how to express himself.  He has been an agent for so long that I don't think he knows how to be anything else.  It's like he doesn't know where his life as an agent ends and he, as a person, begins.  Tess is an awesome computer analyst, but a green field agent.  On her first assignment, she is out of her element.  In Kazbekistan, she sees the worst that reality has to offer but still remains upbeat.  Her optimism was a breath of fresh air even in the darkest times.  I admired her stubbornness and love for Nash because she could see the person he could be under all of the arrogance and attitude.  Yet she would not ask for more than what he could offer.  She would not beg him to love her.  It was all or nothing for her.  Flashpoint is my first Suzanne Brockmann book, but definitely not my last.  The characters are richly detailed and flawed.  Tess, Nash and the secondary characters are real.  Under the harshest conditions, they do and see things that would make a normal person cringe.  I was riveted by the story and all of the subplots that were seamlessly interwoven throughout the book.  Each one helped drive the story, not diminishing the overall storyline.  I could not stop reading because I needed to know what happened next.  I hope each of the secondary characters will have their own story because they are so fascinating.  Flashpoint is a wonderful thriller that will keep you riveted until the last page.   Lee Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewe 
 Despite the abscence of any writers of color and the inclusion of a single female, this is a well-rounded collection of in-depth interviews with fascinating insights into process, inspiration, motivation, philosophy and, in some cases, barely contained egomania.  A must-have for aspiring writers and fanboys alike 
 This book moved me in much the way Walden did.  It is the story of a Japanese scientist who leaves the "civilized world" and returns to the country to live with the land.  Fukoka is much more than a simple  farmer, he's an eco-visionary, and his story is most worth hearing 
 The _Short Oxford History of Europe_, under the general editorship of T.C.W. Blanning, is an especially well-edited series of 11 brief but meaty topical surveys covering the region's entire recorded history, from Ancient Greece to the latter part of the 20th century. The reader is assumed already to know the broad outlines of European history and to want look below the surface of events to the underlying forces and trends. While each volume is composed of a series of articles by experts who bring unique understanding and insights the result is much more integrated and consistent than that of the usual collective work. The transitions between volumes are well managed so that the series can be read as a seamless history from start to finish if desired, but the reader who is looking only for insight into a particular period can read just one or two volumes without feeling that he is missing the secret key.  The overall impression, in fact, is a good deal like a far shorter (and much more affordable) version of the _Cambridge History_  series.   The chief lack is of good references to sources. At the end of each volume is a "further reading" section which is generally pretty thorough and helpful, but there is no way to tell where a particular fact or insight comes from except in those cases where the chapter author has mentioned the origin in his or her text.  It should be understood that these are not narrative histories of the events of their periods. A timeline of major events is provided at the back, but the chapters cover topics rather than sub-periods, and generally are not themselves organized chronologically.   This volume on the Central Middle Ages (a.k.a. High Middle Ages) is well up to the standards of the series, a very high standard. Amazon's helpful "Look Inside" feature gives a good idea of its contents and style. In addition to a series of clear and helpful maps the volume closes with a useful glossary of terms 
 I highly recommend this great little light. It is very flexible and holds its position well. It s very bright with a wide lighting area. A++++ 
 It is said that when the director was deciding who to play the parts of this Shakespeare comedy, he was visiting Elizabeth and Richard during one of their marital fights.   He knew then who had to star in his production.   His choice was perfect with Richard Burton as the light-hearted but firm Petrucio and Liz as the firey untamed sultress.   This one will have you in stitches in short order while enjoying some of the most colorful lines of the english language.  The quintessential Catherine and Petrucio 
 This book is about a girl named Morgan who looses her best friend  Jason. He killed himself and Morgan has to put up with all the pain. Jason's other friends and Morgan get together to deal with it easier. The three of them join a suicide pact together. They are each going to take a bottle of aspirins just like Jason did to kill himself. They keep getting interrupted and they have to decide if they are going to do it or not. They also figure out the secret of why Jason did what he did. Read the book to figure it out. 
 This book is one of the great milestones of American history and philosophy and particularly education. It's as relevant today as the day it was written a century ago 
 Just a brief note.  I recently bought several copies of Possum's Harvest Moon as gifts   for some young relatives. It's turned out to be one of those  books that they just can't put down! It's a constant request  either at bedtime or during a quite time.     The book is especially good because it gives character to some of  night's creatures and also leaves room for the kids imagination 
 I thank God that people like Alan take the time to write their wisdom in an easy to grasp book. We are talking years of hard won experience and true expertise in the field, and it's all put down in 220 pages. Reading this book is like doing time-travel. You spend 3 days and you gain 20 years 
 Not a very auspicious beginning to what is now known as a modern literary classic. Even further, not quite the introduction to James Joyce I had hoped for. However, as I delved into A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, I realized just how revolutionary Joyce has been in the evolution of modern literature. The stream of consciousness format of his writing was something new to me -- I loved being able to feel Stephen's maturation and progression of thought. Another treat was the constant backdrop of conflict between various Irish sects. I always find myself fascinated by Irish history (perhaps because it is so very lively). The religious themes throughout the novel were fodder for some heavy thinking; being raised a Christian put Stephen's struggles into a different perspective for me. All in all, an amazing read. I'm starting Dubliners, and I can't wait for more of Joyce's poetic, eloquent work 
 This album already has it's place in the annals of electronic music. DJ Shadow knows his stuff, and it showed IMMEDIATLEY with the original release of this debut album.  With the deluxe addition, there's a new disc of remixes and B-sides and demos. For any real Shadow fans, it's a must have. There's a fine remix of Bulding Steam With A Grain Of Salt, the song many consider to be the best from Endtroducing. There's also a great Gift of Gab remix of Midnight In A Perfect World, with some nice lyric poetry. And at the end of the disc is a twelve minute mini set of Shadow live, which is hot as hell.  If you've never heard of the Shadow, do yourself a favor and pick up this deluxe edition - it's oh so worth it.  Producing. .  
 Incredible book expressing the principles of genuine success in life.  Napolean Hill is a master at describing and articulationg how to become a truly successful human being, not just monetarily rich.  Highly Recommended 
 This book gives a nice introduction to Econometrics. It goes well when explains difficult concepts with lots of details and examples in a clear straight forward approach.  It lacks a little of rigorous proofs. It's more for you to understand what is econometrics, how to apply it and basic problems associated to it.  For more advances and rigorous texts, check the also excellent Gujarati's book, Fumio Hayashi's Econometrics and Greene's Econometrics Analysis 
 Many people became aware of Frank Abagnale Jr's story until the movie starring Tom Hanks and Leonardo Dicapprio was released (even though an earlier movie based on this story was released).  While not as flowing as the movie, the story told in this book seems much more realistic and true too life, containing many of Abagnale's earlier mistakes & lessons we  don't get to see in the movie. On the other hand, many parts of it do seem to be missing - such as why Air France would take such an interest in catching Frank, even though the airlines he was cheating seemed to be mostly American based?  This is an interesting read as a background to the movie, and to those who would like to learn what had inspired many of the movie's major storylines 
 The original title of this re-release is "The Magic of Food" from 1990. Llewellyn has put this book back into print.   I love the opening lines "Food is essential to our lives.  For many of us, the art of cooking and eating is a chore.  For others, it is a great delight.  And for some, the culinary arts and their products are indulgences.  Food is substituted for love.  Food is an excuse.  Food is a god."  Scott explores all these aspects of food, as well as its magical properties and how this magic affects us and can be worked into our lives.   The first part of the book is a small introduction to the magic of cooking, associations, tools, histories, practicing food magic and even some discussion on vegetarianism.    The meat and potatoes, if you will, of the book are the sections on specific types of foods.  The foods are broken down into groups, like bread and grains, fruit, spices and herbs, etc. Common names, specific names, ruling planets, ruling elements, energies, lore and magical uses are explored, explained and looked at in its uses in magic and healthy living.  Mini-discussion on uses of salt in foods, substitutes for additives that do not promote overall good health, the healing qualities of foods, little known facts on food usages and food preparation make each of the topics covered interesting as well as useful.  "Nuts & Alleged Nuts .   It is curious that one contemporary slang term for insanity is "nuts," as in, "That politician's gone nuts."  In the past, these crunchy foods were thought to bestow wisdom, not mental derangement.*"    Footnote "*Then again, wisdom and insanity are often subjectively determined."  Scott's wit and humor are prevalent throughout the book as well as generous helpings of his wisdom and vast knowledge base.    And we are also treated to "Scott's Favorite Recipes".   Appetizers, such as magic herb toast, beverages, desserts, main dishes. all here for you to consider and concoct in your own kitchen.  Even magical soups and romantic salads are here for you to consider.   The book has a good table of contents, indexed, and contains a good glossary, tables of correspondences and bibliography.  There is a mail order resource list which appears to be current, where you can get those hard to find ingredients.    Overall, a good book for your library, a better book for your kitchen and an essential book to have in your Cunningham library. boudic 
 I had bought the 2006 calendar and felt compelled to buy the 2007. This is a beautiful calendar with pictures from all over the world 
 The Rockford Files by far was the best television show of the 1970's, and probably has not been surpassed yet.  Season Two does not disappoint.  The only thing dated about this series are the automobiles.  The acting and writing are as fresh today, as they were thirty years ago.  If you were to pick just one television series to own-drama, or comedy- it should be the Rockford Files 
 Traviss's background as a journalist and familiarity with the military adds authority to this depiction of Royal Marines and other humans interacting with four different sapient races. However, this doesn't mean this is typical military SF. There is tension, but little violence, at least by the humans. Also, as a previous reviewer noted, environmental issues are central to this series. Third in the series, this book maintains the first two books' uniformly high quality and continues the high drama of flawed individuals trying to do what's right. While the series reportedly will continue in other books, in this book it reaches a satisfying conclusion; and while reading the first two would make it easier to follow the action, Traviss gives enough backstory so that a newcomer can pick up the thread 
 I cannot believe that this material is not standard material for schools.  Coupled with "Good to Great," "Topgrading," and "The Toyota Way" you've got the ammo you need to be a killer leader.  Pro: -Reveals one of the great secrets how "true leaders" separate themselves from everyone else (based on numerous hours of first-hand corporate study) -Describes "fight and flight" and other responses and how to tame them -Details a near foolproof method/recipe for approaching others when stakes are high, topics are embarrassing, people disagree, etc. -There is a two-day class that I took with this book which is the only commercial class I recommend.  Find it and take it! -I have improved myself immensely, have successfully approached beligerant co-workers and to diffuse tense family clashes.  I've even been thanked for doing it!  Con: -I honestly can't think of any  Bottom line: this book is a must read for everyone.  Applies to everyday life, in and out of work.  I also got the CDs, which are good now and again during my commute 
 While I am not a big fan of this two-in-one component for CDs/DVDs (preferring to get separate discs in one pack in order to reduce scratching), the work itself is remarkable.  This is a wonderful collection of live songs performed with much grace and passion. This seminal artist really knows how to connect with his audience, creating rapport and the sense that each song comes alive uniquely each time that it is played. Gaines is an excellent raconteur (by telling hilarious stories between songs), which really must be experienced first hand by attending one of his shows. I had the good fortune of catching his recent show at Satalla in NYC. David Bowie once wrote, "Ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?"   Seeing Gaines live will fill your eyes with plenty of tears of joy. He is a master of songwriting and conveying true emotion. 
 Greetings from Bella Bella, BC and thank you for providing a forum for readers to express their admiration and awe for the writers and publishing houses who support them.   I am sorry to intrude on this review station for his other book; however, I believe this may help all parties rooting for Mr.Tosches.   I have re-read Nick Tosches' "Trinities" now for the third time. If you have not read this novel, wind sprint to your nearest bookstore and pick it up.   Nick Tosches has unleashed hell on earth with this powerful, brutal and unapologetic story about men killing each other off to control the worldwide herion export/import business.   I think Nick Tosches is a man who knows way too much and I am glad his publisher gave him the support to publish this book. I want, however, to give the publisher heck for using possibly the worst cover I have ever seen on any book. That's right! The first cover on the mass trade paperback was horrible and really revealed nothing about the true power and wisdom waiting to be told in the following pages. I am glad to see a new cover on the novel. I have no doubt this will increase sales and perhaps spur more great reviews for Mr. Tosches.   I cannot find any of Nick's other books in Canada and am desperately trying to find them. Can anyone out there help me?   Nick Tosches, you have written one of the most powerful books I have ever read. You managed to capture the strangest beauty in your brutal, bloody story. I do not know how you did it, but you did. Congratulations and please hurry up and come out with another great novel.    Your fan,     Richard Van Cam 
 But I loved the concept and the story of this book.  It was fun 
 It is difficult to find books in this genre that have a new flare to them. Usually the story lines are similiar as well as the characters. This had some of that, but the magical part of it, made for a new twist to the average story line.  It takes a little bit of reading to really get into the book though. The beginning catches your attention, but then it quickly jumps back in the past and you have to learn about how the characters grew up together and fought until they reached adulthood. That part of it is a bit slow. By the time they do grow up, it gets much more interesting and even touches the heart strings a bit. Not my favorite by Nora Roberts, but it was alright as a contemporary romance 
 I liked the unit. it is very well built, materials and workmanship are close to perfect, sound quality is also very good. at least more than enough for a car.  Mp3 player is quite fast - it takes 2-3 seconds to recognize the disk. "Random play" is not really random - the sequence is always the same and very predictable.  Controls are convinient, radio reception is also very good.   The only issue which is VERY annoing - blue leds highhlighing push-buttons are EXTREMELY bright. there is no way to dim them or swith off. it's hard to drive at the night time with the unit on. I had to make a small black paper cover for it to get rid of this bright light: 
 I grew up watching martial arts movies and always wanted to see one that has more depth and meaning.  This movie does not follow the sterotypical path of most chinese martial arts films.  The actors communicate on many different levels that one would not expect.  I was very pleased and inspired by this movie.  This will be on the top of my favorites list for many decades 
 God, I love me some Wilson brothers... especially with Wes at the helm. They are so kooky and yet entirely endearing and approachable. The script is endlessly quotable, the construction of the film is tight and smooth all at once... it's funny as hell with characters you can't help loving. I watch this movie over and over, and when my eight year old daughter quotes Dignan (Owen): "You do not give a $500 tip to the housekeeper. That's inappropriate!" (with perfect inflections) I just about die laughing 
 This book provides a great overview of the developing technolgies in digital design and fabrication.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a comprehensive study in the current trends in digital architecture.  A series of 20+ articles by designers working in this area of architecture, this book updates the conversation to what is happening today and what is being projected in the future.  Great resource 
 It's easy to understand why Alfred Hitchcock was influenced by Diabolique.  Many still believe this to be one of the greatest thrillers ever filmed.  The movie contains many of what would become Hitchcock trademarks, clean editing, edgy themes, and escalating suspense.  Two scenes stand out: the swimming pool sequence and the return of the victim.  Though the movie may move a bit slowly for today's audiences, those two scenes alone make this must see cinema. 
 Hollywood make them, then they break them -- stars can fall as fast as they rise. Sometimes they rise again, and sometimes they disappear.   And Christopher Guest casts a jaded eye on the fickle ups and downs of Hollywood in "The Big Picture," a quirky, cynical movie which focuses on what the successful should never let go of. It has a few awkward stretches, but overall it's a darkly witty cult comedy ("You're tracking failure all over my carpet!").  Nick Chapman (Kevin Bacon) is the winner at an arty student movie competition, and instantly agents are chasing him all over L.A. In no time, he's the Rising Young Director, with a movie deal at a major movie corporation. But he's also starting to lose sight of his old life, as he tries to become a major success.  He changes the style, plot and characters of his arty movie for demographics, turning it into a beach bums/naked ghost movie. He dumps his pretty girlfriend (Emily Longstreth) for a bimbo actress (Teri Hatcher). When the studio head gets dropped, Nick falls as quickly as he rose. But a chance encounter with an old pal gives him a second chance -- an arty music video. This time, can he get it right?  Christopher Guest is best known for his brilliant mockumentaries, tackling everything from small-town musicals to folk festivals. His forthcoming one is another one about showbiz. But his talents are just as present in a "typical" movie, and Guest does a smart, quirky job of it.  The lesson: Be true to yourself and your art, don't fall for empty glitz, and don't let success go to your head if you're lucky enough to get it.   The story is a pretty straightforward one -- Nick gets great success, it goes to his head, he falls, and he rises again a wiser man. And the movie falls into straightforward lines, without many unpredictable plot twists. At first glance, it doesn't seem that unusual.  What makes it special? Well, simply put, Guest manages to infuse it with his unique type of wit, like the oddballish Pez music video and the noir fantasies of Nick's life. Not to mention the glorious dialogue. When speaking of Nick's one'n'only music video, a studio woman announces, "It's the best one yet, and I've seen 'em ALL!"  And Guest manages to show us agents, artists, students, directors and actors, but never descended to cliches. They're real people, no matter how nasty. And Bacon does a solid job as a young man who learns how empty glitz is. His best scene is the reunion with his friend Emmet, where he confesses, "I wanna be your friend again." And he's backed by good performances by Longstreth, Michael McKean and a dancing Jennifer Jason Leigh.  "Big Picture" treads where many movies have gone before, but it does so with an approach as fresh as a Pez People music video. A must-see 
 Wilson Pickett is one of the best in soul music and this Cd has the best of his music on it. If you too like soul music this Cd is a must to have 
 This is John Mayall at his creative best. At a time when music was getting louder, Mayall took it down a notch. Believing that each instrument creates it's own rhyhm, he eliminated drums from his music and set out on his sojourn. The result is "Turning Point." This recording not only changed how I looked at the blues, it changed forever how I looked at music altogether 
 The late Dr. Davis produced this book as part of the material used for training his grad students in WWII about chemical engineering aspects of explosives. However, the best part of the book is probably the section on  the history and development of explosives. Davis was one of those  scientists who had a rare grasp not only of the theoretical and practical  aspects of his field, but also its historical underpinnings. This book  doesn't compare with Urbanski as far as chemical engineering goes, but  rather gives a brief overview of many diffrent materials that were in use  in the mid twentieth century. I wouldn't recommend this book as a lab  manual, but would heartily endorse it as a place to begin the study of the  history of this aspect of science 
 The best book on basic economics I've ever read. It's clear, succint and covers the subject better than anything I've ever read on the subject. It should be required reading in our schools and for anyone holding public office. Every voter should have a copy of it just to find out how far from economic reality many of our public officials really are. I have several other books by Thomas Sowell - all of them excellent in their insightfulness. His writing is "Plain talk, easy understood." 
 However, did anyone else notice how 25 years later, Dabney Coleman is referring to Tomlin, Fonda and Parton as "gals" and "girls" in the 9 to 5 at 25 featurette? Made me wonder.... 
 My pediatrician recommended it after the birth of my first child. It was fun and fascinating to understand better how my babies brain was developing. I read and reread each chapter. I have bought it as a baby gift for at least ten people 
 "Cash Tracks..." in an indepensable guide about how to get on with the business side of being creative within the music scoring world (a side which is sorely overlooked).   It presents no end of ideas, tried and tested successfully, which can imrove your music business strategy and start you making MONEY from music. Please don't be put off by the "life is great!!!" american-ness of it all, this guy-heck, this book-is a full on money making machine. Practical, down-to-earth.  Invaluable. 
 No other biography i've read places the man himself before me, so evocative is it. In his films he chased and captured the wonder in all things, but his own writing does this more directly, a wonderful book. The life of the film maker from the 1920's onwards, and one who can fully express himself descriing the life, and equally great on his growing up towards film. The maker of wonders like A Canterbury Tale, Small Back Room, The Spy In Black and Peeping Tom achieved as much in this book 
 Bertrand Russell's greatest pieces of philosophical writing could probably be said to be "The Principles of Mathematics", "On Denoting" and with Alfred North Whitehead "Principia Mathematica", there is however one sense in which it could be said that the russellian magnum opus is The Principles of Mathematics, from here on TPM.   TPM is, arguably, the culmination in print of a long process of thought and concern, philosophically speaking, of Russell's intellectual preoccupations from his adolescence, youth and maturity with questions relating to the foundations of mathematics. Ever since Russell read Mill in his adolescence he had thought there was something suspect with the millian view that mathematical knowledge is in some sense empirical. Though he lacked the sophistication at the time to propose a different view of the foundations in mathematics his concerns with these topics remained with him well into the completion of Principia Mathematica. Logic and Mathematics were, by that time, seen as separate subjects dealing with distinct subject-matters, it came to be, however, the intuition of Russell (an intuition shared, and indeed, anticipated by Frege) that mathematics was nothing more than the later stages of logic. He did not came into this view easily, after a long period of hegelianism and kantianism in philosophy, in which Russell sought to overcome the so called antinomies of the infinite and the infinitesimal, etc; Russell saw light coming, not from the works of philosophers, but from the work of mathematicians working to introduce rigour in mathematics. Through the developments introduced by such mathematicians as Cantor and Dedekind Russell saw, or indeed thought he saw, that the difficulties in the notion of infinite and infinitesimal could be dealt with by solely mathematical methods, and it was through the continued development of formal logic by Peano and his followers that Russell saw the possibility of defining the notions of zero, number & successor in purely logical terms. Before all of these developments and ideas were put together by Russell and developed into the philosophy of mathematics known as logicism he made several sophisticated though unsuccesful attempts at questions having to do with the foundations of mathematics, one such attempt is his "An Analysis of Mathematical Reasoning". In TPM all of these developments are taken together with the formal logic Russell was developing following the steps of Peano, indeed the TRUE foundations of mathematics are for Russell: the calculus of classes (Set Theory), the propositional calculus and the predicate calculus (first-order classical logic).      And indeed the book not only presents these developments, argues for them and introduces the reader to the whole theoretical and philosophical edifice of formal logic, but also with these tools Russell delves in an exploration of all or most concepts relevant in the mathematics of the day. He shows  that with the methods he proposes he can construct the whole of the real numbers, and that the concept of infinity can be dealt with through the set-theory of Cantor. Russell's theory of relations, a theory which made possible to deal with relations in formal logic as well as to refute the metaphysical views of Bradley and others, appears in the book. The chapter on "The Philosophy of the Infinite" is a tour de force for anyone interested in the philosophy of mathematics. This book is quite long, but it is absolutely breathtaking in its depth, its subtle arguments, its sophistication and originality (for its time). The book already contains a philosophy of language and reference not very different from that of Frege in "Sense and Reference". As I said, it is thorough in its philosophical examination and explanation of mathematical concepts, and it delves into physics through the russellian investigation of space and time, as well as his incorporation of logicism into physics through rational dynamics. Russell's paradox makes its first appeareance in this book, it has a chapter to itself. And indeed, Russell's theory of types also makes an appearance in an earlier form in one of its appendix. It is well known that Russell and Frege each came to his views independently, and indeed Russell had just read Frege by the time his book had been finished and so added another appendix discussing and commending Frege's work. All in all, this book is worth every penny, it is one of the masterpieces of XX century philosophy by any standards. One professor of mine once remarked that if Russell had developed his famous theory of descriptions by the time he wrote TPM and had included it in the book, the already master piece would then be wholly perfect, I am inclined to agree 
 Prety Good she has prety good songs my favortie Song is Get The Party Started she has alot of great music videos I wood anytime vote her for best music video so any good thank yo 
 I think the title is a bit misleading.  This book is a wealth of information in and of itself!  I read it after I had already read all of the Original 6 Volumes by CM herself.  This handy litte book by Penny Gardener is a treasure chest for anyone intersted in pursuing this method of education.  It is well written in "bite-size" pieces and easy to read/understand.  It is very compact and we are using it in our monthly support meetings with great success 
 The authors teach a highly influential course, "Reasoning from  History" at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.  The book has  great case studies of real decisions based, sometimes well, sometimes  badly, on historical precedent.  A wonderful book 
 This book is very useful in my practice as a general practitioner and Travel Medicine Specialist. It gives brief but concise up to date information about Tropical Diseases. I still use other refernces in addition for up to date information about diagnosis and treatment, but find this book as a good quick 'first stop'. The photographs, though interesting, are few and not particularly relevant for my practice in New Zealand.It is the course textbook for the Travel Medicine paper through Otago University.Good value for money 
 This is great, you get three books for the price of two.  All three of the first 3.5 Edition Core Books.  Seeing how the Player's Handbook is necessary to play, and the Monster Manual is almost mandatory, you might as well get the DM Guide for free 
 Doctor who materialised without his Tardis on this, my first timelord download in the amazon unbox, which is much larger on the inside than it appears on the outside.  For a very reasonable sum, $1.99, my family and I were able to enjoy the first Third doctor adventure after his regeneration, where he encounters the Nestene Conciousness.  The down load took only a few minutes although I had some considerable difficulty installing the microsoft program. thanks to the good people at amazon tech support I was able to obtain an alternative download from the gates empire itself which allowed me to enjoy our rental.  a great experience and will not be the last. easy to navigate and fun for all the family. someone should tell the timelords on gallifrey about unbox and perhaps they could get rid of all the old type 40 tardis' 
 A wonderful simple mix of arrangements and genre....some traditional classics, bluegrass and spirituals....and on many selections Ernie invites a quartet or more of other singers to join him. I miss Ernie Ford...a magnificent, underrated talent [even in his heyday]. A charming host who was unafraid to declare his homage to the Almighty at the close of each performance 
 I read the first book in the series with a slightly jaundiced eye. While passably written, it lacked freshness and I felt too bogged down in the details of the differences between the different human races.   Things improved noticably in this second book for me. There was less exposition and more focus on the characters. Particularly intriguing is the Yggur/Maigraith relationship-- I am genuinely curious to see where that goes.  I still did not like Karan (the main character), which makes it more challenging to like the book. Still, I am in more of a hurry to buy the third book then I was to buy the second 
 The only disappointment is that there aren't more of these holiday gems 
 The Duhks is a group of young twenty-something musicians all with amazing talent.  They are in a genre of their own, mixing bluegrass, gospel and blues together to make a sound that has never been heard before.  Jessee Havey, lead vocals, sings gospel like no one I've ever heard.  Her voice makes you want to cry, it's full with so much emotion and strength.  Tania Elizabeth, fiddle, is classicly trained and her talent is over the top amazing.  Tania's voice also blends beautifuly with Jessee's.  If you have ever seen The Duhks live, you know that the banjo player Leonard Podolak is quite a character.  His wonderful personality comes through his playing especially on the instrumentals.  Leonard sings lead on "Everybody Knows," which is one of my favorites and Leonard is probably the reason for that.  Jordan McConnell, guitar, makes his own instruments and you can really tell.  He knows how to play that guitar like it was made for him.  The music he makes is honest and beautiful.  Last but not even close to least is Scott "Senor" Senior, drums and percussion.  Scott plays drums that he makes.  they are wooden boxes that provide a full, earthy sound that compliments the other musicains perfectly.   Other than all of the musicians being incredibly talented, they also work perfectly together.  The problem with many young bands these days is the competition between members.  You never sense that with The Duhks and if you see them live you know there is no competition at all.  They often face eachother and play off eachother.  What they do together is truelly magical.    This CD is one of my favorites in my collection.  When I got this album two summers ago, it was on repeat for all of the season.  I have been fortunate enough to have seen them live twice.  They are five of the sweetest people.  Their shows are intimate and lively.  Afterwards they mingle with the audience and surprise everyone with their down to earth attitude.    Another wonderful thing about The Duhks sound is it can reach all age groups.  I'm a young adult and I adore them just as much as my parents who are the ones who introduced me to them.  At the concerts I've gone to, there have been people of all ages, from five years old to seventy years old and they all have the best time of their lives.    Buy this CD, you will not regret it 
 Or, if you have read and re-read the current bestseller Ahab's Wife, and you are looking for another classic treatment of the Moby Dick story not featured on Oprah Winfrey's daily chat show, you might pick up Olson's famous theoretical exposition of Melville.  In 1947, Charles Olson hadn't written much poetry and he was just coming off a failed political career as a minor functionary in Roosevelt's New Deal, but somehow he got his act together with CALL ME ISHMAEL.  Nowadays, everyone is in on the Melville revival but in the immediate postwar years Melville had only really been in the canon for twenty years or so, so Olson was working out something new and undone in American literature.  His book didn't sell particularly well, it's challenging and high-toned, but it has remained in print continuously for almost 60 years.  Let's see if AHAB'S WIFE can say the same 
 i dont do a lot of bread making but i am an avid meat smoker and griller. the taylor classic roast-yeast thermometer has taken the stress out of preparing a feast for my guests. i have tried more expensive thermometers but some read out an obvious wrong temperature and others are very difficult to read. the taylor thermometer solves both problems! whether you do most of your cooking outdoors or in your kitchen this thermometer will give you peace of mind. well worth the price and ships fast 
 This is one of the better books I have read on the subject of chonic depression.  I think what makes this book so good is that the author suffers from the same problem.  This is not written by someone that has never suffered this disease and just tells you to get over it.  It is also a good book for the spouse of someone suffering from chronic depression 
 I enjoyed this book.  I am a huge fan of mysteries, especially mysteries like this one.  Rick Riordan is a fine story teller, and he captures the multicultural aspects of contemporary Texas perfectly.  The Last King of Texas is an excellent book 
 This was a great book.  You should definitely get this one.  I've shared it with many people and now that I have it back, will reread it 
 This novel, published in 1994, has reminded the critics of certain other writers. I can myself see a resemblance to the narrator of Kingsley Amis's The Green Man in this story told by an ageing, bibulous, randy has-been putting up a show of curmudgeonliness much as Amis himself liked to do. I suppose there are distant echoes of Waugh too, the Waugh of the Diaries and Brideshead Revisited. On the other hand, readers of the Guardian newspaper around 1994 will remember a character created by the clever and wicked cartoonist Posy Simmons who is very similar indeed to Fry's Ted Wallace (the hippo in person) - struggling writer and schoolmasterish spelling pedant in addition to the characteristics already mentioned. That resemblance, whichever way the influence worked, is altogether too close to be coincidence. I sensed another possible influence too, from 25 years earlier. There is an odd film by Pasolini 'Theorem' about a young man who exerts untoward sexual influence over all around him, and for all the countless differences of tone and style from this book I can't help suspecting a kinship with that too.  The theorem here is one that perms situations of, shall we say, a kind we don't much encounter in our humdrum daily lives. It is not about characterisation at all. The characters are a harlequinade of weirdos, meant as vivid and not as realistic. The revelations they seem to take in their stride without missing a step are surreal, but I actually think I'm even more amazed by the mental agility, not to say the emotional pliancy, that they display at the end when Ted himself (either stepping out of character or reverting to his earlier persona briefly mentioned in a previous chapter) explains all. What it all seems to me to come down to is this - if someone is as brilliantly witty and ingenious as Stephen Fry is, then his novels will be more about a peacock display of the wit and ingenuity than about anything else. The phrase-making is coruscating, the eye for people and the ear for the way they talk are acute, and the repressed but desperate sense of how ridiculous everyone and everything are pervades chapter after chapter. As you might expect, there is a darker side to a personality like this, and that comes through explicitly in the scene in nazi Germany. It also comes through in the incident of the boy and the horse, but if that stops you in your tracks I urge you to continue, because you will get not one subsequent surprise but two.   The final surprises come, hardly surprisingly, at the end. You would never guess the real situation, but there is no inevitability to it. It is just dam' ingenious, and it's about being ingenious and nothing else, not even about being convincing. A hundred other endings would have done just as well, provided they were clever enough. It's not hard to hear the black dog of depression baying through the music of this elegant masked ball, but if you have a good ear for overtones I believe you ought to hear something else as well. There is a real tone of human sympathy and downright kindness in Fry. It's something I sense in his public persona as an actor and entertainer, and something I sense in at least some of his novels. I won't say that it's what I read them for, because I read them for the brilliant chatter more than anything else, but there is an odd but agreeable aftertaste to it all, strange as it may be at times and of course strictly not for the Moral Majority, at least not when they are in full moral mode. I have a hunch that the poet (whom I adapt with apologies) spoke for Fry before Fry was born  The stars did not deal him the worst they could do: His pleasures are plenty, his troubles are two. But O, his two troubles, they reave him of rest, The brains in his head and the heart in his breast 
 Sure kids need some time to relax over the summer but quickly become bored.  What's a busy parent to do ? I was delighted to discover this book after reading about in in the Maine Sunday Telegram.  The author advises really listening to your children's input on what excites them, but also wants the parent to offer suggestions and set limits.   A child may think watching cartoons non-stop makes a fun summer.  This book gives ideas (tennis, hiking, other exercise or structured programs).  I highly recommend investigating the free programs at your local public library.  They might be able to lure your child into reading for pleasure (or reward). The book wants you to get resourceful and creative with your children.  Learn origami or stamp collecting or take turns with other parents teaching the children new skills.   The author also suggests a designated "pickup time" each day to gather up the toys and do a 10-minute clean up.  Great idea! There are lots of things to do in the summer with children and many are inexpensive.  Turn off the TV and turn on your family to having fun together this summer 
 This book should be an absolute must for every married couple.  midlife crisis will happen to all men to some degree, and women, you need to be prepared for it.  Out of ten other books I have read on the subject, this one stands out way ahead of the others.  This might end up in gifts for weddings of friends of mine! 
 If you want to know who is really running the governments of the world, who is actually benefiting from all of the wars and why, then you have to read Controversy of Zion.  Mr. Reed's information is not only from the exhaustive documents and references he has found, but from his own experiences as a World War II correspondent.  This is a truly amazing book 
 Awesome lens, especially for the price.  It's very fast and 50mm even at 1.6x mag of my Rebel XT is easily manageable 
 Great book. Has helped me to understand my depression and what I can do to help myself 
 The writing simple, effective and evocative. The art is a joy, a perfect 'companion' to the writing... Ms. Sams really seems to know what she is talking about... Consice, with some great anecdotes... Take a moment and enjoy this one.. 
 this book is great, we did everything wrong and payed for it. this was a great help with our other properties. Highly recommend this to others 
 I see why this book has won so many awards!  It deserves them all.  It has a great storyline.  It is a fascinating page turner.  It brings new light to what life is like for those who do not have much money.  
 Clueless starring the charming Alicia Silverstone is such a cool and funny film from writer/director Amy Heckerling. I loved this movie when it came out in 1995, boy I am so old now! Clueless is clever, witty, smart, and oh so righteous. Look for a young and chubby Brittany Murphy, she is so good as Tai, an outsider who is looking for a little acceptance from the popular Cher (Silverstone). Cher is obsessed with clothes, boys, and finding the right pair of shoes for her picky feet. This movie is loosely based Jane Austin's classic novel, Emma but with a modern and California twist to it. Love, adore, and worship this movie. If you decide not to buy Clueless well then, Whatever!!!!!!!! 
 I use this recorder for my voice lessons, and chorus practice.  It has been grest.  I love it 
  I ADORE THIS BOOK!!!!!!! It has a VERY good storyline, just like Hangmans Curse had a good storyline.Nightmare Academy is a awesome sequel to Hangmans Curse. And what is awesome is that in this book,it reveals that the Springfields live on a ranch, that Elijah and Elisha have their own horses,and they live in Montana too! Why,do I like these details you may ask? Number 1; I'm a horse obsessed freak.2; I also live in Montana.    Frank Peretti gives a great message in this book; that there should always be right and wrong, no questions asked. Because if there is no right, then most likely,there is going to be ALOT of wrong going on.   This is a quote from Nate when he's doing a report to Morgan. " We are free people because we live according to what we know is right and wrong. If Truth is taken from us,then Right and Wrong are taken from us as well.If we don't know Right and Wrong, then we can't,we won't control ourselves,but will look to someone else to bring order through brute force and raw power.We will be controled by a tyrant,and we will no longer be free-and don't count on that tyrant to be kind and merciful."   All'n'all, this is a AWESOME,TERRIFIC,AND EXCELLENT BOOK!!! READ IT!!!  
 I was mesmerized from the beginning page to the end.  Delta Force, America's elite counterterrorism unit have to be the most prepared, professional, and deadliest warrior soldiers in the world.  I began watching The Unit on CBS a few months ago and was fascinated right away with the program.  I noticed during the credits that Eric Haney, a founding member of Delta Force, was instrumental in writing the story lines for the show.  I immediately bought his book.  If you have any patriotism running through your blood and support our military, you will absolutely love this book.  From selection just to be given an opportunity to join, to the immense training in firearms, explosives, espionage, and everything else imaginable, these men thrive on danger like it was a narcotic.  Haney could have been an author in another life because he writes this true story like it was a Tom Clancy novel.  I was literally gripping the chair as I read about his ordeal in final selection on the hills of the Uhwarrie Forest in North Carolina.  These men were tested to the limit in every way physical, but probably more so mentally.  Haney tells of the horrors he witnessed in Beirut, Lebanon in the 80's, and numerous other missions.  I don't know any of these men personally who have served as an "operator" or who may be serving now, but if any of you are reading this, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for protecting my freedom and this great nation.  God bless all of you and...Oh Yeah...Have a good 'u 
 Bob Fosse was probably one of the greatest directors of USA and Dustin Hoffman is one of the best actors of USA. What happens when you put them together? They'll create a masterpiece like this one 
 This was my first Stuart Woods book, and I really enjoyed it. I'm not a big fan of mystery and murder, but since it took place in 1930's/1940's Hollywood, I had to read it.  Rick Barron starts out as a demoted Beverly Hills cop, but after handling a 'situation' with one of Centurion Studios biggest stars, Eddie Harris (#2 man at the studio) offers Rick an offer he can't refuse as Head of Security for Centurion. All too happy to leave the BHPD, he takes the job, and is fast becoming the hot new man in town. While looking out for the well being of the studio's stars, Rick lands himself in some trouble with mobster Chick Stampano. Chick has a habit of beating up and blackmailing Hollywood's leading ladies, and Rick's not about to put up with it...so with the help of some friends, he sets out to take care of his little mob problem.  Overall I really enjoyed the book. It was fast paced, and almost impossible to put down. My only issue with the book was the names. Mr. Woods would use the same name for different characters, and it got a bit confusing at times...especially since it just wasn't necessary, (i.e...the two studio exec's named  Eddie, the two Ben's, the two Jacks, Barrow and Barron...why couldn't everyone have a different name?).   In the end, I definitely recommend this. I don't know that I'll read many more of his books in the future seeing as how I don't care for detective stories...but the man is a great author. And should I ever feel the urge to read one, Mr. Woods will be at the top of my list 
 Released in 1982, Prince's hard-driving double album was his first recorded masterwork. "1999" holds up beautifully and features a wealth of terrific music: "Little Red Corvette," "Delirious," "Automatic," "Let's Pretend We're Married," "D.M.S.R." and the apocalyptic title track. Breakthrough rock and funk from one of the medium's few geniuses 
 What a mesmorizing account of this man's life!  I couldn't put the book down.    Burrel Wilks' brutally frank and unapologetic autobiography is gritty, intelligent and in-your-face, with a colorful cast of characters most of us could only imagine through fiction.  Wilks' street smarts, resoursefulness and sense of humanity distinguishes him from many of his peers on the inner-city Chicago streets where he, his family, and friends lived.  A powerful testament to the man.   This book is a true inspriation for personal transformation.  I highly recommend it to all 
 If you are a revolutionary History Fan its worth your time to check it out.  It gives you a look into the minds of our founding fathers.  
 I thought I read everything about Autism and how to teach my son properly....until I read this book!  This is an absolute MUST HAVE book filled with ideas that seem so simple to do!  I am going to purchase another 4 or 5 copies, one to hand to every therapist, teacher, and grandparent that comes in contact with my son..it's given me an entirely new perspective on how to handle him 
 I've been searching my entire life, and didn't know for what until Anne Katerine codified it for me in "Boundaries".  It has not been a pleasant "awakening" but I was ready to have revealed to me what needed to be so that I can go to work on the healing process.  The book was particularly helpful to me as a woman in that it helped me to define some of my childhood recollections as boundary violations that have affected subsequent relationships with men 
 I had the opportunity to be Roger's student at a Negotiation Summer Course in IAG/PUC - Rio de Janeiro. This book captures the essence of his course. It contains a lot of negotiations tactics, behaviors and other precious  hints. It is a very powerful and useful tool. Great book 
 "The Rising Tide" (historical fiction) is the first of a trilogy by Jeff Shaara. This is a magnificent book - full of intimate and spell-binding details based on World War II. I thoroughly enjoyed it and eagerly anticipate the next book.  Mr. Shaara is a master of this type novel.  Earlier works included spectacular depictions of the Civil War and eloquent portrayals of World War I.  Like many of you, I did not think there was anything more to learn about World War II - due to countless movies and books on the subject.  I was wrong.    The author manages to grab the reader's attention through an invigorating mix of key players. I encountered the usual suspects, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Winston Churchill, etc.  However, I was captivated by an interesting assortment of obscure characters - which brought texture, warmth, and appeal, to this exceptional read.    The chapter on Erwin Romnel (sometimes called "Desert Fox") kept me riveted. It had more action, suspense, and adventure than a James Bond movie!  In the foreword, the author states his goal is to find a few voices,  tell the story through their eyes,  and put the reader in the same room.  I visited that room, met some exceptional people, and had a memorable time.  I encourage you to do the same - tell them, Reggie sent you!  Reginald V. Johnson, author, "How To Be Happy, Successful, And Rich 
 This is by far Kerouac's most enlightening book.  He expresses his deep emotion of the Buddhist culture.  Satori comes only when the main character follows the Path of Enlightenment and the Four Noble Truths of Tibetian Buddhism.  a must read for any Kerouac fan or anyone who wants to share the  experience of Eastern wisdom and thought 
 If you read this book with an open mind, you will learn so much from it!  There is so much wisdom that can be found in this book that will take you to a new level in your life if you follow the truth.  An amazing book with lots of information on it, a wonderful teaching book.  His style of writing is like he has a conversation with you, and this is very comforting when you read it even though you are absorbing a lot of information.  I highly recommend this book 
 I read this book several years ago and still think about it.  It is a gem where time is a major character, and the nature of time and history the topic.  I found it haunting and thoughtful and lovely 
 Weishan has created an astounding book for anyone interested in traditional gardening styles, old house gardens, or anyone who simply wants to improve the design of their garden. Extremely well-written and  researched, this book is a pleasure to read even for the gardening novice.  Truly one of the best gardening books of the decade 
 There's a saying among statisticians (a group I identify with from time to time): "You can always draw a straight line with two points."  Loosely translated, this means that you should avoid drawing conclusions based on fewer than 3 observations.  This being my third Brother Cadfael mystery (I obtained a random selection from a neighbor's giveaway bin), I feel I can now opine more confidently, knowing that my recommendations are probably not based on a coincidental selection of the best the author has to offer.  As always, the author provides us with a fascinating and unparalleled look into life in medieval England, with particular focus on monastery life.  This installment, however, is less of a whodunit than the others.  The principal crime was committed hundreds of miles away from Cadfael's home in Shrewsbury and all he has to go on are some second or third-hand accounts and some unusual visitors at the annual pilgrimage in honor of St. Winifred.  In some ways, the mystery solves itself, with Cadfael simply providing a nudge here and there to bring the matter to conclusion.  For those interested in 12th century English history, there is an especially potent dose of it here, as the brewing civil war between Empress Maud and King Stephen comes to a head.  Wading through these details makes this a bit more difficult of a read than usual.  One interesting upshot of this part of the story is the implication that it is possible for political (if not military) enemies to be civil and gentlemanly with each other.  What a novel concept!  The book also explores the nature of revenge, and the ultimate lack of fulfillment in it.  This, too, is a concept that is mostly foreign in today's world.  Romance is again a significant feature, always a pleasant surprise given that the setting is a monastery.  In this case, however, the romance is relatively conventional and only peripherally related to the crime.  It does however, provide useful clues for resolving the mystery.  Another subplot relates to a mysterious visitor whose past is connected with Cadfael's, resulting in a surprise revelation at the end of the book.  Cadfael also engages in a good deal of introspection regarding miraculous divine intervention, as befitting the occasion of the pilgrimage.  In summary, this book continues the tradition of solid storytelling and fascinating reading established by the author in the Brother Cadfael series.  Both novitiates and long-time fans of the series will enjoy this book 
 I devoured this book, starving for these kind poetic words of wisdom that permitted me to depersonalize my unhappy marriage.  This author gave me the permission I needed to just let it be over.  I highly recommend this book to anyone, married or single, strugging with relationships.  The ideas in this book are refreshingly far outside the usual therapy/couples counseling repertoire. 
 I love the new crop of comic artists in this country - the ones considered a little too subversive for mainstream media.  And Cartoonist Jen Sorensen is one of the best.  Her latest book is the perfect read for a politically burnt-out world.  Sorensen's observations, both political and social, are spot on.  Hilarious 
 this is the most inspiring book i have ever read.  It told about Joan's  religous life and human life.  This book I recomend to everybody above 15 
 And that was during the busiest week of the year - Xmas to NewYear.  My family was a little irritated and skeptical about my obsessive planning based on The Unofficial Guide to WDW 2005 book.   But by day two, my husband was very very glad for the information we'd gathered from the "guide's" dogeared pages.  Because we were at the park an hour early, we were almost first in line and able to experience some headlining attractions -  twice if we wanted to - with no lines.  Heck  some of them we could have ridden/experienced 4, 5 or 6 times with no line.  We were able to walk into various restaurants without having made 'priority seating' reservations b/c we were ready for lunch at 11 when no one else was (because we'd eaten breakfast at 6:30 am due to the early schedules of the touring plans)  Because of the extremely detailed descriptions in the Guide, we knew *exactly* what would be too scary for our sensitive kids....and what wouldn't be 'too' scary but would take some creative coaching to make it enjoyable for all.  At times, the Guide recommended a certain snack location so that  everyone could enjoy a snack in the shade while waiting for a certain attraction - and because of planning, we had enough adults and cell phones so that one adult could stand in line while the other adults got the snacks based on the books recommendations (*spot* on).  We absolutely followed the guidelines for which park to tour on which days -with once exception:  We ended up at Disney MGM (the smallest of the parks) on it's Extra Magic Hour morning - which goes against the Guide's recommendations.   They strongly counsel against this and it became clear why - unless you're a resort guest, even getting there as early as possible puts  you there an hour late:   that was our worst day only seeing three attractions in five hours.  Wtih the rest of the parks, visiting on the 'recommended days', we saw everything we wanted to see by 1 pm.  Will never deviate from The Book again while at disney:)  Loved eating at Cosmic Ray's in Tomorrowland (MK)....at ABC commissary  (disney-mgm),  Toluca turkey legs (epcot, AK and more).   The best (and most expensive for counter svc) was the counter service restaurant in Norway (Epcot):  Kringla Bakerie  Phenominally good and my beer drinking family members thought the beer was great (each country pavillion has it's own beer).  I hadn't planned on any character mmeals, but after reading that section in the guidebook, i thought i'd have a go at it.  i knew it was unlikely as i was calling only 2-3 weeks in advance. I decided to really go for it and try to get a breakfast table at Cinderella's castle - this was back when breakfast was the only character meal (now all three meals are if I recall correctly).   Imagine my shock to find out that a group of 7 had just cancelled and we were able to secure that table.  Everyone was over the moon (though the food at the castle was poor/mediocre as we'd been warned....i love *knowing* what to expect)  i'm excitedly awaiting the 2006 version so i can get down to the details for this years trip:  a combo land/sea disney cruise package.  While i truly thought i'd hate the disney experience (don't like crowds, afraid of loosing my kids, hate gross mass produced cafeteria food), i ended upfalling in love with disney and our vacation b/c the information in this book gave me allllll of the details i would need to make this vacation the very best possible for us 
 If you need a dictionary - for ministry or academic purposes - on theological terms and concepts found in the Bible then this book is perfect for you. It is very comprehensive and deep enough for scholars yet easy enough to read for the inquisitive lay person. It has many articles discussing pertinent issues in biblical studies (e.g., hermeneutics, the relationship between OT and NT, the relationship between systematic and biblical theology, etc.), provides a good overview of all the books of the Bible, and discusses practically every issue found in Scripture. I would even be bold enough to say that this is the best volume in the whole IVP dictionary series. Whether you're a minister or seminary student get this book for your library. You will never regret purchasing this very important and resourceful volume in the series 
 A few of the photographs are disappointing, but otherwise this is an excellent book 
 This book was recommended by the clinic where my daughter was treated for bulimea. I found the book to be clear, helpful, well written and wholly sensitive to a mother's needs. Anyone who has dealt with a person with  eating disorders would find this a God send! It helped my family, so I  recommend it for yours 
 This reference guide is perfect for the novice boater just learning the ropes.  It's organized alphabetically to make finding topics easy 
 The proformances are just great and wicked in a good way.Especially Sarah Michelle Gellar who put the best proformance in the whole movie.This movie is about sex and betrayal and also very wickedly funny. NOT FOR KIDS buy it now and I promise your love it 
 The story was good, I thought. Harvey tells it great, like all of his stories. It is funny, sad, and even inspiring, to me anyway 
 Probably one of the best books you will find out there at this time on the Constitution and the tyrannical judiciary system.  Of course this was a few months ago now.  Make sure to read Constitutional Chaos by Judge Andrew Napolitano.  The supreme court is turning the Constitution on it's head by making law instead of faithfully interpreting it as it was written.   "The Constitution was never meant to prevent people from praying; it's declared purpose was to protect their freedom to pray." "Our nationwide policy of obortion-on-demand through all nine months of pregnancy was neither voted for by our people nor enacted by our legislatures-not a single state had such unrestricted abortion before the Supreme Court decreed it to be national policy."                                                                        Ronald Reagan   Maybe it is our Democratic form of government slowly but surely eroding our Republic foundation. 
 The murder of Clytemnestra by her son Orestes is unique in Greek mythology because we have versions of the tale staged by all three of the Greek tragic poets. One of the things that makes this remarkable, especially given how few of the ancient plays have survived to the present day (think of what it would be like if Shakespeare's work was reduced to about five plays), is that after Aeschylus wrote his version for "Cheophoroe," the central member of the "Orestia" triptych, any one would want to give a different telling of the tale. I think this interpretation is supported by two key points: first, that both Sophocles and Euripides titled their plays "Electra," focusing on the daughter/sister of the two main characters, and, second, that both of these other versions avoid having the pivotal scene between Clytemnestra and Orestes that is the dramatic highpoint of the Aeschylus play.  The Euripides version of "Electra" is certainly representative of his dramatic work overall in that it focuses more on the psychology and emotions of the characters rather than the philosophical or spiritual implications. The murder of Clytemnestra by her son is no longer another sordid chapter in the curse on the house of Atreus and the appearance of the Dioscuri as a deus ex machina stands in stark contrast to the rest of the "Orestia." Still, Euripides ends the play on themes of sorrow as both Orestes and Electra can only speak of their remorse over what has happened and say their pathetical farewells to one another. Having finally found each other after years of separation, they are again forced apart by fate. As the chorus says at the end: "The moral who can fare well, not broken by trouble met on the road, leads a most blessed life."   There are those who characterize this "Electra" as being more of a melodrama than a traditional tragedy, and that is certainly a valid interpretation. The Euripides version is clearly the weakest of the three, but that is almost by default. Aeschylus is creating the greatest trilogy in Greek history and Sophocles focuses on an Electra who is debating whether or not the responsibility for avenging the death of her father means that that the obligation to slay Clytemnestra falls to her. For Euripides the key twist is that when Electra reached maturity Aegisthus, the lover of Clytemnestra, feared that the young girl would marry some powerful prince and seek vengeance for the murder of Agamemnon. Aegisthus seeks to solve this problem by marrying Electra off to a peasant, who knows he is unworthy of the honor and has never consummated the marriage.  Some critics have made light of Clytemnestra's refusal to condone the execution of her daughter given the fact she murdered her husband. But given that the prime reason for Agamemnon's murder was his sanctioning the sacrifice of their oldest daughter Iphigenia, the queen's decision seems consistent to me. This also fits with the idea that Electra is indeed the central character of the drama, even when Orestes arrives upon the scene. Euripides is clearly interested in the story of a royal princess who effectively loses her entire family and becomes a frustrated, embittered woman. She desires not merely justice, but rather a cruel vengeance (which, significantly, repudiates the lesson of the "Orestia"). There is a sense in which Clytemnestra deserves to die in this play, not because of the murder of Agamemnon, but because of her callous treatment of her surviving daughter. Yet, even this does not make Electra much of a sympathetic figure since she is consumed by the idea of her mother being murdered. When this is achieved, there is nothing left to the character and she is a hollow shell.  "Electra" is not going to be one of the first Euripides plays you would read, and I have found that most times when it is considered it is within the context of comparing it to the parallel works by Aeschylus and Sophocles. However, an analog with Euripides' "Medea" would also be informative for students. As always, the key consideration would be which of the various Greek tragedies you had access to in your classroom.  
 For anyone who hasn't listened to Erin tell her riveting stories in person, this book provides her *voice* and fills in much of the background story that you will want to know after seeing Freedom Writers on screen.  Teach With Your Heart gives a glimpse into the heart of Erin-ever resourceful, imaginative, savvy and strategic, sometimes naive, and brilliantly inventive as a catalyst for confronting racism and intolerance.  Like the Freedom Writers Diary, or listening to Erin give one of her impassioned speeches, this book is a way to mobilize beyond hopelessness to ask  "what can I do to make a difference?"  Refreshingly, without distilling ten easy steps, Erin speaks to the perseverence, support and stamina needed to manifest an unstoppable vision in spite of heartache, threats and loss.  
 This movie is directed by Clint Eastwood, written by William Goldman and stars Eastwood and Gene Hackman. So one expects to be kept entertained and one is. The plot is not dissimilar to `Murder at 1600' released the same year but this movie is a bit less preposterous if still a bit incredible. Eastwood is Luther Whitney, a likeable old housebreaker who is robbing a posh big house when he is interrupted. Hiding in a closet he witnesses a murder in which the Secret Service shoot dead a woman trying to defend herself against being raped by the US President no less. Though Whitney is obviously not the most honest man alive he's keen to blow the whistle but how? Surely nobody will believe him against the President and the Secret Service who are soon hard at work trying to wipe him out.   This is  very watchable, well-made thriller much as was Eastwood's `In the Line of Fire' a few years earlier. The suspense is nicely done and the acting generally pretty good. It's nothing very deep, just a popcorn movie - sadly nowhere near scaling the heights Eastwood reached with 'Unforgiven' - but a pretty decent effort. Its biggest flaw on the credibility front is probably that highlighted when Whitney is interviewed by Ed Harris's cop who thinks he is the burglar if possibly not the killer. 'I'm way too old for that sort of thing' is the line Whitney tries to sell him to avert suspicion and, for the audience, it's maybe hard to avoid the thought that, Yes, Clint, old fellow, maybe you are... 
 This Novel fills in some information on the background story, great if you already know the basic Halo story 
 This album, that started off the David Grissman Quintets career is a masterpiece.  Those looking for vocal-less bluegrass that focuses on outstanding changes and climaxing soloing, this is it.  A thousand listens later, this cd still sends tingles down my spine, this album is full of grissman classics that make up the bulk of his live  shows today.  Buy this album, you won't be sorry 
 This book by one of the top scientists in the country is truly remarkable.  Although Dr. John Hagelin's expertise and accomplishments are in quantum physics the knowledge of this work will change the discipline of social science forever.  In fact in almost all cases academia and governments have been ineffective and impotent before the great problems of war, terrorism, and crime. [as well as poor health and a polluted environment]  Manual for A Perfect Government reveals a startling solution for eliminating violence and damage at its core.  This is no ivory tower theory- the data and practical research put forth here is impeccable.   Dr. Hagelin simplifies the myriad of problems we all face as humans.  In a nutshell, he emphasises it is the violation of natural law that is creating the deterioration of our world.  Purifying collective consciousness and harnessing the laws of nature through the use of the technology of the unified field is an idea whose time has come. As Dr. Hagelin points out the unified field which Einstein dreamed of finding [and whose existence was proved in subsequent years by scientists] is millions of times more powerful than the nuclear field; and it can only be used for peaceful purposes, there are no side effects.  This field had its origins in the ancient Vedic culture. Now this field of pure consciousness discovered and utilized by Vedic scientists thousands of years ago is substantiated and verified by modern science.  Dr. Hagelin in his book systematically and concretely maps out how we can markedly turn the tide on the most pressing problems of our times and transform the world into a higher quality of life for all 
 The character that I like the most was Bright Morning. She is the main character. Her job is to take the flock of sheep to the aspen grove so they can eat. I think she was really brave because she did something nobody else in her tribe ever did before.  I think this is an excellent book to read and I think my friends will enjoy reading it because there are lots of surprises and it is never boring! I don't have a favorite part because I enjoyed reading the whole entire book. My name is Tori and I am 9 years old.  
 Similar in style to Adrian Belew and the Bears. Excellent stuff! Great musicians 
 When your best friend that you take everywhere and spend so much time with suddenly turns on you or exhibits aggressive behavior, it is devasting. How can my dog do this to me? It's like any other member of the family turning against you. This book helped me get over that feeling and look at the problem from my dog's point of view. I read the entire book and when I finished, I realized that aggressive behavior in dogs is a dog thing and I learned to understand the factors. I was able to determine that I needed some professional help. I have to say the book is the reason I got help and the reason we're back to normal. I think everyone who lives with a dog should read this book 
 Raymond Chandler (The Big Sleep), James M. Cain (The Postman Always Rings Twice), and Cornell Woolrich were among the creators of the noir genre of crime fiction in the 1930s and 1940s. This uniquely American literary genre had its roots in the terse, violent, and often poorly written pulp fiction. More talented, innovative writers evolved a dark, modern mythology  that exploited themes of crime, guilt, deception, obsession, and murder.  I am familiar with other classics of noir genre, but The Bride Wore Black was my first introduction to Woolrich. The innocuous beginning, a young woman leaving home with no particular destination in mind, transitioned rapidly into an audacious, calculated, carefully planned murder without any apparent motive. Woolrich shifts the perspective back and forth from character to character, adeptly disguising the inner thoughts of the killer. Unlike the police who are uncertain whether the deaths are accidental or deliberate, we readers know it is murder, but not how the victims are chosen. I was unprepared for the ending.  The Bride Wore Black has been often republished and you should not have difficulty finding a copy.   Many novels and short stories by Cornell Woolrich have been adapted to the screen (the most notable was Rear Window), radio, and TV.  I Married a Dead Man, Phantom Lady, and his `Black' series of suspense novels were among his best works 
 How many masterpieces can one director make? In the case of Ingmar Bergman, the answer would be plenty. This is one beautiful, but very painful and at times horrifying film. I think I've yet to see another film that depicts the pain, suffering and despair of dying to such vividness that like the characters, one almost feels the need to look away. The story itself is fairly simple - a woman is in the final stages of cancer/tuberculosis and her two sisters and maid take care of her in her final days - but Bergman's unique narrative style and the complexity and depth of his script turn what at first seems a horror show into a profound meditation on faith, love and mortality. Bergman's direction is simply too perfect. The way the film is conceived visually couldn't be more evocative of its themes. The intensity of the color red to convey the hell these characters are living, and the chamber-like, claustrophobic atmosphere it creates is suffocating and exhausting. Sven Nykvist's Oscar-winning cinematography is simply one of the most inventive and unique I've ever seen in a movie. Bergman's narrative strategy is incredibly thoughtful and effective; it's like the scenes flowed into each other, and despite the horror we are to endure, there is such tact, sensitivity, attention to detail and a feeling of intimacy to every scene. It's simply glorious to behold, appreciate and let yourself be taken by the emotions and insights this film has to offer. All four actresses give spectacular performances: Harriet Andersson (Agnes) is searing physical pain personified, Liv Ullmann (Maria) is so nuanced and real in her flight sensuality (one extended scene that is a close-up to her face is astonishing in the incredible nuances of expressiveness and what the character is trying to conceal but can't), Ingrid Thulin (Karin) is chilling to the bone (and that one scene that is about mutilation in a very sensitive place is for sure one I'll never forget) and Kari Sylwan (Anna) is pure warmth, dedication and love. Bergman has a fame for depicting a bleak and pessimistic view of the world, and I won't argue with that, but I don't think his humanism is addressed very often. I had heard so many things about how depressing and horrifying this film is, and it is indeed, but it is not hopeless. Yes, Bergman suggests that the world can a horrible place and the human experience is full of pain, loneliness and cruelty, but he also suggests that if we extend our love to one another and let ourselves be loved, the burden won't be as hard to bare, and that there will be moments that will bring us love, happiness and grace, as Agnes says in her beautiful and haunting soliloquy. Agnes manages to find solace and consolation even though she's living the most excrutiating hell because she allows herself to love and be loved, and her confrontation with death won't be as terrifying. Maria and Karin on the other hand, as the film suggests, will have to endure the pain and fear of dying in utter loneliness because they don't allow themselves to be loved and have lost the ability to love as well. The film is also bold and insightful enough to suggest that the most awful of circumstances in which a human being can be is paradoxically what strengthens one's faith and love, therefore sustaining one's existence. An amazing film.  A Masterpiece 
 We are each the love of someone's life. Love is what it's all about in this lyrical, magic, and moving story about a boy, Max Tivoli, beset with an affliction that has him born looking like a seventy year old man, but over time physically regressing into infancy as he matures into adulthood. Got that? Smitten with a young Jewish girl when he is a boy of seventeen who looks like a man of fifty, Max finds a way to enter her life at various satges of his development. Each meeting nurturing a different and distinct relationship. I read almost this entire book in one sitting on an airplane, and was lost in his voice. It beautifully captures San Francisco of the early twentieth century, and builds to a moving and touching conclusion with an image that stays with you long after you close the book 
 Excellent covers of Sally Go 'Round the Roses, Crystal Blue Persuasion and Crimson & Clover.  Unfortunately the full 6:11 version of White Bird was cut to 3:10.  That means, that the long beautiful violin solo for which the song is noted, is largely missing.  
 I simply love this music, Super Session is amazing, and this is just as good. Its bluesy, it's jazzy at times, and its just great jamming. Just something about this music is just inspiring. Every song is good. The first disc is definitely stronger than the second disk, even though there is some really great jamming on the second disk. I just find its easier to get into the first one, as a lot of the songs are classic covers (Feelin' Groovy, The Weight, Green Onions). Her Holy Modal Highness is a great sort of sped-up version of the like song on Super Session, with a great bass solo. The rest is history 
 Writers will love these two scores, particularly the one for Fargo. Enjoy writing horror, morbid, or gothic tales? Than this is the perfect cd to write to. Enjoy 
 This album would have gotten 5 stars if not for a few songs.    1. "Fire" - I hate it.  It is incredibly, incredibly repetitive, and not in a good way.  It grated on my nerves after 30 seconds.  The thought of sitting through another 4 minutes of the song was enough to make me want to turn off the radio.  But I was patient and I skipped to the next track.  I'm sure some people love the song (they must, for it to be on this and Dance Factory IV), but I think it's awful.  2. "Cut" sounds a little like a remixed pop song, something Kelly Clarkson would sing.  It's good, but a little slow.  3. "I Think I Love You" is very upbeat, almost hyperactive, but entertaining.  4. "All About Me" is a classic breakup/move on song, pretty good.  5. "Kiss the Sky" - Most people probably know "Kiss the Sky" - the mix on here is slightly different from the radio edit, and it makes it better.  Great song.  6. "All My Love" really gets your pulse going with its beat - it's an unrelenting song, and I love it.  7. "When You Say Nothing At All" brings the pace down a little, as it is sort of a ballad with a beat.  It's mediocre.  Not bad, but not great.  The kind of song you might skip sometimes.  8. "Lying" - Not so good.  This surprised me, since I usually like Lasgo.  This song is almost pure 80's - not a musical style I'm fond of.  If you like that cheesy sound, you'll probably love it.  9. "Tracking Treasure Down" - I think the title is awkward, but it's a decent, if slightly mellow, song.  I think it's the type of song that grows on you after a few listens.  10. "Raindrops" is a fantastic song, short and sweet and packed with greatness.  I just wish it was longer.  11. "Push It" - I don't understand this trend of making dance versions of old 80s songs.  It worked out well for Louie Devito, with Take on Me and Rhythm is a Dancer (a few years ago), but Push It wasn't a good song to begin with and no amount of remixing can make it good.  But it is tolerable for about 90 seconds.  Then your finger will start itching to change it.  12. "Alive" - this song is subtitled "German Club edit" and it absolutely made me have visions of dancing in a packed European club.  Love it.  13. "Piece of Heaven" starts out one way and then completely changes, but the effect is good and it's an upbeat head-nodder.  14. "Bad Boy" by Cascada...another fist-pumper.  I really like it, even though I tried not to.  Equal parts serious and playful, a very charismatic and likeable song, even if it does support a pet peeve of mine (girls who only like bad boys).  15. "Satellites" - a funky and fresh song, the kind you like more and more each time you listen to it.  Good stuff.  16. "I Go Crazy" - It is a good song, but I wonder if the original is better, or if there is a better remix out there.  This mix is a little directionless.  A pleasant listen nonetheless.  Overall, this is a pretty solid compilation.  There are always a few songs that different people with different tastes won't like, so I never expect one of these to be perfect.  It's a good investment; 90% of the cd keeps your foot tapping to the beat, and that is sometimes hard to find 
 These are a bit expensive, but turned out to be fantastic - compact, sturdy and not too much of an eye sore.  They hold quite a bit so you're not having to refill them too often and keeps the food fresh.  The lids are a little tricky to close.  Because they are at an angle, they tend to not line up w/the grids well, but I don't consider that necessarily a manufacturing flaw; perhaps a design flaw, but the angle makes getting the food out easier.    I'd buy them again 
 I got a ton of my cd's. This is easily in my top 20. Even my brother who hates raps steals this cd from my collection to listen to it. Kurupt has been critized for his lyrics when he rhymes a bunch of phrases with the same ending for example "homebody". But I still think he's one of the best West Coast and overall rappers with this being his best CD. Best Tracks: I call Shots, Who ride wit us, Represent dat G.C., never gonna give it up, streetz iz a mutha, ya cant trust nobody, and your gyrlfriend 
 As noted in the Amazon review, the plot of this movie is somewhat trite.  But in one of the rare rich uses of Robin Williams's talents, this movie really communicates the spirit of the Christ story.  Most tellings of the Christ story portray him as a somber, almost morbid figure, frowning and "heavy," totally lacking in charisma -- a total downer.  Such a figure would not have inspired people with the sense of love, wonder, and possibilities and would not have threatened the power structure.  Robin Williams, here, embodies the spirit of Jesus, moving the children who came unto him with a sense of life.  More importantly, this story shows how fragile that sense of grace is.  How, even as we are touched by this immense love, we resist and wind up letting the source of that spirit be crucified.    By the way, I am Jewish and an atheist.  But that does not mean I don't appreciate the notion of the joy, love, and grace that visits most of us.  As Ferlinghetti put it, we all await a rebirth of wonder.  If only we are prepared to accept it 
 Madlib is incredible at his productions.   Pro: used great samples Con: not better than the original.  i give it more of a 4.5/5  if you enjoyed this check out:  Oh No MF Doo 
 Tosca came through strong with this follow-up to "Suzuki."  "Dehli9" uses many of the same electronic ideas and dub tools as the last album, but is very fresh and timely song-writing.  The solo piano disc of the album is good if you are into that sort of thing, but for true techno-heads and beat-junkies, disc 1 is better.  As someone else said, the physical case and feel of the discs is great...exquisite is right! And by the way, there is no such word as "rhythmatically... 
 I am not very coordinated and really hated other aerobic workouts I had tried.  This one is fairly easy to follow, Kathy is very encouraging AND there is a plus size woman in the workout who dropped out at different levels - so I didn't feel so bad when I couldn't do the whole thing at first.  I like the way it's broken up because you can do 20 or 30 min on different days and still get a great workout.  I was doing this one before I got pregnant again and this is my video of choice for getting back in shape 
 As a personal trainer and unfortunate lover of fast food (which I never eat but long for) this book was a godsend. The recipes are easy, and taste as close to the real thing as you are going to get. If your cooking skill ends with boiling water, then the recipes in this book may frustrate you, but to the average person, they are easy. I recommend this to anyone who loves fast food, but avoids it for the same reason I do... 
 This is a great book really. The only point that really don't like is about its phylosophy of training, a little old. The author says in the FAQ that to do Squats 2sets/2 times a week "is a joke", and about the liftings recomend to train daily. He says some think like this about aerobic exercises too. Anyone that know about bodybuilding-without-drugs and efficiency of time/effort in aerobics know that what HE is saying is the real joke. The is not a book about bodybuilding, off course, but such frequency of work only can be done with the specific kind of "fuel" or with very very low intensity, so, the author should clear the reason because he says a absurd like that, or some natural athlete can take him seriously and hurt himself. However, if the reader/athlete is very well informed about the modern thoughts about intensity and frequency in strength/aerobics training, he will know adapt the rich informations of this book to his need. 
 Along with Heinz Knocke's 'I Flew for the Fuhrer' an absolutely outstanding aviation read. Like others here the original edition I had inherited was almost worn thin. I was delighted to read the 'extra bits' as I could probably almost recite the old one! Particularly poignant were the comments regarding Tempests being attacked by US fighters and the description of the 262's arriving to surrender on Clostermann's airfield in 1945. This book simply cannot be recommended enough.  PS:I would suggest along with 'I Flew for the Fuhrer' that an excellent companion read is Eric Brown's 'Wings of the Luftwaffe' - an RAF technical pilot who offers unbiased opinions on Luftwaffe aircraft.   PPS: Regarding the -D9/Ta152 comments above. I believe old Clo-Clo is technically correct 
 The first essay of this giant philosopher is deeply influenced for the echoes of Schopenhauer and Richard Wagner and pretends expose a new conception of the world : the tragic thought, , the intuition of the unity of the things , the converse affirmation of the life and death , the timeless return , the innocence of becoming . Fundamental text if you want to get ready for the Apollonian and Dionisus duel 
 This book, the second in the Dream series, is about Kate Powell, a distant relative of the Templeton's that comes to live with them after her parents are killed in a car accident when  Kate is 8.  Kate is not beautiful like Margo or sophisticated like Laura.  She is an over achiever.  She feels that the only way to pay the Templeton's back for everything they've done for her is to be the best at what she does.  She's a whiz with numbers, so she becomes an accountant at a well-respected firm, with the hopes of soon becoming a partner.  She obsesses over everything, never feeling like she's good enough.  One day at work, she discovers that her father was accused of embezzling money and was faced with going to jail when he died. She also learns the Templeton's replaced the money he took, but never said anything to her.  Shortly after learning that, she is accused by the partners in her firm of embezzling from their clients and is asked to take a leave of absence until it can be resolved.  Destroyed and humiliated, she puts up a wall rather than fight the charges because she doesn't want her father's past revealed.  Enter Byron DeWitt, the new head of the Templeton hotel in Monterey.  Kate and Byron start out detesting each other, but learn to tolerate each other and eventually become friends.  The attraction between them develops over time.  Kate suffers severe stomach pains in his company twice, the second time landing her in the hospital against her wishes.  Kate finds out she has an ulcer and is near exhaustion.  She is taken back to Templeton House to recover.  Byron helps her begin an excerise and weight lifting program and that's when the attraction between them takes off.  With her career in shambles, Kate becomes a more active partner in Pretenses.  She has never been a people person, preferring to be alone with her calculator and spread sheets, but to her surprise, she enjoys her work there.  Of course, she is cleared of the embezzlement charges and is offered a partnership at her old firm, but she turns it down finally realizing that it wasn't as important as she thought it was.  She also realizes how important Byron is to her.  This was a wonderful story.  Nora Roberts knows how to develop her characters.  She is at her best when she writes her trilogies.  I highly recommend this series, but you should read them in order to follow the story from the beginning 
 I must disagree, I love any and all b/w programs or movies in the now beautiful colorization process. I only wish Superman, Honeymooners & I Love Lucy were in color. To the blind closed minded ones who refuse to accept the current facts, it's not your father's colorized movies anymore. Today the coloring process has advanced to the point where each and every item in the picture is assigned a separate and accurate color. Have you seen the beautiful job done on the Sherlock Holmes movies, Woman In Green, Terror By Night, Secret Weapon and Dressed To Kill? Excellent, fantastic, you couldn't ask for a more beautiful picture. Not one false note in the frame, great. The colorizing being done today is truly advanced and wonderful looking. I'll choose my beautiful colorized "Casablanca" anytime over the dull drab b/w world of the standard issue b/w image. I even bought 3 copies of the Colorized Casablanca, it was such the dream come true.  Films and TV shows were shot in b/w in the old days because it was the most economical way to shoot. It was "the standard" of the day, just as color is the standard of today. They didn't shoot in b/w because they wanted to show the beauty of a b/w picture anymore than movies today are shot in color simply because they want to exhibit the wonders of color. It was the standard, NOT an artistic hoity toity vision of b/w pureness. To the folks who only want b/w, fine enjoy, BUT PLEASE DO NOT TAKE AWAY THE PLEASUE OF COLOR FROM THE REST OF US. You may pretend to like b/w over color all you want, but if you could get off your high prentious horse for just a politically incorrect moment you would have to admit color is a natural way and a more interesting way to look at an image in monochrome. If b/w was as highly attractive as you pretend, then why is it that ALL b/w movies sold on DVD or VHS always have a color picture on the front to represent the movie it contains? Why not be honest and put on a typical b/w drab uninteresting picture of the b/w movie on the cover of the DVD? Why not use a b/w cover picture? Because no one would buy it, b/w is not attractive, it implys old, has been and out of date. A color image is of today, of the present, and does not look like an ancient relic of the past. I love watching Laurel & Hardy in color. I have all of their talkie shorts and Roach movies in color and it's just like watching a new video, not an ancient relic of a by-gone day. Color makes Laurel & Hardy seem of the present and happening now. It's a wonderful thing. Go to this Amason website below and see for yourself the beauty of a newly colorized movie. This is a great listing of all the beautiful colorized movies made today. I've bought just about every one of them, and I've not been disappointed yet.  And to all the spoil-sports who refuse everyone the freedom to choose for themselves, color or b/w, the back of my hand to you.  These discs even contain BOTH versions, the dull, drab, boring b/w and the beautiful wonderfully illustrious colorful artful masterpiece of the lovely colorized version.  So you elitist snobs can still put on your blinders and continue to pretend to only liking b/w and buy this disc, because the b/w version is there in addition to the perfect color version.  But I'm not believing the politically correct crowd for one minute, for all their false indignation, I just know they are secretly basking in the glorious color version, while of course, denying ever watching it.  You just know, given the choice, anyone with any taste at all will naturally choose to watch the color version, who wants to see a ugly b/w picture when a wonderful color one is right there beside it.  I LOVE COLORIZATION and love even more calling the bluffs of all the so-called members of the good-taste society who PRETEND not to like colorization, but watch hungily any and all color movies, as well they should.  Too bad they just can't admit colorization's superiortiy over the sleep-inducing b/w image. Buy this & all colorized movies, you won't be disappointed, they look great today.  Colorization has come a long long way from when it first started.  BRAVOISIMO, more colorized movies please, I can't wait to buty the next one!  The perfect world?  When all b/w movies and tv shows are colorized, then we'll have paradise 
 I love the large size of these tumblers, as I can get a whole can of pop with ice in them.  The thermal feature works good, the ice lasts longer, and they don't sweat, so I don't need coasters under them.  They are colorful, so each guest can have their own color, no mix ups. They fit on the top rack of my dishwasher, and they don't seem to be marked or scratched yet. After seeing mine, my daughter-in-law got some, as did two sets of my friends.  I am so glad to have found them!  
 It has many interesting works in the book. It is great to have it 
 Wayman - struck gold with this one, when I first heard it. I put money on it with my brothers, told them, "Tiz-Is-gonna win a Grammy for this one". I think maybe the reason is re-working songs like " 02 Get Down on it" gets you on it and in the groove right now. And "If you want me to Stay" Sly and the Family Stone, come off it, it's over the top. As if that wasn't enough he's got Jeff Lorber playing in most of it. I never get tired of listening to this CD. Every track is great. No it's not Stanley Clark, but in my mind.....It's exactly what you want to hear when you hear it. Just buy it, you'll see. Thanks Wayman! 
 This book is a wonderful "teacher"....the author takes you through step by step on every detail of creating textures....it is my "watercolor bible." It has helped me immensely with golf course paintings.  Carole D. Arlington V 
 This is a wonderful recreation of Shakespeare's time and place.  As an evocation of England, it is much superior to Ackroyd's overly diffuse _Albion: Origins of the English Imagination_.    Ackroyd's Shakespeare is an actor and poet first and a storyteller second, if at all.  Ackroyd cautions us to view theater as the Elizabethans did, as a highly-stylized and rhetoric-festooned spectacle, and not as we do now, as an attempt to create a naturalistic world in miniature.  Ackroyd also does a great job of portraying Shakespeare as he must have seemed to his contemporaries.  He was all the rage for a while, undeniably talented, a fast worker, but also a frequent borrower from other writers, even using verbatim passages from sources for his history plays.  In this he was not unique to his contemporaries, just moreso.  The magnitude of his achievement would not become fully apparent for another three-quarters of a century.  Shakespeare here is very much the Unseen Seer, able to take on all guises and never disclose his own true self.  Since all we really have are the plays and a few legal documents, the temptation to infer Shakespeare's personality out of his writings is strong.  Ackroyd handles this pitfall-dotted terrain masterfully, the reader never feels that the author is climbing on rainbows.  A neat surprise in the oft-parsed biographical material Ackroyd assembles is the record of a lawsuit in which Shakespeare was called as a witness.  Ackroyd points out that this is the only surviving transcript of Shakespeare's actual spoken words.  Perhaps typically, he is noncomittal in his testimony.   The latter fourth of the book is only slightly less fascinating, as the plays are finished and the biographical trail winds through miscellaneous legal materials and contemporary allusions.  But the whole work is great.  Ackroyd makes a great tie-in with the end of Shakespeare's life and the lines of his last play:  Let us be thankful For that which is, and with you leave dispute That are above our question. Let's go off And bear us like the time 
 Its rare for movies to command my full attention, I get bored very easily. Van helsing had my full attention and I had a racing heart because I felt like I was part of that wonderfully creative world. It was worth every minute and I love watching it over and over agai 
 This lens is superb.  It feels like a high quality pro lens (not surprisingly).  The shots are just stunning; fantastic color, razor sharp, beautiful bokeh etc etc.  I initially considered the 18-200(VR) until I saw comments about this lens.  Look into it, from what I can tell there is very little (real) comparison between the two.  I believe you will forget how much you paid as soon as you see the results.  Did I mention this lens is superb....? 
 Without a shadow of a doubt, hands-down, Christopher Guest is the master of the mockumentary.  No other filmmaker can come close to the brilliance that Guest and his repertory ensemble of actors produce when they all come together to form a movie.  A MIGHTY WIND is another of Guest and Co.'s projects that examines the inner workings of the folk music business.  In the movie, folk music icon Irving Steinbloom (Stuart Luce) passes away and his son, Jonathan (Bob Balaban) decides to put together a memorial concert featuring Steinbloom's favorite and best-selling musicians.  There's the classic three-men group The Folksmen (parody of the real The Kingston Trio), the obsessively brightly colored co-ed ensemble The Main Street Singers, and the sweet and lovable duo Mitch and Mickey.  The three groups gather together for one night in New York City's Town Hall singing the music that they love.  The movie boasts a wonderful soundtrack that includes all the majors songs sung in the film.  The soundtrack alone is an achievement, capturing the very essence of folk music so much so in fact that supposedly Woody Guthrie and other folk musicians wanted to participate in the making of this movie, but were turned down because Guest and Co. felt that having actual musicians participate would take away from the comedy of the movie.  And what a comical movie it is.  A MIGHTY WIND is one of the funniest movies I have seen in the past five years.  I've seen the film several times and there are moments and scenes so funny that I laugh so hard I can barely breathe.  What's so fascinating about much of this is that most of it is totally improved.  Despite the hilarity, there is a tender affection in the movie towards folk music (the same tenderness can be found towards community theatre in WAITING FOR GUFFMAN and about dog shows in BEST IN SHOW).  The movie does make fun of the genre, yet it's more like laughing with rather than laughing at.  Without this affection, much of the humor in the movie would be harsh.  Instead, it is cathartic.  Only the best parodies and satire in the world can do that successfully.  Watch and listen carefully and A MIGHTY WIND will feel you with joy and not leave you sitting there wondering wha' happened 
 Camilla Morton knows how to provide women with serious fun. With wit, wisdom and a smile, she and her contributors have given style a good name. I loved it. Walking in High Heels garners my highest, "Did you read this book yet." rating. Gosh if I had read "Heels" years ago, I wouldn't be wearing flats today!! Miss Manners move over and make room for Camilla and her crew!!!  
 Unfortunetly this film has no Dutch subtitles. That's a pitty!! But this film is real monumwntal! Johan Wolters,Arnhem <Hollan 
 This is the first Robert B. Parker novel I have read and I throughly enjoyed it. The main character is a private detective who is both intelligent and resourceful but has a pleasantly sarcastic/cheeky side. Parkers ability to tell a story without making it too detail-saturated and drawn out made for an enjoyable reading experience. I plan on picking up some more of his work and urge you to do the same 
 This is a adorable book that warns kids of the dangers of not eating their lima beans. Beautiful illustrations and a playful story make this a must have book for every child. 
 Its the best! Nothing has happend to it since i got it from my mom and dad for christmas. I like it becuase she listens. When she says, give me a hug you give her a hug. she says, i love you mommy,and it is a great toy. mabey put it on your bithday list. baby alive fan, haile 
 Just BUY IT, its fantastic.  She is the best jazzy soul singer in the last 20 years.  Yes, I said it.  Not to mention one of the classiest.  I am sorry to hear of all her personal troubles that kept her from singing for a whopping 10 years, it seemed like longer to us fans.  Maybe this will make Sade, Pebbles, and Natalie Cole have faith they can repeat their successes if Anita can comeback after so long?  I guess you have to wait on quality?  Every song is good, just let it play, and its a bargain for the amount of music you get.  Good investment 
 The irrepressible badger Frances, now an older sister to baby Gloria, decides that she likes the predictability of her favorite meal, bread and jam, and refuses to eat anything else. In a gentle way, Mother Badger shows Frances just how boring life is when you always eat the same thing. For fans of Frances, it is as much of a treat as the other books. For example, Frances's thoughts on the drawbacks of eggs is laugh-out-loud funny. However, do be forewarned that the gender roles in this book are even more traditional than usual with Mother Badger whipping up every meal and Father Badger praising her for it. It actually doesn't bother me because at least the father is appreciative, but I thought readers should know what to expect. 
 This book is rather strange. There is a very distinct writing style, and Camus paints a very vivid picture of everything that is going on.  The plot itself is at first completely bewildering. The book starts out with the death of our main character's mother, and then moves with startling speed to completely different things, and before you even realize what's happening, there's a baffling trial.  The thing that troubled me most about the story was the trial itself, because knowing how silly the arguments are, one can get extremely frustrated, and I found myself quite angry at the book.  It was the ending that I truly enjoyed. It was a very solid, satisfying ending, making the overall reflections easier. This is certainly a good book; not perfect, not incredible, and, in fact, often very confusing. Overall, though, it's an interesting book to read, and when I was done, I found myself thinking about all sorts of things, because the book really does make you think. It's not perfect, no, but it is thought-provoking. And while some people cannot stand it, others love it dearly. It's a book worth reading 
 This book fills a major gap, as noted it has been mostly convential wisdom that the Wehrmacht was mostly a fighting machine, a conventional army at war, freed from the vils of Nazism and therefore it should be studied as military history as those like David Irving would have.  However it turns out there is much more to the story.  Mostyl Holocaust history has wanted to seperate the 'average German' from the 'Evil Nazi' who is seen as an aberration like Sodom and Gammorah, more myth and tale than skull and bones.  This book helps give us a more detailed look at the culture inside the Wehrmacht, the officer corps and the average man.  We are exposed to the elite old guard of aristocratic officers and the new crass Nazis and we are given a cultural portrait of the German army at war, and perhaps a more nuanced look at its role in atrocities, probably a truly new account of that role.  While there are many critiques of this book or its bias it is a needed account much so in order to widen our understanding of how the entire German nation was implicated in the Holocaust and how the Wehrmacht itself was infected by the ideology of hate more so than previously thought.  Those 'pure' Germans such as Rommel and Guderien will now have more light she don their actions and it will finally be shown just how unique those like Rommel were, who opposed throughout their lives the evils of Nazism.

 What a great story - I just read the book for a second time (2 years after the first time), and again I was drawn into this delicate web of lies, dark manoeuvres, and high-flying ambitions. A cast of memorable characters, surprising twists and turns, and a good dose of subtle humour make this book an outstanding historical novel. And while enjoying the good read, you pick up some knowledge about the beginning of stock exchanges, about futures and puts and gets and some such. So, definitely a good choice for your next vacation reading!   
 Very interesting movie about Dian Fossey, a dedicated conservationist that dedicated her life to preserving mountain gorillas.  She was a bit crazy - no doubt about it, but very dedicated.  The movie takes place in the Congo, then moves to Rwanda when Fossey is kicked out of the Congo.  From other sources, the movie is not all that accurate, but what movie is? It gets the main points right, and it makes for a compelling movie.  The downsides from my point of view were 1. the romance, which, since this is Hollywood, was way overdone, 2. the incessant coughing by Dian Fossey - so she smoked? She didn't die from lung cancer - why do we have to listen to her cough the whole movie - why get that one fact so accurate when they distort so many other aspects of the movie? and 3. Why is she so dedicated to these gorillas?  She gets a little crazy at some points.  Overall a good movie and worth a watch - the scenery from Africa is really great 
 You've never read a business book quite like this one. Often with tongues planted firmly in cheek, authors Henry Mintzberg, Bruce Ahlstrand and Joe Lampel tap a variety of sources in illuminating the frequently nebulous topic of strategy. The essays, anecdotes and quotes are unique, insightful and sometime humorous. And the book is not just nontraditional and cute: it also provides plenty of good, solid information on strategy. We recommend that you go ahead and take a big bite. Chew slowly and savor the flavor. It goes down easy 
 A great book for people who are willing to drop their major bad habits in bowling. This book gives you great tips on things that work. I'm new at the game (only 2 years at it) but couldn't get my average over 155 despite reading several books to see if I could correct whatever I was doing wrong. This easy-to-read paperback quickly put me on the right track with simple, yet important, tips on almost every aspect of bowling I had questions about. The book is more of a workbook since advice comes in short chapters which makes it possible to test yourself with the techniques incrementally. Despite my tendencies to revert to my bad habits, my average has improved by over 20 pins since I got the book 3+ months ago. When I follow the book's tips consistently, I'll hit 200+ every time. Well worth the few bucks 
 This mixer is powerful, easy to use and EASY TO CLEAN!!!  I have never made bread dough and cookies with such ease

 Area 7 by Matthew Reilly            Non-stop Adrenalin Pumper      by  Bob the Builder          ISBN: 0-333-90626-8                                                                                       2/26/07  	Could the United States of America actually be destroyed? In this present day realistic fiction the villains do. The president of the United States of America is scheduled to check on a secret base called Area 7. When they land at the base they are unexpectedly engaged in an all out war inside the base. At this time of need, stationed with the president is a heroic marine called Shane Schofield. Along with Shane, the other marines and the secret service must try to protect the president. They are also greatly out number. If the president dies, then his heart stops beating. If his heart stops beating, then a transmitter will give a signal to set off nuclear bombs all round the U.S.A. This is why he must not die. Can Shane Schofield be the hero once more and save the president?  	Area 7 is definitely ranked 5 stars on my list. He is one of my favorite writers. He packs in so much action that you can't put down the book for a second. One after another things keep coming and never stop till the end. This is a real page turner. Matthew Reilly throws out stuff at you that you never saw coming. I also love he style. He would start an incredible event and then soon another. There would be more then one thing happening at once. I would definitely recommend this book to 13 year olds and older and to any one who likes action packed books and adventure. This is one of the greatest books I have ever read.  
 This is an imaginatively detailed novel that is thoughtful, witty and bracing in a way that many good books are not. I suppose an oddity of "Independence Day" is that there is very little action, or even movement for that matter. What it is, though, is philosophical, wry, observant and smartly written. Ford's main character is a stable and intelligent divorcï¿½ who has such a curiously tight reign on his emotions that he, admittedly, finds himself in a stale but happy midlife. The novel is not so much about him blossoming out of this condition, but rather about his coming to a full understanding of it. If it is overwritten in parts, that is to some stylistic end that the author certainly seems to have in mind. 
 A great product - snug fit on the laptop, and appears to be a part of the laptop itself. Difficult to remove, but no real reason to remove it anyway. 
 I love reading Tom Peters. I plop the covers shut, and jump up feeling pumped, filled with ideas and bubbling over with enthusiasm. Unfortunately, on Monday, I still have to face the work-a-day world.  This book was no different. Indeed, it is one of his best. I love his ideas about decentralization and finding talent in everything work endeavor (Michelangelo's of housekeeping? Props, says the author). Building WOW! projects (any project can be WOW! if we let it), and resume-ing those projects to manage your career as a Professional Service provider. In short, how to brand yourself, how to grow that brand value, and ultimately leverage your talents through that brand.  This book, however, does not stop at the personal Buzz level. It touches on corporate restructuring to flatter, faster entities ... and the fact that the "nerds have won!" Peters points out that grey matter is becoming increasingly more important than lumpy things. For example, examine Nike, Microsoft and Oracle versus Ford. One sells stuff, the others sell ideas. Those industries highest in grey-matter consistently show the highest ROE.  I love this book, though not directly applicable like most excellent business books. In fact, I would caution anyone wanting to manage from Peters' un-tempered ideas.   For example, Peters lauds Nike throughout this book. But, check out how poorly Nike faired in the late 90's, early 2000's. Consumers, unawares to the company's executives, changed fashion trends away from white leather sport shoes and towards causal, brown natural leather shoes. At the same time, the company's lumbering supply chain made its core accounts (the sporting goods stores) very unhappy as they faced constant stock outages. And, when you add the public fervor over its sweat-shops in Asia, well ... Sometimes, it pays to be sober to temper over-exuberance. "A cup of decaf, please."  Everything aside, Peters is one-in-a-million. He continuously points me to the future, and gets my juices flowing. Sort of like a Michelangelo of biz-speak: the reigning king of biz-Chaos.  
 A couple of years ago on retreat I asked a nun from Plum Village what her favorite Thich Nhat Hahn title would be. She named this hefty tome which I purchased but did not read for quite awhile, assuming that it would be tedious and difficult going. (I have no idea why, none of Thay's books are anything but lovely and engaging...) What a wonderful surprise I received as I started reading vignette after vignette from the Buddha's life. In breathtakingly beautiful prose, Thay brings this great historical figure to life in a way that just makes you wish you had been there. The stories also explain and illustrate some of the more esoteric teachings in ways that are simple and easy to grasp, especially for those of us not raised in this tradition. Don't be put off by the size of the book as I was. Keep it on your bedstand and read a few stories a night. You'll be sorry when you are done 
 There are few groups my daughter and I both share an interest in, (35yr age difference) this is one of them...she's been singing "Low Rider" word for word since she was 4, to the amazement of my co-workers at the tire company I worked at. This CD covers all the best hits, not just one or two like most 
 I'm a working professional editor. I read Tom's first edition. I was blown away by the expert mix of how-to and why edits work which can only come from a veteran master editor who is also a teacher. This is the book that gives you everything needed to learn the application and the principles of editing form, structure, pacing, music-- wisdom you don't get from a dry software-only book. Tom layers in all the FCP operations-- appearing just where they should! It's an exceedingly robust work. You can spend well-structured time with it, as I did, practice the designed edit exercises with the supplied CD along with your keyboard chops from the included KeyGuide. Both editing skill and software know-how come together here in a dawning experience. In my view, it's either this, or a semester in film school containing separate classes on editing theory, editing practice, and a solid FCP course to boot 
 The $30 version is too good to be true.  Although it would appear that you are ordering an "attractively packaged two-volume set," you are actually ordering a study guide for what I am sure is an attractively packaged two-volume set 
 I bought this wedding planner for my nanny. I used the free one from State Farm, which they give to their insured, and that was okay. I splurged for her because she was completely unorganized. Within a few days she started bringing it to the house with all her paper work. I could hear her making her calls and checking off her lists. I asked her and she said it was very good. She had a planner form Barns and Noble and it was completely useless. The only complaint she had was the same as everyone else...having to photocopy the guest list. I can see if you are having 300 people, but there is only one page. I think for the money you should get enough for your average sized wedding. Other than that, it's great. It also has lots of ideas and pictures of some of Martha's great work and ideas 
 Piano music for four hands played an integral part in Schubert's compositional output. (Robert Schumann thought very highly of Schubert's compositions in this genre).   He composed like music throughout his very short life.  This recording contains works from the last years of his life and it certainly contains some of his best compositions for the piano-I really think that the Sonata for Piano 4 hands in C major, D 812/Op. 140 "Grand Duo" was really a symphony for two pianos. Whatever it is,  Levine and Kissen give it a splendid reading!  To me these works are far more than mere "housemusic" (or music known as music to be played exclusively among friends at evening gatherings in the home).  As a piano major during my college days (many years ago) I played (not well) many of Schubert's piano works for four hands (with other piano students).  I remember liking and enjoying them immensely.  Since that time, Schubert's piano music for four hands has sort of disappeared from my "musical radar".  This release is very welcome indeed.  Hearing these works played by musicians of the caliber of Evengy Kissin and James Levine is phenomenal. (I simply ADORE  the first number--Fantasie in F minor--it's achingly lovely)     Evengy Kissin and James Levine recorded this album "live" at Carnegie Hall in New York in 2005.  Musicians of this acclaim don't' get together often to play this kind of music.  Therefore, I would call this "a once in a lifetime" recording.  Kissin and Levine play these wonderful works splendidly.  Their playing reeks of almost a "second sense" with each other.  They are always together as if anticipating each other's next move.  There is a keen sense of rhythm, beautiful tone and dynamics.  BRAVO!  I really don't expect, in my lifetime, to hear these works played again as well as they are played on this album-it's is really amazing.    For some divine piano playing by two master musicians, buy this disc!  
 These guys should have been bigger.  They were great musicians. Played in a power trio format, Bruce Foxton's bass was powerful, countered the melodies of the guitar, and was up front in the sound. The guitar playing was right out of early The Who. Paul Weller developed into a real fine musician  And boy, live these guys were the real deal! They rocked!  When punk/new wave died, they were ignored and changed their sound. They should have stayed with their original sound! The Stylel Counsel stunk and even know Weller is worshipped in England, The Jam was his zenith 
 I bought this for a love of my life who was flipping her wig for a career as a baketresse and she has since decided that she must work as an  aesthetician -  aka beauty queen - they are the same in the internal external thoroughfare - I understand.  Cooking is hard work.  However she had quite a few moments of clarity over this book.  I haven't seen it but she said it's beautiful, handy, and could be used as a good weapon 
 This book was my class textbook in a second year software engineering class.  Personally, I found that it covers quite well the basic, and some of the more complex, aspects of software engineering.  A sample of the numerous software engineering topics covered include software patterns, requirements gathering, software testing and project management.  The book also serves as an excellent introduction to certain of the more important aspects of the current version of the Unified Modelling Language (UML).  The book also reviews some concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  Although it uses Java 2 as its example language, the concepts explained in the book can be applied to another programming language such as C++.  Finally, the book is written in such a manner that it can be of use to the novice software engineer (or software engineering student) as well as an experienced developper looking to enhance his or her knowledge.  I would not hesitate to recommend this book to people wishing to increase their knowledge of software development 
 It teaches in a easy way to write in khmer language and enphatizes the colloquial knowledge of this exotic south-asiatic language 
 I found it a very informative book though a lot of the content was common sense. It doesn't hurt to be reminded of the obvious occasionally. Unfortunately, from my point of view, it was an American reference book which does not concern me in Australia. For anyone researching in America, I'm sure it would be very helpful.

 Kate sings the blues and swings and tells stories like only she can. The spiritual call of the  Peace Comes Stealing Slow   and Lord Help the Poor and Needy are timely and strong. 
 I read some daily. Try to review and do the worksheet. I am on chapter 8 and consider this to be an excellant study book 
 Ellie's whole life is pumpkin growing.  On the small patch of land in the yard of her home where she lives with her widower father, Ellie tries to grow giants big enough to win the town's annual pumpkin growing contest.  The fall festival is the biggest holiday of the year in town, and even though Ellie is still a teenager, she has been entering the adult growing division for years.  The problem is Cyril, a nasty and mean-spirited grower who also aims to grow the town's biggest pumpkin and has taken the fair's first-place title for many years.  Ellie always seems to be second place to this despicable man, who enjoys rubbing his victories in her face.  This year, though, Ellie is more determined than ever.  She is confident that Max, the biggest pumpkin she's ever grown, will be a champion.  That is, she is confident until she sees Cyril's giant.  Ellie continues to nurture her pumpkin while trying to do well in school, convince her father that growing pumpkins is important, and attempting to gain the attention of the new boy at school, the president of his former school's agriculture club.  It is a stressful life for Ellie, but will it all be worth it?  I liked how Ellie was able to relate everything going on in her life to growing.  She used the analogy to explain everything to the reader, which showed just how important it was to her.  The characters in this story were really good.  I liked the way they interacted with each other and stood up for each other.  I especially liked Richard and the way he supported Ellie.  However, Ellie took everything too seriously and overanalyzed everything.  If she were a real person, I don't know if anyone would ever want to be around her.  It also bothered me that Ellie was constantly obsessing over her weight and then overeating.  Someone strong enough to do all of the work it took to grow those pumpkins should have been strong enough to go on a diet, if her weight was such an issue to her 
 I've always enjoyed Bill Bryson's writing, and I've equally enjoyed the pieces he chose for this collection.  My favorites were Dave Eggers' "Hitchhikers Cuba" and "Lard is Good for You" by Alden Jones, set in Cuba and Costa Rica, two countries that I'm even more eager to visit after reading these essays.  Funny, entertaining, informative stuff 
 One of the brilliant books that i have ever read this book makes one thing about the endless posibilities one has in life and the ease with which they can be Achievd if we decide not to mess things up at the ground level... though it kept me wondering whether the successful mystics would be sucess ful always.. it kind of gives one the feeling that the the rules mentioned in the book are permnenant and the outcome is like that of the rule of gravity universal and undisputable... worth reading once......and revist multiple times worth a buy highly recommended. 
 This is the book you need for designing large-scale web sites, where a well-planned information architecture is absolutely essential.  In building effective large-scale websites, as in programming large computer applications, much work has to be done in the preliminary design stage.  The early design effort of the information architecture is valuable not only in the building of the successful large web site, but for the future maintainability and revision of this web site.     This classic primer is written by pioneers in information architecture and shows information architects, designers, and web site developers how to build large-scale web sites that are easy to navigate and appealing to users.  To accommodate the many web site display options available today, the book also addresses how to design for multiple platforms and for mobile devices.    The authors first lay the background for introducing and defining information architecture and for presenting the basic requirements to be good information architects.  Information is defined as different than data, different than knowledge and information-seeking behaviors are looked into before delving further into the study of information architecture.      The components of information architecture are then defined as organization systems, labeling systems, navigation systems, and searching systems. Organization systems define how we categorize information; labeling systems define how we represent information; navigation systems define how we browse or move through information; and searching systems tell us how we search information.  The study of these components in designing the information architecture of our web site comprises a major part of this book. Conclusion: In designing large-scale web sites, there are a lot of complex relationships between the information involved, the expected users of the web site, the objects involved, the storage of the objects, the search or browse methods involved, and yet many more subjects. This comprehensive book purports to address all (or most all) of the elements and components of information architecture that need to be addressed in designing a large-scale website so that when the web site is completed, it is an appealing and easy to use and navigate web site that users will enjoy, complete their tasks successfully, find their desired information, and return to the site again and again. 
 I hadn't seen this movie in years and caught part of it on cable.  I just had to buy it!  What a gem!  Dudley Moore is a fantastic comedian.  I never appreciated his talent when this first came out.  This is definitely the quintessential mid-life crisis move 
 Do you ever remember really boring driving trips with your parents when you were little?  Did you ever ask, "How much longer?"  What would you have given for the trip to have been fun for you?  Well, if you are like me, the trip should have been a lot shorter and included something I wanted to do.    I have always been fascinated by how human organizations work.  I think that interest traces back in part to the many tours my Dad took me on in our hometown when I was very young.  He would arrange for some friendly person he knew to show me the "inside" scoop at the ice cream factory, the tortilla factory, the lawn mower repair shop, the car repair shop, a dairy, the fire station, a butcher shop, a farm, a supermarket's warehouse, the local railroad station, and the police station.  I could tell he loved those tours as much as I did, even though he learned nothing new. The driving part of the trip was never more than 20 minutes (and usually less than five), and all of the activities were ones that I enjoyed.    That early interest led me into becoming a management consultant and expert on how to make organizations more effective and improve the quality of life for everyone.  Hardly a month passes when I do not have yet another chance to make a similar adult-version tour.  When my children were little, I adored taking them on the same kind of tours that my Dad did . . . as adjusted for their interests.  It turned out that one of their favorite tours was of our office!!!! Imagine that.    When I was young, I had a friend named Teri Brown who could make a lot out of a little like no one else I've ever met.  When I saw that Day Tripping was about taking children on educational day trips, I was hooked.  It turns out that this is a different Teri Brown (the age and husband's names are different), but the same talents seem to be present in both women.  Most of us grasp very little from visiting something we haven't seen before.  Even when I take knowledgeable adults who are properly briefed on a tour of a factory, I find that they have missed the significance of 95% of what they have seen . . . unless you take four hours to discuss what they have just seen for every hour they spent seeing it.  Ms. Brown clearly understands that point and charts out her ideas to allow your family to find activities it will find stimulating and to fully explore that stimulation in ways that will make the experience more meaningful to them.  I think that's an exceptional quality in a book aimed at helping parents become better at helping their children learn.    She develops examples along a number of themes:  historical, geological, meteorological, culinary, government, literary, naturalist, industrial production, botanical, communications, artistic and mathematical.    Having done this sort of trip all of my life, I found my horizons being expanded by that list.  I'm sure my grandchildren will benefit as a result.  Culinary, communications and mathematical were all new dimensions for me . . . but ones that I know I would enjoy.    She also gives you lots of templates to organize your thinking and preparation.  In that way, you won't forget to develop an aspect of the trip's potential.  For example, she outlines a possible objective for the trip, ways to prepare, how to enjoy the trip, follow-up activities to deepen the learning and possible applications of the new knowledge.  You can obviously build on her examples to make the results more customized to your family.    This book will be valuable to all families with children . . . but it will be a Godsend to home schooling parents.  The book also provides lots of advice on how to arrange for group tours as ways to meet other home schooling families.  I was reminded of this recently when a good friend came to Boston to take his family on a home schooling field trip on American history.  If he could have done his trip with other families, the trip would have been much more successful for all.    All books have some weaknesses in them.  The main one I noted here is that the author lives in Oregon and her detailed examples are a little more Oregon-centric than would be desirable.  She overcomes that bias by talking about what's probably available near you.  So I think the book works.  But if you happen to live in Oregon, this is an even better book for you!  So where will you go first?       
 Kenneth Pollack first gives his readers an excellent introduction to the remarkable history of Iran from the rise of the Persian Empire to the reign of the Pahlavis (pp. 3-100).  Pollack shows clearly how nationalist and xenophobic Iran got wary of meddling foreigners, starting with the hated Russians and Brits, in its domestic affairs (pp. 4, 41).  Many Iranians have angry psychological scars, believing that foreigners are the source of all their problems for partially understandable reasons (pp. 26, 71, 89, 99, 125, 128, 155-56, 161, 173-74, 242, 297, 389).    Pollack focuses the bulk of his book on a balanced account of the troubled American-Iranian relations in the last 50+ years.  The U.S. started building its "satanic" reputation after the CIA played a key role in helping the Brits get rid of Iran's popular Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq in 1953 (pp. 57-67).  Mosaddeq's "crime" was the "illegal" nationalization of the Iranian oil industry under control of the rapacious Brits (pp. 52-56).  The U.S. did not improve its reputation among most Iranians by supporting the dictatorial Shah who largely mismanaged the modernization of Iran until his overthrow in 1979 (pp. xxv, 72-140).    Pollack convincingly demonstrates that the Truman Administration and its successors usually did not exercise enough pressure on the Shah to democratize and liberalize Iran when they had the opportunity to do it (pp. 49, 76-77, 81, 89-90, 104, 121-24, 136-40).  The Shah, who was ironically considered sold out to the West, became less and less amenable to the "omniscient" U.S., beginning in the mid-1960s (pp. 39, 50, 84, 94, 99-100, 107, 120-27, 158, 173).     After the revolution of 1979, the U.S. mostly supported Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war and funded different destabilization operations to contain and try to overthrow the Islamic Republic (pp. 206-16, 259-65, 273-76, 386).  The U.S. apologized in 2000 for some past misdeeds in an unsuccessful attempt to improve its relations with Teheran under the presidency of the moderate but ultimately ineffective Mohammad Kathami, who was under relentless pressure from the hard-liners (pp. xxv, 303-42).   Pollack blames with equal conviction the Iranians for the awful relations existing between both countries.  Iran has built its reputation of international pariah due to the illegal seizure of the U.S. embassy staff in 1979, its lack of democratic credentials, its support of terrorism around the world, its opposition to the Middle East peace process, and its pursuit of (nuclear) WMDs (pp. xxi, 141-80, 182, 198-201, 237-40, 248, 256-59, 266-67, 277, 345, 379-82).   Pollack also explains to its readers that many Iranians have a poor understanding of the U.S. (pp. 50, 180, 309).     Pollack does not hesitate to show repeatedly that greed has not stopped the international community, including the U.S. at times, from doing business with Iran in the last 25+ years (pp. 164-65, 262-65, 271-72, 286-89).  Iran is trying without much success to emulate China by crushing internal dissent and favoring economic development (pp. xxiv, 250, 369-73, 390-91).  The U.S. will be of no help in this endeavor as long as Iran stubbornly clings to its pursuit of acquiring nuclear military expertise on top of other objectionable actions (pp. 273, 312, 324, 351).   Pollack tries to crack the Iranian enigma by rightly ruling out an invasion of Iran due to its size, population, and topography (pp. xxiii, 383-86).  Pollack ultimately pleads for a three-pronged strategy that rests on an unconvincing mix of carrots and sticks (pp. 375-424).   The U.S.-led international community seems to believe that Iran will "submit" to the "diktats" of foreigners in the nuclear crisis without undermining again the "legitimacy" of the hard-liners (pp. xxv-xxvi, 157, 251, 352, 365, 395-400).  Hard-liners have not forgotten the humiliation of 1988 (pp. 227-33).  Nuclear WMDs would shield Iran from further "humiliating" foreign interference (pp. 259, 361-69).  The Shi'i hard-liners, inspired by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and co, relish martyrdom and heavy sacrifices (pp. 157, 177-79, 222-23, 302).  Like most of his predecessors, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is seeking confrontation with the international community as a way of diverting Iranians' attention from their problems for which ideology is a poor solution (pp. 158, 238, 243, 293-96, 348, 369-74).  Iranian hard-liners can find plenty of inspiration in the playbooks of Adolf Hitler and co.  The U.S. will discover again at its own expense that key countries will balk at acting responsibly after Iran predictably fails to comply with the legitimate demands of the society of nations (pp. 165, 262).  Iranian hard-liners consider weakness a defensive and reactive policy towards their offensive agenda (pp. 218, 234-35, 266, 300).  Nothing meaningful will happen until the implementation of very comprehensive economic / financial sanctions and the credible threat of massive strategic bombardments against the nuclear and revolutionary power infrastructure across Iran (pp. 299, 301, 392-95).  Iran has not been impressed with half-baked carrots like the Critical Dialogue and, with "Mini-Me" sticks such as Dual Containment and a few cruise missiles (pp. 265, 273-76, 283-84, 291, 337-38, 344, 391).  There will be no free lunch (p. 385).  Stepped-up war against (state-sponsored) terrorism will require a series of "patriotic" sacrifices to mitigate the inevitable, short-term sharp increase in energy prices.  Furthermore, there will be a new spike in terrorist operations as a "payback" for muscular action against Iran (pp. 253, 345-49, 354-58, 373, 392).  If Iran is not stopped before it acquires nuclear WMDs, it will indulge with a vengeance its own regional hegemonic aspirations not only in the Persian Gulf, but also in Central Asia (pp. 253-56).  Energy prices will not go down in this scenario.  Furthermore, Iranian hard-liners could consider Southern Russia and Chinese Xinjiang fair game for their revolutionary agenda due to the sub-optimal treatment of many Muslim minorities in these areas (pp. 198-205).  Their military nuclear program is not purely defensive.  Whoever ignores the past, will pay a heavy price down the road. 
 This is a very detailed textbook. If you want to learn about Geology in great detail this is the book for you. I recently learned that a new version will be coming out soon. I know this because my university will not buy the book back since the new edition will replace this edition next semester. If you plan on buying this book wait because the price will go down as soon as the new edition comes out. 
 My name is Rob please listen to my tale Of how owning your feelings will help without fail.  I was sad, my mother had to die I was so closed up I couldn't cry.

We knew we had to tell the tiger bye So a funeral was held by Sistine and I  Through all this sadness I did learn To let my true feelings return.    
 A VERY good book which tells you not only the 'hows', but the 'whys' too. Long does a very good job of anticipating the nuts-and-bolts questions, he even describes some of the newbie problems HE had. He's somebody who has walked the walk, having made many of the mistakes for you in advance 
 I've had this album for several years and love it alot. Good choice of diverse songs, groovy styles 
 This movie is excellent!  It has many threads running through it to provide lots of interwoven actions.  I am a retired school teacher and I really enjoyed the success stories and how one helps the other.  It is a film in which children of all ages and adults can relate not only to one another but to the characters in the movie.  
 This cd is Joni Mitchell at her best.  Even my daughters have listened to her and liked it 
 This was such an awesome disc because I have never these videos. Reba was great in all of the videos and it was nice to see how the earlier videos from the '80s to '90s transitioned to her most recent videos. I recommend both Video Gold, Volume I & II, they are great. Hope many of you have already purchased them or plan on purhasing both of them 
 There's no dead money on Jim Swain's latest pair of books in his Tony Valentine series.  Deadman's Poker, followed by Deadman's Bluff, is a one-two made hand yarn of scams, intrigue, humor and emotion this reader has come to love in Swain's novels.  Leisure time for reading is rare for me, but Swain never disappoints with a story I can cast in my mind, and read in days, no matter how complex.  I burned through the pages of both Deadman's Poker & Bluff in just 4 days, enjoying every minute.  As always, he does leave me wanting at the end...for the next Tony Valentine story!     
 This valuable book explores the history of the first century of the Christian religion, showing that the early leaders of the church were Jewish, that the early church was organized on the pattern of the synagogue and explaining what Jesus really meant in his frequent use of Jewish idioms that were literally translated into Greek with the resulting confusion of meaning.  The book is written as a study text with review questions at the end of each chapter. What emerges is quite astonishing and not at all what many Christians have been led to believe. In the context of the Hebrew idioms, many perplexing utterances of Jesus become perfectly clear.  Chapter One presents the evidence for the Jewish background of the early church and discusses the early Hebraic names for the church. The fascinating Chapter Two deals with Jewish idioms in the teachings of Jesus; it includes passages on the parable of the reed and the oak, the golden vine, binding and loosing, the good eye and sounding the trumpet.  Chapter Three examines misconceptions regarding the law. It includes discussions of the law and grace, the Holy Spirit and the law, Paul and the law, the famous Gnostic Marcion and his view of the law, the letter of the law, the purpose of the law, and great Christian leaders' view of the law.  Chapter Four explores the old and the new covenants, the Noachide laws and 4th century theology, whilst the next chapter looks at subjects like the Holy Spirit, grace and gifts before Christ, the three stages of salvation and the relationship of the law to the New Testament.  Chapters Six to Nine are an in-depth study of the Pharisees, including their theology, their study and worship, and the Sadducees, Scribes and Essenes. There are also passages discussing their duties, their communities and the different types of Pharisee.  Their teachings are discussed in Chapter Eight, which includes discussions of miracles, traditions, evangelism and teaching methods. The final chapter looks at similarities between the Puritans and the Pharisees, Pharisaic doctrines and the schools of Hillel and Shammai.  The last chapter lists eight significant conclusions of the preceding text. These include the fact that Christianity was born within the matrix of Judaism and that the original language, idioms, customs, organizational structure and religious practices of the church were thoroughly Jewish.  The book contains a glossary, a bibliography and endnotes arranged by chapter. I highly recommend this work to all Christians who wish to understand the roots of their faith and what Jesus really meant, especially where his words in the English translations of the Bible appear to be confusing. In this regard, I suggest the interested reader also consult the brilliant book by David Bivin: Understanding The Difficult Words Of Jesus. 
 great iron and its purple! heats up fast, stays hot, variable hotness levels..great i own this and the next size up and love them both 
 I am new to gardeing and this book gave a lot of good information to me.  It answered every question that I had.  The pictures inside are plentiful and beautiful 
 Buy this book! Every person with hep C should own a copy. I got a lot out of Dolan's Hep C Handbook, but this one is more accessible & it's easier to find what you're looking for. Packed with information, a great reference 
 Every once in a while I get a book I can't put down, and this was definitely one!  The story line is great and moves quickly, and I loved all the characters.  They all felt real.  And the autopsy was REALLY real, to the point where I'm pretty sure I'd never want to attend one!  Ferguson obviously did a lot of research.  I don't want to give anything away but will say that it's a nail-biter 
 Usually I could jump into an Eric Jerome Dickey book, but this one took awhile for me to get into but it was an okay read altogether. It wasn't as good as his previous works but it wasn't a disaster either. The book doesn't get good until the middle of the book and it has a good ending. The way it ended makes me believe there's going to be a part II. But all in all, its a decent read. 
 Ursula Bielski has done some remarkable things for Chicago's young people since she penned her first book nearly ten years ago.  In an era which finds the entire Chicago history curriculum reduced to a week of field trips and special projects, Ms. Bielski's books have been "luring" kids into learning about the city's history year 'round, by teaching that history through the "ghostlore" that surrounds some of Chicago's most important people, places, and events.  This particular book retells some of the more gruesome tales for younger readers, leaving out a lot of the gorey details of the original stories.  A word of caution, though: once your kids read this one, they will invariably seek out the others!  Our school library has multiple copies of all of Ursula Bielski's books, and they are dog-eared, beat up, and utterly loved.  Can't wait for the next one 
 And that my friends is a rarity.  I'm new to the 'As Good as it Gets' fanclub sort-a-speak since I, for the first time, saw it last night despite the fact that my wife HATES the movie and was pissed I rented it.  I have always been a fan of Jack Nicholson for he has been on top of his game for YEARS and doesn't show any sign of letting up anytime soon (I mean, he's won 3 oscars and has been nominated 12 times).  I've also always enjoyed Hunt and Kinnear so it's a shoe-in for me to enjoy this film right?  I just for some reason have never had the desire to see it, and then there I was walking through the local blockbuster thinking, you know what, I'll just go for it, and I'm so glad I did.  Right off the bat Nicholson is at his best playing the grumpy old man, but he always adds just the right amount of class and confidence to lift him from Walter Matthau status and place him in the Michael Caine league.  Nicholson plays Melvin, an obsesive compulsive racist bigot sexist grump of a man who is hated by everyone and very well may like it that way.  He lives in the same apartment complex as Simon (Kinnear) a gay painter who is the subject of Melvin's vented anger (which is displayed by his constant verbal battery of poor Simon and the abuse he inflicts of Simon's dog) but after Simon is beaten and injured Melvin is pusuaded (a bit forcfully) to take care of Simon's dog.  Unexpectedly Melvin forms an attachment to the dog and is somehow changed by his experience and moved to be a nicer, better person.  He starts by helping a local waitress Carol (Hunt) who may just be the only person who tolerates him.  Carol & Melvin & Simon throughout the remander of the film form a bond that is both unexpected and remarkably beautiful.  Helen Hunt is wonderful in this film, as is Kinnear, but it's Nicholson's show and there isn't a better man for the show.  I have never watched a performance that made me more anxious then watching Nicholson say the WRONG thing everytime, but as Carol realizes, he has his moments, and those moments are about as good as it gets 
 Desent book, good dificulty progression.  This is the type of book that every classical guitar player should own 
 This first track alone is worth the price of this album.  Miles had a way with ballads that no one could touch.  This album was my only clue that there may be a god.. 
 This is a book that helps me everytime I go to a health store. I need to get in touch with the author of this book and deliver a couple of gifts. The writer(s) deserve a few more degree's for this masterful work.   Sincerely,  Author. "Knowledge For Tomorrow"..Quinton D. Crawford 
 This new character created by Parker is getting better with each new novel.  This story defines even more about his personality and what drives him as an individual and an the police chief.  One drawback, he is still be oppressed by his horrid ex-wife.  Why he can't get a hold of himself and rid himself of such a life-wasting creature is beyond me.  Between her and Susan Silverman, you gotta wonder about Parker

 Bowlby is a clear and cogent thinker who takes time to look at an important issue in tremendous detail.  Taking into account much previous research and theorizing, he accepts and refutes a wide body of work in making his point.  You may not agree with all of his conclusions (I may not agree with all of his conclusions), but this is not a book to be discounted lightly.  Should be required reading for anyone interested in the fields of psychoanalysis and child development 
 This product complements my Dell M1210 perfectly. The dimensions are perfect for any 12 inch laptops. I love the added features and the choice of using an external power cord or a USB connection to power the fans.  The fans spin very quietly and it kept my laptop in a very comfortable temperature. I don't know how well this will perform in the summer or how good it is when I'm plugging in lots of peripherals and intensive CPU/HD use.  It would be nice if they have this product in black color. But so far so good 
   The Panasonic PV-GS500 was discontinued in late 2006 in anticipation of Panasonic's new 2007 models which will be available in the Spring.    The PV-GS500 is compact, delivers stunning video in moderate lighting and above, has a lot of features that will appeal to the aspiring pro-sumer videographer. It lacks an audio output jack, which many will fault it for. It does have a separate microphone jack. The menu is driven by a toggle and is easy to use.    It is reall aimed at the casual videographer who wants superb quality in a compact, uncomplicated package and it delivers precisely that.    Low-light performance is poor, but there is an accessory shoe, so you can mount an auxillary light. I would suggest getting an accessory bracket that provides two or three accessory shoes so you can use both a shotgun microphone and an auxillary light for weddings, parties and other group events.    Battery life is about what you would expect, so carrying one or two spare batteries is recommended.    All in all, a very nice 3CCD camcorder for the advanced amateur or just someone who wants superb image quality in an easy-to-use package.  Jerr 
 I am absolutley impressed with the condition I recieved the book in. I will most definatley be buying through Amazon again. I am enjoying the book immensle 
 If you have not begun your Grey's Anatomy obsession, you are missing out. This show has it all: Hotty McHottnesses, witty dialogue, subtle character neuroses, and best of all, drama. In a show that follows in the footsteps of many other legendary medical dramas, Grey's has blazed a new path. This season was of typical length, much longer than season one, and never ceased to amaze. Owning the DVD simply ensures you can always get your Grey's fix at any time! A must 
 That Wave...put me under the album for weeks.  OK.  It's a good album.  Starting with the rocking JFK "Ballad of Peter Pumpkin Head". Moulding's finest moment is "My Bird Performs" which is pretty catchy and has flugelhorns.    "Dear Madam" is a great song about resigning as a clown"I put on a fake smile/And I start the evening Show/The Public is laughing/I guess by now they know/So Climb from your High Horse/And Pull this Freakshow Down/Dear Madam Barnum/ I resign as clown"  "Humble Daisy" is another great tune Really sweet sounding and sincere.  "Rook" has an awesome piano jam and is a great tune.  "Holly Up on Poppies" has a Pyschedelic craze which fits well in the album.  "Omnibus" has some good use of keyboard programming and drum programming.  It's a catchy tune, but the lyrics are a little strange for me.  "Then She Appeared" is an instant classic.  The rest of the album is pretty good in it's strange XTC way with circus and medevil themes all around.  I'd recommend Non to fans of "Skylarking", heck I think this is better than Sky.  
 I have a Honda, which I love, but since I do not drive her on a daily basis now, the battery is tempermental. I bought this product and have had to use it several times. I've found it easy to use and, even when the car battery has been completely dead, this jumpstarter has had more than enough power to get her started. I comparison shopped and the price of this Black & Decker was the best bargain, too. Recommend it highly 
     I'm going to tell you about the book A Long Way From Chicago By Richard Peck. The three main characters are Grandma, Joey, and Mary Alice. This book is about 2 kids Joey and Mary Alice who go and visit their Grandma 1week in August. Every chapter is a new year. My favorite chapter is when they go to the parade.  	When Grandma Joey and Mary Alice go to the parade to old guys get into a fight. The characters face problems like trespassing and they use blackmail to get out of it. I like when grandma uses blackmail.    	I thought this book was good. The book is very funny. I would give this book 10 out of 10. I highly recommend this book. I think others would like this book. 
 This is one of the best live big band/jazz albums ever recorded! From the hot opener Teonova to the ending tag of Blue Birdland, there's not a bad cut in the bunch. I wore out two copies on vinyl and waited twenty years to replace it on CD. If there was only one Maynard Ferguson album left on the planet, I hope this would be the one.  
 In this Advisor Series addition to the Rich Dad Poor Dad collection you get a preliminary dose on how to play to your best strengths in selling. What I liked about this book is it demonstrated some mindsets that help you sell without having to change who you are.  I never cared much for selling until I read this book. I always tried to become the model of a succesful salesman and found it didn't agree with me. Blair showed me how to sell with my personality.

 Kahn's inspired account of codebreaking and cryptanalysis from ancient to modern is a must read for anybody who wishes to understand history, technology, warfare -- nearly every facet of life which depends on encrypted communications and their vulnerability.  His gripping narrative will suck you in and hold you until the last page.    The Codebreakers is accessible to the lay reader without skimping on broad technical fundamentals.  While cryptography is an oft written-about topic today, Kahn's enduring masterpiece is the ne plus ultra to which all others aspire 
 This movie concerns 5 students in Medical School who want to discover if there is anything after death. Most Medical Students I know are too busy deciding on wether to buy a Porsche 933  or a Mercedes 650SL after they graduate and start making the BIG BUCKS to worry about things of a Spiritual Nature. Anyway back to the movie. These students go into a State of being Brain Dead ( just like most Medical Students I know) and then they get revived and it is "Storytime" for the rest of them. This movie was a big hit for some obscure reason but I do like Keifer Sutherland which is why I give this movie 5 stars 
 Do you know which state has the largest cave system in the world, why Tennessee's nickname is the Volunteer State, or why North and South Dakota have the same name? What did Delaware do first, before any other state and why are more languages spoken in Oklahoma than in all of Europe?

The answers to these and hundreds of other questions can be found in Kenneth Davis' marvelously creative and inventive geography book, Don't Know Much About The 50 States. Written in an easy to read, conversational format, each page is dedicated to a single state, chock full of interesting trivia, fun facts and historical information and complemented by Renee Andriani's witty and expressive illustrations that just add to the fun. Perfect for youngsters 9-12, this is a book full of history, trivia and lots of surprises that whets the appetite, takes the stuffiness out of geography and makes learning fun. So find out in which two states wild Venus Fly Traps grow, and enjoy 
 My mother had "good" hair and she didn't have the patience/knowledge to help me manage my "skraight from africa naps". So, I can relate to a lot of the authors experiences (even though I'm only 31). I cut my hair on a whim, then I bought this book. Before reading it I never thought that nappy stuff on my head could grow out (without being a total headache) and was committed to keeping it short. One year later, I had shoulder-length hair that was the envy of ALL the sistas...even the biracial one with "good" hair.  For those of you without a clue, get this book! Read her other book too.  But for those of you who already have the information but haven't committed to treating your hair with respect, you won't learn anything new in this book. It's up to you to treat your hair with love. No book, cream, perm or weave can replace the TLC your hair needs. Good luck and love your naps! I do 
 I read a lot of historical novels, and two of the very best I have ever read are this and Rise to Rebellion. Highly recommended 
 This album is good charlotte's greatest accomplishment ever. They have tried something new each time and aren't afraid to do it. This album shows that these guys are mature in their music and what they believe. This album has more darker subjects than any other album they have put out. I am a good charlotte fan and i have to say this impresses me a lot. The whole sound is heavier and darker. Full of controversy and thats what they guys wanted. Controversy  These tracks really stand out to me  1) The chronicles of life and death- This song is a grotesque look into well humans. The lyrics are basically about when our lives first begin and then end. The lyrics are very raw and very PG-13 rated. It has a lot of controversial issues in it. This song is not appropriate for anyone under 13 because of the nature of this song. Here is a perfect example of some of the subjects in this song: You come in cold You're covered in blood They're all so happy you've arrived The doctor cuts your cord He hands you to your mom She sets you free into this life   thats just an example of what the nature of this song is about.  2) I Just Wanna Live- My God What The Hell Were These Guys Thinking? It is hilarious. I think it one of the most hilarious songs ive heard from these guys. I mean the lyrics are freakin funny. The vibe is more popish.  3) The Ghost Of You-I love this song. It has a very haunting vibe to it. The lyrics are really haunting. The way that Joel sings it makes my spine shiver. His voice is very haunting in this song and that is what makes it more brilliant and a great song. Just the way his vocal qualities are on this song.  4) Predictable-This song is a good song but I dont like it that much  5) Secrets- I got hooked onto this song by watching it on Sessions at Aol.com a while ago. The whole song is very raw. The theme is raw and has a lot of truth. These guys have secrets that they hide from us and like them we have secrets that haunt us. No one knows what they are only we do.  6) The Truth- OK! This song has been the song I have been waiting for. A song full of emotion and darkness. My god it scares the crap outta me when i listen to it. The whole nature of the song is so dark and scary I love it. When I first heard it, I was scared to death. Now it does have a real meaning to my life. I can relate to it. Joel Madden's voice is so dark and emotional it makes me cry. I mean he sounds so dark and so angry in it that is what makes it more and more genious. Thats what I like about this song in particular. Just how Joel gets his voice to sound so dark, emotional and just so damn sexy. I think he sounds really good on this song. Now when he screams, that makes me scared beyond belief. It hits my gut so hard, I get sick. It's just that emotion of when somone is angry that makes you cringe with sorrow. Thats what this song did to me.   7) The World Is Black- Just look at the title and you can get what the song is about. It's the truth about today and how evil our world is.  8) Mountain- This song is so adorable. I love it. The lyrics are beautiful. Now the vocals are so good that when they hit that high note, it makes you fall more in love with them. I love how Benji And Joel sound on it vocally. It is a great song  9) We Believe- My Favorite on this album. The whole song is so powerful and so real. This song is controversy in the making. The part that stands out is,  There's a woman crying out tonight  Her world has changed  She asks God why  Her only son has died  And now her daughter cries  She can't sleep at night   Downtown  Another day for all the suits and ties  Another war to fight  There's no regard for life  How do they sleep at night  How can we make things right?  Just wanna make this right   the part about the war is realistic. The whole concept of this song is about believing in one another but yet our world today is full of war, pain, and sorrow. Joel And Benji really stand out on this track especially because of the beauty of them hitting those high notes and how harmonious it sounds. Truly, this song is a very good song and it is very beautiful in its meaning.   10) In This World (Murder)-This song has lots of controversy in it. I mean the title tell you what this song is about. There are people dying in this world and people just ignore it. People are being murdered and no one cares. This song gives a whole new meaning to murder in the world.  11)Meet My Maker (Bonus Track)-WOW!!!! I am amazed that these guys wrote something that relates to them also. I mean these guys are actually talking about what they truly believe in and that they know they will be with their maker in the end. This song is one of the most risk taking songs yet. I love the whole song and the whole rock feeling to it.  Wounded (Hidden Track)-WOW!!! Amazing and raw. Benji Madden sounds really good on this hidden track that is very hard to find once you listen to the bonus track. This song is full of controversy in all. Just the whole concept of it and the lyrics. It is raw, it is scary, and it makes someone cry. I think it was pure luck that anyone could figure out where this track was. I kept hearing that there was a hidden track but I didnt know where it was.  In summary: This album is a risk taking album that Good Charlotte recorded. A work of a true rock band. Songs that have meaning to them personally. A more heavier and darker vibe and more mature lyrics. It is an album that has songs with beautiful lyrics and beautiful vocals. It is an album that these guys spilled out their hearts and souls on it. It is a true indepth look into Good Charlotte and who these guys really are. It has songs about their faith, songs about pain, songs about death, songs about hurt, songs about fear, and more. I really would suggest this album to anyone who wants to hear some really raw stuff by a really good band. These guys know how to rock and they do it on this album especially!!! 
 On Monkey Business, BEP wasn't necessarily producing a hip-hop / rap album. If one tries to classify the album (a staggering solid 15 tracks!), one may - and quite rightly - arrive at the conclusion that it was more of an album which cleverly married rap with innovative dance beats (a little like CD2 of Outkast's Speakerboxxx/The Love Below), rather than going the quotidian path of rappers rapping about how good, powerful, big, rich, bad, gangsta etc they are over unimaginative, heavy bass beats.  Now THAT is tired, if you ask me.    Reviewers who complain about how Monkey Business "isn't hip hop" etc and gave it low grades have totally missed the point.    This is a shamelessly groovy album, drawing inspiration from other mega-hits (e.g. "Don't Phunk With My Heart", "Dum Diddly" & "Union") and featuring mega-popstars (e.g. Justin Timberlake & Sting).  This album is SO rhythmic, catchy, cute and wild, you should be shaking your bootee to it if you had any sense of rhythm and style.  Afterall, "there ain't nuthin' wrong with a woman in a club gettin' freaky to the song". Amen to that.  Special mention has to be made about the tracks "Don't Lie" (a catchy, sunny ditty about not lying), "My Humps" (groovy, cheeky, stylish - a LOT of people appear to like this), "Disco Club" (again it's catchy & groovy, suitable for putting in your stereo as you are driving to a club), and "Union" (a nod to Sting's 'Englishman In New York', with cleverly-altered lyrics about fighting for a peaceful and harmonious world).    Finally, I am in awe with "Bebot" - Allen Pineda Lindo's modern tribute to his roots. After 4 seconds of a tacky faux opener, strong beats kick in, syncopated with claps and tambourine slaps, "bebot"-ing away, creating a delicious recipe for disco hell.  Then enter Filipino rap - perfectly legitimate, perfectly meaningful, perfectly empowering.  There are readily-available translations online, which should shed some light on why this song is such a beautiful, enjoyable tribute. 
 I picked this CD up after my friend and i saw "FUHGAWZ" written on Kurt Cobains shoe on some poster. We looked it up on Google and found that it stood for "Fugazi." Huh, must be a band. Ok, I guess i will check 'em out. I was pretty impressed. I guess I was expecting some gay new pop-punk band but what I got was an amazing post-hardcore experience. Sounding more like Nirvana or Mudhoney, than the Dead Kennedys, Fugazi slows punk down a bit on most of their songs. The first half of the CD is especially strong with Waiting Room starting things off with that great 24 second intro then stopping.....then grabbing you and bringing you with on a 40 minute punk experience. Truly an excellent CD, thanks Kurt. Standout tracks are "Waiting Room," "Bad Mouth" and "Suggestion" which Kurt covered i might add. 
 As a beginning teacher preparing for a summer reading workshop, I found this book to be helpful. It has great ideas for setting up a workshop atmosphere. I also loved the guidelines and responsibilities of both  teachers and students that were included. The reading mini-lessons were  useful, although I would say most are geared for late elemntary and middle  school students 
 This is one of the objective biographies about late Egyptian President and Arab leader Gamal Abdul-Nasser. Even though Said Aburish expresses his admiration of Nasser toward the beginning of the book, a statement which warns the reader of a biased account in favor of Nasser, the book eventually proves to be otherwise. According to Aburish, Nasser was a popular leader only and had no vision, platform or plan for the Arab world. Aburish correctly argues that Nasser had two positive sides only to his leadership: The first is that Nasser was never corrupt and the second is that his dictatorship depended mostly on his charisma.  Nasser didn't live a luxurious life or eliminate his earlier comrades after he took over the Egyptian rule. Nasser's single-mindedness in decision-making, however, dominated his leadership. This rare influence depended on an undisputed leadership drawing mainly on Nasser's popularity and charisma. Through a narration covering Nasser's life since his early days, Aburish leaves then his reader to judge whether an incompetent popular leader with no platform was needed at that period of Arab history or not. The book is also a good read for all those who are interested in exploring the history of Egypt and the Arab world between the late 1940s and 1970. In terms of style, Aburish presents an easy going and attractive narrative. His sources and research are, by and large, credible. Certainly several pro-Arab nationalism reviewers will find Aburish's book not credible, but whoever wants to dispute this account should provide a better one instead of employing emotions only in criticizing this work 
 I found Preconception Plain and Simple very funny and very intelligent!! It is so refreshing to read about how exciting the process of baby making can be, and it doesn't have to be a time filled with stress and anxiety. I especially loved the red flag parts for men, not overwhelming for them - but definitely funny enough to grab their attention. A girl-friendly read 
 This book is the best of all books about the afterlife because it deals with someone we all know (John Lennon) in a way that we all understand it. I'm sure that once in our lives a dead relative or friend has contacted us, whether we believe it or not. This is further proof that even though the people we love are dead, they are not unactive! It is a comforting thought. 'Across The Universe With John Lennon' is so real that one wishes they could be there right along side with Linda and John, and often feel as though you are 
 I'm glad that I finally got the book after seeing Teri on the Oprah show and the Metro Channel. Her reporting genius and years of experience show as she single-handedly unveils this industry which too often tends to believe its own hype. It was especially interesting to read her accounts of the ways in which the homogenization of large American retail stores has bolstered designers' marketing and branding efforts and subsequently, and ironically, led to the death of fashion. This read was especially timely as I watch my hip trendy New Yorker friends spending $200 on banal denim pants in assorted hues. My only regret is that Teri never once conceded that designers are artists; her approach was strictly business and on those terms this book is brilliant 
 I don't have any gripes about this iPod armband. It has worked well for me in a variety of activities (running, rowing, weights). The silicon case is more sweat-resistant than a lot of the leather ones out there, and the thick armband keeps it tight to your arm. Plus, this one looks a lot better than a lot of the other iPod cases I see out there with full clear plastic front covers.   Also, a non-permanent stick-on screen protector is included, which I didn't see in the product description. It seems to be effective as well 
 Hubbard or Heinlein or Hemingway or one of those guys once said "You must write!" when handing out advice to new writers. This book empahsises that aspect of the writing "process". No Plot? No Problem tells you how to get those words on  paper, in effect creating the raw material you'll work with when you get to the editing, revison, and publishing stages. Ever wonder how some of those guys seem to churn out book after book after book? It's because they have a deadline, that's why, and Baty shows you how to get ready for one, set one, and go.  I could praise this book forever but I'm already getting behind on my word count for today. Write on, my brethren 
 Touchdown Pass is the first of 23 Chip Hilton sports novels.  Originally published in 1948, it retains much of the homey goodness of that era.  While this first in the series is about fottball, in the subsequent 22 novels, Chip and his chums take on basketball and baseball.  This is a quaint adventure, intended for children but a pleasant read and reread for fans of all ages.  The author was also a famous basketball coach of the fifties, also author to many non-fiction books on basketball techniques and coaching 
 I bought this for my grandson, and he no sooner got it out of the box (with help), and he was outside in the sand with it, having a great time.  Cannot lose with these oversized trucks for little hands.  It is a good purchase 
 The chip works just as advertised.  I have had no problems with it, it was easily formatted to my Kodak camera, and it stores a huge amount of pictures and video, either about 280 pictures or almost an hour of video.  Great product, I would recommend it for anyone looking for a lot of storage space for a good price 
 it was a bit rambling or else i would have given it 5 stars, and i would have liked a little more information on giraffes,per se., its a definte read 
 At the present moment there is an awfully small amount of books about French Second World War Aviation obtainable in English, and this book is one of the few who does and has done so since 1971. It is only since 2002 that a comparable work has been published -French Fighters of World War II in Action-, and that offers little extra information to the subject. Of all twelve published titles in the Men&Machine Series this remains the one with seemingly everlasting value, so my advise would be: buy it if you're interested in French Fighters of the second world war, but be prepared to search hard to find it 
 A very good realisitic depicition of the events leading up to crucifiction which helps one fully appreciate the sacrifice which was made 
  As is the case in all cultures, there are people more and less suited for various tasks. In the world of the American Indians of the plains all life revolved around hunting the buffalo. However, not all boys are meant to be fierce warriors, some are simply not suited to the task. This book is about Little Gopher, a boy who had a Dream-Vision of his grandfather where he was told that he was to paint the pictures of the warriors rather than be one. His canvas was to be stretched white buckskin, his brushes made from the hairs of different animals and his colors were made from rocks and berries. He painted scenes of his people in action, but for some time he longed to make an accurate rendition of a sunset as he never seemed able to create the right colors.  One night he had another vision where he was told that because he had remained true to his calling, on the next day he would be able to sit on a hill and capture the sunset in a painting. He succeeded and he left his brushes on the hill when he carried the painting down to show it to his tribe. The next day his brushes had taken root and had turned into plants with brilliant reds, oranges and yellows. Because of his deeds, the people of his tribe changed his name to He-Who-Brought-the-Sunset-to-the-Earth. This is the legend of how the Indian Paintbrush flowers came into existence.  Like so many other legends of the American Indians, this is a story worth reading. Superbly illustrated using a minimum of color, I recommend this story to all elementary school children 
 The Singer of All songs was amazing. Kate Constable is now my favorite author, and I have read the two other books in the trilogy. If you have not yet read it, pick it up now and you won't regret it. Constable takes you on a delightful journey through Tremaris with a girl of sixteen who can sing chantments. I couldn't put this book down! If you like this story, I reccomend the two other books in the trilogy, The Waterless Sea and the Tenth Power. This story was superb, as Kate Constable's writing style is terriffic. 
 1978's Shadow Dancing is another lost and forgotten GEM. The majority of the album is produced and written by older brother and song writing genius, Barry Gibb. Although, Andy has a lot of input in this one. Vocally, I think Andy was the stronger singer out of the 4 brothers, he tends to emulate Barry, but with more range. Together he and Barry's harmonizing flow like running water in a sweet Spring stream. The band is as tight as they could ever be, lovely strings, they are at their peak.  Think Children Of The World,  Main Course, or (even the well over hyped) Saturday Night Fever period. And this one doesn't get nearly enough press, if any, but deserves the praise and then some!   Besides the big hits, this package also offers the stunning, "Good Feeling," probably one of the best Gibb produced track of all time! Midway through the album is the killer "One More Look At The Night," a smooth jam that will remind you of "Nights On Broadway." "Fool For A Night" has a nice Caribbean feel and a clever lyric to go with it. The ballads are breathtaking from the essential version (the Bee Gees did a nice version, too) of "(Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away,"  "Melody," to the album's closer, "Waiting For You," you don't feel more emotion in Andy's voice on any other album, this is definitely the one. He and Barry reached a creative high point on this one. 5 stars, baby!  Rest in peace, Andy 
 Janice Kim and Jeong Soo-hyun have made and excellent book. I had wanted to play go for a long time, yet I did not know what book to choose. Learn to Play Go: A Master's Guide to the Ultimate Game was very helpful.  The book is organized into chapters, and at the end of each chapter, there are some problems for you to try yourself. The book is very easy to understand, and you feel very satisfied when you successfully answer a question.  You don't have a go board? No problem. There is a go set inside. It has a reversable mat with a 19 by 19, 13 by 13 and a 9 by 9 board. There are also 'stones' made out of a thick paper.  This instructional book has everything from ko and life and death, to information about go history and playing go on the computer. If you have never played go before, definately buy this book. 
 This album is a classic. It is not for those who are in love with "pop"ular music. It is not a staus quo type of album. Hell, Kelis is not a standard pop artist. This album is witty, different, yet still has great beats that you can dance to. But also, has some interesting word play and choices that rival the somestimes standard trival lyrics of R&B and Pop. ***************************** Great choice if you want to step outside the box from traditional R&B and Pop. Yet, you still want to dance and have fun. 
 Finally a book that explains the mechanics of these games in a way that is entertaining and informative. I had never understood the fascination with boxing or Nascar before reading this book. Not that I'll ever be a fan but can now be a part of these conversations at work instead of on the sidelines. I'm already a reasonably knowledgeable basketball fan and still found new snippets in this book. The style is breezy and fun making the "facts" much more entertaining to learn. A great gift for anyone but especially your girlfriends who are sports-disabled 
 Ive had this album for a while now and with every listen to it I never get tired of listening to it. G-mone more than holds his own on the mic with his deep monster like flow that captivates u with every lyric that he  spits. Every song from start to finish was executed with precision. 88  key's production on this album is way above average az he compliments the  flow of g-mone and mac-fee. This is a definite must buy. Guaranteed  satisfaction 
 Horton Hatches the egg was one of my favourite books when I was a child and it is lovely to be able to read it to my children and it has become one of their favourite too. I certainly prefer this one to many of the Seuss books available (I have never been a huge fan of Cat in the hat or Green Eggs and Ham) This one has a hugely appealing story.  Mayzie is a lazy bird and doesn't enjoy just sitting on her egg, she needs a holiday from sitting around doing nothing on the egg (a lovely ironic touch for adults here, I think this is one of the reasons it is so appealing!) So she convinces Horton the Elephant who is passing by to sit on her egg for her. She doesn't really care that he is 'immense' she persuades him that he will be able to do it.  So Horton props up the nest and sits on it - all through the day and night, through storms, through winter ice, through teasing from his friends because "an elephants faithful, 100%"  Then one day some hunters come along, but instead of shooting hiim they capture him on the nest and drag him over the hills and onto a boat (where an elephant is seasick, 100%) and back to New York to sell him to the circus.  There he sits on the egg being dragged around the country until one day they go to florida where Mayzie the lazy bird has been lying around. She has been there a year and has decided never to go back to her nest. When she sees the circus in town she flies in and sees Horton on her egg, just as it hatches. Now Mayzie gets angry and claims that it is HER egg.  But the egg hatches with a new type of creature, an elephant bird. It is purely Horton's creation and the circus and the people send him back home where no doubt he will live a long and happy life with his little bird/baby  It is a nice book with a great message of working hard for reward despite the slings and arrows around you. It has a wonderful rhyme and good catch phrases which kids can learn easily to help with early readers  the illustrations are simply coloured in black green and red but enormously effective - Dr Seuss was an extraordinary illustrator!  Overall one of our favourite - and highly recommende 
 This book contains lots of ideas and from there you can get your own ideas.  It did help me in making my latest quilt.  I am a beginner quilter and have not made that many and this book was very helpful and easy to work with 
 I have tried to read other books about Elizabeth, but more often than not they were dry historical tomes.  They focused more on the role this woman played in the course of British history rather than the figure herself.  A powerful single female monarch in and of itself is intriguing.  One born into such a dramatic period of British history is truly fascinating---and obviously begs an inquiry as to what made her tick.   This book, while fiction, does just that.  It provides some guess as to what motivated a very intelligent, cunning woman who prevaricated with finesse during truly difficult times.  While bringing Elizabeth alive as a truly three dimensional person, this book also breathes life into the times in which she lived--a time wrought with treachery, greed and power plays by all so inclined.  The book is long and could be considered slow at times.  However, I believe this has more to do with the thoroughness of the book rather than the writing style.  Beyond this criticism I dont agree with the other negative reviews here.  Why some reviewers find it difficult to believe that Elizabeth may have been fixated on her love life seems strange---afterall, all of England and the continent was surely was fixated for some time on her love life.  (A fixation, btw, she used as one of her many political tools of leading England to its rise in power.)  
 An amazingly well documented accounting of the way famous liberals don't practice privately what they preach publicly.  Often times to the result of great profits and gains.  The book also points out that conservatives are hypocrites as well.  However, when conservatives abandon their beliefs it is quite often a damaging result personally instead of gain 
 The law scholar and US presidential campaigner, Susan Estrich,is trying her best for making the case for Hillary. I think it very unlikely that the current "Madam Secretary" is running for the next US president against Hillary. If she does, she would certainly be beaten by Hillary. So the Republicans would nominate somebody else such as Rudolph Giuliani and  John McCain. In either case, Hillary would not be easily beaten by either man. Then why not challenging? In my opinion, the time is ripe for Americans to elect the first "Madam President" for a change. Then the rest of world would be willing to listen seriously to what she would say, which is truly inspiring.  We have been fed up with what George Bush, Jr. kept saying... His talk is nothing intellligent, but simply bloody and boring. We are planning to translate this book into Japanese so that many other non-English speaking people can share this fascinating book during the 2008 US election.          
 This is the book I wish I'd been able to give to my family and friends several years ago when I began my own journey in the Independent Sacramental Movement. (I've made up for lost time and bought several copies for friends.)  Bishop Plummer has given us a generous and insightful glimpse into ways of doing and being Church that too often go unnoticed. There's an exuberant chaos in the Independent Churches today - at its best, filled with the joy of the Good News. I am, frankly, amazed at the sheer breadth of groups covered in this one volume, and at the level of access Bp. Plummer was able to gain across ideological lines to bring this information to the public. This book stands head and shoulders above previous efforts to give an actual flavor of who we are, and how we aspire to proclaim the Gospel.  Bp. Plummer has done a fine job of creating a family portrait - a snapshot in time - "warts and all", by a member of this extended family of faith. Thank you, John! 
 Very well done.  I was moved, cared about these characters and did not want the novel to end.  I'm looking forward to reading more from this author.  
 This collection has a variety of Scrooge comics that will entertain you al 
 Excellent Book!  Very entertaining.  Hard to put down.  A bunch of very talented women 
 This book is really interesting if you have taken a personality test, because it tells you more about your personality type (ENTJ, INSP, etc).  It speaks about the weaknesses and strengths of each personality type, as they relate to the workplace.  The examples that make up the bulk of the book were not very interesting.  And, there is some repetition of text and descriptions for the different types (extroverted thinkers share similar traits, so the text repeats).  Overall, a pretty good read, and fun to share with coworkers 
 I was very disappointed when I found out Kathy McCarty could not get a record deal after the release of this  album.  One beautiful D. Johnston song after another, and the production is perfect.  The mid-90's is when I really started searching for popular music from other countries.  (Two personal favorites -West African music and filmi or Bollywood & Kollywood (mostly Tamil) soundtracks).  If not for this CD recording and Bob Moses great jazz album TIME STOOD STILL I would have given up on the American pop music scene.  Not that either one of those records was ever very popular of course 
 very exciting and will keep you glued to your seat.  i have just watched (2006) for first time..... 
 This is a great book for little ones. It is my baby's favorite book at this time. He is almost 13 months old and I can sit and read him this book over and over again and he is interested each time. He tries to read it himself! It's a cute book with great pictures and not too many words so you can turn the pages quickly keeping your child's interest and still read the whole story. I haven't read the other little rabbit books yet, but intend to get them all 
 I'm a multi sport athlete who trains all year round regardless of what sport I play.   I bought a few of these Ultimate Guide to Weight Training books, and they definitely helped me train specifically for the different sports that I play.   Then about a year later I received an email from amazon that there was a new edition out.  These upgraded editions are even better than the originals, with more articles and a lot more sport-specific information.   I would definitely recommend this series to anyone who plays a lot of sports or wants to specifically focus on training for one sport in particular 
 In my opinion this is some of the best work that Glenn Hughes has ever produced. His vocals are strong, soulful and spot on. His bass playing is extraordinary. He works extremely well with Chad Smith. It's great to hear a drummer and bass player find that special "hard rock" groove and ride it for all it is worth.   Dave Navarro is an excellent player, but only appears on a couple of tracks. J.J. Marsh covers most of the guitar parts on this CD, rather brilliantly I might add. The CD just gets better everytime I listen to it.       I'm very impressed with this CD. I certainly hope Glenn decides to make a few appearances in the USA in support of this release. I'd really like to see the show.  
 In this book, Grenz recounts a revival in Trinitarian thinking that took place in the 20th century.  After briefly reviewing the history of Trinitaian theology prior to 1900, Grenz discusses how Barth and Rahner initiated this renewal of Trinitarian thinking.  Then he discusses theologians that associate the Trinity with history (Moltmann, Pannenberg, Jenson) before outlining the thoughts of those who focus on relationality (Boff, Zizioulas, LaCugna).  Finally, he turns to those who desire a return to the Immanent Trinity (Johnson, Balthasar, Torrance).  Connecting these thinkers together is a general acceptance of Rahner's Rule that the Immanent Trinity is the Economic Trinity and vice versa.  Most also value the concept of relationality to unity of divine substance.  Grenz's methodology is to outline a thinker's proposal and then briefly discuss some of the critics of that view.  Because of this, one never hears Grenz's opinions about the topic.  No doubt this is due to the fact that his opinions are the focus of "The Social God and the Relational Self."  While this work gives a good description of the evolution of Trinitarian thinking, it does little to sort out the various accounts.  The reason I gave it only 4 stars is that I felt I had to read "Social God" to get the rest of the story 
 As a silent film enthusiast I thoroughly enjoyed reading "The Transformation of Cinema" and got a lot out of it.  Although the author takes quite a scholarly approach (with extensive  notes and bibliography), I found the book to be fairly easy reading throughout, and each chapter, which deals with a separate theme and includes good photos, is just the right length.  This book is probably best for the more serious student or enthusiast of early film development, rather than for general reading or information on certain films or people.  The author's approach is an overall one, encompassing the mentality and social conditions of the time in the US which influenced the development of cinema, such as, for example, the attitude in the early years that moving pictures were only for the `great unwashed masses' and was looked down upon by middle and upper classes.   As a result, influential people concerned with `uplift' in society pushed to make films educational, intelligent and appealing to the more intellectual classes of society.   Then there was a backlash as the majority of people preferred to be entertained rather than lectured, and further chapters focus on the changes that took place in filmmaking: moving cameras, lighting, editing, fade-outs and so on.  Many films are mentioned as examples, but there is no section devoted to any person or film in particular.  Instead, the author takes an all-encompassing approach which shows how people responded to moving pictures in the first place, then how producers and filmmakers responded to the public's reactions, tried to influence the public in various ways, and how all these interactions led to the transformation of nickelodeons into cinemas as we know them today.   I found this to be a very good, informative and enlightening approach which was handled well, making this book an important foundation in the understanding and appreciation of moving pictures 
 I got this book for my mother, an 84-year-old avid gardener and she was delighted.  It's a small book from England and has lots of photos of garden projects to do with living willow. I think it was well worth the inexpensive price and we both look forward to trying some of the projects described 
 "When Potch was born, there was an angel with a clown's face hovering over the bed.  So Potch came into the world laughing..."  He was a happy kid, who turned into an even happier adult.  Then one night he met the not so lovely, Polly Pumpernickel, at a masquerade ball.  "He was so smitten, he did a double backflip.  A moment later the two were dancing...  What an evening!  The crowd stared as the pair continued to prance and pirouette, to weave and whirl.  Polly thought Potch might be the daffy darling of her daily dreams, the one missing piece of her pie.  Unfortunately, Potch's timing was off when he tossed the long and lanky Polly into the air, and she landed, with a huge splash, in the fountain.  Now, how was he going to win back his one and only, true love.....  William Steig's witty and engaging text is rich in tongue twisting alliteration, wordplay and wry humor.  But it's Jon Agee's bold, bright, and busy cartoon illustrations, filled with playful and hilarious slapstick scenes and marvelous sound effects, that really steal the show.  Kids will revel in all the outrageous dating catastrophes as they linger and explore each entertaining page.  With a happily-ever-after ending to set everything right, Potch & Polly is a captivating, fun-filled, manic romp that begs to be read aloud and shared, and is sure to become an instant favorite at your house 
 of punk rock cds. This is a very fast in your face album with sometimes funny lyrics: Shes got issues, walla walla. However the best offspring song is on this disc: The kids arent alright.  Without the last track this disc would be barely 20 minutes long! However even with the last song this album kicks so much @$$! If you dont have it what are you waiting for go and buy it NOW! This is the band that got me into punk rock in the first place and now im enjoying albums by the likes of pennywise,bad religion (best punk rock band ever!), millencolin and the bouncing souls, rancid NOFX etc.. 
 I often find "World Music" dreary when kept in its glass case.  It becomes a preservation activity: record X from Y before He/She dies and their Music Is Lost Forever.  Whilst this is worthy, it isn't necessarily worthwhile listening to something recorded only because it is going to rust away otherwise.   With "Passion" (the soundtrack to Scorcese's "The Last Temptation Of Christ"), Peter Gabriel succeeds brilliantly in creating a work indebted to World Musicians and yet stamped with his own mark: therefore the album lives and breathes as a work in its own right rather than a fossil of the past or a foreign country.  He achieves this by using a strongly north African rhythmical approach coupled with the work of musicians on traditional Middle Eastern string instruments, always focusing on structure to build elements of texture into (rather than onto) each track.  Exceptions to this are the stately choral version of "With This Love" and  the soaring Western/Middle Eastern hybrid "It Is Accomplished".  With "Passion", Gabriel achieved the difficult task of giving voice to ancient music rather than reverentially keeping it in a case, to be merely caged and catalogued. 
 Who hasn't felt the sting of pain when a favorite character dies?  What to do?  Do you make a new character or spend the agonizing hours trying to rebuild the character that just died after suffering the level loss?  No more, I say!  Just pick up your corpse and keep adventuring.  Ghostwalk allows characters to do just that, and in addition provides a well fleshed out setting and ethos for the adventure.  I heartily endorse it 
 Along with Adam Smith, the Englishman David Ricardo is one of the fathers of the so-called Classics school of economic thought, and the Principles is his major opus, one he was very much reluctant to write, but only did so at the urgings of James Mill and his son John. Written in the first half of the 19th victorian century, he was nonetheless, a very freed mind, who did not accept or indulge in the extravagancies of the beginning of the industrialization proccess in England. To David Ricardo, Karl Marx owes a good share of his theory of labour, something essential in the labour movements of then. The concepts adapted and created by David Ricardo is transported to the text in a dry and concise style, not too much worried in polemics, but only interested in address the topics he raises in a very precise way. IF you are a student of Social Sciences, this book is a must 
 the language of the stories is a little stilted, but it is tough to tell if that is gogol's fault or that of his translator (it is definitely time for a new translation). the stories range in all types and quality, though gogol is at his best when leaning towards the fantastique (kafkaesque comes mind). there are some good stories in the collection: diary of a madman (the only story that is genious), the portrait (gogol ruins what would have been his greatest story with a poorly written, unneccesary second half), the nose, the overcoat, and taras bulba (though a bit wordy and does carry on a little too long). vol 2 is by superior volume (if the editor's introduction and diary of a madman had been in it, there would be no point to volume one) 
 Other reviewers all seem to be Animal Rights advocates, interested in a sound justification for their preconceptions.  I read this work for a different reason -- because I was interested in a non-theistic AND non-utilitarian justification for ethics.  Tom Regan does an excellent job as a moral philosopher presenting an alternative way to look at ethics, and I stongly recommend this book for that reason.  As for justifying animal welfare, I found it less convincing.  Regan's reason for rejecting Singer's argument for utilitarianism is because utilitarianism could sometimes justify sacrificing an animal, and he wants a moral guideline that will not allow that.  Well, this is certainly assuming your conclusion, and made me wonder how much of the work was honest reasoning, and how much was a political spin document.  But the ultimate problem for me in accepting the arguments was in two areas.  First, the absolutist nature of rights (either you have them, or you don't and they are non-negotiable) flies in the face of what is reasonable in the world.  If a fish is not conscious, it has no rights, and if it is, its rights equal mine, even though its consiousness may be so marginal that we are extremely uncertain whether it even exists.  Instead, for any consciousness-based rights system to be funcitonal, it must be based on DEGREE of consciousness, so a fish has less rights than a mouse, who has less rights than a mature human.  (If mice have as many rights as humans, then almost all human activity is unacceptable -- plowing/tilling kills small rodents, as does driving, as does ANY construction work of any kind -- his mine rescue example neglects that all his options, including digging the mine in the first place, disturbs the soil fatally for some small rodents.)  But Regan will not accept this, partially because any such scheme would be extremely difficult to work out, but primarily because it would allow the use/abuse of animals in some cases -- a consequence he will not accept (per his rejection of Singer) even if the reasoning for it is valid.  The second objection is that this scheme takes no account of the welfare of future beings.  Extinction to him is a concern of corporatist ethics, when all that matters according to him are the individuals CURRENTLY involved.  But an ethics which cannot provide a rationale to prevent future ecosystem destruction, or to prevent mass extinctions say by a comet impact 100 years in the future of individuals who are not alive today and therefore do not compute for rights calculations is deeply flawed in providing moral guidance.  These weaknesses are correctable, and this work could be improved to become a fairly compelling and general moral guideline.  But to do so will result in drastically weakening the justification for animal welfare in his work, so I expect they will not be adressed, and this work will remain an interesting, but ulimately unconvincing excercise, serving solely to rally the faithful 
 MIXED MAGICS is a delightful new short story collection continuing the Chrestomanci saga that Dianna Wynne Jones had woven years ago. Now readers will see the return of the famed Chrestomanci and the magic that emanates from some old characters in CHARMED LIFE and THE MAGICIANS OF CAPRONA. These are four Chrestomanci tales, and though I did not like the first and last story, one story is an extremely suspenseful, magical story that I could not put down. This brand new collection, MIXED MAGICS, includes the stories WARLOCK AT THE WHEEL, STEALER OF THE SOULS, CAROL O'NEIR'S HUNDREDTH DREAM, and SAGE AT THEARE. I particulary enjoyed STEALER OF THE SOULS, for it featured the return of Cat Chant and Tonino from previous novels. Master Spiderman, a shroudy, dark man, wants to be the most powerful nine-lived enchanter in the world -- and that's because he's going to have ten lives. And he's going to kidnap Cat and Tonino to do so ! Can the two join forces to stop the Master? The magic of this story is wonderful, and the book is extremely well written. All Chrestomanci fans, or fans old and new of Dianna Wynne Jones's heartwarming magical books should read MIXED MAGICS, the brand new, magical, and spine tingling short story collection, which will delight many a reader, flashing with spells, laughs, and magic galore, though it has lost the spark of the original four Chrestomanci novels 
   A PURITAN MIND is not the normal kind of book one would read about Puritan life in the 1600s, Colonial America, as it pulls more on quotes from religious Puritan documents.  You have to already know the history of all the A, B and C-list people in Puritan history to appreciate this book.  I'm a playwright who is focused on a story that crosses into the Puritans in their utopian society in Massachusetts.  
 Having all of buckets albums from his work with praxis on, I think that this one might actually make him famous. His work with serj is phenomenal, good production, and vocals. Its an eclectic mix, sort of like monsters and robots only much much better. If you liked colma you should enjoy this one.  The middle three songs are really mellow culminating with waiting hare, the best song on the album. I dont know where serj found this chick, but she wails. Unlike monsters and robots this album actually flows and has a sense of cohesion that is somtimes lacking in bucketheads albums.Did i mention great vocals?  well i stand by that, this time around the lyrics dont sound as much like they were written by an acid casuality, they make sense, they arent quite as scary, in fact at times they are actually quite tender. All in all this is a great addition to my collection, if you are just learning about the man behind the bucket, or if you already love chicken, and want more meat and bones pick this one up.Bucket and serj, if youre out there, keep making these albums,please please please 
 David Carter never fails to awe those of us who love pop-ups.  This one is especially creative and innovative 
 Like all of the Jodi Picoult novels I've read to date, this one slides down as easily as ice cream. She is a masterful storyteller, with the ability to pull you into a time and place, and an extraordinary family situation. Plain Truth tells the story of an Amish girl by the name of Katie Fisher and the lawyer, Ellie Hathaway, who defends her in a murder trial. Katie is accused of neonaticide, killing a baby she refuses to admit she delivered even though it is a medically indisputable fact that she has just given birth.  The plot unfolds around the psychological treatment of Katie and Ellie's immersion into the Fisher family and the Amish (or Plain) way of life. It held my interest from the start, until what at first appears to be a tidy (and disappointing) ending. But to my delight, it offers an unexpected twist. I read the last page with complete satisfaction.  Certainly a must for Picoult fans, but for readers unfamiliar with her work, if you like well-written stories, with emphasis on both character AND plot, this one's for you. Additionally, if you have any interest in the Amish culture, this book is interesting and enlightening. Picoult has certainly done her research.

 This is a completely underrated work. I haven't ventured out and exposed myself to Osborne's subsequent releases, but if they're as good as this one, my laziness is surely getting the best of me.   Near the entirety of 'Relish' has a breezy tone that confidentally strays away from any sense of heavy-handedness, and surely this is one of the most attractive elements of the album, and possessing such a laid back disposition provides a solid re-playability factor.   Osborne's voice is, as most would agree, phenomenal. I haven't come across many female artists with such a refreshing degree of grace or class, and I deem that a huge compliment. And, yet, it's the 'music' here which carries the album with such a paramount force. The instrumentation and performances are able and unique, and quite varying really, and the production is crisp and clear. And despite its polish, the album still feels raw.. organic.. which, yet again, I find most contemporary artists have a difficult time claiming). Most of the album is drenched in a fine deal of pop sentiment, but it's engaging, adult pop, and the ornate instrumentation raise it to a plane above most pop, which would be potentially dismissed for its brimming simplicity.  Quite honestly -- and I do believe very few albums can claim such reverence in this regard -- most of the songs on 'Relish' are excellent, with little to no missteps throughout its entirety. And, sure, most good to great albums are formidably consistent, but 'Relish' has this sort of uncommon finace throughout each individual tune. It's just about as stable an album as they come.  I'd have to say that my personal favorites -- and again due its sustainable ability to near always impress, it's not the easiest task in choosing -- would be "St. Teresa", "Right Hand Man", "One of Us" (which I might add was a magnificent single, one that actually proved to transcend the mass market's severe overplay it received. Surely, if most ordinary folk were asked who Joan Osborne is, this song would be the triggered memory in their noggin's), "Ladder" and "Spider Web". For those of you who've heard the album, it's obvious the choices here revolve around a quicker tempo than much of the more reflective, resting bits, but the various moods displayed here are all affecting in at least some way.  Osborne is an intelligent, self-respecting musician, and seemingly Human being as well, and this fact is easily gathered when hearing 'Relish'. Maybe it's just my lack of exposure to music of this particular breed, but to me, it really stands out as a distinct musical personality. I'd recommend it to anyone I know with some sense of taste, without hesitation 
 a very rich collection of every Beatles story, hundreds of full color pictures, anecdotes, just everything that was "the Beatles". a brilliant result of the last time Paul, George and Ringo got to work together for telling us their compelte story as the band which shaked the world. hard cover, luxurious publish. Beatles excelence 100 
 As the title.  I relaly like it, but I can not won as many as I want because its price. I hope CK will have some online sale or lower its price someday 
 This low budget movie shines in all areas. Directed by Roger Michell (NOTTING HILL, PERSUASION, ENDURING LOVE) and written by Hanif Kureishi of MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE fame, THE MOTHER's plot may jolt even the most jaded viewer. May, played by Anne Reid, is a 60ish mother of two whose husband dies early in the film. Not wanting to return to the now lonely home where she prevously lived, she visits her son and daughter, who do not really want her. While visiting her single daughter, she has an affair with handyman Darren (Daniel Craig) who is half her age. While the age difference is enough to raise eyebrows in some circles, the real kicker is that Darren is her daughter's lover. (On the other hand, if Jack Nicholson can continue to star in movies where he sleeps with women 30 and 40 years younger than he, why not Anne Reid? Call it the "Cher Syndrome."  Not to worry. This film is done with sensivity and grace. May literally loses twenty years from her face when she meets the carpenter and, if only for a brief period, comes alive. At one point she tells him that we must live before we die. And live she does. Of course, along the way she hurts her daughter, who was already pretty much a mess before she had to deal with competition from her mum. The acting by everyone is first rate. Reid and Craig give very fine performances. The character May generates a lot of sympathy in spite of her transgressions. A victim of her times, she married when women were judged by how well they kept their houses. Now a recent widow, she is adrift, alone and isolated from her two children and ready for the coming maelstrom.  The film has much to say about the relationship between children and parents, generational dysfunctionality, the perils of old age, what it means to live or at least try to, the fragility of life.  THE MOTHER is beautifully shot with a lot of natural light. In many ways it is a very quiet movie. Many of the silent scenes illuminate so much what the director and writer are trying to say. Just one example: there is a terribly sad but moving scene when May returns to her empty house and sits looking at her husband's house slippers. For some reason, nothing is more heart-breaking than the empty shoes of a departed loved one, much more so than shirts or trousers or suits.  One final note-- and a very nice touch. Each time the letter "M" is in a word in the credits it is done in red while the other letters in the words are in white.  Don't let the subject of this movie keep you from seeing it. You will be richly rewarded 
 OK, so hope sounds too pollyanna for "serious medical students and stiff doctors". I'll tell you about hope. It's deeper and more complex than all the so called "only we know what is good for you, you peon." attitudes put together. All I could think about while reading this book was thank God a doctor with deep compassion had the courage to write it. Here we have a doctor who is not afraid to step outside the box to spend years thinking about the single most important part of any illness, in particluar cancer: hope. I've learned a lot about hope. Granted at 20 years old it was probably the last thing I was thinking and probably thought I had all the knowledge I needed. Now at age 62, I have lived longer than expected, and am a living example of hope. I've lived over three years with lung cancer (the last two as stage IV). I found a doctor with great skill whom I admire for his medical knowledge as a great doctor who does in fact treat people everyday with traditional medicine, but every time I am in his presence I feel an energy of profound hope. You can call it whatever "pop" name you want, it just shows you are not really in the trenches. I survived because of my good doctor and because of hope. Near the end of my life, I learned the greatest, most important and enduring things in life are the most simple, yet somehow complex, with hope being at the very top of the list. I can tell by reading Dr Groopman's book that he is a compassionate human being and knows the true meaning of life, and of hope, and was drawn to it by the title: The Anatomy Of Hope. I wish there were more doctors like my doctor, and like Dr Groopman. 
 Thou Shalt Not Be Aware is one of the finest theoretical books demonstrating how parents betray their children and how devastating this is for the child.  Yet Alice Miller, wonderful writer that she is, cannot fully absorb the significance of her own message.  This denial pervades her writing and weakens her book's impact.  She spends over three hundred pages of Thou Shalt Not Be Aware showing how parents damage their children, yet she refuses to hold parents accountable.  (Page 58:  "[People cannot] grasp that I blame neither children nor parents.")  In effect, she, one of the 20th century's greatest trumpeters for the child's rights, herself creates a theory which abandons the full truth of the child.  Shying away from the strength of her message, she compromises as best she can, turns vague, and blames society instead.  Thus, the subtitle of the book:  "Society's Betrayal Of The Child."  It is not society that primarily betrays children.  It really is parents.  Yet Alice Miller, a parent of two children herself and a woman who never came close to processing her own unresolved grief from her own childhood - stemming from maltreatment by her own parents, not society - cannot accept that.  It is too painful.  Thus it comes as no great surprise that years after writing this book, when she herself entered deep therapy to resolve her childhood traumas once and for all, her true past horrors surfaced and she suffered a near-psychotic breakdown.  A 1995 interview says it all:  "At the end of these three weeks my feelings were in a turmoil, so that I could not find sleep, that for the first time in my life I thought of suicide, and had anxiety verging on the psychotic.  I was already fearful of this therapy that robbed my organism of sleep, but I could nowhere escape it."  Yet between the time of undergoing this "therapy" and giving this interview, she touted her therapist, J. Konrad Stettbacher, as a brilliant theorist and discoverer of a "remarkably effective therapy method," thus providing him with thousands of referrals, until, that is, she realized correctly that he had been manipulative and destructive with her and she quickly removed all mention of him from later editions of her books...and publicly repudiated him on the internet.  Yet 95% of Thou Shalt Not Be Aware remains an accurate roadmap and fuel station on the path toward enlightenment.  So much of Alice Miller is fully enlightened.  However, if you aspire to become more enlightened than she is, this book will be partially toxic to you.  For instance, she masterfully exposes Freud's 1897 abandonment of the truth of his patients' sexual abuse histories, yet out of guilt for betraying him and loyalty to loving him (i.e. the omnipotent parent) anyway, she dedicates this book's first edition to...him.  And she spends countless pages beautifully - though not succinctly, as this book does ramble - deconstructing Freud's ludicrous drive theory to expose its basic flaws.  But then, on page 51, she writes this:  "When I wrote The Drama of the Gifted Child [her first and most famous book, which is anti-Freudian], I still believed my experiences as an analyst were compatible with Freud's drive theory..."  This is shocking, and shows how amazing insight and atrocious denial can co-exist in the same person's conscious mind.  This is Alice Miller in a nutshell.  And then there is her intense anti-religiosity, and refusal to believe in God or support any form of therapy that does.  Yet in June of 2001, nearly twenty years after writing Thou Shalt Not Be Aware, she wrote a letter to Pope John Paul II in which she took on the tone of an enraptured, star-struck young girl begging yet another omnipotent parent figure to hear her point of view.  Had I not known beforehand that it was written by the ferocious and insightful Alice Miller I might not have believed it.    I will quote a few lines of it here (and the full text is on her website):  "Open Letter to the Holy Father.  I take the liberty to write to You again...   ...I can't imagine that any other person in the world would have Your courage, Your credibility, as well as Your personal talent and God's grace to be able to speak up against an old tradition [of child abuse]...  If the Church continues to ignore the new scientific information and to stay silent about this issue in spite of the lessons of Jesus, who else can be asked to open the parents' eyes in order to prevent the blind escalation of violence.  I am sure that if my letters succeed to reach You personally You will not stay indifferent to the knowledge they are trying to pass on to you.  With my most profound respect, Alice Miller."  Yet she even predicts her own future capitulation in Thou Shalt Not Be Aware.  On page 209, she notes how often "individual analysts shrink in later life from their own findings and return to earlier ways of thinking they had already left behind."  As she herself points out consistently, traumas that are not fully exhumed and resolved always find a way to manifest pathologically.  Although part of Alice Miller speaks from her healed side, she continues to behave like the traumatized child some part of her remains.  On one hand she speaks the truth more forcefully and honestly than almost anyone else - and as such has legitimately inspired millions through her written word.  Yet at the same time she defends parts of her parents' pathologies at all costs.  This is her unconscious psychic defense against having another breakdown.  Thus, when reading her, we must be aware of her limits.  If you are not, then...thou too shalt also not be aware

 Many of the recipes in this book are phenomenal.  I would particularly recommend "On Golden Pond Mushroom Soup," which instantly became my husband's (and my)absolute favorite soup, though he is not even a vegetarian. I often get asked for the recipe by other non-vegetarians when I make something from this book.  Some of the recipes are less inspiring.  The stir-fry and pasta dishes I have tried so far have been somewhat bland. Still, it is the first book I open when I am looking for something new to make for dinner.  Though this is irrelevant to the quality of the recipes, I find the pictures of Ms. Kramer plastered all over the book to be rather off-putting.  Although I have no problem with the fact that the majority of the recipes come from outside contributors, Ms. Kramer's diminished creative role in preparing the text only serves to give the continual self-reference the unfortunate appearance of an ego run wild.  Nonetheless, I am grateful to her for putting this book together.  I would just like to see a little less of her face in the next one. 
 Timon of Athens has often been thought the work of a madman. Disjointed, polemical, irrational, and downright inelegant, many have thought that Shakespeare (or whosoever it may be) suffered a mental breakdown. These and other factors culimate in what I believe to be a tragic under-appreciation of this play.  This play is NOT the story of a naively generous soul who eventually  "faces reality". This is instead the story of a glorious  Dionysian self-expender, who, upon realizing the cowardly conservatism of  his so-called "peers", runs off to the wilds, to lavishly waste himself in body and soul. He dies on a curse, the climax of all the "evil wind" he has been sending out, the ultimate dissipation, his ultimate glory. The "tragedy" of the play is the cold stone tablet that lies atop his corpse at the end, and the message of  frugality it seems to espouse 
 This is a great series. This year the selection seemed to have more of an anti-religious and political tone, but most of the selections are still well-written, educational and thoughtful 
 Great transaction - Bought this and had it shipped to my sister's house on the other side of the country and she received it in only a few days! I was shocked. THANKS so much 
 This book captures all of the magic of Walt Disney's Snow White and transfers it to the pop-ups and pull tabs that children as young as two can joyfully discover for themselves.  As a mother of a two year old who loves nothing more than parking himself in front of Walt Disney's treasury of videos, this book provides a welcome change from the glassy eyed gaze of a video transfixed toddler, to an eager, hands-on explorer of one of Disney's best loved films.  Kids will love how the images come alive as they work their  way through the book.  It is very interactive and it provides hours of entertainment.  This is a must buy for any young fan of Disney and any parent who would like to vary their children's intake of pop culture.  A great stocking stuffer or Hanukkah gift for a young person.  If you are looking for something different, give this book a try and prepare to be very pleased with your purchas 
 This book gives a broad overview of the American Revolution.  It gives a very detailed account of the events that lead up to the Revolutionary War.  The book uses personal jorunals of the common man and those from the actual decision makers.  Book does pass over some events like Valley Forge, the War in the southern colonies without complete explanation.  Very well written with a wide overview of the war.  Also talks about life at home during the war and life in the camps of the soliders.  One thing I did not enjoy about this book is that it inculded several chapters on the development of the constitution and government after the War.  In my mind these are events are seperate.    I would recommend this book 
 If you find yourself in a position where the individuals in authority over you are, in the actual state of affairs, your moral inferiors, then on this level alone you will be able to appreciate this book 
 With the events of September 11th still so vivid in my mind, I didn't think about reading the synopsis on the back book cover of Loyalty in Death by J.D. Robb. To be honest, if I had read the back, I probably would not have read this book right now and waited a few weeks to continue my journey through the In Death series. It was tough to read this one when the wounds from September 11th were still so raw but I did enjoy the story even if some of the similarities were a bit creepy!   The In Death futuristic series continues with several excellent subplots surrounding and interweaving into a suspenseful main plot. A terrorist group, Cassandra, an offshoot of a former previously disbanded anti-government group, has targeted New York historical landmarks to bomb unless their demands are met. Cassandra tips off homicide detective, Eve Dallas, and makes a sick game out of these acts of terrorism - who will win and at what cost?   The first building blown up just happens to be one owned by Eve's multi-billionaire husband, Roarke, and so the game becomes personal. It's a race against the clock to find the planted bombs, stop death and destruction, while trying to figure out the identities of the villains.   Now if the main plot wasn't enough to keep the reader amused and entertained, Robb (AKA Nora Roberts) has given us a couple of subplots that are fantastic. In the last two books in the In Death series, two of Eve's assistants have been flirting and skirting a romantic liaison. I've read each one wondering just when the flamboyant Ian McNabb, EDD detective (Electronic Device Division), and the "everything by the book" Officer Delia Peabody (Eve's right hand woman) would get together. Well this is the book that begins the relationship - and hot doesn't even begin to describe it. Who doesn't smile when they go at each other in an elevator that just happens to be stopped between floors (hey, McNabb can program anything!). But it's not enough to get each other out of their systems, so they then continue the interlude in his apartment. Ah yes, the anticipated fireworks will not leave the reader disappointed, and J.D. Robb hints that it's only a taste of what the future holds. And I absolutely love it when McNabb calls her "She-body" and she jumps down his throat - ah yes, it's true love!   We are also introduced to one of Peabody's Free-age family members when her brother Zeke comes to New York City on a working vacation from Arizona. Zeke is the baby brother and Peabody is the protective big sister, but she can't keep him from being drawn into a murder investigation as the prime suspect. Given the fact that when the murder occurred, she was a little busy with McNabb, she feels plenty of guilt about the entire situation. Yes, this is a very interesting side journey.   Overall the book is very good, even if the villain behind Cassandra is predictable. It once again showcases J.D. Robb/Nora Roberts' ability to weave a tale of mystery, develop characters that audiences love, and even throw in a bit of humor. Her all around talent is remarkable and this series proves it! 
 As one reviewer summed it up, this is Dashiel Hammett meets Guy Debord, and it's true; flat, spare prose with a sense of existential nihilism from which there is no escape. Fast, rough, violent reading, told in a matter-of-fact procedural manner. The ending is telegraphed rather obviously, but this is first rate work, and if you're into violent noirs, you should read it. What a film it would make, in the right hands 
 'On Yoolis Night' is a collection of motets, carols, hymns, antiphons  and a few other pieces in honour of the nativity - this is a medieval Christmas album.  During the Middle Ages, when Europe was swept with adoration of the Blessed Virgin Mary, many of the songs around Christmas would be as much around her character as with Jesus.  These works deal with the various legends, biblical and extra-canonical, as well as the traditional stories of Christmastide, primarily taken from the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries.  However, the earliest piece dates from the fifth century (A solis ortus cardine) to the polyphony of the fifteenth century, which means that this disc in fact contains a thousand years of history.  Also included are a few anticipatory pieces from Advent, such as the Vox clara chant (the voice of him crying in the wilderness...).    These are beautiful pieces, stunning in performance and quite remarkable - compared to modern Christmas carols, these are pieces with depth and richness, certainly devoid of much of the mercantile and later accretions that have overlaid holiday seasons in the Western world.    This is definitely a holiday album with a difference.  -- Liner Notes --  This text accompaniment to this disc is very full, so much so that the booklet is not contained within the jewel case, but rather within a slipcover in which both the CD/jewel case and the booklet reside. The liner notes include a description of the work, a brief piece about the quartet, and the lyrics of the songs both in original language and in translation - all repeated in English, German, and French sections.   -- Anonymous 4 --  Contrary to the implication of their name, the Anonymous 4 are not anonymous. This is a vocal quartet made up of Ruth Cunningham, Marsha Genensky, Susan Hellauer, and Johanna Rose at the time of this recording (Ruth Cunningham will later go on to a solo career early, and another member will join - Jacqueline Horner). They came together as a formal group in 1986, and have been ensemble-in-residence at St. Michael's Church in New York City, giving concert series in New York as well as throughout North America. They have been featured a number of times on national media in North America as well as Germany. They then went on to yet more success, eventually performing more that 1000 concerts worldwide.   Their specialty is working with chant, monophonic and polyphonic music, and working with medieval texts. According to one source, 'The group takes its name from an anonymous music theorist of the late 13th century, Anonymous IV, who is the principal source on the two famous composers of the Notre Dame school, Léonin and Pérotin.'   The group ended a touring career of nearly two decades in 2004.  
 Going to keep it short and simple: Get this CD  The songs are unique, get your pulse going, and are generally great for driving.  Case in point: Another Planet.  This song has incredible speed and amazing bass - if you have a good sub and system in your car you need to get this song it is so good for racing and pumping you up.  Get it 
 My son who is almost 7 has always wet the bed. It was a non-issue in our house as we knew he couldn't help it. He wore Pull-ups nightly. But about a month ago, he came to me expressing his desire to stop. I researched the various methods which can help children become dry. I was intriqued by the reviews for this book that I read on here, so we decided to buy it. We also bought a Wet-Stop bedwetting alarm. My son loves this book and we happily reviewed it every day. Within days of using the alarm and this book, he started having a few dry nights. This is a child that had only one or two dry nights a YEAR before we started this. It is now almost a month since we started this program and he has had 14 totally dry nights in a row!! We are ready to stop the use of the alarm tonight and he is so, so excited and proud! We will look at his book together until he decides to stop (he likes it so much, I'm not sure when that will be!)  Of course, since we used the two methods, it's not totally possible to say how this book would have worked for us by itself, but I have an inkling that the book helped the most. It is also very good for a child's self-esteem. We are so very happy with this wonderful book and want to thank the author, too! Because of a family history of bedwetting, we assumed that my son would probably go on bedwetting for years. What a wonderful surprise for us and especially for him. This book has helped turn this whole thing into a positive experience for my little boy. He feels confident and now feels that he has control over this part of his life.   
 I loved this story. Henderson has a soft touch. She is able to transform the main character, Lucy, in a short space, from innocent to experienced, without turning her into a victim. I could almost feel the first kiss! 
 This is my favorite book! It's fantastic! You can't put it down and the stories stay with you for years. You can pick it up in any chapter and it's quite funny as well. Beautifully written 
 I beat the hell out of everything I own. My PDA which this has partially replaced has an aluminum hardshell case and a metal body. I have broken just every watch I have ever owned (and I have/had a few excellent watches). I am naturally hard on things due to my focus on life not on my gear. This little notebook has kept itself together so far, while looking very hip.   I am a software engineer/project manager and am cognisant of my technological options, this is just faster, lighter and thinner than my PDA for scribbling notes. I am never without it in the office.   The back folio pocket and the elastic strap looked dumb when I first bought it. However, I use the folio pocket for receipts to be reimmbursed (better than leaving them in a pocket to be washed or thrown out)and the elastic strap serves double duty as a second bookmark and to keep the notebook together (keeping it closed helps it survive).  I like the construction and archival quality of the book. My notes look more like those of a disorganized madman than a manager (I am starting to wonder if they are synonomous) but if I ever have to refer back to them I can be assured that they will be there for a long time.   It only received 4 stars because they are [...] a piece and at my current scrawling rate, I will probably need about 4 or 5 a year. Just get your company to pay for it if you can, because they are notebooks that you can rely on to be there for a long while.  Lastly: For the person who likes their Montblanc notebook with tear out pages, they are partially missing the point. These books are for archiving and keeping records (of questionable usefulness in my case) not for making quick throw away notes. I also highly doubt that their notebook is as thin as one of these is either. Each have their own place 
 maps are a bit confusing. Picture illistration are small and not very clear. the control pictures in the illistations are also hard to see 
 The mechanics of Sun Tzu's art can be applied to many subjects other than war.The book is not very long or expensive, so the hour or so spent reading is well worth it.This particular version is pretty nice. It includes a little history lesson in the beginning 
 I first saw the cover of the DVD in my local video rental store, and the title made me pick it up and read the back cover. It didn't look like the sort of film I would usually want to watch, but my gut feeling said go for it.  Wow, I'm glad I did. Not only was the film excellent, but I was hooked on the soundtrack after just one viewing!! Next day I ordered the DVD of the film, and also a copy of this audio CD soundtrack (Can't understand why here in the U.K we don't have the CD released?) Well, a week later with Airmail shipping this CD arrived, and I have been playing it every day in the car on my way to and from work.  My fave tracks are "Black Roses Red", "Be Be Your Love", "I Want You To Know" "If God Made You", and "These Days".  If you enjoyed the film, It's worth buying this CD. It sounds awesum played on a decent HI-FI turned up loud!   
 This is an epic novel about the horrors of slavery as an institution and as a destructive element to the body, soul, family and faith of the individual being held bound.    It has been said that Abraham Lincoln once met Harriet Beecher Stowe and said:  "So you're the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war."   After reading this book, I believe "Uncle Tom's Cabin" did more than nudge this great nation into taking action against such an inhumane institution.  This book should be mandatory reading for all children in our great public schools.  But, alas, we no longer have the guts to teach our children the truths and the horrors so well described in this book.      
 If you have never done any kind of gardening before, buy this book before you ever touch your ground.  Not only is it helpful as a reference book, but the information is presented in a way that makes it a good read and fun to learn.  If you have a garden, this is a must have.  There might be better books on specific plants or topics, but there is no better all around gardening book 
 If you can only have one Internal Medicine book in your library this is it.  Very little not found in this book...Authors have made a great effort to be complete and it is well edited.  All other Internal Medicine books are superficial, but if you want to know the theory, current treatment/diagnosis, and current research possibilities buy this...it is great 
  I met Judy Jance in a bookstore in Palm Desert, California back in the mid 1980's. It was right before Christmas, and my husband had just told me that he didn't have time to go buy a few small stocking stuffer type gifts for me and asked if I'd buy them myself. Needless to say, I was a little ticked by this situation and since he complained about my reading habit, I decided that I'd fix him and buy a few paperback books. I went to Walden Books in the Palm Desert Town Center Mall and was looking in the mystery section for something new that would hold my interest. Up came a lady who asked me if I had ever read any of J.A. Jance's books. I replied that I hadn't and she said that she had been compared to Mary Higgins Clark and I may want to try one of her books. I was amazed, I mean didn't authors have publicists and marketing agents to promote their books - this one was actually promoting her own work (and not even at a book signing event). She signed my books for me (part of the deal I made in exchange for purchasing them!) and I was on my way. My grumbling had ceased to exist and I was a very happy person and glad my husband didn't have time to do his own Christmas shopping. After reading the two books I had purchased, I couldn't wait for the new series she had told me she was writing. Desert Heat was the beginning of that new series and I had to wait almost a year before I could get a copy.   This is the story of a woman placed in a very difficult situation and how she is determined to do the right thing, not only for herself but also for her young daughter. The story (and series for that matter) revolves around Joanna Brady who is married and living in a small town in Arizona. Her husband is the county sheriff and killed in the beginning of the book (no I'm not giving anything away, the cover up is the basis of the story, not the murder itself!). Joanna is bound and determined to clear Andy's name and find his killer or killers.  J.A. Jance takes the reader on a ride through police crime and corruption and has us realize that no one is safe from abhorrent behavior, even good people. Joanna Brady is a character that most of us can relate to - she deals with everyday situations like her daughter growing up and going through the normal trials and tribulations of childhood or the adjustment from marriage to being a widow. The scenery is very well described and has made me want to visit the little town of Bisbee, Arizona where this series takes place. The supporting characters are interesting and vivid - they will make you laugh, make you cry and make you wonder what in the world makes them tick.  This book is a great beginning to a fantastic series. If you haven't been introduced to the Joanna Brady sequence of books, grab this introduction and start on a journey that you won't forget! 
 I ordered this for my 23 year old grandson who suffers from high blood pressure and has diabetis on both sides of his family. He and his wife are trying the recipes, say they are tasty and easy to prepare, and I feel better knowing he is taking better care of his health 
 This was a fantastic book. Richard Preston did an even better jobe than in the Hot Zone, and wrote a wonderful suspense novel. The graphic scenes that he adds in the book make it very intesting and easy, though not always pleasant, to imagine. The book starts out so well, and doesn't let down, staying interesting and exciting the whole book, as you don't ever know what is going on or who will die next. By using a lot of facts, and doing lots of research on biological weapons, and the such, he was successful in creating a very real life fiction story of some unsuspecting, seemingly unrelated vicims of a horrific crime. It was so real, it makes you really think that it is possible, and could really happen, and with biological warfare on the rise in today's world, seems like a very relevent topic. He even adds a little humor, and emotion to the drama and suspense that makes for an overall good book 
 The author Jane Nelsen as educated as she is does not write down to her readers. She writes in a way that is easy to understand.  This book helped me to understand people, and gives guidance how to understand my child as well why and how to parent and the effects of my decisions.  This Book, Positive Discipline has been the most helpful book that I have read in the first three years of my child's life 
 Since I missed reading this in my "younger days"  it is a complete pleasure to read a wonderfully written fantasy!  In today's world we can all use a Narnia to aid in our escape from reality!   Treat yourself - - - Go ahead, You Deserve it! 
 I was really happy to see that this book has received such nice praise from readers from so many walks of life.  Not many books here on Amazon have over a hundred positive reviews, with only a sprinkling of really wacky ones, which I suppose when a Kennedy is involved one should expect that.    I'll keep my review brief.    I enjoyed reading Symptoms of Withdrawal very much finding it was an honest assessment of the trials and tribulations Christopher endured growing up in what must have been some very difficult times which were complicated by his family of origin.    Being born into a legacy like his is an incredible gift, but this gift also carries with it great responsibility, burdens and the enormous pressure of constantly being observed by the public spotlight, which is no treat needless to say.    Not many will ever experience that or even be able to comprehend just how difficult it can be.  The spotlight is relentless illuminating all and exposing everything which is then open for public comment and debate.  I think the term is living under a magnifying glass.  Christopher has been able to successfully translate his experience for his readers, successfully shining his own spotlight inwardly, showing us just where this journey has taken him.  Some of those places were not what one would expect but he fearlessly exposes both the good and the bad of his youth and growing up in his family surrounded by the historical figures many will never have the opportunity to encounter.   The soul searching he does throughout is straightforward and honest taking full responsibility for his actions in the past, unlike others who write these faux memoirs blaming everyone except themselves for  how their life turned out.    Readers clearly see the many transitions Chris went through, and most importantly the recovery he managed to obtain.  This part of the book is written clearly and concisely perhaps so others still struggling with the same problems can see that while addiction can infiltrate any family at anytime, recovery from addiction, is always available to anyone who seeks it, anytime their ready. 
 I wish I had had this book when I owned my own newspaper.  There are uncountable leadership tips and lots of wisdom between these pages.  And now I'm using this new knowledge in promoting the books I started writing after retiring from the journalism field.    I recommend it highly to anyone who wants to achieve their goals!! 
 I love this book to death!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i've NEVER read a book beter than The Witch of Blackbird Pond! I discovered it in my school library & i used it for my book report!  -Haile 
 There are no reviews submitted by others , so how can there be any voting buttons  
 It is really a pleasure to come across this book online. I bought it maybe thirty years ago, when I was a preteen, and was developing a serious interest in design. Without a doubt, much of it is dated; particularly since so much of what the book describes can be done on a computer, and quickly. However, in doing graphic design work/illustration, I have often fallen back on the basic principles communicated in the book-e.g. its cues on how to render the human body. Subsequently, I think that it's an excellent primer, and will provide you with a great foundation on how to illustrate. 
   This is a wonderfully written biography of Peter the Great.  It goes deeply into the many challenges that Peter faced in his rise to power.  It then looks at Peter's lifelong efforts to drag Russia from its political/economic/cultural slumber into the 18th century.  No easy feat -not even for an autocrat who was never hesitant to break skulls to achieve what he wanted (as illustrated by the building of Peter's beloved "Window on the West").  Neverthless, Peter did transform Russia into a major European (and Central Asian) player and I think that Massie covers this nicely.  Massie takes care to balance out Peter's ruthlessness with his devotion to modernize Russia. At the same time, he takes care not to judge Peter's brand of goverance with 21st century notions of human rights. 
 I paid more for my 4th ed. new, and find it to be worth even more. It is not a cookbook per se, but it is a very comprehensive textbook that details general reactions by functional group. It outlines every way known to remove, add to, or otherwise modify every functional group. There is as much commentary as is needed, if not more, and every pathway is mentioned regardless of how exotic or primitive and low-yielding. The corresponding OS synth refs for specific cpds. are given for each type of reaction, along with a total of 15,000 other refs in footnotes. This was cutting-edge in 92, with much updating of the 3rd ed. The index will take you to the section that shows how to make the manipulations you want - if it doesn't, it probably can't be done 
 If you love football strategy, good passing game then watching any highlights of the 80's and early 90's San Francisco 49ers is great.  I wish some one would make Steve Sabol of NFL Films to knock it off with the close up shots. That's all his highlights ever are. I would like to be able to see the formations and the whole play. Especially from a historical offense the 49ers had with Joe Montana and Steve Young.  
 My daughter loves this tub. She moves a lot and it is nice to know she won't hurt herslef on a hard plastic tub. She loves to bite the duck and play with the rings. I have not had any problems with this tub at all. Blowing it up is the hardest part. Takes a lot of breath. I recommend it to anyone. It is worth the money. I plan to use it with all future kids as well 
 This book is chock full of amazing things. Reads easily. Many applicable exercises for the every day person 
 In this novel, David Wilcove discusss the relationship of the development of america and wildlife.  Each chapter is broken down into sections chronicaling each section of america.  From the great plains of the midwest to the hawaiian islands, overdevelopment, overhunting and neglagence all have contributed to the loss of wildlife in  america.  The fauna of america were so mal protected for so long, ecologists of the last century have pushed for legisation to protect or furry friends.  This book is a great read of any aspiring ecologist, The only issue i had with the book is that it put no importance on the value of Technological advances, such as roads, buildings, and pesticides.  Overall this is a book that i would recomend to anyone who wanted to know more about the ecological movement in America- GHHS APE 
 Like the first in the trilogy, this was excellent writing, alternating between telling and describing, but with the most vivid description, and somehow the telling is the most desirous writing as well.  Yes, Kamal's long-winded poetic idealistic love gets...long-winded at times.  But it builds to the a very appropriate conclusion in his life.  It is amazing to watch a family crumble- but not at all unexpected.  You see the seeds of destruction from the first pages of Palace Walk.  Al-Sayyhid Ahmad Abd Al-Jawad desires to have such strong control over his family, he ends up building it's destruction.  He wants to live a double life- and those live half as long.  He sees no hypocrisy in his actions, for he lives the unexamined life.  And he reaps his harvest.  This is the message interwoven throughout both the first two books.  I keep on feeling that Naguib Mahfouz is the Dickens of his culture.  Characters are consistent with themselves, yet constantly changing, evolving, to become something greater, or worse, and unexpected, yet somehow we always knew it had to be that way.  He writes with such realism of the lives of people, and the changing lives over generations of the people of the large city.  It is dirty, intimate, and full of pathos.  It is life.  
 "No-Fuss" is truly the best title for this cookbook.  My 21 year  old daughter, a college student, was diagnosed with Type I Diabetes  recently.  The dietician has her "counting carbs" and learning to  identify slower-absorbing sources of carbohydrates.  She is "new"  to cooking, and these delicious recipes fit the trends of today's taste,  ease of preparation, and are colorful and satisfying.  We are hoping for  "Book Two" to be out in a few years.  Bravo to the writers 
 Muy buen 
 this book stands on its own. however, reviewing it is done most quickly by comparing it to two similar books (by time of publishing and topic), 'naked economics' and 'freakonomics'. this book is better than the former and far better than the latter. it lacks much of the arrogance of 'freakonomics', and provides far more insight than either.  an easy read, an interesting read, and a book very much worth reading 
 This is just great for a single VPU video card, the cooling system works great, moving all the hot air outside the CPU. The software overclock is good too, u can change values any time u want and u can select if u want those applied for 3D games only. It works with any game, I've tested it with Oblivion at 1280x1024, HDR enabled and every option at maximum. It works great with F.E.A.R at 1280x1024 with AAx8 and FFA x 4 the price is good for a very high end video cards 
 This carafe is inexpensive and keeps the liquid hot for at least 12 hours. The only problem was that it had scratches and little stains on the lid and the surrounding area, even though it was delivered perfectly packaged.  I am guessing Amazon sent me a returned item, not properly check.  Two out of three items in that order came with scratches!  I am a new customer and this is very disappointing, since up to now I did not have any problems with other sellers.  I am not returning it because my previous carafe (Guzzini) after six months began to leak, so I need the carafe now.    
 Specials, the third book in the Uglies trilogy by Scott Westerfeld, offers just as much intrigue and action as the previous two installments.  What if everyone in the world was pretty? What if things were more peaceful because of it? Would you conform to the norm or fight to be unique?  When Tally was almost sixteen, she was ready to get her obligatory operation, just as everyone else gets at that age. She thought the world was a pretty okay place and took her surroundings and standing in stride.   Then she learned that not everyone gets the surgery, some escaping to a safe haven known as the Smoke, where people look and live as naturally as possible.  Forced by the authorities to visit the Smoke, Tally found herself siding with the dissenters - a decision that risked her life and the lives of those she loved.  After the smoke cleared - no pun intended - Tally found herself one of the Pretties, having undergone the surgery anyway, again under the thumb of those in power. At first, she did not know any better, but once she learned of their mind-altering surgeries, she fought back, this time stronger and smarter than before.  Now she is one of the Specials - stronger than she ever could have imagined, with special privileges and high-powered contacts. But at what price? Sure, she enjoys the power, the strength, the immunity - but she has been given all of these gifts from people who may not have her best intentions at heart.  One thing is for sure: Tally is no longer the blissfully ignorant girl she was a few years ago. She cannot be. She can, however, attempt to right some of the wrongs she has been a part of, and, in the process, change her life and her society.  Readers of Uglies and Pretties will not be disappointed. Specials delivers all that it should and more. The action sequences are packed with octane, an the writing is imaginative and descriptive. The ending of Specials will challenge readers to think, really think, about what they take for granted and what they should truly value 
 The book was very useful for sharing with the hurricane refugees staying in my home 
 I absolutely thought this was a great movie. It was scary yet it had a real feel to it. I think Timothy Dalton is a great actor and he did a fantastic job with the role of the tormented Priest. His remembrances of his World War II experiences were particularly moving.  I liked this movie alot...was surprised at how moving I found it.  Worth a watch 
 I purchased a copy for my sister who recently gave birth to premie twin boys.  She has her hands full, but Lisa's fun book is helping her cope 
 I saw the movie and loved the soundtrack.  I really think that it helped intensify the drama involved in the story.  I like the soundtrack, but am a little disappointed with it.  A few of the tracks sound like they were taken off of old records - they have that crackly sound to them.  This is how they were in the movie too, so I guess it is to be expected.  I'm not usually an opera person, but I enjoyed the selections on this CD 
 Mr. Rosenkranz is somebody that was in love with his job and not war. this book takes a look at his experiences of the gulf war. one of the things i really liked about his book was his openess about his moral concerns of his job. he was the guy next door who was called upon to defend his country. a true hero. the thing that bumps this up to a five star book is the interactive website. i really suggest looking this site up when you start the book 
 My son was 20 months old when we started working on potty training (wanted to accomplish it before baby brother was born a month later).  I had blocked out a whole week to focus on it, because I thought "less than a day" was a bit too ambitious.  We started at 8:30, and by 10am I wished I'd never started.  He ran away screaming from the training doll!  But I had reserved the whole week for potty training and didn't have anything else to do, so we persevered.  Things went much better the second day, and by the end of the week my son was potty trained, at least while we were at home.  He wasn't as independent as the book said he would be, but I think he doesn't have the motor skills for that yet.    I think many people would have gotten frustrated and quit, but I am glad I persevered.  I was consistent and positive, and did not become frustrated (or let it show anyway), and it really paid off.  I definitely recommend this book, but allow more time than just a day if your child is very young 
 "We live in the flicker."  Need I say any more?  As much meaning as can be packed into just over 100 pages.  Best read in a quiet place with a good bottle of red wine at your side.  Not for the weak of mind or heart. Be prepared to discover.  
 Good reference book, but somewhat technical and not the most organized 
 Vanessa Carlton, to me, is amazing.  She is full of talent, with a voice that is powerful, and driven by feeling. All of her lyrics and songs on this c.d. were written by her with the exception of "Paint it Black", and I have not heard anything like her before. Many of the beats are catchy, the music flows and cascades, and the words are definitely from her heart. That is why you could never compare her to anyone else. I have tried and failed to find anyone that comes near her, and she is my favorite artist. She is herself, and doesn't try to be anyone else. Rinse is my favorite song on the track because it has a nice beat, beautiful melody, and just is a wonderful song. I love the lyrics because they are not your average  break-up or I'm-in-love songs. They're way deeper, and you will not be dissapointed if you buy this c.d. There's nothing like it! 
 This was, in my opinion, one of the best Marcus Didius adventures.  Marcus's relationship with his father adds great humor to an already wonderful story 
 I thought that this book was a substantial advance on the understanding of the ideas of Gurdjieff. Yet it goes beyond this by introducing new ideas that I believe would have been very acceptable to the original fourth way schools of thought 
 I recently read Charles Murray's "In Our Hands." A reviewer of it suggested "The Stakeholder Society" as an alternative drastic change.  I recommend both books to anyone that considers reading either.    At the risk of oversimplifying, here are the proposals. "The Stakeholder Society" recommends a one time cash payment of $80,000 as citizens turn 21, financed by a wealth tax. "In Our Hands" recommends an annual cash payment to all adult citizens financed by the elimination of all other transfer payments.  Both books have lots of detail to explain how and why to implement their proposal.  Both admit that some details will have to be worked out based on experience, and both identify some potential weaknesses of their proposal.  The biggest problem with "The Stakeholder Society" is the observation that leads to the proposal.  Since there is an unequal distribution of wealth, there must be an unequal opportunity to accumulate wealth. If the stake increases the disparity in wealth, the same arguments can be used to increase the stake and the corresponding wealth tax. If the stake decreases the disparity, but does not eliminate it, the same arguments can be used to increase the stake and the corresponding wealth tax.  Those that favor equal outcomes will favor "The Stakeholder  Society."  Those that think there is a large degree of  opportunity for most will favor "In Our Hands."  Both books are worth considering carefully, but not worth worrying about. The authors of both admit there is no chance of either scheme being implemented any time soon.  Most ratings of books with political implications are based on agreement or disagreement with the conclusion. This one is based on the presentation of the arguments 
 This is the 6th coffee maker I've owned in three years, falling in the middle of the purchase price range. It has finally brought peace to my household, since I no longer spend the first five minutes of the morning wiping coffee puddles off the counter. I also appreciate the fact that Cuisinart included a gold filter with the unit. Furthermore, unlike my previous two coffee makers, this one's 3-beep completion alarm is not overly loud or obnoxious. This model's biggest drawbacks, for me, are the difficulty reading the internal water level gauge, and the fact that the lid can be tricky to reattach. I can live with those inconveniences, though, if the coffee maker continues to function properly and doesn't start leaking 
 Most serious directors and actors aspire to a level of professionalism that seems effortless to the point of casual.  Like the best baseball outfielders catching swirling flyballs with a nonchalant jog and a flick of the wrist.  On the other hand, Kinski and Herzog want you to feel every moment of effort, every muscle twitch, the oppresive heat, the mind-numbing glassy eyed exhaution,  the dangerous waters, & the sleepless nights. Watching this movie, I can easily imagine the furious arguments and sullen bitterness of men pushed to their creative and physical limits. They suffered to make this movie and they want you to know it.  Herzog's actors tolerate conditions and exertions far beyond the call of duty and for what?  To make a flick.  Aguirre's men tolerated far more for gold most didn't live to see.  At the heart is the titular character, played by Kinski as a wild eyed wraith more dead than alive as he descends into an utter madness as a refuge against the ordeal and death he presides over.  To know anything about Kinski is to know that Aguirre is not a terrible stretch for him.  If anything, his performance is more brave in its selfexamination than creative in its acting chops. Herzog, for his part, seems to be a good old-fashioned meglomaniac as he appears to derive great satisfaction from pushing his cast and crew far beyond normal limits and treating them like little toy people so he can be a rich famous director. He has a singular vision and is determined to see it on the screen, no matter what.  He is a throwback to the American studio director/petty tyrants like John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock (a gentleman tyrant who referred to actors as cattle), Michael Curtiz and many others.  Herzog is determined to control and Kinski resists control and their collaborations are the output of a kind of two brained insane but brilliant filmmaker. Aguirre is almost two movies.  One is a brillant study of madness and ordeal and the other is an equally fascinating, if unintentional, documentary of two difficult half mad professional collaborators making a great movie often in spite of themselves 
 When I first dove into cultural music, I began with Varttina, a Finnish group. Then I found Altan, and they're absolutely wonderful. The fiddles,  the pipes, the mellow voice of the female, I love it all. Celtic music is  truly great 
 This book is all about girl power!  Way to keep it real, Mary Anne!  From an existentialist point of view, I feel Mary Anne is finally taking control of her destiny by going for her man.  From here on, it's a whole new Mary  Anne.  Oh, baby!   She inspires me to write this haiku: Mary Anne snags her  babe, Logan is whipped by his gal, And they are all good 
 Randomly bought this cd because I thought the cover was cool.  Now I can't take the darn thing out of my car.    WARNING- This cd is addictive, but in a GOOD way.   
  	Having listened to the majority of albums by THE ALAN PARSON'S PROJECT its impossible to not be aware of the sentimentality and melodrama at the heart of the music. Considering Parson's emerged from engineering duties for amongst others PINK FLOYD one may have expected a little edge to the compositions. But even on potentially atmospheric and dark concept pieces like TALES OF MYSTERY AND IMAGINATION the overall impression is just to bright.  I think TURN OF A FRIENDLY CARD is just about the best synthesis of Parson's production excesses and ERIC WOOLFSON'S syrupy lyrical style. Where things fall down is when the bombast and drama of the music make way for such lyrical ideas. Fortunately on the superb track NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE, Parson's wisely accompanies the wonderful lyrics with a simple acoustic guitar. This track remains for me the finest accomplishment of the Project. Also excellent are the title track (itself a big hit single in the USA) and yet another Edgar Allan Poe effort THE GOLD BUG, which has an atmospheric spaghetti western quality to it. The first four tracks are as one would expect, relatively dull and over-produced, even the epic TIME just doesn't quite satisfy. The Project are on firmer and safer ground with hypnotic instrumentals and minimalist production values. Unfortunately this combination is rare. As for concept, the album is interesting, with outstanding cover artwork. And also listen out for the intro to SNAKE EYES, which is surely a tongue in cheek reference to MONEY. 
 This book supplements the first volume on Eckhart from the Classics of Western Spirituality series with great reading.  The sermons alone are worth the expense as they are chalk full of Eckhartian charm and challenge.  In this work, you'll find solid translations of important medieval  literature 
 There are way too many books about The Beatles, and this one is by far THE one to have. Culled from interviews exclusively for the book (and in Lennon's case, the lengthy interviews he gave over the years), it builds a story about 4 guys who came from nothing, worked hard, and changed music.   Like most authorized bios, its weakness is in glossing over the less savory moments in the band's history, but the rare photos and amount of material and stories told by the four that is included more than makes up for it.   This is something that will take time to read, but don't let the size and amount of pages fool you, either.   Because it is part of a bigger package that was put out at the same time the video documentary and 6 CD set, combined together, they are as definitive as you can get about The Beatles.  I'd recommend the hardcover over the paperback version only because it will last longer, but the price of the paperback version is great for what you get.   I had recently seen Bob Dylan's "Scrapbook" in the store, and hope that The Beatles will put something similar out.   Pete Best and Cynthia Lennon have written books that offer their insights to the early years that I think are worth checking out. "All You Need Is Ears" offers George Martin's insight to the Fabs. Mark Lewisohn and Bruce Spizer have also written books that are the "go to" reference books if you are into collecting or want to know when a particular session happened. John Lennon's "A Spaniard in the Works" and "In His Own Write", Ringo's "Postcards From The Boys" and Harrison's "I Me Mine" are also worth checking out. Ray Coleman and Barry Miles have also written comprehensive bios on John and Paul.   
 Sonata Arctica is one of the best things that ever happened in the musical world, and this album took them a step further, showing they can bring more sofisticated pieces then their previous material.  Highly recommended, although previous albums might be a better start for those who are not (yet) fans. I'd only recommend this as a first album to those who can appreciate the relative complexity, such as progressive metal fans 
 I read this book in twenty sittings Alone but for my Bovril tea And after twenty eyebrow knittings I pulled the covers over me High as the pale marijuana smoke That covers my bed when I try to toke. "Now don't be greedy," my cat said, "As someone to whom you have read, I pray thee, Kevin, read some more of That book The Golden Gate by Seth!" "My fault, cat."  "It's not life or death, But that is one of the books I love." And grinning like the famous Cheshire We settled in; my nap grew meshire 
 Enrique is the king of writing highly emotional songs and this cd proves it.  almost all of the songs are very romantic like 'sirena', and 'contigo' and 'nunca te olvidare' although some are of heartbreak, they are so well written and sung.  'ruleta rusa' has a cool beat to it, different, spices up the cd a bit.  and 'dicen por ahi' makes you feel soo bad for talking bad about someone.  imagine if you talked bad about an ex beau and he found out...how would you feel??  this is his best cd by far, there are soo many great songs and lyrics.  It's what Enrique's music is all about...emociones puras y profundas 
 This is a must for anyone who is interested in the writings of Plato and what little we know about Socrates.  The footnotes provide excellent refrences to phrases, gods and place names that the average reader may not be familiar with. 
 The world of totoro is such a magical place. Totoro will lead you on the adventure of a life-time. Just hop on the cat-bus, and we're off!  I would gladly rate it a hundred stars instead of 5, for it is infact my most favorite movie in the whole entire world. It's just sop magical..in the beautiful world of totoro...you'll always be safe.....sorry! Got sorta lost in my own world there! Well, anyway, please buy this movie! It's the best in the whole entire world! Please! 
 It is amazing how much can change in a decade. By 1992, communism had fizzled; an obscure Democrat named Bill Clinton was President. And Michael Crichton was writing a novel about the threat posed by the Japanese. In the Rising Sun, John Connor and Lt. Peter Smith are called to assist in a homicide at Nakamato Towers, a sprawling conglomerate. What starts out as a trivial murder, soon explodes and becomes a tale of Japanese industrial subterfuge reaching the corridors of power. Crichton does an admirable effort of explaining the cultural differences between the West and East. In the 80's Lee Iacocca, former CEO of Chrysler and Ford, in his autobiography, had warned of the insidious business practices of the Japanese, but it took the talent of Crichton to bring it to a mass audience. The plot is decent, with Connor in the perfect role as teacher. However when one reads the Rising Sun in the present, one is struck with the realization that though the charges remain, the bugbear has changed. It is no longer Japan; it is now China. (Especially after Lenovo bought the PC division of IBM.)  Going beyond the tense murder investigation, the duplicity of foreign corporations, and the hypocrisy of our elected officials, this novel might just teach us that the American economy is more resilient than we think 
 This encyclopedia is a good introduction into the animal kingdom.  It does read well and the illustrations and imagery are well done.  The categories make looking up animal groups a breeze.  There is enough detail and close ups on the smaller animals, which really helps with understanding the animals. Even the rediculous representation of the T-Rex found in the Big Dinosaur Book by DK makes a cameo, which we found amusing.  Overall a worthy purchase, promising long use 
 As Peter Jackson points out in the introduction to this hefty tome, it's so important not to grow up. Even in his 80s, sci-fi master Harryhausen continues to conjure the entrancing magic he first created with 1949's Mighty Joe Young. The wondrous worlds and mythical monsters made by this master of cinematic magic, in the days of stop-action animation before computer-generated images became the norm, are showcased in this lush coffee table book. This treasure, with 211 color plates and 74 black-and-white illustrations, contains not a single scene from any of his motion pictures, but rather storyboards, pencil sketches and oil paintings, models, masks, puppets, rubber dinosaurs and bronze Cyclops, sundry ideas for movies bearing the HH stamp. Even more fascinating are images from movies that Harryhausen wanted to make but for which he never got financing. Many of the drawings are so detailed and ornate that the viewer is at once pulled in; we experience them with the fear and wonder of a child's limitless imagination. Looking at these detailed sketches, it's easy to believe we are in some pre-Christian religious temple, some deserted island populated by monstrous things or Anytown, USA, totally destroyed by evil ugly aliens. Like a child, we simply wonder at it all 
 I bought a pack of 3 for my purifier. This filter does a good job and keeps the watrer tasting good 
 Anyone who calls himself/herself an environmentalist should read this book.  It should be considered one of the great environmentalist books of our time, even though Jared Diamond does not intend for it to be so; he approaches the subject as a scientist, and his conclusions illuminate arguments for responsible stewardship of the environment, from the front yard to the whole planet.  I liked it better than Guns, Germs, and Steel 
 The best set ever! quality is great! extras are great! no complaints! awaiting the release of the 13 comedy hours 
 The life of Jesus Christ has ispired filmmakers for decades, giving audiences everything from animation (The Mircale Worker), to big-budget extravaganzas (The Passion of the Christ). But one epic, made for TV mini-series from 1977 stands out among all other Jesus films as the greatest, most timeless portrayal of the life of Christ ever made. Of course I'm talking about Franco Zeffirelli's "Jesus of Nazareth."  This film excels in so many areas it is difficult to decide where to begin. In my opinion, what made this film for me was Robert Powell. He is just absolutely amazing. Also, the film does a fantastic job of portaying both the divine and human sides of Jesus, and unlike other films (like the ridiculous "Last Temptation of Christ") Jesus clearly understands who He is and what He came to do. The rest of the cast also excels and delivers superb performances. Along with superb acting, the film also showcases superb locations. Most of the scenes were actually shot in the land of Judea, which gives it a very realistic quality that no other movie can match. And speaking of realistic qualities, the script is mostly taken directly from the four Gospels. It is so refreshing to be able to watch this film knowing that what you're hearing and seeing accurately stands up to Scripture. The soundtrack is also wonderfully composed. Probably my favorite part of this film would have to be seeing the crowd's reactions (both positive and negative ones) to Jesus' words and miracles. For me, this really brings the Gospels stories to life and makes me think about my own personal reactions to Christ's love and compassion. I also love that the Jesus in this film is not weak or unconfident. This film most accurately portrays the Biblical and historical Jesus because Robert Powell speaks with power and authority. He displays holy anger in the temple, Spirit-filled rage towards the hypocritical Jewish leaders, and loving compassion towards the repentant victim hanging next to Him on a cross. As I said earlier, Powell's portayal of Jesus is very realistic, believable, and accurate.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this film covers all the events in the Gospels, from the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary to the appearances of the Risen Christ to the Apostles. You get it all here. These are just a few reasons why "Jesus of Nazareth" is such an amazing film. I would encourage anybody who has not yet seen this movie to do so as soon as possible. I have seen almost all the films concerning the life of Christ, but this one is by far the best. I can honestly say that after watching it, your life will not be the same. 
 Like many other readers I expected something different from this work, and was to a degree disappointed by it. I expected to get a real feel of the thousands of great characters, the people who have made London one of the great centers of human civilization and culture. I especially expected this as Ackroyd is a biographer. But there is not even a considerble section on Shakespeare's London, and no real creation of Johnson's or Dickens' worlds. Instead the work consists in essays on seventy or odd different topics, on prehistory , on the medieval city, on the theatre, music, food, crime and punishment, the crowd, the weather, radicals, London's rivers, on sewage removal, on the Empire, on the Great War, on the redesigning of the City after the war etc etc. One learns in reading the book a tremendous amount about the City. I found all of this fine, as like so many of us in this day and age, I too am a devourer of 'information' any kind of information.  But the book says it is a Biography and does not really tell a story. It begins at prehistory but loses its way in chronological terms, and does a lot of jumping back and forth. Often a chapter may be a kind of mini- history in which for instance the history of pubs or of nightlife is given . The work as a whole is dryly informative and intelligent but not as one would have expected truly humorous.  There are outstanding chapters. The chapter on the Blitz the story of how Londoners dealt with the burning of one - third of the City and sixty- thousand deaths is an especially gripping one. The concluding chapters of the book are odd and anti- climactic, and do not really give a sense of the tremendously thriving and vibrant city London is today.  I don't think there is a great city in the world which can compare to London in its solid efficiency, in its sheer well- organized and deep sense of tradition. London is impressive, powerful, commercial , and if not wildly beautiful as Paris can be nonetheless clearly overall , a great ongoing achievement.  
 Has some great advice about parenting in general but was a little disappointed in her advice about getting your child to sleep through the night.  It is a great resource if your infant/toddler isn't falling to sleep on their own and requires a bottle to soothe them to sleep.  My 4 month old is a self soother so this book really couldn't help me out.   I still enjoyed reading it and it reassured me that I was doing everything possible to get him to sleep through the night 
 I thought this book was highly entertaining and apparently I was too stupid to figure out the twist, so that made it all the better.  This is the only Lehan book I have read but I would recommmend this easy read to anyone.  I did notice some anachronisms but they did not detract greatly from the book.  The characters make you care and this read is excellent 
 I cannot recommend this book enough!! A truly remarkable story and an absolute amazing life. An addictive page turner from start to end! A must read!!! 
 Newman's account of the rise of nationalism in eighteenth-century England fills a much-needed void in the otherwise teeming body of work about nationhood and national identity. Although Newman's book appeared several years ago, it remains one of the few works to really address English nationalism in the century and to take into account its many manifestations in literature, politics, and culture. Newman writes with a clarity and liveliness that will appeal to the interested lay reader as well as the seasoned professional scholar, a talent often sadly lacking from modern critical and theoretical works. Amateur and professional students of English history and culture will all find something to appreciate in this study, but those interested in literature and culture will be especially pleased, since most scholarly work about English nationalism and literature has to date chosen to focus on poetry rather than the novel (Howard Weinbrot's Britannia's Issue is a good example). I have found Newman's book not only enlightening, but entertaining to read, and I encourage others to add this valuable study to their personal scholarly libraries 
 From the first page to the last, John Brewer's recent study of the eighteenth century English culture is itself a "pleasure of the imagination". Offering a synoptic interpretation of the lettered -- and unlettered -- culture of Enlightenment England, Brewer invites his readers to the Turk's Head Inn, where the Great Cham of literature, Samuel Johnson, presided over his philosophic family, including such luminaries as Edmund Burke, James Boswell and Oliver Goldsmith. In addition, Brewer exposes us to the shrewd politics and repartee behind the scenes of the Drury Lane playhouse -- where the renowned actor and theater manger, David Garrick, modified the plays of Shakesphere in order to popularize "the Bard" for the average Londoner, hoping to maintain the interest of a crude, but critical, audience. Brewer ranges freely between contemporary memoirs and philosophical tracts -- describing not only the pomp and pretence of the intellectual elite, such as the epicurean dilitantes (who praised the phallus and spurned the Christian sacraments), but also the painters, musicians, and rustic "sages" (both male and female), whose studied affectations combined with their genuine sentiments make their biographical accounts so enjoyable. Brewer's format is redolent of Simon Schama, and is as witty and entertaining to read. The illustrations are admirably selected, and help to make the narrative even more dynamic. Considering the excessive drivle that passes for social history nowadays, it's so refreshinig to read a scholar who is not only intimately familiar with the literature of the era, but himself a gifted prose stylist 
 You have had it up to here with newspapers and news broadcasts that are partisan and shrill.  You are sick of the media focusing on scandal or even making up scandals.  You can't stand the prospect of hearing from another pundit who calls for the death of her political opponents.  You wish that newspapers would go back to the good old days of objectivity and impartial promotion of the public interest, perhaps when Freedom of the Press was a new concept and was being flaunted with energy and joy.  Don't be too sure.  In _Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and the Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism_ (PublicAffairs), Eric Burns (who works for Fox News!) has given a funny and thoughtful look at our nation's initial press.  The title of the book comes from a phrase George Washington, who had more than his share of problems with the papers, used to describe his newsprint detractors.  We may have come a long way in the technologies we use for our media, but the problems here of lies, leaks, and libel will sound familiar to modern readers.  One excuse the newspapers had then that they do not have now is that they were new.  Neither Europe nor the colonies had a tradition of an impartial press, so the press had to invent itself.  The first newspaper was closed because the publisher was obnoxious and refused to get a license.  The second was a toadying journal that printed what the authorities wanted.  Ben Franklin's elder brother was the first crusading journalist, but took up a malicious crusade against smallpox inoculations.  Founding father Sam Adams edited the _Boston Gazette_ and had no interest in printing the truth, unless the truth happened to promote American liberty.  If a false story about British troops raping helpless American women incited violent protests against the redcoats, Sam Adams didn't mind.  As Burns writes, "History has vindicated Adams's political ends; it cannot justify his journalistic means."  The exaggeration and outright lying was continued by others during the time of the writing of the Constitution and during the initial decades of the new nation.  The Federalists (in favor of strong central government) and the opposing Republicans had their pet journals, and even arranged for the editors to be on the federal payroll when they could.    Burns's lively history is a reminder of how venerable is the tradition of parties loving a press that agrees with them and excoriating the press that disagrees.  It also goes a long way to making the gigantic marble statues that we think of as our Founding Fathers into human figures motivated at least in part by lust, vanity, and eagerness for power.  The vehemence and outright deceitfulness that they could use when deploying the press is remarkable.  It is also worth being reminded that for all the good that came from our founding, those involved in it were often unsure about what they were doing, and if sure, were often sure of what proved to be error or misjudgment.  Burns commends the nation for coming to admire the strengths of the founders, but not emulating their style of journalism.  Perhaps the papers of two hundred years ago were more extreme in their bluster, malevolence, and inattention to fact, but those who look at current cable news, blogging, or even supermarket tabloids will find that the reformation has not been total 
 My daughter tells me that her daughter plays with this item regularly and thoroughly enjoys it, Thank You 
 _Schotts Original Miscellany_ IS miscellaneous - a collection of facts and triviata assembled in no particular order.  This, of course, is part of the charm of the book.  The information ranges from "Lines of the London Underground" to "Ivy League Fight Songs" to "Coffee Shop Slang."  (My personal favorite was "Quantity of Beauty to Launch a single ship:  1 millihelen.")    Its a lot of information to digest in a single sitting, but it is sure to bring a smile to your face how ever you read it 
 In 1995 I was in college and playing football in the state of Oregon.  I bumped this CD in my walkman on every road trip.  This has to be one of the most underated West Coast CD's off all time.  CJ Mac represents throughout the whole joint.  There's not one song on the CD that I skip.  I bump the whole thing straight thru.  Don't sleep on this West Coast classic.  It's a must have for your CD collection.  I spent many nights drinking a cold 40 and slappin bones with the homies while bumpin this CD 
 A no non-sense book on stocks, investing, trading.  While it seems that nowadays selling books on stocks is more profitable for these authors than actually trading stocks, this book is well worth the money.  Seems like every two bit trader from new york has written a trading book, has a trading website, and seminars and classes probably not worth half what people are paying for them.  Buy this book 
 Most people will not have the discipline and patience to work through this workbook on qigong, but for those who do, this is absolutely the finest presentation around.  Even more advanced practioners will want to refer to this fundamental book again and again.  This book works through the physical alignments and beginning standing-dissolving practice as foundation for all advanced work in healing, martial, and meditative qigong/neigong.  The old edition was excellent, but the new revised edition is even better, adding a step-by-step chapter on Taoist breathing which is a very welcome addition, and one which is a stand-alone practice in its own right 
 After 5 miscarriages and trying practically everything including lots of "normal" blood tests, we finally saw Dr. Beer. We followed his plan, and the next try resulted in our now 17 month old little girl. We have a little boy on the way in one more month, again thanks to Dr. Beer. A friend of mine had a little boy without issue. Then, when trying to get pregnant again, she had 5 IVF failures before going to see Dr. Beer. She did his tests, followed his plan, and the next try was pregnant with her little girl. If you, your friends, or your loved ones are fighting infertility and/or miscarriages, do yourself (or them) a huge favor and start with this book unless you want to go straight to his practice (now taken over by Dr. Stricker but still great). It doesn't have to be so hard! We are forever indebted to Dr. Beer!! 
 This is one of Allen's darker films and immediately any Allen fan can tell because of how raw it is... Allen's films are usually devoid of foul language but this one seems to be cowritten by Quentin Tarantino. Needless to say, this may be the perfect movie for any person who has enjoyed a Woody Allen film but who has said that all of his movies are the same. The plot is clever, a writer makes enemies with everyone he knows because his books are a little too close to fact. As dark as this film is, I must say that it still is hilarious. Another brilliant Woody Allen flick.. 
  Solidly entertaining, whimsical biography of the hangin' judge west of the Pecos.  THE LIFE AND TIMES OF JUDGE ROY BEAN stars a growly and bearded Paul Newman in the title role, guide to the life of a legend of the Old West and host to a revolving series of guest stars.     `Whimsical' seems kind of an odd word now that I think about it.  After all, it connotes a lightness of spirit, and that's a hard choice of words to use for a movie that features an on-screen hanging or five.  `Whimsy' is defined as `an odd or fanciful or capricious idea,' and `whimsy' begets `whimsical', which is made of sturdier stuff that its pappy - `Whimsical: adj. Erratic in behavior or degree of unpredictability.'   I'll let the word stand. John Huston's JUDGE ROY BEAN is erratic and unpredictable enough.  John Milius wrote the original screenplay.  With movies like `Jeremiah Johnson' and `Geronimo: An American Legend' among his credits, Milius has given ample evidence that he's a `print-the-legend' type of writer.  And he takes his heroes seriously.  Underneath everything - and everything piles high in this movie - there's a script that wants to make a legendary hero out of its title character.     That serious intent is subverted by Newman, whose charm is unsuccessfully buried beneath a beard and gruff exterior, and Huston, who peppers the whole thing with darkly humorous vignettes.  In fact, JUDGE ROY BEAN is more or less a series of disconnected incidents, from Bean's massacre of a bar full of desperados who rolled him for his (stolen) cash and left him for dead to his circa 1920 explosive showdown with an unscrupulous eastern lawyer played by Roddy McDowell.  In the interim he appoints himself judge, the law west of the Pecos, peppers the bar with posters of the beloved Lily Langtry (Ava Gardner,) adopts a black b'ar dropped off by Grizzly Adams (John Huston,) takes up with pretty young Marie Elena (Victoria Principal,) and witnesses an assortment of quirky cutthroats pass under the shadow of his well-worn noose.    If Milius wanted to plant Bean next to Geronimo and Jeremiah Johnson in the pantheon of American legends he must have cringed when Stacy Keach appeared for his twenty-minute segment.  Gigged out in white pancake make-up and an Edgar Winters' fright wig, Keach plays the albino outlaw Bad Bob, who's so tough he drinks boiling coffee directly out of the pot.  Bad Bob has come to call Judge Bean out, and hurls a series of insults about Lily Langtry in the attempt.  I liked the darkly, surreally, humorous Bad Bob character, but he doesn't belong in a movie that's trying to keep things real.  Worse, much, much worse, is the `Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' like musical interlude, also known as `Picnic with the B'ar.'  Newman, Principal, and their 300-pound black bear co-star cavort along the Pecos River, accompanied by Andy Williams singing the saccharine "Marmalade, Molasses and Honey."  I don't know for a fact, but I believe "Marmalade, etc." effectively killed the use of cheesy musical interludes in the middle of westerns.  If it didn't, it should have.      
 For anyone who has dreamed of doing a Thru hike of the PCT or even the CDT or AT, this book gives good insight into the life of a thruhiker. George Spearing, a New Zealander, takes the reader with him as he hikes through the desserts of California across the snow covered peaks of the Sierras through the Cascades of Oregon and Washington. He gives humerous as well as practical accounts of his adventures along the way. He introduces us to some of his fellow adventurers, including a 75 year old thru hiker. He includes little glimpses of history along the way which made for an interesting read. I picked this book up on Friday and couldn't put it down!!      
     If you thought the anime was great, then check out this soundtrack. The second volume has been released and it is sure hard to find so what are you waiting for!!!!? Hey, I didn't find this at Planet Anime and I know I'm not getting ready to pay 30 dollars+ tax at Robert's Corner Store. I have the third and first volume and they are AMAZING!!! I love Crazy Sunshine and Lsdt Dinosaur. So to all my Aanime fans out there , check out this CD!! 
 This is a nice collection of mind-stretching essays covering math, the future of happiness, swappable minds etc. The next 50 years are certainly going to be a lot fun! What a great, captivating read this book is!  -Simo 
 I have little problem with the main outlines of Koestler's thesis--however much I might quibble with some of the details.  I am comfortable with the idea that the gene pool of modern Ashkenazy Jewry results largely from a melding of Jews from Western Europe (refugees from the Middle East) and Khazars who converted to Judaism, of whatever variety.  Modern DNA studies propose that the Ashkenazy genetic material is about 40% of Middle East origin.  To the extent that such genetic research is accurate, that leaves about 60% to be filled by Khazar, Germanic and Slavic inheritance.  People do intermarry.  The Jewish people have always absorbed from the neighboring population.  Even Moses had a non-Jewish wife.   My purpose in this review is to point out the absurdity of the review posted last September by [Space Intelligences "Space Intelligences"].  Not enough that he apparently beliees in space aliens, but he writes that Iranians are Semites.  Any high school student who ever looked into a decent encyclopedia should know better.  The Persians, and many of their neighbors, are NOT Semites.  They are Indo-Europeans.    Such glaring violation of established fact should indicate the value of the whole.  As always, the discriminating reader must beware 
 I liked this book because all the different characters had their own voices.  I liked Charlotte best because she was smart. And I also liked when Lucy was the princess in Dr. Cadaverezzi's show. It was funny when Max's girlfriend Eliza kept calling his coach horn a trombone. And then he made his coach horn shoot a pea and he shot it through the mayor's hat by accident. There were a lot of silly parts in the book because some of the grownups weren't so smart. Charlotte, Lucy and Hildi, who were the kids, were the smartest people in the book I think.  I would recommend this book to other kids. It was funny and a little scary but everyone is OK at the end except for the bad guy 
 This was Mick Foley's first book and it is great!  At times he goes into a lot of detail, perhaps too much.  It was interesting to learn about his childhood, early career, marriage and family.  Also, very interesting what he has to say about other wrestlers.  A must read for a wrestling fan 
 While I will never get to the proficiency of White, Teter and the rest, this was an enormous inspiration. Non-snowboarders and non-skiers will never understand the thrill of going out on the slopes doing things that none have never done before, but the rest of us is confirmed in the belief that we have chosen the right pat 
 I bought this book for my wife, who is a real WWII buff, but turns out I read it first. I had previously read Gordon Prange's "Miracle at Midway", so "Shattered Sword" offered another, quite different perspective. Anytime someone interested in history discovers new facts and information it is rewarding. That was the case with "Shattered Sword", not only about the Battle of Midway but about the Japanese war machine and the war in the Pacific.  This is a worthy addition to anyone's library who is at all interested in WWII.  Dave Twig 
 The explaination of each individual element of the scientific paper  is very well presented. I would give 5 starts if it include some examples 
 I don't really know what I can say about this book, but I'm sure I'll find the words... Nevermind, I have them. If you pick it up and expect the Disney movie, you're in for one of the biggest surprises of your life. At the beginning it seems to start out slowly because some of the characters introduced weren't in the Disney movie at all, so you're like... "oookay, who are these people?" However, this book was so great. It was very sad and depressing, but it had it's happy moments, which is always nice.   It was amazing, and one of the best books I have ever read. Disney is a butcher of good stories!!! Arg! (This, however, is just my opinion. If you're a fan of Disney and I have offended you, I do apologize.)  I loved his writing style, with how descriptive he is with the setting and the characters. Victor Hugo does it so well that you feel like you are actually in Paris in the 15th century, and that you actually know the characters. They were portrayed so much differently in the book. My favorite character was Dom Claude Frollo, and I thought that I would have hated him, especially since he causes virtually all of the horrible suffering in the story. Weird, huh? I also liked Quasimodo for his kindness despite how unfortunate he is. He's constantly ill-treated, but he still keeps his good-natured soul.  I'm sure I'll be picking up copies of some of Victor Hugo's other books soon as well. The ending of this book brought me to tears, but I don't know about anybody else, since nobody I've talked to has read it.   I'm the sort of person who cries easily, and I became very attached to the characters. This book is filled with death, but some of it made me smile. I loved the ending even though it was tragic, but I won't spoil it. Go read it yourself. Not all stories can end happily 
 I and my son loved this book. It helped us to get a hold on anger and stress. While some reviewers did not like the emotions being referred to as my autism, I found the book,an excellent tool to use and inserted other descriptive words like anger into the text. This is a springboard for making sense of feelings that are so hard to put words to. The scale is easy and my son likes it.Most importantly this child friendly book empowers my son and encourages conversation about a difficult subject. I also strongly believe in empowering our children with self-calming techniques to manage stress and anger.   We have also had tremendous success with the Indigo Dreams Series of stress management CDs for children. Kari Buron actually mentions a breathing relaxation book by the Indigo Dreams author in her introduction. Learning ways to manage stress and anger is helping my child. Thank you for this helpful book.   
 Easily one of the best CDs I own. A great live CD with versions of his best songs that will inspire. Includes enteraining comments and stories between songs. Just waiting for Vol. 2. 
         I sort of had low expectations for this dvd. But it delivered what I wanted. It could have packed a mightier punch tough. More footage from that era would have been nice. They go into a pretty good depth of explaning the tracks. Listening to the backing tracks were cool. Freddie Mercury has the best voice in rock n roll history!        ANATO is truly a classic album. It's about time they had released the making of this album. I've waited for about a good 4 years for something like this. So this dvd is pretty good. So if you buy it, you should enjoy it 
 This is an amazingly good book.  Buy it, read it.  You'll be glad you did 
 An absolutely spellbinding story!  Hard to believe the hardship faced by the crew of the Commerce.  This book made me become quite interested in the Sahara, on which I've read considerably since.  
 A good example of how the Creation of Official History, plus a witty, popular play by Shakespeare can heavily influence public opinion and obscure truth. Or more simply put: History is written by the winners. A little comparison. One monarch created the right to post bail & protection against jury intimidation and tampering. The other is known for the Star Chamber & Morton's Fork(a clever ploy to increase taxation.) Henry was also the first English king to have a personal bodyguard.         
 If you're looking for a scary love story, then this is the book for you! Eric has the voice of an angel but the face of a monster. When he takes his ask off people scream and run away. So, he hides himself away in the bottom of the opera house. 	Eric falls in love with a beautiful singer named Christine. Christine is forced to love him but she loves another man named Raul. Raul knows about the phantom and wants to hurt him. 	The phantom scares everybody by turning the lights off and tacks Christine to his dungeon there she sees Raul in the dungeon...but you will have to read the book to hear the ending.    
 Dispossessed and alienated by the death of his grandfather, the divorce of his parents, and the imminent sale of the ranch where he grew up, 16-year-old John Grady Cole heads for Mexico with his friend Lacey Rawlins to pursue the lives of traveling horsemen.  They find a hard, Darwinian world where the weak and foolish suffer.  Cole is scrupulously ethical and strong-willed, and he needs to be.  Every time he shows love or compassion for another, he is made to suffer for it, and only his own strength of character allows him to persevere.  Cormac Mccarthy's prose style is challenging at first, but I soon grew accustomed to it.  His long galloping sentences effectively emulate the rhythm of travel, and his simple yet often startling turns of phrase bring the landscape of the Texas/Mexico border region to vivid life.  
 This book is excellent and forms a very important part of my architectural, research library 
                Hello, fans of Tangerine Dream!  I will reveal the mystery of Russian words in "Kiev Mission"! Of course, I like the album because of this track. The humour of TD is the following: for English or German speaking listener these words sounds as spoken by Russian girl, while for Russian listeners (girl speaks-whispers-sings with the strong foriegn acsent) it sounds as Russian words spoken by friendly foreigner. The words are the following:  Continents Asia, Africa, Europe, Australia, America It`s - the Earth Past tense Present tense Future tense  World is we are  To understand To ask To answer To talk To start thinking Transmission...  To associate (to communicate) with the friends... To exchange opinions... Infinity An intelligent being Talking, dialog Continents: Asia, Africa, Europe, Australia, America It`s all - the Earth.  As you see there were nothing poltical in these words. Only idea of global unity which is close to people of different countries. I think that Russian words were choosen because they sounded exotic for the Western ear and beacuase of their rhythm.  By the way, electronic music by TD and Jarre was popular in the USSR in time of cold war... And still is popular in Russia. As to cold war itself - We lived the same normal usual every-day life as you but with our own problems. For the people in the state which lost more than 20 million lives in the 2WW - nearly every family lost its relatives - every talk and wish of possibility of new world war was a kind of sacrilege. And Chrustchev didn`t told: "We will bury you". He spoke vulgar Russian-Ukrainian slang, so English translation was complete fake (the meaning was lost in translation). He meant that (in his humble opinion:) USSR will win competition with America and would show much better results of development. So don`t think of political stupidity of the cold war - simply enjoy the music!  Also I recommend you best albums by TD: Le Parc (1985) Underwater Sunlight (1986) Goblin`s Club (1996) Try also "Jeanne D`Arc" (2005) and interesting solo albums by former TD members (though music differs from TD sound still it`s dynamic and interesting): Christopher Franke "The London Consert" (1992) and "Celestine Prophesy" (1996), Paul Haslinger "World Without Rules" (1996).  
 This is Karen Rose at her best!!  I have read all of her books and she continues to keep me interested and impatient for the next one to come!!!!  If you haven't read her than i suggest you begin! 
 This book gives deep insight into the Nature of God and how deeply He really loves each and every one of us, especially in these times of so much turmoil and suffering. 
 The Liar is the first novel that Stephen Fry wrote and the second of his novels that I have read. Over the last 15 or 20 years he has of course become familiar from television as a comedian and comedy actor, as large as Oscar Wilde and with a flippant urbane wit nearly to match.  A born entertainer, one would say, full of zest for and enjoyment of what he does, and a bit of a toff with it. However when I first read his The Stars' Tennis Balls I sensed something else entirely. My reaction was `This man is seriously not right', and it came to me as no surprise recently when he let out that he is a manic depressive. You can already sense the problem in The Liar. It is largely autobiographical obviously, and just as certainly embellished too, I should say. The hero and the author are carried along on a torrent of their own phenomenal articulacy and imagination. Experiences and ordeals that would have had most of us in permanent psychiatric care seem to leave no lasting mark so far as this narrative is concerned, but the underlying nihilism is unmistakable as well. Fry's genius is a gift of the gods, but like most gifts of the gods it comes with a heavy burden attached. When the effervescence boils down, as it sometimes must, the vessel is empty. The style is not just the man, the style is the man's whole world.  The most elite English education is the scaffolding that supports Fry and his hero. Their patois is a joy to listen to, and the author's satirical ear is acute. He has not only the idiom of the English public school to perfection, but also the jargon of Cambridge professors arguing as well as the strange lingo in which examination questions are framed. None of these are targets for Fry in any sense implying hostility. He is a liberal, not a revolutionary, and he laughs because otherwise he might weep. All the same, it would be leaving an utterly false impression to suggest that there is any tone of gloom to this book. It's funny, sometimes hilariously funny, and it is damnably ingenious. I will go further - there is a real feeling of kindness about Fry, and cruelty is absent altogether. This book involves people being murdered, but the sense is no more gory than in Agatha Christie, and the Christie-style denouement with the master-mind explaining the intricacies of what has happened is clever beyond anything Christie could do.   Is he perhaps too clever by half? Not for me, but very likely for his own good. He remains an entertainer of genius, his heart is obviously in it, and I feel it's a good heart too. This is what he does because this is what he's good at, and I have not read a book that entertained me quite so much for quite a long time. Put your Family Values in a jar with the lid firmly on, of course, when you read Fry 
 We took this on vacation with us and three kids between the ages of 2 and 4.  It was something different and they really enjoyed it.  It was easy to pack and provided about an hour of quiet activity that didn't involve cartoons.  It only lasted about 2 more times for my two year old son but older kids could probably get a few more uses out of it. 
 I grew up watching the old re-runs of the Little Rascals in the 1980s and watching those shows are some of my most vivid childhood memories.  In retrospect, why can't viewers accept the fact that this show featured good, clean innocent childhood fun AND yet also had some racist undertones consistent with the times?  To say this show wasn't groundbreaking and hilarious, is to ignore the facts. But to say that this show, looking back, didn't have some racist undertones is also to ignore the facts.  Look at Amos-N-Andy.  A large portion of the Black Community in the 1950s refused to watch this program because of its overtly racist undertones, and yet a lot of those same people will admit today that it's hard NOT to laugh at some of the humor.  You just have to be honest and be real when watching old footage of Hollywood shows like these.  I'll continue to laugh when I watch these episodes, but in adulthood, it's hard not to also think back to what living in the 1920s and '30s was like for my family -- it wasn't always all fun and games (and no doubt, we all know that TV & Hollywood images have proven to be equally empowering & damaging for a number of reasons).  Little Rascals should serve as the ultimate history lesson.  Great writing & great comedy are timeless. This kind of racism, no matter how blatant or hidden,is dated.  These DVDs attest to that 
 The best of writing from the Gourmet Magazine of the 60's and 70's. Writing from the Goumet we know and love 
 Steve Oedekerk (the writer of the film BRUCE ALMIGHTY) directed, wrote and starred in this quite silly kung fu spoof. Though one hesitates to call it groundbreaking, KUNG POW is genuinely remarkable, in that much of it is composed of scenes from a 1977 Chinese film with modern actors smoothly and digitally inserted into them. Watch the credits at the end for examples of what I'm talking about.  Because of this creative juxtaposition, KUNG POW manages to create a comedic atmosphere that is uniquely its own. It really does "feel" like a vintage martial arts film, yet the dialogue is so extraordinarily silly and the timing is so odd, it just wrings laughs out of you.  SIDELIGHT: The entire movie is dubbed, and Oedekerk also did all the voices for every character (except Whoa.) To further the bad dubbing effect, Oedekerk wrote a fake script of gibberish for the modern actors to repeat on-camera 
 Sharp, quick whit.  If you like edgy comedy you will love this!  For all the bad reviews, it must have just been over their heads 
 definitely recommend this memory card, download time is great . .  
 This book is right to the point with some very different tools to measure a business' future. I am a Certified Turnaround Professional and I found the introduction and definitions of Turnaround very useful since most people think of turnaround all wrong. I am getting a copy for an associate since I was so impressed 
 It's bad that the season does not have subtitles, when is so important when you have deaf problems. Should not this subtitles be a part of the standard procedures for the realeases ?  Thk 
 This book is excellent for a brief summary of every major accident since the 50's.  It reads like an encyclopedia rather than a novel.  Some pictures are included.  There is a fair amount of lingo specific to the  industry, with occaisonal transciptions of cockpit dialogue and  illustrations of flight paths.  Emphasis is given to the facts surrounding  and explanations for the crashes 
 On March 29, 1282, the celebration of Vespers in Palermo, Sicily was marred by a massacre of European importance - the townspeople rose up and slaughtered their French occupiers. The uprising spread from one town to another and soon the entire island was in rebellion against its ruler, Charles of Anjou. Steven Runciman, one of the last stalwarts of the great Oxbridge school of history writing places this violent but seemingly local event in it proper context - as part of the struggle between the rising tide of the new force known as nationalism and the aspirations of the Popes and their religious establishment to create a universal Papacy ruling all of western Christendom. Toss in the age-old struggle between the spiritual authority of the Pope and the temporal authority of powerful rulers, and the result is an explosive mixture. The Sicilan Vespers marked the watershed in the fate of the medieval Papacy - as Runciman shows, the credibility and spiritual authority lost during the course of the last half of the 13th Century set the Church on the slippery slope that led to Avignon and eventually the Reformation. It is a stirring tale, and who better to tell it than the distinguished historian of Byzantium and the Crusades? New readers will soon discover why this book has become a classic 
 Impossible to put down. You cannot wait to see what mistake or twist of bad luck follows these people 
 More than 20 years old now and a little dated, Spinal Tap is still loads of fun with the "mockumentary" gang including Christopher Guest and Michael McKean (who did the delightful "Best in Show" in 2000).  Every aspect of `60s and `70s rock music is lampooned.  Surprisingly, director/interviewer Rob Reiner comes off a little flat--but maybe that's just to help highlight the rest of the delightfully dim cast of characters.  "Big Bottom" (a sendup of "Fat Bottomed Girls"--one of my politically incorrect favorites), the "sophisticated" "Sex Farm", and the controversial "Smell the Glove" (ultimately released as Tap's "Black Album") are among "Tap's" big hits.  
 Imagine being able to learn or hear someone's deepest, darkest, most secret fears, desires, and shame.  Postsecret lets you into the minds of people and reveals what is in their hearts.   Frank Warren started a project where he handed out blank post cards with the edict to write a secret "Reveal anything -- as long as it is true and you have never shared it with anyone before. Be brief. Be legible. Be creative" what he never expected was the amazing responses he would receive.    These postcards are in turns amazing works of art, brilliant snapshots of life, betrayals, funny antidotes and stirring reminders of life's dark places.  You will find your self moved and see your self in many of these postcards.  Most of all you have a backstage pass into someone's mind and it will leave you wondering if you actually know who that person is.   
 This is a wonderfully written, and excellent book. It assumes only minimal background  knowledge but imparts a great deal of insight. I love the way that the author describes this area and the connections with deep and beautiful  mathematics 
 The highly acclaimed Soda Fountain website relied heavily on this book to put together their history of Coca-Cola pages. This is by far the BEST book ever written on the history of Coca-Cola. It debunks a lot of folklore put  out by the company and even gives away the original formula 
 Finally, a book that shares the proper way to store all types of vegetables and fruits.  As a member of an organic food co-op, sometimes my husband and I received vegetables we were not familiar with.  This book widened our horizons, even providing serving suggestions, how long to store items, what signifies a healthy looking vegetable, and more.  We use it all the time and are buying copies for friends and family!  A plus 
 This book is great!  It may be short in length, but it is a great story.   All her life, Karen has known nothing but boarding school after boarding  school.  Her father, her only parent, is a mob boss, and Karen doesn't  really know it.  She has always kind of suspected it, but never confirmed  it.  She doesn't really want to know the truth.  She is very out of touch  with her father, partly because everything is handled by her father's  secretary, Miss Simon. One day, the headmistriss at Karen's boarding school  recieves a call to get Karen and tell her to pack her bags because her  father is taking her to London. This call is supposedly from Miss Simon,  snd there is no question in that matter at that point in the book. When she  finally gets there, the people that meet her are again,  "supposedly" her deceased mother's cousins. After a few odd  happenings, Karen starts to think that something isn't right, so she calls  upon an old friend who happens to be going to school in London.  He comes  to the rescue, and whisks her off to a safe place, however, all is not  right yet. Her mother's supposed cousins chase them all over, and  finally.... Well I guess you'll have to read the book to find out, won't  you? This is such a good book.  If you like excitment, action, and drama,  this is the book for you.  Read it already 
   Dr. Anthony Arthur has written a superb biography of Upton Sinclair (1878-1968) whose long, colorful and controversial career in writing novels and in California politics takes the reader through the twentieth century.   Sinclair was born to a fading southern family with aristocratic pretensions in Baltimore. His father died a drunk; he was not close to his mother. Sinclair grew up in New York graduating from CCNY and attending the Columbia Law School. As an only child he was coddled at home. Sinclair was an eccentric who always had self confidence in his amazing intellectual gifts.   Sinclair married Meta Fuller in 1900 with the union producing a son David (who later became a scientist) They lived in tents in Princeton where Sinclair labored on his novels and articles. The couple divorced after they both had several affairs. The lifestyle of the Sinclairs was bohemian with the young family living in communal situations as Helicote in New Jersey and others.   Sinclair would wed two more times in his long life. His reputation is solidly based on his expose of the meat industry in 1906's "The Jungle" and the Lanny Budd novels beginning with "World's End". Sinclair won a Pulitzer Prize. He was a friend of such luminaries as Albert Einstein; Jack London; HG Welles and George Bernard Shaw. He dabbled in film work getting to know Chalrie Chaplin and many other directors and actors.      Sinclair was arrested several times for marching in union  protests. He was high strung and a man who valued his privacy. He wrote several novels in his career but is little known by the general public in the twenty- first century. He is often confused with Sinclair Lewis.   Sinclair was the Democratic candidate for governor in California in 1934 promoting his End Poverty in California agenda (EPIC). He was defeated by big business and the moguls of Hollywood.   Upton Sinclair was an avid tennis player who enjoyed the outdoor life. He was tough, eccentric and blessed with a genius for putting words on paper which the general public could comprehend.   This is a worthy biography for persons interested in American literature an history.         
 I adore this book. It explains physical chemistry in a way that makes perfect sense. I used it for my chemical engineering thermodynamics I class. While other people contented themselves with memorizing really long equations and formulas, I was able to derive them by reading McQuarrie's book. I found that my chemical engineering textbook just spat out an equation out of nowhere and told us to know it, this book starts out with the chemistry, explains the theory, and clearly shows how to get to the equation. These things don't come out of nowhere, they can be taught and derived! I haven't even taken p chem but I look forward to it after using this book for ChemE thermo 
 Ok this is not one of Sonic Youth's best albums. That does not mean it is not intriguing or worth buying.  Compared to other sonic youth albums this one  is kind of in a world of its own.  Just listen to "The world is red" and you will know what I mean. Or you can be like my freind and listen to this album while really  drunk on a cold fall evening. He came away a little spooked, especailly after listening to the dark and slow "protect me you". I had a similar expreience with this album and it really caught on with me. This album is not for everyone but is worth checking out. 
 I looked and looked for a bike that had a great digital screen with all the things I wanted (calories burned, RPMS, distance, heart rate and time), one with a lot of different resistance levels and one that was going to be quiet. I got everything plus more with this bike! I'm so glad I spent the extra $100 or so for this one instead of the 200$ ones I was looking at. Worth every penny! I would recommend this bike for any at home exerciser looking for a great workout on a daily basis 
 In the wake of Littell's bestseller, "The Company," Overlook has reissued three of Littell's Cold-War novels, classics of sly black humor and switchback, labyrinthine plotting. These include his first, "The Defection of A.J. Lewinter" (1973), about a low-level American scientist who defects to the Russians - or does he? Then his 1990 novel, "The Once and Future Spy," pits the CIA against the CIA in a twisted tale of dirty tricks and history.  But "The Sisters," a conspiracy of conspiracies, is the apex of Littell's diabolical wit. Plotting is the vocation of the title characters, Francis and Carroll, old CIA hands, known to their leery colleagues as "the sisters Death and Night" (Walt Whitman), and the story opens with their obscure and hilarious conception of "the perfect crime." They are too careful - communicating in cryptic written notes which are shredded at day's end - to let anyone, including the reader, in on what this crime might entail, but its instrument is a Russian sleeper - an unactivated spy living secretly as an American.  To find him, the Sisters must suborn the Potter, a disgraced and retired KGB officer, the former head of the Russian sleeper school. His last and best pupil, the one the Sisters seek, is also the son he never had. But, between threats and bribes, the Potter betrays him, as he knows he will.  The action picks up as the Potter flees Russia and then his CIA "protectors" in order to intervene and stop his protégé from committing the crime that will reverberate around the world.  Narrative shifts among the various characters - the Sisters, the Potter, a Cuban assassin whose role remains a mystery until things are well advanced, a couple of Russian masterminds, a pair of Canadian assassins and the debonair, reluctant, but well-taught young Sleeper - all of them plotting and counterplotting.  As a number of these chase each other across the country, Littell's black wit and deft storytelling keep the pages turning. The Potter, a hapless, likeable fellow, despite his cold-bloodedly ruthless side, acquires a civilian sidekick and the reader's sympathies. As the story comes together with a bang, first-time readers will gasp at Littell's masterfully inclusive cynicism and readers familiar with the twists will marvel again in sheer appreciation. This is a conspiracy fan's uber-conspiracy 
 Please see my review for "Give Us a Penny and We Will be Gone." I saw this album as an Irish release first, and it is essentially the same material.  This is a young band that manages to engage listeners with less than the normal studio style ornamentation to the original music. Some Irish traditional music enthusiasts prefer the old pub style as more accurate in preserving the heritage. This one-two albums is a very strong contribution to that heritage.  
 I bought this book for a friend who has cancer.  It offers information and support both medically and emotionally for anyone who has been diagnosed with breast cancer.  It is a gift for its clarity and kindness. An easy read that can help someone begin to be empowered when their world has been turned upside down.  Thank you. 
 This book is about the kidnapping of Christian Missionaries Martin and Gracia Burham in the summer of 2001.  The Phillipino Abu Sayyaf branch of Al Quieda was responsible.  Taken with a group of rich tourists from various foreign countries, their abduction was originally done for quick randsoms. But, the American government refuses to participate in this so they were in captivity for over a year!  Other tourists were either killed or their ransoms were paid.  No other source I've read mentions this as one of the financial operations of Al Quieda.  I loved this book because it really makes you think about what is important in life.  
 This beautifully produced coffee-table book arose from a fashion exhibit held by the Victoria & Albert Museum in the early 1990s. I can't say enough about the layout, photography, and amazing color throughout the  book. While the exhibit curators obviously labored mightily to put the  exhibit together, the book manages to catalog it all in an enthralling way.  A bit expensive for people like me, but you should definitely find a copy  to browse through if nothing else 
 I had only recently discovered music download sites and was looking for love songs from south of the border. I had never heard Gloria Estefan before and got lucky on my first download. It was one of the songs from this album and I was instantly enchanted by the lush orchestration, the beauty of the melodies and the sincerity with which delivered the song. Nearly every "cancion" in the album has the same premier quality. The addition of a bilingual "libretto" was very welcome.  Dave Gilli 
 Trisha Yearwood has a talent like no other. Her voice is just beautiful and her delivery is perfect! This CD includes all of her major hits from the '90s and even three new songs which have all since became standards for Trisha! She is definetly gonna go down in history as one of Country's brightest stars!  Everyone needs to own a copy of this CD 
 It comes with all the accessory additions that I need.  Protects it from scratches very nicely.  Silicone protects it well.  Not much will protect an MP3 player from a fall, unless you want a big bulky case.  I would recommend an aluminum one if that is waht is desired.  This case is great because it is sleek, slim, and protects it well from everyday use 
 I would highly recommnend this book to anyone interested in the environment, but more importantly, anyone interested in the idea of "saving" the environment. Ashworth very nobly explores man's  vision of what "nature" should be and what conservation should  mean. Through his own experiences and wisdom, he deftly tells it like it is  and though this may seem a turnoff to many, he doesn't aggravate or annoy  the reader. I read this book in several hours, and wished there had been  more. Ashworth is a keen observer of nature and anyone who feels that  nature is worth saving should read this book 
 Iam not a big jazz fan but I put a set of head phones on and they didnt come of tell it was over.This man is one super artist. Buy it 
 The truth had to be told and Dave Holloway and his co-authors did a great job of letting us know what the Aruban and Dutch officials did to hinder the investigation into Natalee's disappearance.  It's just disgraceful!!! I applaud this father's courage in facing up to those people who did everything they could to stop him from finding his daughter!! The book was so good, I read it in three days.  It is spellbinding and captivating and it is the best account of the story that I have seen.  Bravo to Dave Holloway for letting the truth be known!!! I definitely would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys true crime.  The mystery has yet to be solved, so I do hope that there is a resolution to the case and we have the opportunity to read Part 2 
 A Tale of Three Kings contains helpful information about how we can thrive in spite of being under the leadership of someone who abuses authority. Succinct and easy to read. Powerful. 
 Love this for hot summer days, dry winter days and hot flashes :) A must have for catching the vapors also good when out in the sun.. 
 Deborah Crombie continues to deliver a series worth reading and rereading...this entry is no exception. Balancing jurisdictional disputes, personal life distractions, and a strong sense of historical detail, In a Dark House is another superb example of Crombie's sensitive portrayal of character, place and pitch-perfect plot. If you haven't read her work yet, get them all and be prepared to enter a world you won't want to leave 
 Not as good as Flags of Our Fathers, but a very good book that shines a light on a little-known, little thought of corner of WWII 
 I own all the other books listed in the suiseki section, and have read numerous descriptions of the art of Suiseki as they appear in books on Bonsai,and I feel that Mr. Rivera's book was the first to help me  understand what makes a suiseki different than any fascinating stone that I  might pick up. The sections on aesthetics, and display were extremely  helpful. And lastly, the photos were of terrific quality, and variety.It  would be the first book I would buy on the art 
 This is a nice piece of equipment for the price.  I was looking for under $300 a collapsable workout center.  That is exactly what I got.  It works for what I wanted and it allows me to have a great workout.  The only con I see is that the bands don't give enough resistance.  For a starter gym it is great, but if someone is moving from the gym to home workout it might not be enough resistance.  To purchase replacement bands you have to go through Stamina, but each band is around $10 or less so that isn't too bad.  I also had to modify some of the workouts that were described in the book to make them more efficient

 Fire in My Bones is an examination of Afro-American gospel surveying the gospel music program as a whole, considering how it works to join performer and audience, prayer and singing into part of the worship service and how  Afro-American Christians have made gospel an integral part of their world.  Fire in My Bones is a fine in-depth examination of devotions and devotional  services 
 Detective Mia Mitchell has just returned from sick leave after taking a bullet in the shoulder, while her partner Abe is still recuperating from his injuries. With Abe out of the picture, she is partnered with Fire Marshall Reed Solliday, a sexy widower who is investigating a deadly fire which appears to be murder. Mia is not happy with the assignment and wants to search for Abe's assailant. A workaholic by nature, Mia is not sure what to think of her new partner, and there is a definite spark igniting between them. Between the death of her not-so-beloved father and a mysterious woman popping up all over the place, Mia's plate is too full to act on her feelings.   As Reed and Mia sift through the clues, additional fires and victims start piling up, as a madman is seeking vengeance on people who failed him and his brother, and they can't seem to connect the dots, but sure seem to connect with each other. As they get closer to the truth, Mia gets into the crosshairs of the killer, who plans to use her to detract attention before he completes his revenge.  Rose's latest novel (one of many to feature Mia) is an intense, nail biting drama. Though the romance is secondary in this story, it is still prevalent and sensual. Despite its length - 550 pages, it goes extremely fast, as the reader won't be able to put it down. Between her ability to plot, realistic dialogue for characters of all ages and backgrounds, interesting and well-developed secondary characters, and not being afraid to have her characters do flawed things, no one can top Karen Rose when it comes to romantic suspense. 
 FIRST OFF:  "The Man in the Moon", is a great film! With Robert Mulligan, the director of 'To Kill A Mockingbird' and 'The Summer of 42' at the helm, and a 14 year old Reese Witherspoon as Dani, who shines in the role of a coming of age teenage girl in love for the first time, the film certainly starts out on the right foot.  IN A NUTSHELL: A TALE OF 2 SISTERS [some plot spoilers below]  Its roughly the summer of 1957 in rural Louisiana. Maureen Trant, 17, [Emily Warfield] and Dani Trant, 14, [Reese Witherspoon] are sisters. Very close bonds hold them together, but this summer will put a strain on their relationship. The strain comes in the form of Mr. Right appearing without warning as the boy next store. His name is Court Foster [Jason London] and he is 17 years old.   The trouble is, Dani saw him first, or more correctly he saw her. The family knows that Dani has an older friend next store who happens to a boy, but owing to the age differences and the boy's character nobody is worried -- except Court. He's got a little girl following him around and he has to admit it too himself that he wants her around -- and perhaps more -- too much more?!   THEN THE PLOT THICKENS: [more plot spoilers below]  Maureen never sees Court until we're about halfway through the summer, since she was out on a date when his family returned to the farm and they had dinner at the Trants. When she does see him, he has come to their house to visit Dani, but then something happens.  Court and Maureen are obviously taken with each other and Dani can't believe it. How could her sister betray her like this? From this point on the movie is about the strain between the two sisters when Mr. Right appears to both of them as the perfect man.  Robert Mulligan - Director  Sam Waterston  - Matthew Trant  Tess Harper  - Abigail Trant  Gail Strickland  - Marie Foster  Reese Witherspoon  - Dani Trant  Jason London  - Court Foster  Emily Warfield  - Maureen Trant  Bentley Mitchum  - Billy Saunders   ABOUT THE DVD: EXCELLENT WIDESCREEN TRANSFER  SPECIAL FEATURES: THEATRICAL TRAILER & SCENE SELECTIONS - WISH THERE WERE MORE   BOTTOM LINE: THIS IS A 'REEL' SLICE OF LIFE THAT WON'T DISAPPOINT  This is quite a little story with a big punch. The supporting roles are impeccably played with Sam Waterston playing Matthew Trant, the father, and Tess Harper playing Abigail Trant, as the mother. They have their own personal dramatic subplot in this summer of 57 in Louisiana. 
 My daughter truly loves this book - she loves reading how silly the states are and how sometimes they act like people.  I truly recommend this book for everyone.  It is definately lots of fun 
 For anyone who has no idea but is curious about the gaming industry, then this is the book to get!  For all I know ( for I am also a novice), this book covers everything about the world of gaming - game industry terminology, different game platforms, presenting concept ideas, receiving intellectual property.  I know all that makes very little sense to a novice reader, but trust me, after reading this book, you'll know what I'm talking about.  And for those already with jobs, but are hoping to make a career change into the gaming industry, this book provides encouraging yet practical advice on how to get started on achieving your goal.  Simple things like what sort of education and internships.  This book is also meant for those already in the gaming industry.  It provides tips and advice on how to get your ideas on a distributor's list of possibilities and how to recieve as much credit for your idea's success.  However, I'm not saying that with this book and this book alone will you be on your way to working for a major developer/distributor.  The points made in this book are very blunt and straightforward.  It'll explain how your love for games will be your only drive when forced to devote about 95% of your life to getting your game done on schedule.  This book filters out the idealistic views of game-making to a practical cutthroat business where one minute you'll be recieving $70,000 pay for working on a game and the next being broke and out of the job and having to force an early release of the game which you've put so much time and energy into so that it can go to becoming one of the games that get sent into the discount bin.  But that, with experience and determination, you may someday end up creating the next Half-Life or Call of Duty!! 
 This is my favorite Nora Roberts novel.  It has all the typical ingredients for a romance novel, but adds in tons of mystery and thrills that keep you guessing until the very end.  I've recommmended this book to several people, all who loved it.  This is one of those books you can pull off the shelf every once in a while and read again, and the thrills will still get to you!  A definite keeper from Nora Roberts 
 This is a wonderful book. The pictures are great and it is in a form that is easily read. 
 as a child, I didnt have siblings my age so you may as well call me an only child. and certain television shows would come on that I loved and my dad went out of his way to see what I liked. Then he would ask me to watch them with him and we would bond for about an hour a night.   The Greatest American Hero was one of my favorite shows ever. I loved this show. I was a comic-book fan from day one and I always took in the opportunity to make the next experience in television superheroism nowhere near my last.  Yes, I put up with the lame Captain America series with him on the freakin' motocycle and yes, I dealt with Spiderman being a sucker with one webshooter. Who cares? We had a new player in town. An upstart and boy...do I believe in upstarts!  Mr. Hinckly is a great guy who just wants to do well at his new job at teaching the worst kids in town. He even goes so far as to challenge a tough guy in his class to a boxing match. He loses to the tough guy but that tough guy becomes not only a friend for life but a guy whom he will need to lean on in his superhero life.  Did I say superhero? Yes. During his trying to teach his kids something special, Hinckley goes on to live his life until a field trip changes everything. When no one is looking, Bill Maxwell and Hinkley see Maxwell's dead friend in the desert. He tells the guys that he was preserved by aliens and that they need a hero. They chose Hinckley.  They give him a box and an inscruction booklet on how to use it. It is the dead of night and both guys are really confused. When they leave the dark desert, they lose the inscruction booklet. And that really sucks.  The shows that come up are all about Hinckley trying out things about his new suit but never knowing what he is doing. It's fun sometimes, but other times you wish he would just finish the job and be done with it. He really is a superhero and doesn't know how to deal with it. He has the perfect outlet, an FBI agent who can sent him in the right direction. The Greatest American Hero does a lot of undercover things and it's kind of cool but you just wish that once in awhile he would know what he was doing. He is always experimenting with powers he doesn't know he has because of him losing the inscruction book 
 The Minute I saw this book I thought that this would make a great Christmas gift for some James Bond fan out there.  You really have to see the insides of this book to see what I am talking about. Every page is filled with color photographs, drawings and diagrams from all 21 James Bond film. It is a beautiful looking book from cover to cover. I thought they covered enough on CASINO ROYALE without giving too much away. In fact they do a very good job with CASINO ROYALE. Some kid or a really big kid is going to love this book. 
 Lynne Hinton's The Things I Know Best is set in North Carolina, where a home which has housed generations of the Ivy women is affected by a special gift which sparks changes and tragedy. A twin sister's experiences and predictions spark conflict and love 
 Cabinet of Curiosities is my fourth book by these authors (Relic, Reliquary, and Brimstone) and while it wasn't without a few annoying faults I found it to be extremely interesting and entertaining at the same time.  In this book, we find that a new construction project is delayed when the excavation crew unexpectedly discovers a 19th century coal tunnel holding skeletal remains of 36 brutally murdered people.   Almost immediately after the discovery is made, Dr. Nora Kelly (an archeologist and curator at the Museum of Natural History, Thunderhead) is visited by the mysterious, refined and independently wealthy FBI agent Pendergast (Relic & Reliquary) who takes an unusual interest in the remains. Dr. Kelly reluctantly joins Special Agent Pendergast for an unofficial examination of the site, and together they make a startling discovery...a clue has been left behind by one of the victims that proves to be an important piece of information in the search for the perpetrator of this hideous crime.   All of this is connected with a Cabinet of Curiosities (collections of items of historical and/or archeological interest, these predated museums like the New York Museum of Natural History...some of the items were genuine  -- others contrived to bring in the public and their money) that was once located on the site.  Pendegast and Kelly are almost immediately ejected from the site as the wealthy builders money buys his way to having the site cleared and back on track with their building schedule in a matter of hours, but not successfully covering up the discovery of the remains of what could be the work of the most prolific serial killer in American history.  With a taste for this mystery and a piece of clothing (with a note inside) that Kelley and Smithback (Relic & Reliquary, her boyfriend in this book) manage to sneak in and retrieve the trio is well on their into a mystery that threatens to consume them all.    While I enjoyed much of Cabinet of Curiosities, it has a number of "sore" points for me and I find that much of what I don't like about this particular work can be laid squarely on the shoulders of one Agent Pendergast. As in his previous appearances, he is superior in every way to every one around him (richer, more refined, better dressed, more knowledgeable, and just slightly ahead of everyone else in piecing together the pieces of the puzzle).  The authors certainly tried to make him more appealing this time out, personalizing and going into detail with his life and his past...but overall it falls flat and one is left with the feeling that none of the other characters is as marvelous or important as Pendergast...he's just too perfect.   As a result of the attention given to Pendergast, interesting characters like Kelly and Smithback can only function on the periphery, as sidekicks or buffoons; I just felt that they weren't as well developed as they might have been if the authors didn't place so much importance on Pendergast.    My other major complaint with the book is that it drug on for 100-150 pages too long, well beyond the "reveal" and where (I felt) the authors has the opportunity to take the ending to a truly horrific and unique levels of mad scientist genius they didn't...they took a sharp right turn and ended in a way that really felt like a let down after all the effort that went into the build up.  I would have liked to have seen something a bit more exciting (and unique), but that's just me.  Despite its flaws, Cabinet of Curiosities is quite a good read, It kept me up two nights in a row...just one more page, with eyes burning and me feeling desperately tired...I just had to read ONE more page!  For me this was ALMOST as good as Relic (which was my favorite so far by Lincoln & Child), I love the descriptions of the museum and of New York (both the historical and contemporary descriptions) and the history of the Cabinets of Curiosities was quite delightful!  I'll definitely be picking up more of their work in the future.  I give this one a B+, I love Pendergast...but I feel that this character might be becoming a pet character for these authors and as such is bordering on becoming unreal (and annoyingly so)...he hasn't quite reached that point, but I could see it happening.  So...overall, great late night reading with just the right mix of horror, thriller and a dash of science that's hard to put down! I'd recommend it in a heartbeat, especially if you liked their previous work.  
 This 278 page paperback book by Lynn Weiss Ph.D. is essentially a field guide for adults with ADHD, but without pushing the ADHD part. Dr. Weiss who is one of adult ADHD's pioneering authors and a champion of the brain diversity model of ADHD has done a solid job of presenting her arguments and strategies in this book. The first portion of the book looks at the emotional consequences of growing up with this specific type of brain wiring (ADHD) and suggests several strategies for undoing damage to self-esteem and identity.   The rest of this book focuses on a wide variety of essential life skills and is definitely geared towards adults who are suffering from ADHD related difficulties such as organizing, time management, and financial skills to name but a few. The Strategies Sections have been well organized and broken down into five main topic areas; Organizing in New Ways, Following through to Success, Behaving Yourself, Using and Protecting Your Sensitivity, and Succeeding at Work.  Although I do not completely share the author's views, I have found this book to be extremely valuable, both personally and with clients. The breadth of the book is outstanding in that it covers such a wide range of topics, and they are extremely easy to locate and understand.  The book is laid out in a way that allows readers to flip through it and pick out whatever topic is of importance or interest.  For example, if you are experiencing issues around clutter you can just pick up the book, open it and go to the section that tells you how to deal with clutter. As is always the case the book is certainly not a panacea, but it will help jumpstart the reader's ability to better manage their negative symptoms, as well as build on their strengths.  In terms of presentation and lay out the author has done a very good job, the pages are all two columned with well bolded and italicized portions, and there is also ample room for note taking in the margins.  This book definitely makes my top 10 list of adult ADHD books and is an essential part of any well stocked adult ADHD library.  In terms of criticisms I only have one and it is that there is no index in the book, which is an oversight I just do not understand. Though the book is well laid out and has a well developed table of contents indexes are still vital, because they help individuals who have a hard time making their way through entire books, allowing them to hone  
 This book, this entire series, is so amazing.  Normally a series of books starts off really good and simply gets worse as the other books come along.  Not this one!  Each book in the series continues to get better and better.  I'm just waiting on pins and needles for her next book to be out 
 This is a very useful collection of ten essays by University of Wisconsin/Harvard University historian Frederick Jackson Turner written through out his career. Edited and introduced by John Mack Faragher, this book is a very fine entrï¿½e point to the thought of Turner. The first of the essays published here is Turner's seminal work, "The Significance of the Frontier in American History," an essay that defined a whole field of research. Read at the 1893 annual meeting of the American Historical Association in Chicago, this paper has exerted an enormously powerful force on the historiography of the United States, in no small measure because of its powerful statement of American exceptionalism. Turner took as his cue an observation in the 1890 U.S. census that the American frontier had for the first time closed. He noted, "Up to our own day American history has been in a large degree the history of the colonization of the Great West. The existence of an area of free land, its continuous recession, and the advance of American settlement westward explain American development."   Turner insisted that the frontier made Americans American, gave the nation its democratic character, and ensured the virtues of self-reliance, community, egalitarianism, and the promise of justice. He noted that cheap or even free land provided a "safety valve" that protected the nation against uprisings of the poverty-stricken and malcontented. The frontier also produced a people with "coarseness and strength...acuteness and inquisitiveness, that practical and inventive turn of mind...[full of] restless and nervous energy...that buoyancy and exuberance which comes with freedom." It gave the people of the United States, in essence, virtually every positive quality they have ever possessed.  Despite criticisms, through at least the 1950s vision of the frontier reigned supreme as an underlying definer of American character. It conjured up an image of self-reliant Americans moving westward in sweeping waves of discovery, exploration, conquest, and settlement of an "untamed wilderness." And in the process of movement, the Europeans who settled North America became an indigenous American people. In Turner's characterization, the frontier concept has always carried with it the ideals of optimism, democracy, and meritocracy. It also summoned in the popular mind a wide range of vivid and memorable tales of heroism, each a morally justified step toward the modern democratic state. The popular conception of "westering" and the settlement of the American continent by Europeans has been a powerful metaphor for the uniqueness of America in the twentieth century.  As explained in Faragher's introduction, in the latter half of the twentieth century historians increasingly questioned Turner's frontier ideal, arguing that it reduced the complexity of events to a relatively static morality play, avoided matters that challenged or contradicted the myth, viewed Americans moving westward as inherently good and their opponents as evil, and ignored the cultural context of westward migration. They determined that Turner's "Frontier Thesis" was excessively ethnocentric, nationalistic, and somewhat jingoistic. His rhetoric excluded more than it covered, moreover, failing to do justice to diverse western people and events.   In addition to the title essay, this excellent collection of the essays of Frederick Jackson Turner includes such articles as "Social Forces in American History," "The Western and American Ideals," and "The Significance of Sections in American History."   This is an indispensable source for the thinking of Frederick Jackson Turner and his influence on thinking about the history of the American West 
 This book came at a time of necessity for my daughter whose body is now changing. It is all put in a way as girlfriend-to-girlfriend advice and very helpful for the young. Jukes gives life experience moments, which make  the acceptance part of puberty easier. I love the humor and of course that  opens you up to talk about your experiences with your daughter. I think it  should be included with the fourth and fifth grade school supplies. No  surprises! Buy it, you'll be glad you did 
 i have to say that this is possibly the most interesting and enjoyable movie soundtracks i have ever heard. it is good to hear something that is fresh, modern, and soulful, unlike all those Stravinsky-clone orchestral soundtracks out there. don't get me wrong, there are a lot of good ones out there, but after a while they all start sounding similar. it is great to have here in Fight Club a soundtrack that highlights the destructive and modern/urban nature of the film itself.  another interesting feature here is that the tracks on this cd are not in original film order. they are in "general" order by themes, but all of the miscellaneous cues and tracks from the film are arranged into the various themes (as indicated by the track titles). for example, the track "Marla" contains multiple cues within the track that happen during scenes that concern Marla herself. also, the very first cue from the movie, during the "fear center" opening credits, does not occur on the cd until the tenth track. i think this is a great idea, as rather than being a "perfect pristine this-is-exactly-as-the-film soundtrack", here we have an album that accentuates the dust brothers' music itself. it would most likely not be as interesting if it were all in order.  and to all those others who complained about the lack of the pixies and tom waits: if you want the music of tom waits, GO BUY A TOM WAITS ALBUM. i also personally hated that "where is my mind?" song from the end of the movie 
 At first glace, "Whatever Will Be" appears to be just another wannabe pop album, but once you actually start listening to it, it starts to become much more. Tammin co-wrote almost all of the songs, and they have meaningful words, rather than the usual teenage pop singer complaining about how awful it is to be rich and gorgeous. (cough Lindsay cough Lohan) If I had to pick two songs I like best, I'd choose the title track, Whatever Will Be, because of it's slow and beautiful sound/vocals, and probably the fun and relaxed Around the World, because of it's peppy, laid-back rhythm. Tammin is already a celebrity in Australia, and maybe someday she'll release her brilliant album in America, where she'll fit right in among the likes of Hilary Duff, Avril Lavigne, and Kelly Clarkson 
  The art book to which this product is related, is really quite fantastic. A simple, accessible and dymystifying look at the art world and artistic styles and movements which gives glorious little representations of the works on offer and wise words which avoid art world snobbery.  This is a box of post cards based on the book which allows the images you loved in the book to be portable, artisticly usable and sharable. Use as for notelets, celebrations or to brighten up a dull room,Delightful 
 I started reading The Funhouse Mirror up while I was waiting for a connection in an airport.  I got so absorbed in it that I almost missed my plane.  It is a collection of stories by prisoners in Washington State.  Their pieces are remarkable, but what really makes the book are the interspersed commentaries and stories by the editor, Robert Ellis Gordon.  Gordon spent several years working in the prison system as a writing teacher, and the prisoners who wrote these stories were his students.  While the prisoners' stories are good, Gordon himself is a far more accomplished and vivid writer.  Reading Gordon's own pieces really brought home to me the hell that is our prison system, and the difficult moral and emotional problems that it poses.  This is a wonderful, gripping, depressing book that I recommend to anyone who wants to learn about what our prisons are really like 
 This pamphlet by Lenin was first published 90 years ago in the midst of World War I and on the eve of the Russian revolution.  In this work Lenin sets out to achieve two things; first, to give a concise and scientific explanation of the nature of Imperialism and, secondly, to debate the ideas of influential and long time German Social Democratic Party leader Karl Kautsky who, under the pressure of war helped to lead the capitulation of the majority of his party to the side of the German ruling class.  Advocates for social change familiar with arguments on the "left" blaming the cause of the today's ills on various forms of globalisation, - which is meant to represent a more aggressive and rapacious form of imperialism - will find Lenin's polemic against Kautsky invaluable.   Lenin presents a more than convincing case that what we see today is no more than the normal workings of imperialism and therein lays the source of the problem  Taking in Lenin's five principal features of imperialism starting from the first chapters is essential to understanding his discussion with Kautsky near the end of pamphlet. In fact, it goes a long way to clarifying the world as it is today. 
 This was a really good book. It is good from the front cover to the back cover. I would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys being "transported" to another time and place through words 
 The photography in this series of books are touching and beautiful and very creatively presented. They bring back memories of times with my mom and dad. Money well spent on gifts 
   Jimmy Cagney polishes his tough, street smart, gangster-type image. This time he is not a punk, he's a fed, if not squeaky clean, at least honest. He's a young lawyer who joins the FBI to avenge his best friend's murder. The name FBI is not used nor is J. Edgar's culture present. New technologies for the time are shown. Interesting, but certainly not the CSI of today. Real life events of the time are woven into the story such as the Kansas City Massacre which occurred in 1933.    It is an old fashioned cops n' robbers movie from the 1930's with the stock characters, classic old cars, chases, gunfights & crashes. This movie is guileless. The guilty are killed  or captured, Cagney is the hero, gets shot, recovers & gets the girl in the end, his boss's sister no less. An old favorite 
 By far one of the most technically and musically talented dj's so far! Always ten steps ahead of the rest of the turntablist world. This can only be said about only so few dj's out there, It's been said to never show this man whatever scratch or new technique you've invented, 'cuz he'll take what you've invented and re-invent it and make it better. After hearing this album... I can beleive that!! Much respect to Qbert for paving the way in this art.. he's one of the few that make dj'n what it is, AN ARTFORM!! He's defenitely the man! 
 Great read covering the psycological aspects of trading(Winning, Losing, and learning from one's mistakes. 
 I'm deaf and a diehard Red Sox fan... so I want to know if this DVD has any closed captions. Thanks!!!  My rate (5 stars) isn't true because I'm writing here for get the info of the CC. Sorry 
 I'm a big fan of Nora Roberts and I've read some truly great books with her name plastered across the front. Then again, I've read some "not-so-good" novels too. But overall, she writes romance like no one else can. BLACK ROSE was probably one of the best novels with NR's name on the cover that I've read in a while. This is a the 2nd of a trilogy for story line and all I like reading now is Red Lily, which I'll be getting soon. I love a good romance story, but I hate trashy sex scenes. And this book has some of the tenderest and sweetest sex scenes that there is. That's probably another reason for the five-stars. But really, this book flows well with great characters and the paranormal worked in just beautifully. No need to go into what this one is about because there's been too many reviews posted. Just take my word for it. This one is a keeper 
 ..This is a wonderful and complex book about self-discovery by travelling back home to one's roots. The journey made by the main story's protagonist, Milkman Dead, is both wonderful and complex, but Morrison through her main character and this book demonstrates the importance of families and the dangers of not passing down our heritage and not embracing it, for if we do not we will end up like Macon Dead, and Milkman Dead. Whereas Macon Dead, the father purposefully erased his past (what little he maintained), Milkman seeks out his heritage and as a result finally finds out who he is and is free. This book has everything, symbolism, metaphors, character development, emotion, and mythology and witchcraft. It contain sexism, elitism, and racism. It is an awesome read for the mature reader and this ranks along with Sula 
 I enjoyed this book more than Max Allen Collin's second Dark Angel novel 'Skin Game', as I found Max's backstory quite interesting and informative.   However I don't feel he's really got her character down pat, and there were certain elements to the story which I found difficult to chew. Such as the transgenic Seth, who also escaped from Manticore in '09 and winds up working for Eyes Only. Seth is never mentioned in the show or even counted amid the 12 escapees (turns out that he's the 13th) and personally, I find this transgenic a hard bit of 'canon' to swallow. It just doesn't tie in with what we know of the characters in the show. Would Logan really have kept Seth a secret from Max? Maybe so, but it makes him now seem incredibly ruthless.  I'm not the biggest fan of Logan but I still find it hard to believe he could do what he does to Seth, and still be able to 'use' Max once she comes along.  Actually, maybe he could... *shrugs*  Anyway, asides from that gripe I did find this book a good read. At times even a great read.  Although I still feel Max Allen Collins was the wrong writer for the job.  I've read better fan fiction 
 This is the best album of theirs. Its full of lessons and tales of life and experience.  1. Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground- 10/10 Great song. 2. Hotel Yorba- 10/10- Country tune with a very vibrant story. Its great and fun. 3. I'm Finding it Hard to be a Gentlemen- 9.5/10 Great song and very addictive riff.  4. Fell in Love with a Girl 10/10- Incredibly addictive to listen to.  5. Expecting- 9/10- A great riff. It almost seems similair to "Heartbreaker" by Led Zeppelin. 6. Little Room- 8/10- This is just Jack singing while the drums play. I still like it because hte vocals sound really good with the beat. Its actually pretty good even if it is incredibly minimalist. Thats their style and they do it very well. 7. The Union Forever- 9/10 Awesome song about a heartbreak. Really awesome stuff. It starts off slow and then breaks out in a grungey refrain. Awesome! 8. The Same Boy You've Always Known- 9/10 Really good love song. 9. We're Going to Be Friends- 10/10 Chances are you've heard this song somewhere. It's a great love tale following up The Same Boy You've Always Known 10. Offend In Every Way- 10/10 In my opinion this is the best song on the album. Its about Jack White's talking voice offending people because it is so diferent than his singing voice. Its hilarious because the lyrics are very literal. 11. I Think I Smell a Rat- 6/10 The only bad song on here. I hate it absolutely. Lyrics suck and the whole music is bad here. 12. Aluminum- 8/10 Cool effects song. This is a really neat. You may not like it at first but afterwords you'll really enjoy it. 13. I Can't Wait- 9/10 Good song. Not a fan of the simple lyrics. 14. Now Mary- 10/10 Seriously awesome song. Great stuff right here. 15. I Can Learn- 10/10 Great stuff here. Awesome song about marriage. Has a lot of meaning here behind the lyrics. "I wish we were stuck in a tree, then we'd know it was nice below". 16. This Protector- 10/10 Is in the style very much of their Get Behind Me Satan. Unlike The Nurse in that album, this song is done very well. Great job on this song. Artistic and beatiful sounding. 
 I have read this mag thru and thru, and for some 20 + years now it has continued to be at the top of the crop.  It is the most superbly laid out and designed magazine with excellant content,that I have ever seen.  To be totally honest, I would much rather read and browse this any day over "Print" magazine.  This is almost like a graphic design book, that just gets published every 2 months where the best designers in the world are given each about 30 pages to just go nuts on.  I found it deep in the stacks of the university library one day and have been hooked ever since...also for those of you who can read/write japanese, german, and english you can have your pick while reading.. 
 This tries to research the mind of this evil person and how it became that way, and mainly explains it away with genetics!  It seemed to be more about his father - who was a "real piece of work."  So he inheirited his "mean streak a mile long" and added to it as he went along.  The only saving grace to a person of this horrible magnitude is to keep us on our toes against someone else coming amongst us and taking over like this scoundrel did.  So far as I know, people like him are incarcerated in Maximum Security Prisons in our country, and they are usually discovered earlier in life than Hitler was.  This book stops before he really gets into the Auschwitz mentality, etc.  I had not read Norman Mailer in a long time and found his writing interesting.  Mailer is in his 80's now and still writes engagingly.  I did not like the subject of the book much, but enjoyed the author's ability to keep me reading in spite of that.  
 I wish I could think of more to say than "this is the best mystery or thriller I have read all year," but the truth is, this story knocked my socks off.  My one (small) complaint is that I would like to have had a little more insight, perhaps from a first person perspective, of the villain's pathology and motivation.  That small complaint aside, this is the best mystery or thriller I have read all year.  And then some 
 After reading an excerpt from this book in Real Simple magazine, I couldn't wait for The Language of Baklava to come out.  It was definitely worth buying.  I have read it at least four times so far.  The author gives so much detail and believable experience that you feel like part of the family.  In a time when we don't hear many positives about the Middle East, this book is a necessary, perspective changing read.  So many of our families center around food anyway, and though it isn't the food of my childhood I can still relate.  The author does try to stick in her new love life at the end, which is disappointing and non-relating to the subject.  And, Auntie Aya's advice is given in bullet point style, which is also disappointing.  However, those are the only two negatives in a book of hundreds of positives.  (And the recipes sound amazing...)  I've read rave reviews about the author's other books.  I will tell you, while I've only read Arabian Jazz, this book comes out far ahead of that one.  If you liked it, you will love The Language of Baklava 
 This is just a fun movie that anyone can enjoy. The plot-an alien (Kim Bassinger) comes to Earth to study the planet and in doing so falls in love with a scientist (Dan Akroyd). But things are not all sun and fun! Dan's daughter (played by Alyson Hannigan!) suspects things are not all gravy on the home front and investigates his new love interest. Needless to say-hilarity ensues. The best part of the film is the scene when a really young Seth Green comes to take Alyson on a date. Buffy Fans!!-You'll really like seeing Seth and Alyson together. Rent the movie if you see it, you'll have a good time 
 The characters in this book as well as the story line in itself seem very real, the book is very touching.  From the mother in the story we learn strength and perserverance, and from the daughter we learn about humility  as well as determination.  Even a mother and daughter can come from very  different viewpoints, and in this book, Janette Oke shows us that those  differences are not insurmountable, and can actually make a relationship  stronger 
 This is an excellent overview of Winthrop and his Massachusetts Bay Colony. The author traces how John Winthrop struggled with the dilemma, first internally, as he dealt with the question of whether traveling to the New World represented a selfish form of "separatism", the desire to separate himself from an impure England, or whether, as he eventually determined, it offered a unique opportunity to set an example for all men by establishing a shining "City upon a Hill", a purer Christian community in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In this regard, it seems to have been of vital importance to Winthrop and his fellow Puritan colonists that they had the imprimatur of the King and that though they were physically distancing themselves from the Church of England, they were not actually renouncing it.  The issues Winthrop faced are no different than what the Church still faces today (though perhaps seemingly less practical). That is, what is the normative and non-arbitrary basis for jurisprudence- Gods' law or autonomy? Gary North's books are particularly helpful in answering this, hopefully, rhetorical question. The sad reality is that most ecclesiastic officers and the Church as a whole are altogether unprepared to deal with the task presented to Winthrop because of their pessimillenialial views despite Christ's admonition that the (defensive!) Gates of Hades shall not prevail against His kingdom.  I highly recommend this book 
 This is an amazing book to read after reading Barbara Tuchman's "The Guns of August." Both books deal with the psychology of war but Susan Griffin addresses modern war on the level of the individual; telling stories of both the victims and the perpetrators of war's atrocities. Susan attempts something new in her style that is very effective on one hand but difficult for the reader on the other. She asks "Who are we?" and then answers that there are so many strands to a story and one must trace every strand. She literally takes this idea as her form and weaves the threads of several stories together on the same page. I found each "thread" fascinating but ultimately I ended up reading each separately so that I would not lose my grasp on the story. I found Chapters 1 through 5 to be fascinating. The last chapter entitled, "Notes Toward A Sketch for A Work in Progress" is just that--an abrupt departure from the main body of the book. It's what's left over in her journal that she didn't quite fit into the book but still wanted to include anyway. It's interesting but not as engaging as the first 5 chapters. The book is gloomy and yes, Susan Griffin has a depressing outlook on life, but even doomsayers can be valuable soothsayers in our society 
 I love the delicious "cakes" she makes and how she misunderstands everything and takes it literally. I was laughing so hard when she served mr and mrs rogers a "chicken dinner" of cracked corn and a "sponge" cake!!! too hilariou 
 I have seen some criticism that this book isn't religiously sensitive, glosses points or seems to be from one man's perspective.  The thing about history is that, like the present, everyone interprets things differently.  If Van Loon was to explore every opinion of every historical event in human history the book (apart from filling a stadium) would lose its blatant charm.  For religiously historical stories of a less practical  nature, one should really read their particular religion's prescribed texts.   I found the book to be flambuoyant and enhanced by humour and opinion - qualities rarely found in history books.  I have a copy of the original book and will be buying the revised version to bring it up to date.  As Van Loon said - why buy story books when history is far more exciting? 
 While no Scream, Valentine still manages to rise above other horror films like I Know What you Did Last Summer and the like.  It's not original by any means, but it makes the regurgitated scare tactics it uses seem somewhat fresh and with a cast as beautiful as this one your willing for forgive the many mistakes.  The film follows a group of friends as they try and decide who is trying to kill them.  These girls were all horridly mean to a boy in school and it appears that he has come back on Valentines day to exact his revenge.  As the body count rises their fear grows stronger, and with a large Valentine bash on the way things start to escelate rappidly.  It's far from perfect but it's far from dull and that counts for a lot.  It's a nice deversion from the mundane and serves up some decent scares, some hot bodies and some bloody aftermaths (if your into that kinda thing, and judging on the fact your interested in this type of film tells me you are).  Recommended for any fan of the Scream franchise and the like 
 If you like nu metal, or the rocking side of alternative music, you should get this CD.  These guys are killer.  If the first few songs aren't heavy enough for you--- check your pulse!  I actually had to listen more than once, but it's hit me.    Play some Xbox and listen to this album... cool isn't it 
 I've read both short story books by A.M. Homes and loved them. This is the first novel I've read by her, and I loved it. I couldn't put this book down. I never knew what crazy thing was going to happen next. I could relate to alot of Elaine's feelings regarding her life 
 Karen Armstrong's book "The Gospel according to woman" is an extremely well-written account of the Christian Church's attitude to, and lack of respect for, women.  It certainly explains why women are still struggling to be accepted as equals by their male peers in the Church even in the 21st century, literally hundreds of years since the establishment of Christianity 
 Tailchaser's Song is another great animal fantasy. Tad Williams created a wonderful world for his cat characters, including their unique religion and culture. He also introduces a language, "The Higher Singing", which can be confusing to follow but it has a glossary in the back so no harm done.   The story follows the journey of young Fritti Tailchaser, a tom of the Meeting Wall Clan. His friend Hushpad goes missing, and Fritti swears to bring her back. He begins a perilous journey with the kitten Pouncequick in tow. He meets a whole cast of cats and other creatures along the way, and it's there that Williams really shines. You can tell each cat apart by their characteristics and different tones, and the way he introduces the custom of all cats having three different names is well done.  The tale does get downright bleak during Tailchaser's stay at the Vastnir, and it's a little confusing in places. But the twist at the end when Fritti finally discovers Hushpad was unexpected and really made the book work, without the usual ending that the author could have just as easily ended it with. Tailchaser's Song is on my list of well-done fantasies, and it's perfect for readers of The Wild Road and the Golden Cat by Gabriel King.  
 Ever heard the joke about the city planner who married his wife just so he wouldn't have to explain what city planning is on another first date again?  Community development is often even harder for the general masses to comprehend, and yet we are a part of it all the time.  CD is basically what happens when neighbors get together and decide they want a better neighborhood, where people can afford to live and still feel safe, still find economic opportunity and a sense of community.  Over the last generation, a whole industry and profession has grown around this simple idea.  CD is something you can now get a masters degree in.  Most people in the CD field entered it through a back door.  Today's CD professional is more than a person with good intentions.  He/she has skills in real estate development, group facilitation and strategic planning, public policy analysis, and finance.  This book is the first of its kind--an actual front door into the field--and it's a godsend for anyone considering a challenging and meaningful career in making neighborhoods better.  The book gives great background on the industry, has real case studies with leaders--as well as everyday joes--in the field, lists common job titles and responsibilities, and even estimates pay scales.  It's an ambitious, yet slim, readable book that delivers what it promises 
 Having sat on the boards of two international nonprofit organizations for decades, I can say that this book could have saved me years of confusion and ineffectiveness, had I come upon it earlier in my career. I am purchasing it for all the people I am mentoring, and highly recommend it as basic but indispensable reading to anyone working or planning on working in the nonprofit sector. Thanks, Peter 
 The city of New York hosts some of the most memorable skyscrapers in the world: for those unable to personally visit, Manhattan Skyscrapers provides a newly revised, expanded edition to present over eighty of the best of Manhattan's skyscrapers. Though full-page color portraits of each are packed into each feature, equally striking is the blend of historical background, architectural insight and details Nash provides in each accompanying description. A 'then and now' feel is created by the color contemporary photo facing a page of vintage or black and white illustration. Highly recommended for any fan of Manhattan or urban architectural style.  
 This book was very enlightening!  Raymond Capt wrote his books so many years ago, but he was so far ahead of his time.  The past few decades on this planet have been so mind closing.  Our belief systems have limited our abilities to search for the truth.  We just take what we've been taught at face value and believe it to be the truth and the gospel and we go with it, limiting our beliefs to just that and being totally unaccepting of any other possible way.  Capt gives us other ways!  Read all of Capt's books and you will find so many new paths and truths.  Don't make judgemnets on his writings until you have read them (as one reviewer has)!!!! 
 great pen for puppiies or small dogs. You can  bend over it or use the door for dogs to come and go as they like. I ordered 2  and they came right away have ordered 6 more they have been on back order for a month so far 
 I bought four of these Unsolved Mysteries collections - Ghosts, UFOs, Miracles, and Strange Legends. UFOs is my favorite. I especially liked the part about Roswell. I have seen lots of shows and info about Roswell over the years, but this episode had info that I had never seen before. It made me believe it really happened at lot more than I had in the past. I remember thinking things like "WOW! THAT IS COOOOL!" The rest of the UFO stories are very interesting too 
 The reason I like this  book because the comedy, the pictures and the characters.I like books like these because they get boring in  the beginning and,in the middle it gets interesting .The reason that i like bone is because in other books people get bored but with bones they dont but I just love bone so much and,the characters are so funny.You inspire me so that I want to write my own book.The reason I gave this book 5 stars because it is creative hot, slamin, and funky.               From; Marva, Nic 
 I've seen a plot kind of similar to this before.  I have watched thousands of movies and worked in a video store through high school and college and have a good memory for movies.  I can pick apart a plot and predict the ending easily and I knew Josh Harnett's character was just too innocent at the beginning.  But I give them credit and a great all star cast (though I hate josh hartnett).  It sure was a h@ll of a lot better than the horror movie we picked out just by box cover this weekend (Beyond the wall of sleep.  Shoot yourself instead of watching this) 
 This book struck me as unique on several levels.  First of all it is a serious, thorough examination of the 21st Century Mafia and stock scams, through the eys of a serial swindler working for the mob.    But what really appealed to me about this book was its writing style, which was unique among the mob books I've read in being offbeat and satirical. It is very unusual to read either a Mob or a business book, and this book falls in both categories, that approaches its subject in that manner.  You practically have to go back to Jimmy Breslin, and his Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight, to find a less reverential view of the mob. The difference is that Breslin was working in fiction and this is a true story.   In business, the only parallel is Michael Lewis' Liar's Poker, which of course delved into an entirely different side of Wall Street 
 This book starts with a extremely well explained chapter on the philosophy of control charts. This is really the most important part of the book. Other topics about rational subgrouping and myths are also very well covered. The book deals with interesting examples which should be a little bit more up-to-date. Presenting control charts on mm-paper is outdated in this computer era 
 Can Cher do no wrong? The woman's remixes are always great, like Madonna. And their single prices are the same! How weird is that? "When the Money's Gone" has the very best remix ever made by Thick D**k (Thick D**k vs Cher Bootleg Mix), the lighter-sounding Manny Lehman Remix (a MAJOR turn from his other remixes), plus 2 Brother Brown gems. "Love One Another" sounds VEEERY similar to a RuPaul song, in the subject matter and lyrics. It has a fantastic mix by Eddie Baez, a house/trance mix by J Star, and a great Friscia & Lamboy remix. I also recommend: Believe All or Nothing Song for the Lonely A Different Kind of Love Song  PS: Kristine W did the first version in 2000. I prefer Cher's version, though.  
      This was my first melodic-death album and over the years I've collected dozens and dozens of albums.  But weirdly, this album seems so fresh every time I listen to it.  The production is as good as it would be today which is very odd.  The riffs are fantastic and rival those of Arch Enemy's.  After getting many underground melo-death albums, I feel as if this is the most exciting.  Maybe it's because it was my first melo-death album but I sincerely think that this is because In Flames, with this album has created a formula that mirrors pure perfection.  Every song is worth your attention.  Get this for sure.  I like it better than Clayman while their other albums are a very different style.  (Whoracle owns 
 This effort by Frances Mayes should be considered on its own merits.  Like Mayes I have an ongoing love-affair with Tuscany and the people who live there.  Mayes continues her whimsical account of life in Tuscany inspiring my flights of fancy and thoughts of my next visit to Tuscany.  Her descriptions of Italy whether it be its food, places or people are so sensual and compelling that you put down the book only to long for that next visit to Italy.  That is what I expected when I read this book, and Mayes delivered the goods.  I was thoroughly satisfied with this book 
 If you want to REALLY get to know the Romanovs, this book is for you! It contains the letters and diaries of Tsar Nicholas II and his family, which gives readers a personal glimps at this amazing family who lost their lives on July 17, 1918. It also contains the memiors of those who knew them well. 
 Though the magazine does have the MLM and "You To Can Get Rich" articles, it has validity. You can do anything if you find the right thing, something your passionate about. I've found the articles may not always fit my exact situation, but I can extract what is meaningful or useful to fit my unique situation or business needs. Isn't that the main goal here? You have to find it, no one is going to hand it to you. Do the research and the work and ask for mentoring. Follow up on the leads and ideas they give you. I truly enjoy this magazine.  Carpe Diem 
 Outstanding account of this engagement. I have a close friend who was involved. From his account this is the way it went down 
 Five stars to the Brothers Gibb.  The Bee-Gee's of history proved that you don't have to be some pretty boy, or a corporate goon, to make it to the top.  They added equal parts crooner, bull-fighter, and groovemaster to produce some of mankinds most cherished monster hits, and they did it their way.  No tricks.  No pureed drivel.  Just three men with a lot of guts and class.  They may not be Bismarckian in the true sense of the word, but make no mistake: they wielded their own unique brand of "blood and iron" to secure that proverbial "place in the sun" for their mighty empire of fantastic ditties.  An A+ for the awesome Aussie trio!! 
 Good quality product.  Twirl whisks are much better than regular whisks for making puddings, soups, etc. that don't have "chunks" in the food 
 Loved it from start to finish. Have read it twice in the last ten years. Love the time period, the plot, the hero and heroine. All good. One of Lindsey's best! These idiots who write about how demeaning it is to women...blah blah blah, they should read something written by a ball- busting left wing lesbian (someone like Hilary Clinton). As for me I'm sticking with Lindsey. 
 This 1963 film from 20th Century Fox, albeit oboviously compressed in time, offers a great opportunity for insight into the classic struggle of Rome's movement from a Republic to rule by dictatorship. Subtle references such as Cleopatra's teasing of Caesar's balding by referencing  his cognomen (nickname) "Julius" (means full head of hair), the burning of the great library of Alexandria, and the propaganda used by rullers of the time (Cleopatra claiming to be Isis and Caesar claiming to be related to Venus through Aeneas), give opportunity for scholarship; all the while being thoroughly entertained. Scenes like the death of Pompey, the mention of Caesar's pride, his 10th Legion, Cleopatra's references to Caesar's writings "Commentarii", Cleopatra's grand entrance into Rome with her son, Caesarian, the naval battle at Actium between Antony and Octavian, are all rich with generally accurate historical facts. The Latin word for school and fun are the same..."ludus, -i". This cinema offers both. 
 This book was recommended to me by Amazon; after reading a few comments I was curious as to way this book got such high marks. I've read quite a few books on attraction, and I have to say this book does a great job of synthesizing a lot of the information your likely to come across. I had the luck of just finishing The Evolution of Desire by David Buss, which happens to be in the bibliography. I saw key elements of Buss' book simplified for easier reading. I have no doubt that Irresistible Attraction simplifies other sources in the same manner. The book, though not original contains a lot of useful information about attraction and personal magnetism 
 An excellent source book for anyone looking for authentic reproductions of the original that is housed in the Vatican Libray. This is a reproduction of an ancient document from the Mixtecs, around 1400 AD, from the area  today known as Puebla or Oaxaxa. The project took seven years to complete  as they painstakingly reproduced the Codex with accuracy and authenticity.  The color plates are a delight to the eye as they depict kings, mythical  warriors and the Mixtec belief system. Each plate is explained, in great  detail, in the beginning of the book for your convevience. The colorful  plates are intricate and exact on thick high quality paper. This is great  stuff for an artist working in any medium that needs inspiration or just  wants to reproduce. A good book for history buffs too 
 This book is very well written, its easy to go through it quickly. One of the features I really like is the different interviews with game music composers asking everything from equipment to techniques to inspiration.  This book gives a detailed look into the industry, don't expect to learn how to compose from buying this book. This book is for musicians that are beginning or are already working with computer games and need to know about the industry. Sorry but there will never be books around pretending to teach you how to compose music, composing like anything else is something that you learn by doing and not by reading books. But if you are a musician already, and love computer games, then you won't regret this book 
 This story stayed with me for very long time. I couldn't wait to get his next book "Tis".  
 Jimmy McDonough does a superlative job of bringing the fascinating life of the late and almost completely unmissed misanthropic sexploitation/schlock horror movie maker Andy Milligan to light. Reader be warned, this is an unflinching look at life in the nightmarish rough trade underworld of New York. Milligan started in amateur theater before helping to create the boiling milieu that birthed the Off-Broadway Theater movement in the early sixties. Then he moved to the 42nd street grindhouses, making exploitation 'classics' that are eye scalding in their badness and impossible to forget, no matter how hard you try. Yet McDonough continually points out that, as bad as Milligan's movies were, they could only be made by Andy, being infused with the writer/director's utter contempt for women, family, and just about everything else humanity offered. Being a recalcitrant and secretive subject for McDonough, Milligan (as the author warns) sometimes fades from the narrative, but never from the world he inhabits. By the time Milligan leaves theater for the exploitation movie business we can fully understand why McDonough found Milligan such a hypnotically fascinating figure. For fans of exploitation movies, The Ghastly One is an essential book. Highest recommendation 
 I'm writing this just at the end of the 2006 elections. I can't imagine how many millions were spent trying to persuade me that this candidate or that question on the ballot should be my choice. I'm astounded at how many phone calls I've received from Laura Bush, or that candidate who just wants to set the record straight about the lies her opponnent has been telling about her. And then there are the outright lies. The people for Question 4 tell us that this will eliminate smoking in public places and we should vote for 4 but not for 5. Question 4 relaxes some of the current laws, Question 5 strongly limits smoking nearly everywhere but casinos and brothels. Oh, and did I tell you about this fellow in Nigeria with the huge amount of money that's tied up in his country and if I will just pay some transfer fees....   This book looks at all aspects of persuasion from a scientific point of view. It's useful from two directions, how to be more persuasive, and how to resist persuasion. Most important, it's how to understand what's happening in out world 
 Raphael Cohen-Almagor offers a comprehensive, rich, and critically considered discussion about questions of death and the choice of death in the context of the medical practice.  This book is a remarkable contribution to the debate on death with dignity. It discussed a wide range of topics, including an original outlook on terminology at the end of life (for example, 'post-coma unawareness' is suggested instead of 'permanent vegetative state'); the question of autonomy; the sanctity-of life - quality of life debate; criticism of some extreme quality-of-life position; criticism of Ronald Dworkin's distinction between critical and experiential interests; active and passive euthanasia; the Dutch experience, and the Oregon Death with Dignity Act.  Cohen-Almagor's book is a complete, interdisciplinary discussion of the right to die with dignity. It may be of great interest to people coming from different experiences. Its language and methodology make it accessible to wide range of readers. Its exceptional merit is that it provides a balanced view that never renounces human life and human dignity. 
 "American Sphinx" is not the place to begin a study of the life of Thomas Jefferson. In the introduction, Joseph Ellis comments that before joining the plethora of published analyses and biographies of Jefferson, the historian had better be prepared to bring some new insights to the life of this most revered of the Founders. Ellis chose for his subtitle, "The Character of Thomas Jefferson", and it is Jefferson's character that Ellis explores, in snippets that leap forward from scene to scene in Jefferson's life, as if Ellis were a time-traveler checking in periodically on his subject while Jefferson the man moves through a life that is now considered hallowed history. Ellis assumes that his reader is already familiar with the larger moments of Jefferson's life, as well as the surrounding history, and so skips over these. The reader who is new to Jefferson, therefore, should start elsewhere.  "American Sphinx" was published a few years before the DNA tests in 1998 which proved that some of Sally Hemings' children did indeed carry the Y chromosome of the Jefferson family, probably from Thomas himself or his brother Randolph. Because the DNA evidence cannot narrow the paternity of Sally Hemings' children any further, Ellis' arguments against Thomas Jefferson as their father still hold up, and remain as reasonable as they could also be inaccurate. Despite a wealth of circumstantial evidence that can swing either way, any final judgment must be taken simply on faith.  And "taken on faith" seems to be how Jefferson's life must be viewed. He represents so much to so many about the founding spirit of the United States that he is often worshipped along the lines of a Joshua or other prophet. Ellis seems to hold Jefferson up to this same hero-worship status, but through lines of often dry prose and some confusing sentence structure (Ellis does not set off his prepositional phrases with commas), the reader begins to get the queasy feeling that Jefferson may not have been the man that we have all wanted him to be. He begins to come across as petty and insecure, with a naï¿½ve outlook on humanity that carried on even into his waning years. It was always easy to write off Jefferson' sharper declarations (The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants) as youthful enthusiasm, but his convictions against a governing structure for the United States apparently never changed, leaving John Adams to question Jefferson's sanity while even James Madison had to shake his head from time to time. Ellis almost appears to have been startled by these revelations, and struggles to keep Jefferson atop a pedestal even as the evidence tries to topple the whole thing.  All in all, "American Sphinx" is a sobering exercise in the realities of greatness; that in the end the Founding Fathers--and Jefferson in particular--were all very human and just as capable of error as anyone; that the founding of the United States was neither a clear-cut goal of rationality nor even a consensus, but was rather a struggle of ideology pulled toward the center by camps who were alarmingly polarized even in the eighteenth century. But even as the dichotomies of Jefferson's life descend into disingenuousness, we can still ask with some reverence: Where would we have been without him?  
 I have read several of Thomas Moore's book and this is probably one of my favorites.  
 I'm happy to be the first person from Michigan to review this album for amazon although it is a bit sad since I've just gotten into them and they have a few other quality albums that I haven't heard yet, however, what they have here is brilliantly played rock and roll.  I don't think they are the saviors of rock and they wouldn't even say that, but they rock in a way that few in todays rock world do.  These guys are so anxious to rock it shows in the speed and chops in the perfomances.  They never cease to be impressive song to song. One thing that's the best thing about the album is the lead singer.  He's not the best singer by any means, but he sings with an inspiration that's not only right on key, it's loud and energizing.  Similarly, his guitar playing and the band accompanying solos are spot on.  I wholeheartedly recommend this album to people who like rock and roll and I mean the classic sense of the world, it's music that has a groove you both can, and can't dance to. Whatever the case may be it makes you move. Although it might be wrong for me to ascribe greatness to a band that has just entered the national scene, I truly think they are a quality band and if enough people hear them, they will be great. It's just a matter of those people catching on 
 I read this entire book on a flight from London back to the U.S. When I got home, I rented/watched several of the movies mentioned by Truffaut (Rear Window, etc.) watching for the points he made. Many people don't know Truffaut was a journalist as well as a filmmaker. He was able to write as desriptively as his films were imaginative. My only complaint is that this is a book for serious film fans who have already seen the movies he reviews. If you haven't seen the films, his comments aren't referential enough to include you. But, that said, it will help you see many titles in a new way 
 I own almost every organizational book that has ever been written but this one is at the top of my list.  The author shows you how to organize totally everything in your home, office, and life.  It is definitly worth the money 
 You might not agree with Pat Buchanan in other areas; however, he is spot on with this book and it is scary.  We are living in a time where the United States is rapidly changing and it's not for the better.  The illegal immigration problem runs rampant and unchecked and is leading to the division and yes, the potential downfall of this country.  California is already lost, Arizona is fighting for its survival and other bordering states are rapidly being taken over.  It is in no uncertain terms an invasion and occupation of portions of our country.  It will not stop there but will continue, if unabated, to the rest of the United States.  It's simply a numbers game and our number is up 
 If you are a Weather Report fan, this is a must have.  New to the band?  Find out why this was the most popular yet critically acclaimed band of the era 
 For those of you that don't already know Dre died on holloween 2004. He waz shot while riding in a van on the freeway in Kansas City. But this isn't about his death this is about The Game Is Thick pt.2. This is not Dre's best work as heard earlier this year with the Genie Of The Lamp but this is close to it. My personal favorite tracks are numbers: 2,3,8,9,12, and 13. The one and only garbage song is number 10 feat. Yukmouth (what a coincidence Yuk on a garbage song? no it can't be! maybe it has somthing to do with Yuk being weak)So if you don't have this go and get it. It is a good way to end Dre's Legacy as THE GREATEST BAY AREA RAPPER, PERIOD! 
 I really like this book.  In many ways it is a book about how institutions change.  Dr. Witte has simply decided to focus on tax institutions.  He begins with a discussion of incrementalism, or the idea that very  often-large changes cannot occur all at once.  He then puts this into  context within the academic theories of the best tax.  The bulk of the  book though is historical.  Through economic history, Dr. Witte, discusses  the forces of ideology, interest, and pragmatism that shape tax policy.  He  shows that these forces affect both the tax rules and the meta-rules that  shape them.  [The history is very clear, although an historian might note  that Witte tends to rely on secondary sources.]  Finally, Witte notes that  because have institutional structures that prevent anything but marginal  changes, we are unlikely to get an ideal tax no matter how defined.  I  would recommend this book strongly for people who are doing this type of  research.  My only complaint is that I would have preferred to see more  discussion of the political entrepreneurs who shape the changes 
 Harold and Maude is simply the most joyful movie I have ever seen. Not only is it laugh-out-loud funny, it is touching and moving and odd. If you haven't seen it in a while ... see it again 
 Gaitskill writes like a boxer, punching her way out of chaos and confusion, landing with grace in places of hard-knock clarity. Her language is direct, economical, immediate, and piercing. Every word matters. Emotionally, Gaitskill accomplishes in story form what Joni Mitchell of _Blue_ expressed in song: honest reflections on brutal modern-day relationships and the complex, often self-destructive behavior of the people in them. Her characters are sexual outsiders-- intelligent muscular women who dabble in prostitution or pain-play, sadistic men, bookish slackers, inhibited typists who can't escape the driving life forces of numbness and humiliation. Though her cast members often belong to the downtown art scene of an ultra-Blue-state city like New York, Gaitskill describes the details of their lives with a straightforward, matter-of-fact candor, always resisting the urge to glamorize, heroize, or commodify these perversely low-rent bohemians. Thus these are not stories that one can fetishize. In a lot of ways, fantasy *is* a major concern of this book, though it is not the pornographic fantasy of the reader daydreaming his/herself into the position of the characters, but rather the fantasies of the characters themselves as they manufacture self-justifications for their misbehaviors, project unfinished business onto objects and persons of desire, and, more and more as the stories progress in this volume, partially strip away these fallacies to arrive at new moments of awakening and self-understanding.  It is a profoundly moving experience to watch the unmasking of these characters occur in familiar, mundane places-- in offices, porchways, streets, diners, semi-private interiors, crappy boudoirs. One experiences the realism of attempts at human connection, without the Hollywood soundtrack, the forced resolutions, the cutified truisms. When characters confront each other in dialogue, the point is not to promote some hackneyed idea of "universal truth" but to expose the underside of something far more serious: one's worst suspicions about oneself. Though some have criticized Gaitskill's lack of ending in her stories, I don't really see it that way. To me, she writes honest portraits of complex people seemingly trapped in tough situations of their own making. Her stories end at moments of the greatest internal crisis, right at the point where her characters are poised on the cusp of having a change of heart. That Gaitskill stops the story there, essentially giving her characters the gift of autonomy to choose as they will without authorial intervention, is a mark of true compassion and maturity. It is a gift to the reader as well. I can't believe how I've lived so long without the presence of Gaitskill's stories in my life. Her writing lifts the heaviness from my heart many times over. 
  How do storm chasers capture a tornado? They don't. They get as close to it as they think is safe, they pause, they make observations, then they turn and run.   Being a storm chaser implies intent. It implies conviction, purpose, and desire.  When confronted by such a force of nature the depth of one's convictions becomes apparent and what appears can range from a vision of hell to transcendent bliss.  Buddhist practitioners are storm chasers. The natural force they pursue is inside them. It is the very intent, conviction, purpose and desire, which cause them to chase in the first place.  As they get close to this internal force it may or may not feel safe, they may pause or they may not, they may make observations, they will turn and run. The intrepid come back and begin again.  Dancing in the Dharma, by Sandy Boucher is the story of one Buddhist teacher, Ruth Denison.  She is a force of nature. You know this, you don't sense it, you know it, when you meet her.  Somewhere between the first ten seconds and ten minutes of being with Ruth you are pushed outside your comfort zone. You are pushed outside your envelope.  You are pushed outside the box the envelope came in. You want to turn and run. The intrepid stay.  Learning meditation from Ruth is not sitting quietly cross-legged on the floor, although there is time for that.  It is experiencing the Dharma, the Buddha's teaching. It is experiencing the force, the force as manifest in a small wiry German woman born in 1922.  Sandy Boucher is intrepid, she stayed for more than two decades. She is also a wonderful chronicler of this very dynamic and enigmatic woman, Ruth Denison. To practice with Ruth is not only experiencing the Dharma, but also learning, in bits and pieces, Ruth's life story. Ms. Boucher paused and observed. It is good for us she did.  This is a biography of a contemporary Buddhist teacher, not an historical figure or a pop star.  This is the story of a survivor who went beyond mere survival. This is the story of a woman with an incredibly strong personality and a stronger faith and experience in spirituality.   Sandy Boucher has beautifully contained this force of nature (the good, the bad, and the neutral) between the covers of a book. For those who have not met Ruth in person, this is a safe distance. It will tell you a marvelous, awe-inspiring story of one woman who found her spiritual calling. Those who have been with Ruth will find threads dangled before them tied together, but they will also know the feeling of being with this force, pausing, observing, then turning to face the force within.  I recommend this book to all. And to spiritual storm chasers I suggest a pilgrimage to sage tussled Copper Mountain Mesa, in the Mojave Desert.  You may turn and run, but you'll have gained for the effort 
 Although the text covers quite a bit, I can't help but feel a bit annoyed in its arbitrary, and sometimes misleading use of chronology. For instance, Heironymus Bosch is covered in the 15th century nothern art chapter, when it seems to me he should be covered in the 16th century northern art chapter, along with Pieter Breugel and Dürer.  Of course this might be somewhat arbitrary too, but I can't help but be annoyed.  Still, despite this one little problem I have with the text, it is very comprehensive. The works are very well reproduced, and in color too, which is delightful.  I know this isn't a helpful review, but I'll conclude saying despite some disagreements I have with the organization of the text, it is still an award winning text and well written. Unlike other textbooks I have, I have no problem reading the chapters without falling asleep. This is a big big plus 
 My daughter loves this book! She's 6 years old and reads it all the way thru. If your child loves animals he or she will love this book. My daughter bugged me and bugged me to get this book for her. I highly recommend it 
 Reid's philosophy was very influential in the early nineteenth century. Unfortunately, his fame declined. But contemporary analytic philosophers recognize his contribution, and Reid is again very influential. Reid is a philosopher of historical importance and contemporary relevance.  Reid's Inquiry established him as Hume's most brilliant critic. Reid treats Hume's scepticism as a reductio against the theory of ideas, offers some independent objection to the theory, and replaces this theory with a more accurate account of the human mind. Reid's method is characterized by careful empirical observation along with keen philosophical analysis and argument. I think that Reid's style is more beautiful and engaging than that of any of his predecessors; he writes lucidly, elegantly and with sharp wit. The Inquiry is also shorter than Reid's subsequent masterpiece, "Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man".  However, I think that Reid's Essays are better than the Inquiry; the Essays are better organised and more comprehensive. While the Inquiry is a hint of things to come, it is no replacement for the Essays. I recommend both the Inquiry and the Essays. This edition of the Inquiry includes a nice introduction, and some manuscript material relating to the Inquiry. I think that the most interesting of the latter is the exchange of letters between Hume and Reid. There are also helpful explanatory and textual notes. Every serious scholar and student of Reid will want this critical edition of the Inquiry. I also recommend the critical edition of Reid's Essays published in the same series as this volume. Fortunately, unlike the Essays in this series, the Inquiry comes in a relatively cheap paperback edition. I have also posted a review of the edition of the Essays in this series on amazon.com, where I suggest some other editions. But I think that the editions in this series are the best, albeit not the cheapest 
 This was the perfect gift, for a friend who constantly checks tire pressure.  It comes with a case and easily fits in the glove box.  Digital readout?  No more stickey readings!  This new technology easily allows you to read and check the accurate tire pressure.  Definately a nice gizmo gift for most anyone who takes care of their cars 
 Before I review this classic Rolling Stones album, I just want to point out that Juke Box Hero and whirligig are one in the same person. A troll who likes to trash great music and praise Dire Straits(who are a good band but nit the greatest) and Green Day. I say CUT THE SHENANIGANS! Now that is off my chest, back to the review! The Rolling Stones' second album to be released on their own label fittingly called Rolling Stones Records, which was distributed by Atlantic at the time(now Virgin/Capitol), entitled Exile on Main Street was released in May of 1972.  The album was the band's only double studio album but is one of rock's greatest double studio albums in history and ranks up there with other classic 2-record sets like The Wall, Quadrophenia, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway and Tommy among others.  Before guitarist Keith Richards' heroin addiction took over for some time in the mid-1970s, he was what the late producer Jimmy Miller called a workhorse.  The album was recorded at Keith's home in France and at Olympic Studios in London and Muscle Shoals in Alabama and in Los Angeles.  Keith's music and frontman Mick Jagger's lyric writing was arguably at its peak on Exile on Main Street.  Songs like the opening rocker Rocks Off, the 50s sounding rocker Rip This Joint, the album's hit Tumbling Dice, the country-ish Sweet Virginia, Keith's classic rocker Happy(and it is his most famous track which he sang), the slow-ish Soul Survivor, the fast-paced blues rocker All Down the Line and the soul sounding Shine a Light are classics which sound like they could have been recorded yesterday.  Ventilator Blues was another highlight as it was the only song that Mick and Keith wrote was co-written by guitarist Mick Taylor whom just tore the place up from 1969-74(his solos just rocked from 1969-74).  Exile on Main Street was The Rolling Stones' second consecutive #1 album and another million seller.  The tour in support of the album saw the band getting bigger and bigger. Almost 35 years on, this album is still a classic! This album is hugely recommended 
 People are missing the comedy (intended and not) in their reviews.  The script reportedly went through 3 writers and they shot two endings. My friend and I think that Bruce Vilanch (who has a cameo as a bartender in a West Hollywood leather bar) may have written one of the drafts.  Jane's virtuoso comic scene in the airport ("What about Vegas? You fly to Vegas?") is priceless as she goes through a whole dramatic act about her dying sister.  The drag queen she goes to visit has several funny lines.  Diane Salinger has some classic, overdone reaction shots at the climax which are funny!  Love it and don't agree with the other reviewer who said it's not involving.  You're grabbed from the beginning by the situation, the acting, the glamorous L.A. locations, the cinematography.  I'm first in line for the DVD.  I wish they'd included the alternate ending, but supposedly there's a featurette and audio commentary by Jane and Lumet. 
 This is one of those 'secret books' passed from friend to friend, artist to artist. My own initiation into this work certainly came at the most needed moment, and I hope this deliriously engaging analogy speaks to you now as sweetly as it whispered to me back then. Daumal's intriguing characters are hell-bent on marking the mountain that unites heaven and earth, a geographical place that "cannot not exist." Daumal draws obvious inspiration from his metaphysical tutelage under G.I. Gurdjieff, and the book has been radically reimagined by filmmaker and Tarot master Alejandro Jodorowsky in his epic 70's masterpiece "The Holy Mountain." Have a go-go 
 What a story teller. I really enjoy all the disc world books 
 I recently made room at the top of my "Favorite Teen Books of All Time List" for this book. And, trust me, that's saying something.  The concept of a girl attending a virtually all-boys Catholic high school was what hooked me from the beginning. Francesca's observations of the male population at St. Sebastian's are dead-on and hilarious. From Thomas Mackee, the immature music-loving jerk/good guy, to Jimmy, who is too smart for his own good and the only person who can make her mother laugh, to Will, the arrogant but strangely attractive senior that she finds herself kissing at the most inappropriate times.  Francesca, who still considers herself best friends with girls from her old school, grudgingly engages in relationships with three other girls at Sebastians's that she never thought she would become friends with. From Justine, the nerdy but confident band member, to Tara, the feisty feminist ready to take on the world, to Sioban, promiscuous show-off and Francesca's seventh-grade dancing partner. I fell in love with Marchetta's characters from the very beginning.   Marchetta also deals with the issue of depression with incredible realism and honesty. Francesca is unsure about how to help her mother, who spends most of her time in bed; she also struggles to fight the same disease that she feels could be lurking somewhere inside of herself. Since reading the novel, I have gone back more times than I can remember to reread funny observations or poignant moments. Bottom line: A must read for every teenage girl 
 I will start this review by noting two things. I greatly appreciated Nussbaum's 'Upheavals of Thought', and I am uncomfortable with the way sex sits in the society I live in. (But, then, I recognise things in myself that - for good or bad - change my perspective from that of the society I am embedded in.) But Wedekind's play 'Springtime Awakening' should raise alarm bells for most of us.   We are sexual beings (most of us anyway) and we have to deal with that - learn to accept it within ourselves, learn to share it with others (it is, of course, the quintessential sharing experience), learn to grow with it, learn to let it go .... The easy path to take is to grasp a social 'norm' and follow it regardless of the morality of that path. Societies do present many 'norms' to a young person developing sexual awareness but not all of these are equally desirable. If Nussbaum's book does nothing else but diminish the acceptability of some of the undesirable 'norms', and enhance the more socially responsible ones it will have achieved a great service.   There are curious things in this book for me. Nussbaum refers to many sources but many of them are male - Aristotle, Seneca, JS Mill, DH Lawrence .... To be fair, the last chapter is about 'To the Lighthouse' by Virginia Woolf, and other writers such as Andrea Dworkin are prominent. However I was surprised that some powerful women writers are totally ignored - where is Mary Wolstonecraft, where is Emma Goldman, where is Mary Shelley? Why is 'Maurice' (Forster) referred to but not 'The Well of Loneliness' (Hall)?   The chapter on female genital mutilation (FGM) is an appalling indictment on the behaviour of some societies. Nussbaum has a glancing reference to circumcision; not surpringly it is glancing for someone who was converted (so I read) to Judaism. While I would never compare what happens to baby boys with what happens to young women in severity or risk, nevertheless I think the motivations for both practices come from the same source. If, for cultural (religious) reasons it is appropriate for Jewish boys to be circumcised, I think it is a very dangerous position to take to expect other societies to abandon the practices they see as legitimate, if not mandatory.   The chapter on Equity and Mercy impressed me immensely - it is so balanced I expect many feminists will hate it. But for me, her rare use of a Christian quote ('Forgive them, for they know not what they do.') was a revelation. Never before had I seen how compromised that plea is. (Compare with Tolstoy: 'It is a wonderful thing to be loved because of oneself, but it is a far more wonderful thing to be loved in spite of oneself.')   The fact that often I have other feelings than Nussbaum expresses does not concern me, because she often has perspectives that broaden or hone my own thoughts. In the chapter on prostitution and its illegality I had to agree with most of what she writes simply from a libertarian point of view rather than one of morality. The morality issues are complex - perhaps irresolvably complex. Just as there are men with 'dangerous' sexuality, so there are women. Perhaps it's only an issue for men because they demand or expect control. For me, all of Nussbaum's discussions seem to centre on the effects on women that prostitution entails - this is not inappopriate even though it may not be balanced. The problem I see with prostitution is that it panders to the man's 'need' to have sex. They can get it on demand. This reduces their sensitivities to the needs of the women in their lives, including the need (wise or not) for a woman to have a faithful partner. In Australia we had an advisor on women's affairs to the Federal Government write a piece in a newspaper where she expressed the view - based on her own practice - that a woman should always make sure her husband knew where the red light district was in a city they were visiting, so he could satisfy his 'need' when she herself felt incapable. For me this is an appalling suggestion - as if men cannot have self-control and should not be expected to. But, for all of that, like Nussbaum I would not see prostitution as worthy of being made illegal.  For me this was a thought-provoking read. It had some incredibly ugly things to describe, to consider. But it helped me to structure my thoughts in this difficult area - perhaps it will help me guide my boys as they reach maturity.   Other recommendations:  'Springtime Awakening' - Wedekind  'The Well of Loneliness' - Radclyffe Hall (I hated the outcome of this)  'Matilda' - Mary Shelley (her biographical details are worth exploring too)  'Godwin on Wollstonecraft' - William Godwin (Mary Shelley's father; Mary Wollstonecraft was her mother)  'Upheavals to Thought' - Nussbaum  'Living my Life' - Emma Goldman  'Let Me Alone' - Anna Kavan  'Conditions of Love' - John Armstrong 
 I love watching the episodes without commercials. This show is the best! 
 I recieved a couple of these while in college as a gift and have been using them ever since.  Up until now I have aways had a hard time finding them.  I have been usinghte same two for years now and I gotta tell you, washclothes come and go but these still look almost new after all these years.  I am  so glad I can stock up on these!!  Buy them, you will ove them.  I have ultra sensitive skin and these washclothes are outstanding for exfoliating 
 I've applied most of these techniques and they work.   I'm happy to have received this book as a Christmas gift.  I have my personal organzation area in order, menu planning down and am ready to tackle the laundry situation.  To Alison who must not realize that there ARE women who want to serve their families and the Lord.  This book is particularly geared toward women who want to accomplish those goals and is a great organzational guide for anyone, I've found, even those who aren't much interested in serving others.   It is hard to believe you didn't come away with anything positive to help you get organized.  You must have missed chapter 11 which goes over delegating chores and skills for indendence with children, which does not support your opinion that "the head female in the household does absolutely everything".   Perhaps this was merely a sounding board for your disdain for women who enjoy being the heart of a home.  Hope you find your own path and may you find many blessings along the way.   
 This book was well conceived and well written. This book aggregates stories, anecdotes and research summaries that are relevant to the world of investing, management and decision making in general. This is the best business book I have read so far in 2006 (of 20 total) 
 In the wake of reading ORCHID FEVER, I looked for other books that dealt with the plant hunters -- particularly of the 19th century. What I found was this wonderful book that is even broader in scope, providing a fast  paced review of highlights in mankind's never ending task of collecting,  naming and growing plants. The author does not try to present only  sensationalized material, and doesn't try to be "complete," but  instead gives a wonderful and highly readable overview of the field. Highly  recommended 
 Once again, Sybex has come through with a great resource for CCNP studies.  I have trained hundreds of students in pursuit of their CCNP certification with this book.    As the IT Mentor CCNP Boot Camp instructor, I selected this book library years ago as my primary resource for the class.  My students find the books easy to read and full of usefull information.  The labs are very good, and overall, the book is great.  Once again, my only problem with Sybex is that their books have a large amount of typos and errors in the first few editions 
 I read a lot about nutrition.  Before I read this book, I smugly thought I knew my way around a grocery store.  "What to Eat" confirmed many of the things I already know, but it also provided an amazing amount of new information.  Marion Nestle's writing style is funny and down-to-earth.  I couldn't stop reading.  As I started each new chapter (cleverly organized like a trip through a supermarket), I found myself getting excited to learn about each new topic ("oh boy, milk!").  I love that Marion always shares her own opinions and how she personally shops for each item.  I learned so much about nutrition and food marketing from this book.  I am able to use this information every time I go to the grocery store.  I feel so much more comfortable about my food choices and understand the marketing hype that I see all around me.  Wonderful book 
 -In a Puritan town where religion is the number one priority and women are confined to being just housewives a religious woman that has conversations with God finds the love of her life in a worker at the village called Jan. The two soon marry and fall madly in love with each other but tragedy strikes as Jan gets badly injured in an accident at work that leaves him paralyzed from the neck down. This may spell doom for any other relationship but Bess really loves her man and is determined to stay with him forever but an unusual request from Jan complicates things as he ask her to do something that requires her to give the ultimate sacrifice  -Now unless you have a heart made of ice and bitterness then I think you'll either be in tears or in deep depression after watching this movie. It's just so sad what happens in the movie as we see the character Bess do things she doesn't want to do in order to make the love of her life happy. The movie's slow pace helps greatly with the 180 turn that it pulls on the audience half way through the movie. At first glance the movie seems like a heartbreaking romantic story of a woman that loves her husband even though he's crippled from the neck down but then slowly turns from that to a dark tragic story of a woman going to the extremes to make him happy.  -I guess the super cool thing to do in order to prove how knowledgeable I am in movies will be to say how I've been a fan of director Lars von Trier and he's one of my favorites but the truth is before this movie I never knew the man existed and honestly despite my love for this amazing movie I haven't really seen anything that he's done after or before this film. But I will try to someday so I can join his fan club and seem important and clever like the people who pretend to like filmmakers no one's heard of just to be cool. Emily Watson plays the schizophrenic Bess who gives an Oscar worthy performance here. Her character isn't exactly stupid in the traditional sense but she is more loyal than anything which in the end makes her do things that even she knows to be wrong. I know people will criticize it for not being realistic but there really are women like that in the world that will do anything for love. Stellan Skarsgard whose one of our overlooked actors plays her husband Jan who is pretty hard to figure out at times. We don't know whether she shares Bess' intense passionate love or whether he's just a horny man that's having fun with a local girl.   -This is one of those movies that I love but won't dare recommend to anyone due to how depressing it is but if you're dead on the inside and have no emotion what so ever then it maybe a great idea to check it out 
 I received this item as a gift and *loved* it. The pictures and layout are beautiful. However, I would like there to have been more content around the items. 
 The brilliant author/writer/wordmaster Pat Conroy has always been my favorite all-time author.  I love his style, his way with words, his storylines, dialogue, description, and masterful similes.  Another Conroy fan once e-mailed me, asking if I knew anyone else who wrote as well as Conroy.  Well, I did a search and asked some of Amazon's top reviewers and they admitted they couldn't find anyone comparable in style, etc.  Well, now I have found Jodi Picoult and I think she's in the same league with Conroy.  Her style is decidedly different, but just as brilliant. MY SISTER'S KEEPER is a real page-turner and frighteningly thought-provoking.   For details of why this book is so great, please read Eileen Rieback's great review posted here.  She hits the high-points of the book much better than I ever could; all I know is that in author Jodi Picoult I have FINALLY found the PERFECT BOOK, comparable in brilliance to Pat Conroy.  I especially admired pages 308 through 322 where one of the Fitzgerald teen-agers enjoys her first boyfriend, her first "prom."  Picoult certainly understands teen-age angst.  If this chapter doesn't move you from the heights of joy to utmost sadness, nothing will.    Even in the midst of a long-awaited vacation I found my eyes glued to the pages of this book, abandoning many of the recreational plans I had made ... even abandoning work on my fourth and fifth novels.  Even as much as I hated for Picoult's amazing story to end, and the Fitzgeralds' family trauma to be resolved, I'm pleased to get back to my own writing ... and my personal vacation pursuits.  I have many author friends who have come out with potential best-sellers recently, but this book is undoubtedly the very best I have read since Pat Conroy's BEACH MUSIC.  It's a sure-fire winner with believable characters in a very timely, controversial situation that has been well-researched by Picoult, brilliantly and powerfully written.   The NEW YORK TIMES wrote following her debut novel, SONGS OF THE HUMPBACK WHALE (twelve books ago): "Picoult spreads her wings and catches an updraft."  To that I add: With this novel (her thirteenth) she now soars with the eagles. ... On second thought, make that angels!  WOW!  Wish I could write like her ... which is the same thing I've always said about Pat Conroy.  Now I have two favorites to aspire to.    Next I plan to read another of Picoult's books, THE TENTH CIRCLE, but NOT on THIS vacation. 
 Upon opening this book, and seeing my grandfather's name in the opening line, I knew it would be an interesting read. He was descibed perfectly, even though some could say that is not a good thing. Anyways, great job 
 Without duplicating the book description, I'll just explain why I would recommend this book to anyone interested in conservation.  Although the creation of Guanacaste Conservation Area -- which combines pre-existing national parks and added land between and around them, along with a marine sector -- is unique in representing the world's only large-scale tropical forest restoration project, the story illustrates elements common to nature conservation projects in general.  These include the importance of understanding the local ecology (in this case, especially forest succession and the necessity of controlling fires); political aspects, both local and national (Costa Rican president, parks service, etc.); how money is raised and land purchased or otherwise secured; and ways of involving people from the local area in conservation and the importance of that.  I have just returned from Guanacaste and was impressed by the program that trains local people as "parataxonomists" to help with the huge task of identifying and cataloguing the area's many species.  Another program gives instruction on natural history to children in local schools.  The result has been an important cultural shift toward appreciating nature and the many benefits it provides.    The writing is sometimes long-winded and ponderous, but the careful recounting of details was worthwhile, and the integration of interesting snippets of tropical biology and anectodes of the people involved made it an enjoyable read.  Of particular interest as well was the recounting of the reaction to the revolutionary suggestion that tropical forest can indeed be restored on land taken out of agriculture, an assertion that initially met with skepticism and alarm from conservation organizations, as it conflicted with the conservation message that a tropical forest, once cut down, can "never" regenerate.   In this end, this is a great and stirring conservation success story.  The book illustrates how much hard work that entailed on the part of many dedicated people 
 There is so much postitve press for Johnny these days, that I wrote it off as hype.  I was so wrong!  Fans of rock, blues, folk, gospel, country, and maybe even heavy metal will all find at least one song on this release that will take their breath away and make the disc worth purchasing.  The song selection is inspired, and the Heartbreakers provide respectful backup to Johnny's time-worn vocals.  Notice I said "respectful", not respectable.  The musicianship is stellar.  The band shuffles, ambles or swaggers as the song demands.  For me, the song "The Mercy Seat" is worth the cost of the cd all by itself.  The lyrics are chilling poetry, the music is incredible and Johnny's interpretation of the song conveys deep emotional impact.  The same goes for "I See A Darkness" and "One".  I never quite understood what the song "One" was all about.  When Johnny sings the lyrics, I understand.  That's what makes Johnny and this cd so special:  with each and every track, you will connect with what he's talking about.  He makes every song REAL.  "That Lucky Old Sun" sums up the sorrows of a family man, while "Nobody" is a tongue-in-cheek ballad about the pains of someone who has no one to love.  Yet Johnny as narrator is equally convincing on both tracks.  I really appreciate the dark and depressing passages throughout this cd, and the moments of happiness and hope shine through like sunlight through dark clouds.  I highly recommend this and every other Rick Rubin produced Johnny Cash cd 
 Oh God, as a graduate of UAG I should say that this movies is nothing like the movie but I can't lie. The Madera's own the med. school.. the Leano's own the med. school. The Dean does not care about students.... Dean Villalobos and Martinez Sandoval dont care about the students. The infrastructure is a bit outdated.... you guessed it!! UAG's buildings are as old as Fenway without any upgrades.  Oh yeah, the pride and joy of the institution is the infamous PMC program:  "Programa Medicina en Comunidad", just like in the film!!!!   It is a riot! If you plan to go to UAG you must watch this film. If you get a hold of it, bring it down to Guadalajara so you can laugh. 
 This is one of the most viscerally exciting political / philosophical books in history.  You can't help but be swept up by the force of Vaneigem's appeals... and though one may not assent to all of his positions or specific interpretations, all in all you will have to say that he had managed to tap into something very true.    read it, ponder it... and get out and live.  you have nothing to lose but your boredom 
 Library Journal Kaminsky, an award-winning writer of numerous articles for Field & Stream, Food & Wine, and Outdoor Life magazines and currently a columnist for the New York Times, is a lifelong lover of ham; this is his culinary search for the best pork. He travels from Kentucky to Madrid to Brooklyn, NY, regaling readers with stories and mouth-watering recipes (e.g., Porchetta, Burgundy Style). Meanwhile, Kaminsky reveals a disquieting fact: the industry has changed processing procedures to market large quantities-the end result of which has only compromised flavor and our health. Kaminsky's passion and love of pork is reminiscent of Peter Mayle's fervor for food and the south of France (see A Year in Provence). For those who enjoy food literature and cooking, this work is an ideal escape; it will inspire creativity in your kitchen, as well as have you embarking on your own pork adventure! For all collections.-Jennifer A. Wickes, [...], Pine Beach, NJ Copyright 2005 Reed Business Information.  
 As a first year law student, I found this book to be a valuable companion to class lectures and other homework assignments, providing clarification, elaboration and insight into this complex and rich subject.  If you have not yet had the privilege of adding this to your library, I especially  recommend it at this critical period for many -- a few weeks before final  examinations 
 Brief and objective way to keep updated in general clinics. It is probably one of the best ways to keep updated, when working specificaly in a defined field. As an otolaryngologist, it is always a good source of information in other fields. The chapter of AIDS and HIV, gets longer every year. The first time I read it, it was in 1983 with few pages related to it, and now the chapter has pages and pages, enough for a non AIDS/HIV specialist (I hope!) 
 "Ashanti to Zulu" presents 26 African tribes, from A to Z, and lets children learn something about the culture and customs of each one.  Aside from being a learning experience, the book is visually eye-popping; the illustrations are so gorgeous you'll want to blow them up and frame them.  The book won a well-deserved Caldecott Medal for the best illustrated children's book of 1977.  It's a great book for helping children to learn about some of the peoples of our least-known populated continent, and the pictures will hold the kids mesmerized.  It's a volume that belongs on every youngsters bookshelf 
 Given the book's content and title, I was expecting something off-the-wall!  But nothing could be further than the truth.  The author has serious academic qualifications, and the press is associated with the United Church of Christ.  The idea that Jesus could be involved in a homoerotic relationship is startling, to put it mildly, but the book makes an excellent case.  Even if one doesn't fully accept the book's conclusions, there's a lot of thought-provoking textual analysis, especially on Jesus's attitude toward the Law, and to so-called "family values" issues (I suspect He would be quite dismayed to see how the Religious Right has hijacked debate in this area) 
 "Valley of the Dolls" is pure fun. It's got great characters--from the small town girl trying to make it in the big city to the actress who needs to feel real to the singer who wants it all. Reading this, I was reminded of today's soap operas and also other novels of this genre. It was, for me, a fun read, though sometimes a little dark. It's an older book but I think it's withstood the test of time. I definitely recommned it, along with "Take Your Shirt Off" or anything by Jackie Collins.  
 The stories that are photographed, not fully videoed are a style called "iconographic".  It allows the child to enjoy the story and the illustrations.  Of course it would be far, far, better if the parent would actually sit down with the child and READ the book. But for those who use videos, at least this is exposing the child to some quality literature--and the story quality is far far better than most of the fully animated junk out there 
 I think Rinker Buck has captured in this story all the joy and passion of an adventurous youth's desires. It resonated with me in ways that are deep and emotional.   Good job, well worth the read. 
 Mark Bittman cooks like a lot of us do. We start with a recipe and then change this, add a bit more of that, and we come up with favorites that suit our tastes and those of our family. This is probably offensive to some food purists that insist a recipe should be followed exactly, with exactly the same ingredients. If you are the purist type, this is not the book for you. Otherwise:   Here are more than a thousand recipies, ideas where you will start your own cooking. I first turned to Polenta (we southerners call them grits, the Romanians call them mamaliga) and there are four different recipies. Some of these I've seen before but never tried. His explanation is so simple that this weekend I have to try it. There's a southerner coming over to diner. (I wonder what his wife, a Montana girl will think.) The four recipies take up just over a page in the book. There are no pretty pictures, just recipies.   That's the strengths of this book. I don't need the pretty pictures. I want new ideas of things that look like I'd want to cook them and that my friends would want to eat.   Ummm! The book just fell open to a recipie on how to make your own ginger ale, and his comment, 'incredible with run.' Should I do that this weekend, or perhaps wait until the weather gets hot 
 This is a great CD.  It collects the best of the series' scores, especially Cathy's Story, The Main Title, and the Generation to Generation tracks.  It is a great collection and is very good for  afan to have.   Definitely buy 
 If you're a fan of Steven Seagal then you won't be disappointed. He always knows how to deal with the enemy and he'll do anything to reach his goal. It is too bad that Seagal doesn't use his Martial arts skills as much as he uses weapons most of the time. 
 This dvd is wonderful! I got it as a bday gift for my co-worker's 15yr old daughter and even as a complete beginner she was able to instantly catch on!!! I hear she's completely hooked on knitting and crochet now=)  I Can't Believe I'm Crocheting in Motion makes it sooo easy to learn how to crochet even if you've never touched a pair of needles in your life.. 
 There is nothing that can be said about this book that has not already been said, except that I laughed until my valve shut. I wish I could give it six stars. Or six hundred 
 I really enjoyed this book - it's the first book I've read in a long time that I couldn't put down.  I've read lots (and I mean lots!) of books about eating disorders and this was one of the most honest works I've read.  It's real, straight-forward and at times raw with honesty.  Nothing is held back here.  It depicts eating disorders for what they really are and does not glamorize them.  Ms. Arnold writes fluidly and and with meaning.  I found this book to be hopeful and inspiring and full of good insight.  Excellent read.  
 If  you're sufficiently interested in the Brooklyn Bridge to read something book-sized about it, let it be this book.  By the same token, no single book and necessarily suit everybody's needs which explains why some people below complain that there is too much social history, too much engineering detail, or even not enough engineering detail.  Heck, if you want to dig deeper onto any aspect of this book there is a fine bibliography in the back of it, and an amazing amount of the historical materials cited in it can be found on the Web if you know how to search for it.  One other suggestion: treat yourself and buy the Dover picture book "A Picture History of the Brooklyn Bridge" as a companion to this one.  Even though the selection of photos in the McCullough book is more or less generous, the broader coverage of the Dover book helps you better visualize more of what is in the book

 To those who approach "classics" with trepidation, I heartly recommend House of the Seven Gables. Not only the characters but the very house come alive, in all their splendor and in all their shortcomings.   Cousin Hepzibah Pynchon stands as one of the most pitiful but admirable characters of fiction. The befuddled Clifford, the mysterious Holgrave, and the sweet Phoebe come alive to the reader. Even the house itself has a life and a spirit.   Come home to the House of the Seven Gables 
 For someone like me, a programmer interested in creating better user interfaces, this is a really good book. I have no formal training in creating better visual displays, and this book has helped me understand decent graph layout. I've read the Tufte books, and while I really like them, they are often more qualitative than quantitative (no pun intended) in their descriptions. This book spells out how to make a good table based on the type of data, the number of fields being used, the relationship of the fields, etc. It's very hands on and very usable. My one complaint is I think he strays too far in to the cognitive aspect of how we see and understand data than he needs to given the focus of this book 
 I came to Gustave Flaubert cold. I did not know what to expect, who he was, what his books were about; when I picked up Madame Bovary I would have been hard pressed to put him into the correct century. For a time I was frustrated because I kept searching for 'Gaston Flaubert' on Amazon, so little did I know. I was, after all, lured to him by the indirect references that other authors had made concerning his works. Oscar Wilde in particular made a few (vague) referrals to him in 'The Critic as Artist'.  So I bought this book, skipping the introduction and plowing through the novel. Upon finishing my first thoughts were along the lines of, "I just read a book about a bored country doctor's wife who spends all her efforts in pursuing pleasure, finding nothing but emptiness in it." I don't mean to give away the whole plot...but really, that's it in a nutshell.  Wait. There's more.  This is my thought now: "Wow, so THAT was his intention, eh? He achieved it marvelously! His work ethic was really like that? He strove so hard to find the right word that sometimes he would only do 5 pages in three weeks? Really? My goodness, I should re-examine the passages in the book. Wow...in this light they're really good...I should just..."  And it goes on and on.  I had to get to these thoughts somehow, right? Did I go online and search through Wikipedia for research on the author? Did I take a class on Flaubert? Who was this mysterious teacher that instructed me in the beginnings of this French novelist?  It was none other than this edition. Not only does Bantam include the novel but it also has dropped in essays on it by some very prominent folks. By reading through these after finishing the novel, the true magnitude of it starts to come to the forefront; it's not simply about a country doctor and his wife, it's something much more, something sublime. The thing that Flaubert created starts to become clear, like an image that fades into view from the other side of smoked glass.  Following along this train of thought, even with such a simple subject (as even the author admits in the supplemental sections) there are some pretty profound, beautiful statements that can be garnered from it. Take this one: "Human speech is a cracked cauldron on which we knock out tunes for dancing bears, when we wish to conjure pity from the stars." Take something that is so subliminally supreme and scatter it throughout the book and you have yourself a grand novel that needs to be studied intently.  This might not be for everyone, I admit that too. If you are not into literature; if you are not into the creation process that writers go through, the aesthetic quality aside from the subject matter itself that some people strive to achieve; if you are not a person who can allow themselves to empathize with a character, no matter how depraved that character gets...you will not like this book. If, however, you ARE interested in the process of writing, or writers, you will want to pick up this terrific little book and study it intently for the secrets that it will expose to you.  Bottom line: Simply put, you cannot have a serious literary collection if you do not possess this book. This edition contains a plethora of supplemental material that makes it worth well more than its price.  -LP 
 Dan Price's philosophy and perspective on people he meets are entertaining and thought-provoking. I enjoy reading his books and weblog immensely 
 This book will give you permission and practical support to be the best teacher you can be, even if that is completely different from the teacher down the hall...  I used this book over the summer like an instruction manual to build a course, and I have already been very pleased with the results I see in my classroom! Fried shows you how to think about what you are teaching and why you want to teach it, working step by step, and building up slowly from a solid theoretical foundation.   This is a hopeful book, full of excitement about the possibilities of teaching and based on the idea that you can design your courses so that students will rise to the challenge and perform at their best.  I have not read a better book written for teachers about teaching. I wish I had read this before my first year, so I could have applied the method right from the start 
 In the five years since the U.S. invaded Afghanistan, the most disappointing thing second to not capturing Bin Laden, is the lack of tangible progress in developing infrastructure. Former CIA operator Gary Berntsen appears to be well qualified to comment on the problems associated with the failure to achieve objectives.  Having spent a year in Afghanistan myself, there are numerous points that I agree with Mr. Berntsen as most salient.   *	"He (Afghan) said, `This is common for America. You make promises and abandon us. You ask for our commitment to fight an enemy that wants to kill our children and then you walk away. I will never understand your country." P. 62 *	"In resisting the Soviets, the Afghans had suffered as many as two million casualties, more than five million displaced citizens and so much political and social disintegration that the viability of their country had been threatened. After the Soviets retreated in '99 we had abandoned Afghanistan to the same brutal sectarian violence that led the Soviets to invade it in the first place." P. 126  The U.S. policy for after invasion action is where the problem lies. Today's world war-fighting has the parameters of low-intensity conflict and law enforcement. The U.S., while excellent in technological devastation, is slow and ambivalent about nation building. That means we don't do infrastructure, peacekeeping, and ...nation building. Essentially, we haven't done anything to provide security for the Afghans, and they have noticed it!  Jawbreaker is a good book about the day-to-day affairs of those people tasked with being on-scene in some of the most dangerous places on earth. It may be most appreciated by men and women who have actually served in Afghanistan, but that would be expected.  Regardless of who gets the most from reading the entire book, everyone should take heed of Mr. Berntsen's conclusions:  "If we want the values we believe in to prevail and our country to survive, we simply have to do a better job of defending ourselves."  *	"We must have people in every corner of the globe listening, observing, making friends and educating other people about our society, warts and all." *	"We need trained experts who speak the languages and show sensitivity to native cultures." *	..."we should promote student, cultural and scientific exchanges and cooperation between ourselves and other societies on every level possible." P 312  Mr. Berntsen uses a quote from Michael O'Hanlan's article in Foreign Affairs ..."'It [the Afghan war] may wind up being more notable in the annals of American military history than anything since Douglas MacArthur's invasion at Inchon in Korea half a century ago."  Mr. Bernrsen attributes several important factors to its success:   *	Intelligence-Driven Warfare *	The Partnership with the Northern Alliance *	Technology *	The Ability of Team Leaders to Make Quick Decisions on the Ground *	The Muslim Americans on Our Team *	Leadership  Unfortunately, what worked to give us the initial success in the Afghan war quickly fizzled out due to poor leadership, the lack of an appropriate plan, and failure to act in a timely fashion. As the book cogently concludes; "Terrorism won't be stopped by intelligence collection and military force alone. Compassion in trying to feed the world's hungry, heal its sick and support peoples' search for freedom and dignity must remain at the core of our international goals." 
 I found this book to be an excellent introduction to J2ME wireless development.  The author's clear and consise writing style gets the reader up to speed almost immediately with a minimal degree of effort.  The fine examples and graphical illustrations couples nicely with the text.  I especially found the chapter on Internationalization particularly useful.  This is a good book for the beginning wireless developer 
 I have two of Sonia's books. If she writes another, I will buy that one also. She is amazing and down to earth. This book is very intelligently, yet simply written. She speaks to the heart of the intuitive spirit within all of us. She writes of various guides and angels that can help us along lifes travels. She speaks a simple truth, yet one that we must open our hearts, minds, and spirits to, in order to receive. Way to go Sonia, keep them coming 
   my daughters love the little people farm and any else having to do with fisher price. I played with fisher price when I was little, I know they're quality toys you can trust 
 After getting and reading Primary Target as a gift, I immediately began picking up other Joe Weber books.  Defcon One, his first, was absolutely terrific.  Great plot line and characters.  The action is continuous throughout.  My suggestion is not to pick up this book to read up before going to bed because you'll never put it down.  Looking forward to reading his next - Shadow Flight.  My hat's off to Joe Weber.  Keep up the great work 
 Comprehensive and for the most part unbaised.  The author seems to lean toward a "no-frills" type lifestyle, but she makes no effort to Sell you on her preferences.  This book is absolutly packed with great information.  
 Long-time die-hard EWF fan. I have done their music live, there is no greater musical high.  This is a superbly produced DVD.  The arrangements take EWF to the highest levels yet. Musicanship (although not all-original band) is awesome.  Sound and video technology is near perfect.  If all my favorite bands did this quality of DVD production, I would never get anything done 
 I've read all of this author's books and was a little worried that this one, being the last in the series, might be a little "ho-hum." Far from it!  As usual, Jan Karon has dug deep and produced another set of memorable characters (and animals) that will long live in my memory.  She never ceases to inspire and after I finished this novel, I was left with the same sense of satisfaction and warm heart that I had after reading all of her other books. I don't know what kind of writing adventure Jan Karon is taking her readers on next, but, whatever it is, I'm there 
 This CD is filled with wonderful, slow, relaxing jazz.  The kind of music you listen to on a late evening, with someone you care for or in a mood to care for yourself.  Miles, Monk & Co. were at the top of their creative energies when this was made.  Their music is magical, on the level that mere mortal instrument players rarely achieve -- but then, these were no mere mortals.  This music ranks among the best and most formative of all modern jazz, but here's a nice thing:  it's so lovely and mellow that your non- jazz lover friends will easily love it also.  I saw a gripe here on Amazon that the disc is "only" 27 minutes.  Come on!  The Beatles' Abbey Road, a milestone of a brilliant album, was 28 minutes long.  Yes, this wonderful music is mellow and relaxing, but by no means in the universe is it "elevator" music.  This is the real thing, so deep and warm it'll wash through you and soothe your soul, and be so rewarding that you can palay it over and over and still find new things to enjoy.  This is great music, by musicians who stand on the pinnacle of all-time, brilliant and unequaled great jazz musicians.  And it's nice, relaxing music to boot.  You can't go wrong.  
 A great book on the power of lifetime friendships.  While the focus of the book was Williams, it was great learn more about Dom Dimaggio, who lived in the shadow of his brother and Williams.  
 I only read The Tenant of Wildfell Hall because i was a fan of her two sisters. i didn't expect it to be a great work of art and i was surpirsed to find an exceptional tale. It does contain faults. For one the narrative is told a little clumbsily through letters and diaries and there are also perhaps mistakes in characterisation, but at the core is a heartfelt tale of a woman who falls in love with a man whom she marries, but we slowly watch his decline into a drunken, selfish slob, who not only breaks Helen's heart but the reader's too. Readers who dislike the character of Mr Huntington from the start will probably not much like the rest of the book, because they can see what a mistake she is making, but i, like Helen, made the foolish and naive error of believing that she can change him for the better. It's certainly worth reading if you are a Bronte fan and is perhaps a slightly forgotten masterpiece of Victorian literacy, shadowed by family connections 
 I also ordered thinking I was getting 'volume 1' as it was not specified in the listing. Amazon definetly needs to clarify the situation in multi-volume sets 
 Perhaps one of the best parts about this book is that you don't feel like you're reading a cleaning manual. Paula intermixes stories, both personal and not, throughout the book, so it's completely possible to read it cover to cover and not feel like you've been "learning" - but, of course, you have! My favorite chapter is "Let there be light." It is amazing how by doing a few simple things, such as changing your lightbulb wattage, can make a HUGE difference 
 Ford's short stories are weighty, without being dull.  This weightiness does not derive from any complexity in concept or even character, nor does it derive from prose which is complex.  Rather, there is a wealth of detail in terms of what the characters are experiencing.  The common subject in this collection is marital infidelity 
 Absolutely no difference between these and Uggs...except the price!!  Great quality 
 I saw them live a few years ago, and was captivated by their group chemistry and technical precision. One of my favorite modern classical groups. 
 This is my first set of tarot cards i have bought.  I found the instructions very esay to under stand .  The scenes on them are wonderful. I would recomend this book to any one who wants to learn about the tarot 
 This book is a fountain of fun and information and is an excellent introduction to the Dan Brown book coming soon I hop 
 Excellent service! The book arrived within five days of placing the order, and I was totally blown away when it arrived, considering the fact that it was a text book that I needed to have in a timely manner. Thanks again Amazon! I'm now hooked more than ever, and I'm telling my friends about the wonderful shopping experience 
 These four singers are handsome, talented, and sing the songs so beautifully, it's overwhelming.  They combine their classical voices, the exception is Sebastien who is a pop singer, into   popular arrangements of well known songs such as My Way, Unchained Melody, I Believe In You sung with Celine Dion. Since they represent 4 countries, the ablums contain songs in Spanish, French, Italian and English. They have 2 albums out with some variation of the songs in those recorded in the UK. There is also a DVD with Simon explaining how he discovered them, plus a very engaging interview with the 4 of them. Be sure to get the USA version, the UK can only be played on a computer. If you like Josh Groban, you'll LOVE Il DIVO ! They're currently Number 1 on the charts in the USA 
 Alta has a very original and well-detailed setting, which provides half the pleasure of reading it, if you are a person who likes to know about food, clothing, and details of daily life. Not to give the impression that Alta is no more than description of life in Lackey's pseudo-Egypt, but Alta does really transport the reader.  The plot twists in this second volume where Vetch/Kiron arrives in his native land to try to help Alta win the war against Tia were very unexpected, and kept the interest and action rolling along. Some middle books feel tired, or like they are only there to accomplish the work and developments that need to take place before the conclusion. Not Alta--it felt as fresh as the first book in this series, Joust. Where the book suffers, in my opinion, is the characterization. In her many Valdemar books, Lackey always created distinct and three-dimensional characters. In this series, the only truly complex character was Ari, Kiron's mentor, and he hardly appeared in Alta. Kiron is the innocent little boy who is taking on a Grand Destiny, but isn't much of a character now that he has escaped from being Downtrodden. The girl, Aket-ten, was a typical fiery and talented princess-figure--slightly annoying, to say the least. So it's good that Alta has such an interesting plot. Highly recommended as a good solid dose of fantasy entertainment 
 My copy of this book is chewed, back broken, torn, taped, worn out by the use of my own children and years of my students in my Primary classrooms. I recall reading this with my younger brother and that was just forever ago. Some books just stand the test of time and this is one of those. As a teacher I know very young children like to categorize, inspect, look for something(well what else explains I SPY books?)and ferret out details. Scarry definitely "got that". I've seen children slip inside these pages and be entertained and cataloging for really long periods of time.Not that I'm suggesting it for that reason ALONE. My daughter Sylvia was definitely one of those kinds of children and she always searched for Bananas Gorilla. I had several videos that were made of the Richard Scarry world (get them) and at a very young age-two to three- she loved those in combination with the books. My son much later was similarly enthralled and now I use this material when the Standards hocker's aren't looking teaching my 1st grade with students who have ELD needs-second language development. This particular book I really like because the early years social studies curriculum is "community" based and this attends to those understandings so well. I recommend this as a teacher to families, and with parent interaction and co-exploring it's a very fun afternoon activity 
 Two years ago, Lucie Montgomery had her foot maimed in a car accident.  She fled from her Virginia home to spend time in France recovering.  Forced to use a cane to help her walk and still overseas she has shown no indication to return to her family's winery.  Her time in Europe ends when her brother Eli informs Lucie that their father Leland was killed in a hunting accident.  She comes home to the Montgomery Estate Vineyard for her dad's funeral, but is stunned as the once proud five hundred acres has been neglected since she left.  Lucie soon learns why as Leland let the winery go to ruin while he invested in questionable schemes that wiped out the family fortune.  Eli and their sister Mia want to sell the winery as they prefer the money to continue with their upper class lifestyle.  As stunning as her siblings wanting to sell their heritage, Lucie is further shocked when Mia flaunts her affair with Greg, her sister's former lover and the person responsible for her mutilated foot.  Meanwhile Lucie's godfather Fitz Pico warns her that Leland was murdered and anyone else opposed to the sale will probably die too; he leaves her with a key to a box that may hold a fabulous diamond necklace.  The next day Fitz is found dead.  Lucie believes the killer struck again and plans to uncover the culprit before she joins the murderer's row.  MERLOT MURDERS is a fabulous first Wine Country Mystery that uses a wonderful backdrop to the amateur sleuth investigation.  Lucie is a delightful protagonist struggling with her father's death as much as his allowing their estate to become dilapidated.  Her siblings make matters worse with their avarice.  Fans will enjoy toasting newcomer Ellen Crosby to the sub-genre and think twice while sipping a glass of Merlot.  Harriet Klausner 
 Tom Wolfe is praised as a brilliant social novelist and I don't read enough of that type of novel to comment on the success of A Man in Full.  I have read Bonfire of the Vanities and now this book, and I found them both to be quite enjoyable.  A Man in Full is similar to Bonfire with sprawling chapters full of thoughts and descriptions of the main characters.  This book is set in Atlanta, where Charlie Croker is an aging real estate developer and former football star.  Croker's financial empire is on the verge of collapse and his personal life isn't going to well either.  As with Bonfire, Wolfe writes about the polically connected, race politics and the very wealthy.  Charlie Croker and friends judge others based on the amount of money they have and the material possessions they own.  Using this criteria to judge others is obviously foolish to all except the most materialistic.  Except for Conrad Hensley, the Croker employee arrested for assault, the poorest main character is a banker named Peepgas who has a Harvard MBA and makes $120,000 a year.  Needless to say, the social arena Wolfe writes about is above that of most readers.  That doesn't mean the book isn't entertaining.  I enjoyed all of the characters and their interaction.    When an all-American African American football player at Georgia Tech is suspected of rape, racial tension threatens to destroy Atlanta.  Croker is about to lose all his possessions to his creditors and his sexy wife half his age isn't too thrilled about it.  Roger White is the black lawyer called on by the black mayor to see if he can get the crusty old Croker to speak out.  Conrad Hensley is the Croker employee who is fired then thrown in jail.  All the plots slowly converge.  This book isn't about action, its about characters.  I give this book 4 stars because it was a satisfying journey with some enjoyable characters.  I was frustrated a few times by how what was important in life was so obvious yet Charlie Croker never did quite get it.  His good ole boy attitude was amusing at times but amazingly ridiculous at others.  It was sometimes appalling how attached he was to appearances and his possessions.  About halfway through the book, I browsed some reviews on Amazon.  A few said they were terribly disappointed in an ending that felt tacked on and that there wasn't any resolution to the plot or to some of the characters.  I disagree.  The book ends by resolving the point that the entire book led up too.  We are given a few sentences about the fate of some of the other characters.  For Wolfe to write entire chapters about everyone else would have taken another 200 pages.  The ending is not disappointing and you won't be let down.  Every loose end might not get the attention you think it deserves, but I give Wolfe the benefit of the doubt and accept this as the story he wanted to tell.   
 Lilly is a 14 year old white girl in the south. Her mother was shot (unclear by who, but Lilly feels responsible) in infancy, and she has been raised by her mean, hateful father, who punishes her for any little infraction of his inflexible rules by forcing her to kneel for hours bare kneed on grits (among other tortures). Lilly's only friend is the African American housekeeper/babysitter, Rosaleen.  When Rosaleen decides she has to go to town to register to vote, she gets into an argument with a typical white cracker character--and she and Lily end up in jail. Lilly is bailed out by her father, but she escapes, and then breaks Rosaleen out of the hospital (she was beaten half to death by the police after Lilly was bailed out).  On the lam, Lilly decides to try and find out about her mother. She and Rosaleen end up in the home of a trio of Black sisters, who survive making the best honey in the county.   Of course, ultimately, their summer of freedom ends, and reality comes crashing back in, when Lilly is found by her father.  While the story is somewhat predictable, Kidd keeps the tension, moves the plot forward, and does a superb job of getting into the heads of all of the characters. While the racism of the time is clearly a subtext to the entire plot, it is (with a few obvious exceptions) the subtext, and not the foreground. This allows the reader to discover what racism feels like from the inside.  A very good read 
 *Spoilers*                                                                                                                       What I learned after viewing Monte Walsh  	I believe that the movie, Monte Walsh tells me to strive for my desires and dreams because in the movie, Monte continues doing his job as a cowboy even though he lost his close friends and he continues even with technology taking his job away. However, at one point he has second thought on whether he is doing the right thing to leave his passion for being a cowboy. 	 I saw this movie at my father's house on DVD on September 25th 2005. I never saw or knew that this was a TV special, so the first time I saw it was on DVD. At one point I never had an intention of seeing this movie until my father recommended it, so I decided to watch it. 	 In the movie, it shows Monte and his friends enjoying their jobs as cowboys. However, at a point he loses his closest friends Shorty and Chip. He lost Shorty because out of all the cowboys he had the least experience in the group, so he was fired. Chip, however, left because he wanted to have a better living, so he became a hardware shop owner. This reminds me of my passion for the Japanese language. I have lost many friends who have gone on to do much better things because they thought there wasn't much work that involve the language. They might be right, but I plan on staying on track and hope to use it in my career. 	 Technology had put a big burden on Monte's job. With automobiles making horse obsolete and trains doing the job of moving animals much faster; the need for cowboys was decreasing. Monte didn't even like fences being built because they prevented him from going places and he wanted to travel all over the country. Even with these advancements he still continued doing his job. This was Monte's biggest difficulty to overcome, but he made it over in the end. I have also had a difficulty in my life and it was my ability to socialize. This had been a problem for me since I was really young and I wasn't able to make many friends because of it. Recently, I have been getting more social and this difficulty is starting to disappear. 	 When Monte lost all his friends; he had second thoughts on whether to continue his job or not. He was considering marriage and even considered an alternative job. He was worried about this decision to change, so he talked with his fiancée, Martine and she told him that she would love him regardless of what job he had. After this conversation he decided that he would continue his job as a cowboy. I, too, have had second thoughts like when I was moving from my mother's house to my father's. I was constantly wondering "is this the right choice" and "will I be happier over there". In the end I made a good choice and I am glad I made the choice to live with my father.            I believe that many people have desires that they want to go after and once they watch this film they will want to go after those dreams. 
 an amazing movie! to begin, my thanks to my friend bugsy for turning me on to this, which i probably would not have watched on my own. adapted from the offenbach opera, there are so many startling images i will only single out three: the coil springs popping out of olympias severed head and dissolving into the canal of venice; the barefooted giulietta descending the statued steps portrayed as the heads of her victims; the desperate antonia running thru door after door only to continue entering the same room. beautifully danced, beautifully sung, i watched this two times in a row (second time with martin scorseses terrific commentary) and i KNOW i could watch this many more times and STILL find something new. great work by director michael powell and scenarist emerich pressburger, this has gone on my list of the 100 best ever. 
 if you're down with tha 916, you'll luv this album.  lunasicc brings heat on all of the tracks, and there's definately some classic sacramento bangers on here, so go out and cop this 
 I bought this album because of its cover and i never expected it to be a rock/angry/sad/badreligionesque album. Everything in here sounds so familiar youll swear youve heard it before, yet it will unravel in the most profound corners of your head that this recording is more beautiful that what you think you remember youve heard. Its great to hear alternative tracks that do not linger into unknown frontiers, and can be commercial at some point. I dont really like this kind of music, but i have not been able to put this record down 
 Shipler has compiled a great deal of first person accounts and analyzed them in such a way that the reader cannot deny the truthfulness and depth of the arguments. A must read for all 
 There are large and small crimes in the world.  Small crimes includes little white lies and petty theft.  Large crimes represent something much larger in the grand scheme of things.  For example, it is a very large crime that it took the New York Public Library's 2003 100 Children's Books Everyone Should Know for me to discover "Ben's Trumpet".  Have you seen this book?  This is a gorgeous piece of work, particularly striking in its publication date (1979) but not dated.  Not even a little.  Following Ben, a young man living in a Harlem-esque neighborhood, the story depicts the boy's obsession with playing the trumpet.  The plot is touching and has a happy ending that doesn't feel forced or tacked on.  It flows just as smoothly as the book itself.  Nice storylines aren't what push this book into greatness, however.  Look at the illustrations a minute.  Notice Isadora's use of line.  Her clever placement of black and white.  Look at the different drawing styles that emanate from the jazz musicians and their music.  Now compare this to Ben's home, a simplistic realistic series of pictures.  My favorite section comes after the trumpeter at the Zig Zag Jazz Club compliments Ben on his trumpet playing.  The next two pages show the trumpeter walking away, his body curved, swaying to some internal music.  On the opposite page there is a kaleidoscope of forms and images, possibly representing Ben's elation at the compliment.  Possibly just serving as gorgeous filler.  Please read this to your children.  Teach this to your children.  And give this book to everyone you know.  Do I gush?  I know I do.  But trust me, this book is worth it 
 Motor Mouth and Metro Girl are super - Evanovich does it again !  Her books are great reading !  Very entertaining 
 I bought these for my Sony digital camera and I am very pleased with them.  Exact fit into the camera and with great capacity, they simply seems to last forever, so running out of power is no longer an issue for me.  The sliding case is a nice touch for storing and transporting your batteries.  Highly recommended 
 This is the best single-volume account of the Thirty Years War (1618-1648). The war was very complex but Wedgwood provides singular clarity. Other interpretations are possible, but her vision is strong and memorable. The Machiavellian machinations are head-spinning, one has to read carefully, the reward is a solid understanding of not only 17th C dynastic politics but how Medieval politics operated  before the rise of the nation state.  Wedgwood is an old-fashioned historian like Gibbon, retelling the events in highly-readable prose, focused on the "great men". This can be problematic, the Thirty Years War was more than just the decisions made by a few elites - social, economic and other forces were at work. Her sources are almost all 19th century. There are no new insights on the war, it is a retelling of established views. As a political narrative it is not only a great work of history but also literature. 
 The best album he's done in my opinion, infact, he really began to get soft shortly after this 
 This John Le Carre adaptation is almost as good as Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, there's no legendary performances here but the screen play by Arthur Hopcraft and a strong cast make it a pleasurable viewing experience. The suspense and understanding the psychology of a spy builds through each episode and for such a slow paced film at times it really is surprising edge of the seat stuff. Just a quick note on Peter Egen, at first i had trouble not picturing him standing next to Richard Briers (Everdecreasing Circles) but once you get over this initial shock by the end you realise what good job he does for the part and that he is actually a rather splendid actor. 
 THIS BOOK PROVIDES EVIDENCE FOR WHAT MANY PEOPLE OVERSEAS THINK ABOUT OUR COUNTRY. MR. PERKINS PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF AMERICAN POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL MISDEEDS ON SEVERAL CONTINENTS. THE DETAILS ARE FASCINATING , IF SOMEWHAT UNSETTLING. I HOPE TO HEAR HIM SPEAK , SINCE I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS FOR HIM. I ADMIRE HIS WILLINGNESS TO ADMIT HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THESE EVENTS AND EVEN HIS OWN PERSONAL SHORTCOMINGS  
 Back in the 70's when we headed out to cruise the streets ofOklahoma City in the Z-28, the first thing we did was put in my copyof Dwight Twilley's "Sincerely" album in the 8-Track. Whenthat first song "I'm on Fire" came on, we were ready for thestreets. All those other Hot Rods had their ... blaring out of theirspeakers with their mindless rock and ... singing, while welistened to the perfect pop and great voice of the kid from Tulsa, andwe were proud of it. And the women loved it too. And that's all thatreally counted to us back then. Well, I bought the upgraded CD versionof "Sincerely" a couple years ago, and now I've got the restof Twilley's old stuff with this Greatest Hits CD. The first few songson here are from his first 3 albums that I had on vinyl. All great andmemorable tunes. But you get so much more here from a guy whose carrerhas quietly moved along without anybody ever taking notice of thisgreat lost talent. Songs like "Sky Blue", "10,000American Scuba Divers", "Girls", "I'm OnFire", or "Looking For The Magic" would easily make mytop 40 if I was a DJ spinning records. But in the real world thisartist was criminally overlooked. Even the song "That Thing YouDo", which Twilley recorded hoping it would make it in Tom Hanksmovie of the same name, was passed over for an inferior song. I guessthat's just par for the course for Dwight Twilley.  I highly recommendnot passing up this fine Greatest Hits CD. I think I'll head out andtry this Greatest Hits CD in the car stereo. Man, cruisin' never getsold when you have the fresh pop of Dwight Twilley ridin' with ya.  EN 
 You will not be disappointed as Juan Cabrillo and his crew aboard the Oregon once again take center stage in this, the 3rd book in the Oregon Files series.  This series has had my attention from the beginning as the idea of an entire crew of "heroes" headed by Cabrillo is a fresh new twist on Cussler's long history of sea-going adventures starring either Dirk Pitt or Kurt Austin.  This series allows the Cussler enthusiast yet another new book to look forward to on a regular basis.  Long live Juan Cabrillo and the Oregon!!! 
 This semi-fictional story is set in a brief 6 month (or so)period in 1916 in which the British Army began to assume the major contribution to the Allied effort.  By this time of WW1 the French had been somewhat degraded and pretty exhausted by the combined efforts of Verdun and the Somme.  The story is set on the Somme front after the opening phases of the battle and includes the description of a long recovery period behind the lines to refit-a luxury denied many German units.  The story reflects to some degree the British class system , and many of the soldiers themselves seem somewhat bewildered about the nature of war confronting them.  The Germans themselves are shown as remote and treated somewhat indifferently.  Despite the possibility of death each soldier seems distracted with obtaining alcohol, women and decent food in that order.  The 1 difficult aspect of the book is the phonetic nature of the spoken words.  The characters are, after all, British, and Americans may have a tough time understanding what's being said.  When compared with All Quiet on the Western Front, which focuses more on the futility and abstract nature of the war, Her Privates, We is more insular and personal 
 Dennis O'Leary is known to most folks as a funny, sarcastic, and irreverent comedian but few seem to know much about his more serious side, along with his impressive array of academic credentials. That he is also a leading authority on the evolution vs. creationism controversy came as a total surprise to even this well-informed reader (I did already know about his PhD work at Stanford, and of the numerous awards he's received for his work in genetics).  Proceeding along at a rapid clip and carefully setting the trade-mark quips and bon mots aside, O'Leary lunges pell-mell straight into the hot fulminating core of this increasingly important pair or two of challenges to conventional notions of logic, common sense, and classic Western religio/scientific method. In a series of discourses over the course of this series of paragraphs, he first broadly outlines the history of the Creationist Creation that mandates the pro-active "contracting" of a higher intelligence, or "Intelligent Designer" to do the important set-up, and then he covers the evolution of the history of the creation of the origin of the theories of Charles Darwin--a man who may or may not have been ascended from an ape-like creature that he one day realized he superficially resembled (his Eureka Moment or possibly his father). Moving beyond this initial rendering, the author then enumerates the problems with the Theory of Continental Drift (one unresolved one being that if all the continents were once part of a single massive continent clumped on just one side of the planet--as is alleged--why didn't the Earth tip over sideways?)and other so-called "scientific" theories that run counter to native, two-bare-feet-solidly-on-the-ground, good sense.  Using famed industrial designer Raymond Loewy and Native American origin myths as suitable metaphors for a sort of sublime "Tinkertoy Universe," O'Leary succeeds in bridging an irreconcilable conceptual gap with a life-line that has so-far posed as an impassable barrier (and a rope for hanging oneself on!) to commentators on this challenging yet pressing topic--perhaps the single most important controversy facing the world today*. By interpolating the two seemingly contrasting traditions in a radical yet highly effective manner (using an almost Rabbinical dialectical style and rhetorical welding tongs) O'Leary then "makes the leap of faith," cuts the Gordian Knot, overturns presumption and applecart, and convincingly shows that, for starters (and beginners), Charles Darwin--his thoughts, his theories--may be viewed (metaphorically, if not spiritually) as an Earthly manifestation of the divine. Those who have worked closely with tenured professors in an academic setting will find this conclusion wholly plausible if not outright worthy of blind worship.  Resolving the two-edged dualistic dilemma at the finely sharpened point at either locus of this particularly linear stick, O'Leary notes (citing countless examples taken from scientific journals, trade magazines, and Jesuitical writings of the 12th and 13th Centuries) that since the beginning of the Christian Era (0 A.D.), the primary argument of Intelligent Design boosters is this: If we don't understand how something works, it must be irrefutable proof of the existence of God. (He tops off this observation by noting that Bertrand Russell frequently used this common sense "law" in the chapter on Godel's Theorem in the Principia Mathematica; and not being mechanically inclined he also had a superstitious fear of clocks) This, he then continues, is a natural step forward from Paleolithic (meaning "before the Creation") notions about the divine origins of species of various "natural" (or are they?) phenomenon/punishments like lightning, darkness, loud sudden noises and the ever-frightening fire. Here he presents the equally controversial and fairly new notion of Intelligent Redesign--essentially the Politics of the Deluge--and explains its all-important economics.  The difficulty for the sharp reader who retains a facsimile of an open mind on this confusing subject, wherever he or she or He may be hiding, is that the endless words and threats hurled--like hot chunks of brimstone--from below by advocates of Intelligent Design, coupled with those slower-appearing and more plodding bookish-isms scribed by Supporters of Evolution, are each so utterly convincing in their taut arguments and smack-in-the-head conclusions that open-mindedness is all but impossible to any but the foolhardy or those feverish with the Black Death. For the average seeker-of-answers, it see-saws back and forth thusly: one month--usually just before the Christmas Holiday shopping season--a controversial pamphlet (or book, if enough loose words are available in mid-winter) will be intelligently designed-and-published that effectively proves the presence of God's Hand in Creation beyond all reasonable or even unreasonable doubt; the next month--often just seconds before the first Fourth of July firecrackers are lit--some immense tome will groaningly and spontaneously self-manifest itself atop the uncomprehending public--one that conclusively settles the tiniest niggling smidgen of doubt about the Theory of Evolution (anyone who worked their way through Steven Jay Gould's ironclad 3000 page proof-of-pudding will agree here and we hope he will follow this last word on the subject with an equally convincing sequel). With so much rock-hard and incontestable evidence for two polar-opposite realities what can any sensible or patriotic person do?  BUY THIS BOOK! O'Leary offers a clear-cut way out of this dark and confusing briar patch. Read it, believe it, stop thinking, and relax.  *The supreme importance of resolution here is missed by many. These days drugged-out, over-medicated students with ADD and dyslexia all across America are being taught (and are almost immediately forgetting) Darwin's theories to the exclusion of the opportunity to forget and ignore any other possibilities about the nature of their prized pets. Official acceptance of the idea of "Intelligent Design" means that forgotten curriculums will need to be reordered and unread textbooks rewritten for the near-illiterate whose briefly flickering attentions are almost always elsewhere--it will be a major and costly restructing of our nation's progressively worsening educational system!  
 This movie will loose some of it's original appeal and humor in the heightened atmosphere of the polically correctness of the 2000s. But this movie did break new ground in the days when we used to laugh at ourselves. On the other hand, some of the "skits" are on the stupid side and may turn off a few viewers 
 The first 2 lines are: "What makes Iago evil? some people ask. I never ask." Which also reeks of facile gum-snapping cynicism.  But Joan really redeemed herself with the following passage: "She walked back to the car and sat for a long while in the parking lot, idling the engine and watching a woman in a muumuu walk out of the Carolina Pines motel and cross the street to a supermarket. The woman walked in small mincing steps and kept raising her hand to shield her eyes from the vacant sunlight. As if in trance Maria watched the woman, for it seemed to her then that she was watching the dead still center of the world, the quintessential intersection of nothing."   
 I got my book that I ordered in the time they specified and it was ing good condition 
 I recently purchased this item because I absolutely loved the movie. Stevie Nick's contribution of Cystal and If You Ever Did Believe took me back to her days of her classic best. I absolutely loved the Midnight Margarita sequence in the movie and it was highlighted by Harry Nilsson's Coconut Song. I also loved the angel love sequence and it was set off my Is it Real. It could have had some more classic songs on it but the only reason I bought it was for the aforementioned songs. I certainly would recommend this CD 
 Fianlly a book integrating the most complete system of health care and human undrstanding (Ayurveda) with the art and science of Acupuncture.  TCM in the west is now not much different then allopathic western medical science - only treating disease, disregarding the whole of man..especially the subtle/causal bodies.  Ayurvedic acupuncture provides a method of diagnosis and treatment from a fully holistic perspective...understanding that true healing only occurs at the level of consciousness.  It is through the shifts in awareness and invoking of the divine inner flame that we can truly "heal" and once again return to the source of God/Love within.  Ayurveda is the mother of healing..from which all medicine arose...and all will return 
 We really like this camera!  It's a WHOLE lot better than our previous one, which ran off 4 AA batteries, and ran THROUGH so many AA batteries so quickly that we can't even guess how many $$ that wasted.  This Optio camera uses very nice rechargable batteries that cost $5 each through Ebay (don't buy them here on Amazon... ouch!)  We've got 3 batteries and are getting two more so that we never even have to worry about power while on a long trip.  (The really handy travel charger is also awesome... get it on Ebay for just a few bucks.)  The startup time and shutter speed are very fast, so catching quick pictures is finally possible for us.  (My wife no longer threatens to go back to film after using this camera!)  Our last camera would take so long to focus that we never got the candid shots we wanted.  The one and only thing that's even a slight problem with this camera is the power button being next to the shutter button.  (What clueless engineer thought THAT would be good??)  However, now that we've used it a lot, we never hit the button by accident.  All other features of the camera are great.  With a 1 GB memory card, we've never ever run out of memory space, even with taking lots of short videos and many many pictures on medium quality.  Great camera, worth every cent.  Buy the accessories on Ebay and you'll find that getting everything you need is not very expensive at all.  (Actually, we bought the camera on Ebay too, but these reviews are great here on Amazon.  Thanks, Amazon! 
 i find it amazing to think of all of those scarface fans out there that haven't heard of or haven't seen the original. i know it's hard to get but if you can track it down watch this movie you will be glad you did.seeing the 1983 version first, the 1932 version seems condensed but it carries the same weight and the same great storyline.it is a film that definitely stands out from other films of that time period and a film that needs to be respected because it IS the original and it spawned the greatest movie of all time. A MUST SEE! 
 J.otto is one of the finest children's illustrators (and web animators) and he and Walsh have outdone themselves with Gluey, a Snail's Tale.  J.otto's style is bright, attractive, and compelling.  His pages are full of humorous details that children and adults will love to examine.  The story of Gluey reveals the fallacies of superstition and quick judgments, and lauds hard work, friendship, loyalty, and reconciliation.  A great book for everyone to enjoy 
 This is the Best Disney Channel Original Movie, to date. It's the most watched movie, and I love that movie!!!!!!  Those 4 girls are so succesful singers and their songs are cool!!!!  This DVD comes with an extended version of the movie and music videos!!!! 
 while i have never heard the cd, i have heard the record compilation while spinning at my friend's house and it contains all of the same songs.  its a commendable effort from a meticulous producer that makes drum & bass that is innoffensive and danceable.  definately a more mature approach to the entire genre i feel that this is something that will appeal to older drum & bass loving adults that couldn't get over the fact that jump-up fizzled out and jungle became subdued by years of darkness 
 Whether you are a lost Jew, the spouse of a Jew, or just someone who is interested in Jewish observances and traditions, this is a worthwhile book to own.  The authors emphasize Judaism as a series of choices that you can make or not make.  They discuss, in admitted brevity, the various facets of Jewish life and Jewish customs as they have evolved since the destruction of the Temple in 70 A.D.  Each chapter concludes with a list of books for further reading.  You will be tempted 
 It would never win an Oscar. Who cares?? A fun, spooky movie, kind of campy and fun. A great rainy-night movie, especially since it takes place on a rainy night. This movie was made to entertain, and entertain it does. Loved the twisty little ending. If you like Dennis Lehane novels, you might like this! Kind of a "Shutter Island" feeling to it. 
 Patrick O'Brian's 17th volume in his critically acclaimed Aubrey/Maturin series of Royal Navy novels set during the Napoleonic wars has our intrepid heroes Captain Jack Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin sent by the Admiralty to the Gulf of Guinea to suppress the slave trade and then, to Ireland's Bantry Bay, to intercept yet another French attempt to forment rebellion in Ireland. Aubrey assumes command of a squadron, as a Commodore first class, with his old shipmate and first officer, Captain Thomas Pullings, as the captain of his flagship, the 74 gun two decker ship-of-the-line Bellona. Meanwhile Maturin must contend with the unexpected disappearance of his wife Diana, who has abandoned their autistic daughter Brigid, leaving them with Maturin's servant Padeen and Clarissa Oakes 
 "Organization Theory and Design" is a book every corporate member that has aspirations to better understand and contribute to his organization should own.  I used this book studying a basic course of organizational behavior after the professor had referred to it as "the best text on the market". I found out he was right - the book is extremely well-written and its contribution to my understanding of the subject is invaluable.   As it happened, I partly read older versions of the book to find out how every few years Daft updates his analysis, insights and examples of the ever changing and evolving world of organizations; for instance, the past example of IBM that served as the major opening example of an organization that has gone from the top of the world to the brink of disintegration in the beginning of the 90's, is replaced in this 8th edition with Xerox. Daft continues and presents the most recent developments in organizations' design - structures and management methods that have only emerged lately in response to the turbulences in the environments and competition worldwide.  By making the changes in every edition "Organization theory and design" wins the title of this review - "the learning book" - that mirror images the main theme of this work - "the learning organization". Almost no organization can stand still in today's reality - managers and workers have to constantly think of better ways of doing things and learn from every source that bears knowledge and can give the organization a better competitive advantage. Things have never moved so fast and threats and opportunities have never been so immense. Competitors have to be efficient and different to survive and stay on the top.  The structure of the book is designed to convey its ideas in the best possible manner: Each and every chapter opens with an example illustrating its content, then comes an introduction to the subject, theory and examples from today's organizational world are interwoven throughout the text in the "in practice" section. A fascination section is "leading by design" in which Daft highlights top-of-the-line companies that materialize the theory and lead their industries. Yet another remarkable feature is "bookmark" in which Daft recommends and actually reviews the content of other books that further develop the subject the chapter dealt with. For me, the magnitude of this behavior is unprecedented; I haven't read a book that is so much interested in advancing and advertising works of fellow authors. This is a code of conduct every author can learn from in pursuing the ultimate end - to better inform and educate his/her readers.  Some of the material the book covers include the organizational environment, organizational structures, organizational decision making processes, ethics, organization decline and organizational politics.  As is the norm in many books, Daft integrates case studies directly connected to the content of each chapter in its end. They add all the more to the reality dimension that is so strong throughout the book.  Lastly, the price of this book is somewhat expensive but well worth the money and will certainly prove to be a wise investment. Years after reading it may serve as a reference source when the reader will stumble across situations covered in the book and learn to appreciate even more the study and insights daft offers.        
 This is the fourth Braun shaver I have owned, and this is clearly the best.  Yes, it is a bit expensive, but you use it everyday and my last shaver from Braun lasted over six years and survived year long deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq in 130 degree temperatures.  This shaver is the quietest I've used and cuts my beard in less than three minutes.  The cleaning system is much better than the last system and the shaver always stays fresh and clean.  I am not sure the message display is necessary, but it does tell you how long it took to shave each time and tells you how much battery charge is left.  The 8975 model is probably just as good as the top of the line 8995 model, but I liked the idea of the larger message center and knowing how much of a charge is left.  The Gillette blade is very nice and cuts through my thick beard like butter.  I am very satisfied with this shaver and will purchase other Braun shavers in the future 
  In the late 1980's I taught a computer science course in computer graphics and I used this book as the text. It was one of the most interesting courses I have ever taught, the students and I had a lot of fun. The action on the screen was slow and patience was required as we were running Turbo Pascal on IBM PC's.  Although it is now dated, this book was more than adequate for our needs. While it was abbreviated, the coverage was complete, well suited for a beginning course where the emphasis was on the mathematical foundations rather than the modern bells and whistles. Even today, if I were to offer a computer graphics course, I would consider using this book as a supplement, computer power may have advanced over the years, but the mathematics has stayed the same. 
 This book will give you every bit of information you'll need to get started in silk ribbon embroidery.  The step-by-step instructions and pictures are nearly as good as having a personal instructor!  I was amazed by the amount of information packed into this thin book.  You'll be able to make dozens of different types of stitches with the information you find here.  This book is well planned and (surprisingly) covers even such details as painting in a background for your work!  Worth every penny you pay for this book 
 'Sacred' is an unusual thriller by Lehane in a number of ways.  Firstly, much of the setting is well outside greater Boston - specially, Tampa Bay.  And the protagonists are a mega-wealthy father-daughter duo who are decidedly not what they appear to be.  No gangland thugs, very little drug use, no scenes poverty and urban decay.  Does this departure for Lehane do him justice?  Er, mostly no.  But it is still a good read.  Without divulging the story, in 'Sacred' we have a couple of lovey-dovey yet hardcore private eyes who are hired by a gravely ill billionaire to find his daughter.  And off they go to Florida  to find the beauty.  However the detectives find themselves embroilled in a family situation even Jerry Springer would find offensive.  Violence, greed, and a whole lotta nastiness follows.  As always Lehane comes up with rich dialogue and great characterizations.  I suppose my biggest complaint with the book is the very ending, especially after some very clever twists mid-stream.   Bottom line: certainly recommended, especially for Lehane fans 
 I have been a fan of the Doobie Brothers since 1971. I like everyone else bought all of their greatest hits CDS, and box sets. The Very Best of the Doobie Brothers is the DEFINITIVE COLLECTION of their career. It  contains all of their hits plus a few bonus tracks that make it THE CD to own. With the inclusion of such non singles such as South City, Midnight Lady, Eyes of Silver and Need A Little Taste of Love, help establish this collecrtion as the only one you will ever need by the Doobies. The addition of Ordinary Man, which is perhaps the best song that the Doobies have recorded in over 20 years, is just icing on the cake. GREAT COLLECTION. GREAT SOUND. GREAT VALUE 
 The 3.5 rules are new to me. So far, what I see I like. 
 Sandoz does in this book what a hundred modern authors bound by Political Correctness could never accomplish.  She puts forth a well written and never-flinching story about the terrible final moments of the Northern Cheyenne.  Excellent book.  See also:  Crazy Horse: Strange One of the Oglallas, another feat 
 This DVD game is for tech junkies and fans of horror movies and games I would not reccomend this to people who have weak stomachs or have re-occuring nightmares ha ha nightmares.

 Treasure Island  By Robert Louis Stevenson.   I am a twelve year old reviewer that is in the 6th grade. I enjoy fantasy adventure books the most. I have quite a good memory for the details in books that I enjoy. If  books  are not of interest to me I have trouble getting through them and then I forget about what's happening. I can never forget about a good book. I always go back to check  out a good book over and over again until someone will buy it for me. I like building my own library because then I will always have the book I want there to read. I stay up late at night reading and if I'm lucky I might stay up the whole night reading. I am someone that does not enjoy looking up words in the dictionary so I just read on and try to figure it out.  Treasure Island was not a book I stayed up all night reading, but I still enjoyed reading it. It hand the adventure I wanted, it hand mystery, and it hand a lot of  sword fighting. 	A strange pirate named Captain Flint walks into the Admiral Ben Bow Inn where Jim Hawkins and his mother own, live and work. Little does Jim know that this man will change his life forever. Captain Flint has a treasure map that another pirate named Long John Silver wants more then anything in the world. This map will lead the Long John to the treasure. When Flint died Jim found the treasure map. Soon after he finds the map pirates attack his house and Jim must flee. When Jim goes looking for the treasure he has to work for a mysterious cook named Long John Silver. When they set upon there journey to the island in search of the treasure Jim gets put to the most challenging tasks. When they see the island Jim gets betrayed by Long John Silver and his cronies who want the treasure more than anything. When Jim gets on shore he must fight pirates for the treasure.  As Jim is running through the jungle he finds a man named Ben who was marooned on the island. Ben knows his way around and he may help lead him to the treasure. Jim might lose his life looking for the treasure.  	I thought that the author had a very interesting way of writing. He would go all out on the exciting parts. I think he made the  most important parts of the story sound dreadfully dull. This was a book that I would not stay up all night reading. At some parts I felt like just closing the book and throwing it away. Then he would pick it up again and make it exciting and it made me want to continue. One thing I liked was how I could relate with the character, Jim, at certain points in the book. Something I thought was good was how the author made you use your imagination for the island and how you could picture Ben, the man, and how he lived on the island all alone. The author expressed Jim emotions very well. I could tell when he was scared,  sad and mad.  I would recommend this book 
 When John Allegro first characterized Christianity as the normalized, dogmatized spinoff of an ancient Levantine psylocybin cult, some demonized him, some laughed and some followed him into the darkness where drug mysticism and mainline religion can coexist.  A thousand critics poking at his every word discredited Allegro.  But is it not a logical phallacy to assume that because a person is wrong once, ever wrong shall he be?  As a student of Christian origins, I find it extremely valuable to read the writing of a scholar who begins study from the premise "Jesus did not exist" precisely because for most of us, the opposite premise is taken.  The parallels between the Qumran cult's "Teacher of Righteousness" and the Jesus figure need to be examined from more than one perspective. As is often the case, the truth here may lie somewhere between the opposing conclusions.   This is one of those works from which many will gain value by synthesizing its ideas with others. Is it unreasonable to conclude a kind of Davidian enhancement to the Jesus legend? That Jewish patriarchal typecasting has something to do with the story? That strains of the messianic spirituality nurtured at Qumran made their way into the early Church?  The historical evidence for Jesus, not to mention his cultural momentum, weighs heavily on Allegro's insistence on his non-existence. But we shouldn't let him be crushed. He's a useful Devil's advocate, if nothing mor 
 Overall the DVD was excellent and very much appropriate for young children. However, after a couple of months it had fallen to the back of his preference list. We've not watched it in over a year now. I guess this isn't so different from any other DVD we have.  I would recommend this for young children. It does have a few concepts that are not appropriate, but are presented in a way that is way over the heads of children adn does have a few scenes that very concervative parents may term violent but is violence in nature. very entertaining for the whole family 
 The Second Summer of the Sisterhood Anne Brashares Delacortes Press           Would you like  to know about what four different girls  did over the summer?  If you do, you have come to the right place.  During the summer, four girls, Carmen, Libby, Lena, and Bridget are separated from each other. Carmen starts to date, and surprisingly, so does her mom. Libby goes to college and as part of her class she makes two different movies. Lena is still in love with her ex-boyfriend and tries to stop thinking about him. She's always thinking about him and gets mad whenever her sister tells her, `'you broke up with him.'' Bridget goes to her grandmother's house to spend some time with her, and finds out some things that she didn't know before and is shocked about it. Lena gets really mad at her ex-boyfriend Kostos for something that he did. During the summer the girls write to each other what will happen ot them or what did happen to them.         All of these girls are best friends but they all have different lives. Carmen is Puerto Rican. She is good at tennis and fun to hang out with. She is sometimes girlie but mostly a tomboy. She is the narrator in the story telling what happens to her and her friends.  Lena is really pretty and she can't stop thinking about her ex-boyfriend Kostos. Lena has light skin,  dark brown hair. Libby is tomboy and sometimes girlie. She's not chubby and not too skinny and she has dark brown hair. Bridget is hyper and boy crazy. Every time she sees a guy she falls for him. All four girls were friends since they were little.          This book was very good and great for teenagers to read. The book has specific details and good language, good characters and humor. My attention was held very well in the book. It was a fantastic and fun book. It is the second book of a series tells about other adventures. Kids from the age thirteen and up would enjoy this book.  I hope that you will be interested in reading this book now. 
 Good book! But we need to add a little less glue for the Funny Putty, and we didn't make Kookie Creepies right. We made the Instant Watercolors and they worked great. I think Gooey Gunk would work too. It's  just like the concoction "oobleck" only with a different name.   Although my Kid Concoction book is only a library book I borrowed, we're copying our favorite recipes and giving them different names.  It was so silly that they called "Jell-O" "Yell-O. 
 An excellent account of history. Finally, a balanced account of what happened after slavery until today. 
 I'm reviewing the 2006 paperback edition of this book, and it has an extra dozen pages of material.  If you want to get this book, I recommend the paperback edition.  I think all of us ought to read this book.  It has some practical advice for how to deal with those who are at war with us.  I don't agree with everything David Hunt says here, but it is all sincere and straightforward.    The author, a retired U.S. army colonel, shows us how badly the war on terrorism has been going.  And he starts with the bungled efforts to save the hostages during the Munich Olympic Games in 1972, followed by the absurd release of the three captured terrorists.  This failure to deal with murderers has become part of a pattern that we all need to do something about.  After reading this book, it dawned on me that the first hint I had that terrorists were simply going to start getting away with murder systematically was in 1974, when Arafat, a horrible thug, was allowed to address the United Nations.  Arafat was not arrested, put on trial, and executed.  Instead, he was applauded at the UN!  And after some thought, I realized that this was more than a blunder.  It was a blow to human civilization.  Yes, it was a minor blow.  But the precedent was scary.  And given what happened, I had to hold all of human society at least partially responsible for this outrage.  Hunt explains part of the reason why nobody killed Arafat decades ago.  It turns out that in a very serious sense, "the United States does not want Israel to defeat its enemies."  There really is a "small but powerful" lobby inside the United States State Department that wrongly regards Israel as the major problem in the region.  And it "managed to convince five American administrations that it was not in our best interests to kill Yasser `the Rat Man' Arafat."  Hunt asks how ending the daily slaughter of innocents could not be in our best interests.  There is more sound advice on our response to terrorism.  Clearly, some responses put some of our rights at risk, and they could lead to trouble for, say, loyal American Muslims.  Hunt warns us that "stripping away the rights of our citizens doesn't make us safer; it puts us in a different kind of danger."  And he warns us not to turn against our own (Muslim) citizens in this fight.  Such acts of bigotry would simply create unnecessary divisiveness and lose us assets in our fight.  In addition, we see some advice to counter the enormous amount of anti-American propaganda.  Not silence it.  Just counter it, so that it does not stand unchallenged.    Throughout the book, we see advice to do something useful as opposed to creating more bureaucracy.  One example is the rather dubious looking "color codes" which supposedly alert us to the severity of a terrorist threat.  Hunt wisely calls this idea "amazingly stupid."  And the author tells us how, in 2004, Senator Edward Kennedy was kept off a plane flight that he had taken regularly for forty-two years because a suspected terrorist used "Edward Kennedy" as an alias.   That may sound funny, but Hunt points out that it isn't.  If even Kennedy can't avoid such problems at the airport, we're making a serious error somewhere.  I highly recommend this book.   
 This book examines the different ideologies behind the empires of the great European powers.  This book does not examine the impact of empire upon native people, that is not it's focus.  It can be tedious at times, but overall is very informative and interesting 
 I read a negative review of this show but I just watched it and it was better than foretold.  I expect it will do better than people think.  It's basically a Danielle Steele novel come to life.  Courtney Cox is a somewhat stern and enigmatic publisher of a Los Angeles gossip magazine.  The other characters are troubled celebrities (who have sex a lot).  The show feels very contemporary.  It is definitely a drama.  Despite moments of levity, it is basically a dramatic story.    In any case, my bet is that this show will get better and that naysayers are jumping the gun.  
 Irresistibly priced 22 track repertoire of Love's work,1966-1970.For those of you unfamiliar with Love,they were a 'lesser known' West Coast psych/garage rock band,that in my opinion their main man,Arthur Lee(R.I.P.-earlier this year)was a bit like Jimi Hendrix. Wonder if many would even semi-agree with me on that. Tunes here that'll have many patrons keeping this disc in their player for a bit are "My Little Red Book", "No Matter What You Do", the Leave's cover "Hey Joe", "Signed D.C.", the rocking "Seven And Seven Is", "She Comes in Colours" (didn't I hear this cut in the first Austin Powers movie?), the non-lp single "Laughing Stock" and the low-tempo "Always See Your Face". A should-have 
 Both my children, 5 and 2 love this book and all the others that we have purchased in this series.  The pictures are fantastic and the text informative.  Depending on which child I read to, I either just point at the picture and tell them what it is or read them some of the text.  My older child is fascinated at even the most detailed information...not that many kids that age know how to say and describe metamorphosis (in fact I couldn't remember the word now and I ran to ask my son what it was!) but mine does.  Later, when they can read, I know that they are going to love going to even more detail by reading the books themselves.  And when my children ask me questions, then these books are great to look up answers you don't know. These books are excellent 
 I have read a lot of sylvia browne and even listen to her hayhouse radio show. This is my favorite book by her because it unlocks all those interesting mysteries that man has been pondering on and she gives it a psycics view on it. 
 Salespeople, do not kid yourselves.  If you want to be a success the  techniques are all here.  There is no shortcut to being a top salesperson.   This book restates the classic basics found in Tom's all time great  "How To Master The Art Of Selling" with todays' savvy customer in  mind. Fads come and go but sales truths remain essentially unchanged.  If  you desire to succeed in sales and can afford to see him live, do it!  But  read the books, too.  I know whereof I speak.  Eighteen years ago I found  Tom and it changed my life.  I went from bottom rung salesperson to owner  and CEO of a multi million dollar sales organization.  And it is not that  hard.  If you can believe and truly serve your customer you can do it!   Sales is the most honorable profession for true professionals.  You are  helping others 
 The other reviews tell all you need to know about this book.  In fact they tell too much.  The second "editorial review" is terrible and shouldn't be read.  It is a spoiler and it is foolishly negative about a really good book.  The star of the book is Tasmin, a haughty, self willed girl who seems to be 20 or less.  She is accustomed to the cream of English society fawning on her, and she is shocked when a frontiersman named Jim Snow whacks her for using the word "damn".  Jim Snow is the "sin killer", religious in his way, completely unsophisticated, and a very good survivor in a land of deadly Indians and deadly weather.  As a result of getting smacked in the face, Tasmin instantly falls in love with her sin killer.  She also admires his impetuous style, and adopts it when she is back with her younger siblings, smacking them when she gets annoyed by them, and even, in one really cute moment, telling her little brother to smack her little sister for annoying her.  Some very dreadful things happen, but when they are told in such good humor you can't be upset by them.  When little sister Buffum, who was talking about being kidnapped and ravaged by savages, ends up being kidnapped, beaten with a firestick, and ravaged by savages, it doesn't make you sad.  When a few people die, and when Lord Berrybender (that obnoxious old fool) loses one part of his body after another, it doesn't upset you.  It's a funny book, strangely enough.  It is Robert Louis Stevenson turned upside down, for a laugh.  By the way, it isn't hard for the reader to fall for Tasmin Berrybender.  She's adorable.  I look forward to the other three books in the series 
 This book is great for the history of habaneros. I did not know there were so many varieties of habanero. However, there are only a few recipes I would try. My taste runs differently from those in the book 
 Reading a play poses challenges, as one must imagine it as a production while reading it as a book, and Michael Frayn's "Copenhagen" is no exception. Written without stage directions or set descriptions, and relying solely on dialogue, this three-person play describes the complicated relationship between Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, two physicists responsible for groundbreaking work in quantum physics. With Bohr's wife Margrethe acting as a fulcrum, the two great physicists discuss their lives before, during, and after World War II, using Heisenberg's visits to Copenhagen as focal points. Probably the most radical device Frayn uses is skipping around in time (appropriate given the mention of Einstein) where the characters speak after they have died as well as in the past, often with one describing to the audience what is happening or what something means while the other two interact; the reader has to be astute enough to "hear" the change in tone to know whether the characters are speaking in the past or as deceased observers, especially since the change can occur from one sentence to the next. This play gathers its power mostly near the end as certain principles of quantum mechanics, particularly the ability of an atomic particle to act like both matter and wave, clarify these relationships. Issues of personal responsibility and negligence ignite the last pages.    But is this drama? Frayn does not create scenes except through expository writing and discussions. Action is described rather than shown, and thematic development is contained solely in the words spoken by the characters. What's worse, the characters seem too aware of the implications of their actions, making the dialogue somewhat heavy-handed. I would expect skilled actors to be able to magnify the glimpses of deep emotion as well as enliven what is already an intriguing concept, but in lesser hands, this play could end up as a mere exercise. The cover perfectly describes the starkness of "Copenhagen": three industrial chairs on an empty stage, two characters talking while another looks on.     Frayn's postscript lends context to the play, and I recommend not skipping it since this is an intellectual play about an intellectual topic. Particularly interesting is Frayn's description of fact, background, interpretation, and pure imagination on his part.    The average play reader should find "Copenhagen" fascinating. The basics of quantum mechanics are rendered in understandable and digestible bits. If you are planning to see a production of "Copenhagen" in the near future, the book is worth purchasing for the postscript; it should enhance your enjoyment of the production.   
 This movie was very great. I enjoy Indian show but usually find them to be to long. This show added just the right amount of culture to it. It explores the friendship of two girls of opposite races and shows that people are just that people now matter what class, race,or sex you are. They also portrayed woman as strong and independent,I liked that 
 at first i really liked the 12th track since i saw the movie, and that's the reason i bought this although i spent considerable money on shipping. now I LOVE almost EVERY single one in it. I really don't know why they don't import this soundtrack in Korea 
 This is an excellent adventure story! Matt Cruse has spent most of his life in the air ...on a luxury passenger airship.  He rescues a dying balloonist, meets the balloonists granddaughter, sees mysterious flying creatures, and takes on pirates. This action story has it all 
 This is a must have recipe book for anyone who has even the slightest inclination towards cooking. The recipes are easy to follow, easy to make, and absolutely scrumptious! Ms. Storey explains everything from cooking utensils to cooking techniques- this is one treasure of a recipe book ; 
 Covey's "First Things First", was required prerequisite text for a class.  At first I balked at the idea of someone telling me how to organize and structure my time and life.  Pushing my preconceived notions aside I tackled the reading with an open mind, since I was about to start academic studies again.  I found much of the book to be blatant common sense, which seems to be a precious commodity today.  As it turns out the book was very helpful.  It put words to my present thoughts and allowed me to align myself with what the book calls "a true North principle".  In all if you are a person who needs some structure or guidance or is lost in the day to day shuffle; I would definitely recommend this book.  One word of advice is that you whole heartily read it.  It can become very deep with intangible philosophies and at times trying with repetitive words (you will become quite familiar with the word synergy), but press on past it and you will be able to gain a better understanding of why you wake in the morning.    A side note to that; Covey, in my opinion, is a devout follower of LDS.  The religion I have had some conflicts with.  Not withstanding the book does not feed their doctrine down your throat, directly.  Alhough some of the LDS religious undertones, albeit the good ones, are made slightly evident throughout the book.  Despite my dislike of their doctrine, I will be the first to admit that of the world's religions the LDS seem to have a better grasp of family and community structure than most.  In that regard, we could all stand to be a little more influenced by the shirt-and-tie guys.  Oh, and the book makes some efforts to sell some other Covey self help tools, which again if you are lost in the woods may be of some help although a poor marketing tool for the needy. 
 The republication of this authorized English edition which appeared in 1914 will enable libraries to replace aging volumes with a fresh, affordable paperwork. This remains one of Freud's most widely recognized titles, blending anecdotal accounts with his personal experience and psychological insights. His first-person, chatty tone makes it easy for the lay reader to understand his concepts of underlying psychological influences 
 Blue of Noon disturbed those dark corners previously controlled by my Victorian pretension and pathological grasping. Anyone suffering from either will find liberation in Bataille 
 If only more people were as proud of their heritage !  Sect Webb has written a book that's lucid, accurate, and thoroughly enjoyable. It's no surprise that with his dedication to "Honor - Courage - Committment" that the 'elite's' like Publishers Weekly hates his book - he espouses principles and concepts of sweat, toil, and hard work that these media weasels will never understand.   There's more to being Irish than just St Patrick' Day, and this book helps describe the traditions and background that these brave people brought that made this country great. Well Done  
 I've always enjoyed Jarre and this album is no exception, but while reading some of the customer recommendations posted on this site I discovered a group by the name of MEHDl (pronounced medie). After an online search I found their site (S00THINGMUSIC,C0M) and listened to the samples... I was instantly blown away by the quality of this music and so I gave it a try and now that I have listened to these CDs several times I really must say that although I'm still a Jarre fan, I find MEHDl to be a great addition to this CD. I have them both in my multi-disc CD player and love the way they compliment each other. I highly recommend that you give this artist a try or atleast just go listen to the samples, I have a feeling you'll be glad you did 
 I used American Son as the end of year text in my 10th grade English class at a low-performing, multicultural high school in San Diego. The students read it in class and then discussed it in small groups, applying theme words like alienation, assimilation, family, loyalty.  I can say little more than this: some of the books were stolen; students who never read begged to take the book home to finish it; many students said they had never read a book that felt more real.  These students were stunned that such honesty existed inside a book. Filipino students came uncorked and reveled in the accuracies. Yes! came from faces and voices as if deep secrets had been told.The figurative language is brilliant.  The characters are amazingly complex, particularly the mother who is as much villian as saint.  Just like life 
 Being a huge fan of Hitchcock's work, I consider this set a real treat.  Vertigo, one of the truly great movies ever produced, and ,of course, Psycho make for treasured viewing.  The package includes very well done  written information on the films themselves, with quotes form the actors   and others involved in the filming. The DVD's also have additional pieces  on the making of each film, providing a lot of juicy stuff for the serious  fan.  The quality of the DVD's are, as they should be, excellent.  And, of  course, the selection of four Alfred Hitchcock Presents programs are really  a treat, with terrific video and audio quality.  The set is beautifully  packaged and is a must for any lover of these films with DVD access 
 I listened to the audio version, which was a delight.  This classic impresses upon the reader the importance of Christ's rhetorical question: what does it profit a man to gain the whole word but lose his soul?  Wilde also underscores the point that true beauty resides in the eternal soul not the temporal body.  This is a book to read and re-read 
 This book is wonderful on the basics of competition and market analysis - especially on the role of barriers to entry.  Most of the case analyses are strong. For this discussion alone, I would recommend the book to anyone in business.  Some of the prescriptive advice/analysis on cooperating with competitors is puzzling.  For example, at points it seems the authors believe that collusive agreements between competitors will not reduce innovation. That is hard to swallow. Everyone knows that without a real competitive incentive, R&D costs can and will be deferred in favor of other expenditures. Why improve the cow today, if you can milk the one you have and use the money to buy a beer? The case history on gas additives is silly. The authors admit that the FTC successfully challenged these people at least twice for illegal conduct. Why would their deals be cited as a model for anything that a law-abiding businessperson might consider doing "strategically"? It is not clear that the authors have a firm grasp of the antitrust laws (which can prohibit even "tacit" collusion) or the costs of an antitrust claim - they favor an approach to "competition" (wacking up markets) that runs very close to the line. Antitrust disclaimers are thrown in from time-to-time, but the legal limits of the suggested types of collusion are never adequately explored. Read this well-written book, but use it with caution (and a lawyer) 
 I love the BSC, and the earliest books in the series are my favorites.  Ann Martin is one heck of a writer, and this third book in the BSC series tackles some serious issues - Stacey's struggles with diabetes, moving to a new town and fitting in, the loss and re-gain of old friends.  A subplot in this book is the girls dealing with a copycat club called the Baby-Sitters Agency that threatens to put them out of business.   Ann, I wish you had written every single book in the series and not used ghostwriters for so many of them!  
 Colonel Corso's book is a great read, very interesting, and filled with "fantastic" stories. I mean, stuff that's pretty far out there even for the UFO community. Corso covers subjects such as the Roswell incident, reverse engineering of alien technology, the alien threat during the military buildup of the Cold War, and other secret government projects related to alien presence. All of this is extremely riveting stuff, based on the premise that this book is a memoir and therefore everything in it is true. But there is a problem. I have a feeling that a lot of what Corso is saying in the book is a lot more science fiction than truth.   The main problem with his story is that he puts himself at the center of this "above top secret" government operation to reverse engineer alien technology - starting with his Govt R&D role in 1961. The Roswell crash occurred in 1947, 14 years earlier. Are you telling me the US military had highly advanced alien technology for 14 years and did absolutely NOTHING with it, letting it collect dust in a file cabinet?! That is, until our hero Corso shows up in 1961, saves the day and single handedly reverse engineers everything within a few years with the help of some defense contractors. This in turn shapes the future of technology on Earth. That is far fetched at best. I won't even get into the claims he makes about aliens as they related to the Cold War and the space program. Those are even more difficult to accept as reality.  Even with that being said, this is a great book and hard to put down. I definitely recommend it to anyone with even a slight interest in the subject of UFO's. Read the book and make your own conclusions about General Corso's claims. Hey, sometimes fact is stranger than fiction right? In this case, that would definitely have to be the case 
 I think that for a first time writer/director Vanessa did a great job.  The story is based on her real family to some extent and the town she grew up in, which is VERY similar to the film and the movie was filmed there as well.  It's a movie about family like nobody could ever imagine.  This family is real, and i know them all because they are my family as well.  Others say this family is impossible to exist but THEY DO......slightly less dramatic but its all there.  I think it's great 
 This is one of the few recipe books I have gotten and kept over the years.  I like it because it has simple, filling meals that aren't your typical condensed soup fare.  They have some imagination but are all pretty tasty.  And they come from real students 
 This is one of those books, published posthumously, that encourages readers to go back and read all of an author's previous works in its light. It's essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the psychology of Hemingway's work--and especially for anyone who thinks he already understands it. The games Hemingway's characters play with gender and sexuality in this novel cause us to reconsider the role of gender--and gender AS a role played by characters--in much of his earlier work. It's not surprising that this book was greeted with slight embarrassment upon publication. It reveals a Hemingway whose view of sexuality is much more complex and Modernist than that of many of his more conservative readers 
 Thomas Hoving seems to know his art, and doesn't have any qualms about sharing his knowledge.  He may be a premier fakebuster, but as a writer, he could use a little more practice.  While the subject matter was interesting, Hoving had a slightly difficult time keeping my attention.  He seemed to jump around alot, and made a lot of assumptions regarding my knowledge of the art world.  False Impressions is filled with all kinds of interesting tidbits about the world of art forgery and fakebusting.  Unfortunately, it can be somewhat difficult to separate fact from opinion.  As a novice to art appreciation, I found much of the material to be "above my head".  Perhaps after a few years of study, I will be in a better position to fully benefit from all Hoving offers.  Probably the simplest and most effective thing he could have done to improve the book would be to include more pictures, perhaps even some color photos, and have them more logically located in the chapters in which the pieces are discussed, as opposed to having a group of plates three-quarters of the way through the book.  At the very least, the text could have referenced the plate section.  Unfortunately, every time a new piece is mentioned, the curious reader has to flip to the plate section and hope that the piece is represented there.  Overall, I would say that if you are really interested in fine art, you will find this book enlightening.  But it's not something one would read just for fun 
 THis is probably one of my first and Favorite CDs. It has some of my favorite songs on it. One of the most stupid ones is "Pop",I seriously can't beleive people actually like that song. The best song is "Kids in Amearica",one of my favorites. Buy it,it won't be a waste of money 
 This is simply a milestone film. A picture that broke the walls, specially in those hard times when the shadows of a recent War waggled over the world, in pain, sorrow, revenge, repentant, deception, sad memories and renovated hopes in search of a better world. Rossellini made his masterpiece based on a fiction story according his introductory words but so vivid and so credible that it makes us hard to think about the whole veracity of the previous statement.   The particular seal of the genius is making us to get inside a play with such invisible force that you do not even realize when or where you were engaged to live shoulder to shoulder the lives, times and disgraces of a group of people joined by the cruel fatalism of the omnipresent and repressive Nazis. A mature woman -my always beloved actress Anna Magnani (one of the ten best actress ever born in any age) waits for her bliss, her fiancée Francesco will marry her the next day. But in her neighborhood, we have living her sister who works in a nocturne club with the girlfriend of an important resistance member, a immature woman, who has struck by the life, she has walked too many miles, in search of best positions and living selfishly; a bold priest who will work out as fundamental bound.  What you will see all along this movie is the reality shocking your soul and spirit. This script is so sublime that we forget they are acting, but living the struggling environment and trying to make the best they can according their possibilities.  The misery, greed, double moral, SS nastiness, the bold resistance and the supreme of surviving makes of this film a diamantine and majuscule artistic achievement. We should wait eleven years to presence another invaluable gem in this sense: Wajda `s  Kanal.  Obviously you should not do without of  Paisa and Germania Anno Zero of this superb filmmaker and a true universal patrimony: Roberto Rossellini                  
 Good book with simple maps, black, white and green and not poor texts. Detailed. But unfortunately, mostly focuses on European history. I' d call it Atlas of Medieval Europe 
 The first time I heard this band was in the mid 70's when I went to visit my friend David out in San Francisco. He introduced me to Asleep At The Wheel's first album "Comin' Right At Ya". When that great Bob Wills song "TAKE ME BACK TO TULSA" started playing, this kid from Oklahoma was hooked! This was a great album of western swing that, up to that point, these ears had never heard. Asleep At The Wheel, who were originally from Austin, moved to San Francisco, and under the influence of Commander Cody, worked the clubs there and eventually became these great pioneering rockabilly/western swing revivalists. The Wheel were a talented band of great musicians. They had what were probably the two best fiddle players around in the legendary Johnny Gimble and the multi-talented Andy Stein from the Commander Cody Band, who claimed he could play virtually any stringed instrument you put in front of him. As for the music on their first record; besides "TAKE ME BACK TO TULSA", two other tracks that really stand out on here are CHEROKEE BOOGIE, which features some great piano playing by Floyd Domino, and my favorite alltime Wheel song I'VE BEEN EVERYWHERE. You just gotta hear this one. It starts out ultra-slow and eventually turns into western swing on speed. It's great, and it's one I guarantee you'll be wanting to learn the words to. You'll be singin' it for days, or in my case years. As for the second album on this CD called "Texas Gold". I believe this is their third record. It's not as good as their first two albums, but it's still a pretty good effort. The standout tracks on this one are "THE LETTER THAT JOHNNY WALKER READ, which was cowritten by Commander Cody. "ROLL EM FLOYD, which again features some great piano playing by Floyd Domino. Another song which I think is the best on the album is "RUNNIN' AFTER FOOLS", which was written and sung by Leroy Preston, who besides this one, penned most of the songs on these two albums. This is a really nice twofer by the Wheel. Asleep At The Wheel's CD catalogue is not complete however, until Epic Records rereleases their self-titled second album, which has been mysteriously deleted. This was the Wheel's best record. Asleep At The Wheel has gone through many band member changes over the last 30 years, but they were never better than this outfit of renegade western swingers. I've seen these guys "live", and I guarantee ya they can get your feet movin' on the old hardwood floor. Highly recommended listenin' 
 Soros probably writes too many books and doesn't spend enough time crafting them. Certainly he stuffs each book with too many ideas and topics, some of them decidedly under-developed. For all that, the insights are well worth the slog.   If you've read his earlier books, in particular The Alchemy of Finance, you already know his philosophy and can quickly scan the first 70 pages of this book for new nuggets and then go on to his take on the current situation in America. Even if you're new to his blend of theory and practice, you may be better off skipping the passages that don't mean much to you. There's something useful for everybody here, so don't get bogged down, go ahead and piece together the good bits.   What particularly appealed to me is the application of his conceptual framework to the American political scene. The framework is about the two-way interaction between thinking and reality: We can't know what's going to happen, whether in markets, elections or wars. But our thoughts direct our behavior thereby shaping reality, which boomerangs back to our minds.   A simple example: people think [...] stock will rise so they buy it and it does and people think it will rise even more. Such is the stuff of market bubbles. Misconceptions become reality.   Soros applies this dynamic, arguing that Americans went along with Bush feel-good nostrums because they don't like to face unpleasant facts. Political reality was re-made in the same sense as demand for [...] causes a real bubble. Soros argues for a change in attitude.   The odds are probably against him. However, as he writes, one trades in order to win but one takes political positions because one believes in them. Now that's not really correct--plenty of people mouth political messages because they're paid to do so. But not Soros, more glory to him. All this is an overly simple sketch; read the book at least in part to get the flavor.  
 These stories were almost forgotten but for a recent biography of the author. A great read by a great author. Reading the stories may kindle interest in the biography but enjoy them anyway 
 This is one of Danielle Steel's better novels. It had a pleasant and happy ending and is great for summer or vacation reading. I was captivated by it and couldn't put it down until I was finished.  It tells how 3 couples, who planned to vacation the following year in St. Tropez, France were met with tragedy when one of the couple's wives died. Robert soon began to date again and when it came time to go on vacation, he brought his new girlfriend, who was a budding actress. This did not go over well with the other wives and caused a lot of friction among the couples.  In the end, all of the preconceived notions about the new girl friend were eliminated and it taught a lesson to those who made quick judgments about others 
 This is a great book to use for practicing and learning counting,  addition, subtraction, colors, and shapes.  Also aids in the development of  phonological awareness by using rhyme and rhythm.  As a teacher you can do  a number of lessons from basic counting and colors to more advanced sets,  ratios, and fractions.  Best of all, your students will love making them  disappear 
 i guess 'nice to be with you' is the $55. song it's my favorite and the rest are available elsewhere. i had it on vinyl 30 yeare ago, actually it was my dad's. some of my favorite albums were 
 After seeing recent TV newsmagazine shows on Pre-School waiting lists, and the related parental and childhood stress, I wish every parent would read this book.  There is a lot of solid evidence in here that will allow you to relax, enjoy playing with your child like you never have before, and help you to stop worrying about flash cards and where your child rates relative to their peers (especially when they're only two years old and it doesn't matter).     
 This book is excellent.  It has brief sections that talk about different aspects of the adult child's personality.  It also offers simple questions to ask yourself to see which parts pertain to you.  This book is imformative and simple to read 
 A fantastic movie!  One of the best Vincent Price movies, imo.  Highly recommend 
 Ron Sexsmith has been a brilliant, stellar exception to the dull and shopworn landscape of popular musical artists for a long time now, and continues his streak of gorgeous, masterful music on this disc.  Not only is Ron in his best form, perhaps better than ever before, he also has teamed up with an artist, Don Kerr, who's so compatible they may as well be twins separated at birth.  Ron's heavenly voice is there, as are the soaring, tuneful and memorable melodies, and lush, rich guitar work, all to complement lyrics that are at once sweet, gentle, insightful, and bitterseet.  The music flows like a river of diamonds from start to finish.  Not one track or moment is less than lovely.  If you have been liking Ron Sexsmith, rush to get this outstanding work of art.  If you have never really tried his music, this is a great place to start, with Don Kerr's voice complementing Ron's so beautifully.  And if you fall in love with this disc, which you likely will, get the rest of his music.  It's all of piece, all beautiful.  Regards,  Tom  
 Ruthie Marks, in her new book, Geometrics, has chosen a subject close to my heart -- math, as it relates to the craft of crochet. She's taken three concepts and presented them in an accessible way that's not fussy or high-minded.   When I get a new crochet book, I often jump right to the patterns. In fact, that's what I did with Ruthie Mark's new book, but when I came back later to read the introduction, the whole book took on new meaning. Ruthie explains that she's teaching how to use three ancient, though not arcane or difficult, mathematical principles. They are dragon curves, which she found, like I did, through thrift-shop crocheted hot-pads; the Fibonacci sequence, used by knitters for eons but not applied much to crochet; and the golden ratio, which she lets on was actually discovered by Theano, the wife of famed mathematician Pythagoras, (maybe Theano was a crafter).   The book goes on to teach the concepts step by step, with fun projects that increase in complexity as you go. There are garments, accessories, and projects for the home. What I find most empowering is the ability, once the concepts are mastered, to go off and apply them to my own crocheting 
 I'm a big fan of Bryan Peterson's books and I found this one very helpful.  His tips on how to see things differently and how to take shots from different angles and vantage points were great.  I think the best part about his books is that he shows examples of the same scene captured in different ways and it's alway clear to the reader which is the most compelling and interesting.  Plus, he always tells you exactly how he took the shot, what his camera settings were and other useful information that you can use right away.  I highly recommend this and Bryan's other books 
 a very well written book in detail of manufacture of all amphetamines and ectacy but unless you have a chemistry background is have to follow or attempt any of the synthesis described in the book but still a good source of informatio 
 thease dolls are ok i agree with the other reviewer that the third edtion is wayyyyyyyy better roxxi is kinda ugly lol  phope is nic 
 I've just listened to the superb audio version of this wonderful book, and recommend it highly. It was a selection for my bookclub, and I had to really search the local libraries to get hold of an unabridged copy-- absolutely worth evey moment of the 12 (or was it 14?) CDs. The narrator, Nigel Anthony, is the ideal actor for this sort of assignment-- lots of characters, both genders, and various class and regional dialects. I was intrigued at our discussion to realize that some readers had been a bit confused about certain things which I feel were completely clear-- and I believe Nigel Anthony's performance is responsible for a lot of that. The mood he created through the voices for the title characters in particular added so much atmosphere and shape to the story that I rather doubt I would have enjoyed it nearly as much if I'd used my own eyeballs, rather than my ears. I may read further Julian Barnes, but I will definitely look for more audio performances by Nigel Anthony 
 This is a great book. My two boys, ages 2 and 4, love it. It is one of the best books on lots of levels and very funny as well.  Great way to learn about healthy competition and not getting carried away. We read it several times a day and it always gets packed if we go away. 
 and once again, Chuck D's genius shines through.  This is only a slight departure from PE's fierce mix of on target observations and hardcore beats.  This soundtrack captures the essence of Spike's film on CD and Chuck D meets the challenge put before him.  Tired of soundtracks that are thrown together to launch hit records, but have no connection to the film?  Then this CD is for you.  The title track may seem like PE going a little soft, but listen carefully to the lyrics. Which is something you find yourself doing on every cut.  And when you listen, you find Chuck making incisive observations about the state of basketball today, through the eyes of the high school phenom.  "Politics of the Sneaker Pimps" and "Super Agent" are both on target and get you to examine the "BLING-BLING" mentality of the game today.  Other great cuts include "Is Your God a Dog," "Game Face" and "Unstoppable," with the TEACHER, KRS ONE!  And Flava Flav brings the good time with "Shake Your Booty," one of my favorite tracks on the disc.  This CD continues the tradition of great Spike Lee movie, great soundtrack ("Do the Right Thing" and "Jungle Fever" are two other favorites).  Soundtracks that are excellent companion pieces to the films.  "HE GOT GAME" SCORES 
 I've always enjoyed P.D. James Adam Dalgliesh mysteries, but have always wished for a little bit more information about the characters. I got my wish with "The Lighthouse"! Dalgliesh moves forward, and so does Kate, his loyal assistant. The end is more of a new beginning for the characters, instead of being just a mystery resolved.   I got the feeling that maybe P.D. James is trying to complete the cirlce in this book. Maybe it's the last AD mystery? I hope not, I love all of them 
 This is an excellent book for the person who knows nothing about Siamese Fighting Fish.  It gives a good general knowledge.  The pictures were excellent also. It left me wanting to know more 
 In this book, Roddy Doyle creates a character who is just like anyone you'd meet on the street.  Through her eyes, we the readers see hope, heartache, pain, and lost dreams as well as a look at greater social ills.  This is an excellent book for bibliotherapy or anyone who enjoys a good story from a master storyteller 
  The military courtroom drama,"A Few Good Men" is one of those films, that through endless cable showings seems to have taken a life of it's own. But even with countless viewings it retains it's emotional power and speaks to us about issues, that have become more important than ever. In the film we meet Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) a young successful, military lawyer, who is considered so slick at plea bargaining out cases, that supposably he's "never even seen the inside of a courtroom". He is assigned the cases of PFC Louden Downey (James Marshall) and Lance Cpl. Harold Dawson (Wolgang Bodison). They are accused of murder and a host of other charges, when at the Guantanamo Bay military base they performed a "Code Red" (an illegal form of discipline within a military unit) on Pvt. William Sandiago, which unintentionally resulted in his death. While the two accused Marines admit they did the "Code Red", both claim they were under orders to do so by their superiors, which includes Base Commander, Col. Nathan Jessup (a brillaint Jack Nicholson) a powerful, highly decorated officer, who is being groomed for one of the top slots in the military command. With both time running out and a lack of legal evidence, Kaffee must get to the bottom of a conspiracy and present his case, even if it means putting his own career in jeopardy. Through a brilliant script (based on the play by Aaron Sorkin), Rob Reiner's steady direction and the cast's dynamic performances this film looks at the meaning of highly held military principles such as "code, honor & discipline". Should a soldier always follow orders no matter what? Whats' more important our ethics & principles (on which this country was founded) or our need for security? Is Col. Jessup right? Can we not "handle the truth"? It's hard to believe, that this film was made way back in 1992. In this post 9/11, post Abu Grebbe world, where our country is on a war footing the questions, that the film seeks to address have become more profound and important than ever. The film is filled with great performances. While I am not normally a huge Tom Cruise fan, I have to admit, that Cruise does a wonderful job as the young conflicted lawyer. The same goes for the great supporting cast which includes good acting turns from Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon and Kiefer Sutherland. But what really propels and turns this film into a classic is the brilliant, dynamic performance, that comes from Jack  Nicholson. When Cruise puts Nicholson on the courtroom stand and starts pointly egging him on, you just watch in awe as Nicholson just continually builds the character's palpable anger, until he just boils over and explodes in the now infamous "You Can't Handle the Truth" speech. Even though the speech and Nicholson's performance has been endlessly quoated & parodied, when you put it in the context of this movie it still has so much power and resonance. If you are interested in seeing a well made, movie courtroom drama, that is both thought provoking and entertaining then I highly recommend "A Few Good Men" 
 Having read about the Rosenstrasse miracle in various books I rejoiced when somebody chose to make a movie about it. I eventually managed to get a copy.   It is an incident unique in the story of the Holocaust. Fanatical nazis in Berlin of all places were forced to return Jews they wished to deport to the Death Camps. It happened when they seized mixed marriage Jews as part of the Berlin Round up. And much to their astonishment, their German spouses showed up outside the place they were kept demanding their release.  Much to everybody's astonishment, they got it shortly aferwards.  This is their story.  I must confess I thought the New York scenes where the main character starts by meeting a relative her mother doesn't tell her about were rather flat and two dimensional. The modern German scenes weren't that bad but the scenes set during WWII Berlin were superb. Great costuming. Great scene organization and set design. Nice drama. Good character portrayal. A happy ending, something unique for Holocost films.   Overall, this is a great film.       
 The irrepressible Penn Cage is back again as the protagonist of a complex, action-packed page-turner set in Natchez, Mississippi. Penn Cage, former lawyer and prosecutor turned author, is shocked to discover that his best friend, Drew Elliott, successful local physician, has been having a tumultuous affair with gorgeous Kate Townsend, 17-year old high-achiever in the local high school. Kate has been found dead after being raped and strangled in the creek near Drew's home.   Drew asks Penn to represent him as his lawyer, and though Penn feels unprepared due to their long friendship and inexperience in capital cases, he temporarily acts as investigator and offers legal advice until he can find a more suitable defender. Drew claims that Kate was already dead when he found her at the creek and believes that Kate's dealings with some of the low-life drug pushers in the area may have been the actual cause of her death.   The trail of evidence points inexorably to Drew, and as each day passes, Penn is sickened and horrified by the revelations, though Drew continues to profess his innocence. Drew claimed to have been deeply in love with Kate, but Penn can't get over the unsuitably of such a dalliance, particularly the 23+ year age difference, and the fact that Drew is married.  The plot complexities stem from the entangled web of drug pushers and users that have invaded the quietly deteriorating back-water town of Natchez. It seems that every kid in the area, even the "good" ones, have attended the raves, are sexually promiscuous and are at least experimenting with, if not actually using a variety of drugs.  The multiple sub-plots humanize and allow us to empathize with the characters: Drew's flawed marriage and painkiller-addicted wife, Penn's faltering love life with Caitlin, Penn's respect and admiration for his father, and Penn's close but charged relationship with Mia, his daughter's 18-year old babysitter.   The plot twists and shocking revelations make this an engrossing story that will keep you immersed to the end. I will definitely be keeping Greg Iles on my list of favorite authors for a quick, absorbing read. 
 It was a little hard getting the batteries in, but once that was done I set the device to feed every 12 hours and it has been working great for the last couple months.  I think it is an excellent product 
 This book is for everybody.  Everybody has had the experience of not wanting to let go, or letting go and finding it extremely painful.  Hardly anybody does the strange things Forward describes her clients doing, but the insights she offers on how to deal with one's feelings speak to the universal human experience.  I decided to write off "relationships" years ago, but reading this book was just the thing to find closure and put an end to that part of my life permanently.  Whether you are writing off one "relationship" or writing off all "relationships" the way I did, Forward can help you and how.  The book could benefit from a good editor.  I was not at all interested in reading about her weird clients, which took up at least half the book, and some of them are really major league weird.  But after a few pages you learn to "zap" that part the same way you "zap" commercials on your VCR.  Her comments on why people find "relationships" so painful and ultimately not worth bothering with and where those feelings originate and how to get rid of them are pure gold and well worth reading.  I cannot recommend a better resource.  Also, readers who have heard Forward on the radio should know that the book is not at all obnoxious, despite the way she comes across in her show.  Whoever wrote this book (Forward or an uncredited ghost) strikes you as someone you would feel very comfortable turning to for advice.  Get it.  You will be glad you did.  
 I came across Numbering the Stars while clearing out a storeroom at the school where I teach.  Since I had already read and reviewed The Giver, Gathering Blue, and Messenger by Lois Lowry, I took the book home and read it over the weekend.    Numbering the Stars won the 1990 Newbery Medal for most distinguished contribution to American literature for children.  The story is set in Denmark during World War II.    It centers on Annemarie Johansen and her friend Ellen Rosen and their families.    The Rosen's, a Jewish family, live next door to the Johansen's.  As with most parents, Annemarie's parents try to keep the harsh reality of the war far from their children.  Lowry keeps her focus tight on the character of Annemarie.  We see the occupation of Denmark through her eyes. However, Annemarie is at an age where she is curious but not always able to understand the world.  As events move forward she, along with the rest of her family, are called upon to be brave.       This relatively short novel allows young people to see the Holocaust through events written for their age level.  The story is told well with strong descriptions and good tension.  Numbering the Stars deserves the Newbery Medal.    I have criticized the endings of other Lowry stories but this story has a logical start and finish point.  As I read the last page, I had answers to my questions and wanted to know more.  That is the mark of a story told well.  Numbering the Stars is an enjoyable adolescent novel.  I recommend it for any Middle School reading program.    Kyle Prat 
 Kubler-Ross teaches us how to understand the death of a family member or loved one and how to cherish the final moments with them 
 The previous reviewer criticizes the book for not being accessible to youthful audiences.  It's quite clear that Trites is writing for a professional, adult audience.  In doing so, she provides a thoughtful,  intelligent, convincing analysis of feminist children's literature.   Potential readers should not be mislead by the previous comments as the  reviewer has misunderstood the intended audience for the book. The book is  essential reading for any adult interested in feminist children's  literature 
      Had used Premiere Pro for an 18 minute project and had some of the major concepts down already. Knew my way around the interface a bit, but found that I really didn't feel comfortable, and knew that there was alot of stuff beneath the surface that I could really use.  I have several premiere pro books that are really just manual replacements and I didn't want one more step by step "do this, then this" hand holding books. I wanted to get a handle on how to get my projects done and what tools Premier Pro had to help me.      The book covered all the bases: Acquistion, rough cut, tim, sound, effects, color correction and even some basic integration with other products.       I found the Editing Worksop to be a pleasure to read, and it gave me a much firmer foundation on how this NLE works, and what is really happening to my clips along the way. It is a great book for the beginner to intemediate user. I still find myself going back to reread sections as I work or as I read more advanced books.  The book is clear, concise and well illustrated.  Many illustrations are well thought out and designed to illustrate concepts rather than just pages of screen shots. The book manages to give a very comprehensive grasp of all the major features, without becoming lost in useless detail.  Not the last Premiere Pro book you will own, but one of the best, and the one you should read first. 
 This is a better than average film. Outstanding things here. The acting is good. I did like the film very much. Yet, it is outstanding. It is above average in every department and I did enjoy it. That's not a bad thing. Great score and theme 
 Bought this as a gift for my Mother who is in a nursing home, looked for light, up lifting reading for her and WOW did I find it in this author, bought two more of his books and am thrilled with the poignant and sometimes humorous stories. Would recommend again 
 Another amazing release by a talented band.  These guys never cease to amaze me with their lyrics,  melodies,  and sounds.  Ok,  so they are one of my favorites,  but if you have other 54-40 CD's,  then you'll know what I mean.  I wonder why these guys aren't giants in the industry,  but then again,  I like them the way they are.  This CD features such gems as Giants,  Ride,  and Seventeen On.  Oh ya,  Animal In Pain,  is a riot!  With so much intellegint rock packed into one CD,  I feel I've stolen something.  Keep up the good work guys 
 This book has become the most important book to me when making clothes. Using it before starting saves from many troubles. It not only explains how different fabrics behave, what threads and needles to use, but gives an extensive view also of the types of seams and finishes to use. The included hints are really valuable, giving a lot of inside information and experience. This book really saves time, material and patience 
 This is a super star of a story.  A classic.  We love it 
 Everyone that comes to our house has to laugh when the dogs ring the bell to go out.  Very fast learning curve for the dogs.  One of my dogs will occasionally lay down with the paw between her paws and put 1 paw on it so it barks continuously until I come.  No problem with the range.  I did have one that stopped working after a year and Lentex replaced it, with a compelete new unit, immediately 
 I picked up this book again after reading it when it first came out.  I'm loving it all over again.  Of course it's not a book about how the Three Dog Bakery came to be.  It's a story about Gracie.  I see that a reader was disappointed in the dialogue, but I don't think it's geared towards a teenage girl  (as the reader suggested.)  The author is a creative writer (or was- read the book!) and so the stories (although- I don't think they're fabricated) are fantasticaly told with great description.  There are so many points in the book that I literally laugh out loud.  Definately a good (and quick!!!) read 
 If you want more information on Sophia Peabody Hawthorne, read Sophia Peabody Hawthorne: a life by Patricia Dunlavy Valenti. I thought that Marshall was stretching a bit when she inferred that Sophia's migraine headaches happened at certain times because of feelings (e.g. jealousy, loneliness) that she experienced. Biographers get into muddy waters when they diagnose or interpret diseases from the 19th century as part of their description. An exception would be a writer who is a medical doctor and is writing solely about a disease in the 19th century and is using medical records as sources. Marshall puts her comments about Sophia's headaches in context by referencing only one text: Oliver Sacks' Migraine: Understanding a Common Disorder.   This well-written book is full of descriptive passages that do put the reader back into the Victorian time period. The expectations of and challenges for women are interesting to read about first hand from the Peabody sisters' letters. New Englanders will appreciate learning about towns and cities such as Dedham (once pastoral), Salem, Brookline, Boston along with parts of Maine. Learning about the connections between these women and famous artists, statesman, authors, lecturers and ministers is unendingly fascinating.   Editorial comment: Sophia should have been a famous artist herself and Elizabeth Peabody should be recognized in university education classes for her accomplishments and struggles 
 This review is for people who have never heard of Porcupine Tree. If you have, then you don't need to read this, because you most likely know how good they are. With that said, this album really took me by surprise. I kept reading about how good this album was, but I really had no idea. It seemed to be on alot of people's favorite album lists, and I had never heard of Porcupine Tree. But, I was thoroughly interested in listening to them because of the rave reviews I kept running across. I was not dissapointed. It took me awhile to really understand what Porcupine Tree is all about, but once I did, I really enjoyed their music.  This is one of those albums that almost mesmorizing. It just captivates you, you can sit there doing nothing and let time fly while you listen too it. Or you can soak it up while your involved in something. If you've never heard Porcupine Tree, and you like music, listen to this album. It's definetly worth checking out, and is a hidden gem among the rocky thorns of todays overgrown music 
 This book is the result of research by experts that are able to teach others in most practical ways. Along with that, the photos are beautiful and give a glimpse into the intermost workings of nature that a reader has never seen or imagined. Practical guides for planting your own butterfly garden will give you a taste of paradise in your own back yard. A "must have" for anyone intereted in butterflies, from the seasoned to the novice seeking to know more about the subject 
 What I love about this book is its warmth and authenticity. Susan is an incredibly talented marketing and publicity expert... but just as importantly, she genuinely cares about living life with integrity.  It's that combination of skill and thoughtfulness that makes this book different than any other marketing how-to.  As owner of a small, heartfelt business, this is the one book I turn to over and over again as my reference for publicity questions and inspiration. The pages of my own copy are dog-eared and marked with highlighter. If you believe in what you're doing and want to spread the word, you won't be disappointed in this book. I promise. 
 "A superb...  well written book by Kozol. This award winning book gives an in depth look at the controversy of homeless victims living in shelters in New York City. Kozol doesn't just speak about homeless issues but goes directly to the suffering victims for his certainty. Startling facts about the homelessness, that the media never reviews. If you're curious of how the homeless survives in all for seasons...This is the one book you would need to read. 
 The book arrived in time for my class.  It's in excellent shape and the price was more than fair 
 Chicken Soup for the Soul By: Jack Canfield Reviewed by: M. Ke P.2     Chicken Soup for the Soul is a series of short stories that often portray drama. The series would often describe people living with cancer conditions or people that are mentally disabled. I believe that the book's purpose is to make you happy for the person you are.     I liked the book, mainly because it cheers me up. This book not only makes your heart smile, but also your soul smile, with quotes such as: "Don't bug me! Hug me!" and even made the people who are the most crippled smile.      The second reason why I liked this book is because of the drama. There are some stories in the book at this play this such as: "I cried for Mark and for all his friends who would never see him again." or people suffering under a medical condition such as: "The 26-year-old mother stared down at her son who dying of terminal leukemia." For this one, this amuses me more than comedy.     My favorite park in this series is a short story called "The Hugging Judge." It tells about a kind-hearted judge who would go around hugging everyone he sees. When he is sent to a place for the mentally stupid people, he is pleaded a hug an old man named Leonardo. It is said that because of that, the old man smiled, in the first time during 23 years 
 This book spoke to my soul.  It came to me at a time when I was at a crossroads in so many levels of my life. Even though I am only 28, have not had children yet and haven't had the same amount of life experience as Iris, I related to so much of what she writes about. I found peace, liberation and an insight into my own truth in this book 
 Just to correct a mistake I made, #7 is the song called My Little Suede Shoes w/the Cuban drummers 
 This is a great book for the person just getting started in thinking about putting up a web site.   The basic concept here is to use a fairly minimal amount of HTML, which he teaches you, and then one of the hosting services such as GeoCities, Google or AOL to get your site up and running. All in all, he presents an excellent description of what you need to think about, what technologies you need to understand, and the various tools that are available to assist in the construction of the site.   The intent of this book is to enable to get a site up and running, fairly quickly (He says in a day, I think he is a bit optimistic, plan on a weekend, maybe even a three day weekend.) but only after having thought a lot about the various aspects.   Then in chapter 18 he talks just aenough about things like JavaScript, database connectivity, cascading style sheets and more to let you know that you've barely scratched the surface.   An excellent place to get started 
 Very pleased with my first time ordering texts on-line. I tried to order my school books on-line to save money, while not compromising the integrity of the product and I am very pleased with the results 
 We purchased this book for our 1-year-old daughter for Christmas, and she immediately fell in love with it.  Every time it is read to her (every day, several times a day), she eagerly lifts each flap to reveal the animal underneath.  Because of the rhythm and repetition of the story (we think), she also nods her head like a bobble-head doll as it is being read.  She doesn't do this with any of her other books!  We find the quality of the book to be superb as well.  Since Christmas, she's probably lifted the flaps a couple hundred times, seriously, and she does it with enthusiasm.  Surprisingly, the flaps are still in perfect shape, not torn or even bent.  I compared the thickness of the flaps to her other lift-the-flap books that quickly became worn and ripped (such as Peek-a-Moo!) and found that Dear Zoo's flaps are thicker, thus explaining its sturdiness.  You just can't go wrong with this book!!   
 Steve Martin has created a masterpiece for the sales and marketing industry.  This is a provocative business book that is a welcome departure from the many process-oriented sales methodologies that crowd the marketplace today.    This is a study of the qualities of successful salespeople in business today.  Although the genesis of Steve's teaching is from technology sales, his thesis is a thoughtful analysis of the importance of building customer rapport early and throughout the phases of the sales process.  It applies to any sales professional irrespective of product or industry.    Based on scientific principles of neurolinguistics (how the mind creates language) Martin introduces ways to establish interpersonal rapport where communication is most effective.  He gives us insight to how the majority of the population processes information.  People are placed in three categories: visual, auditory and kinesthetic.  These are scientific tenets but Martin, through his own expertise and his many years of observation of successful salespeople, understands how to naturally adapt to the unique ways people think and interpret data.  Salespeople that understand how people process information, can then develop a custom language beyond product  feature, benefit, advantages to reach deeper levels of human understanding and ultimate persuasion.    This is a complex subject that Martin makes acessible for the average to excellent sales practitioner.  He clearly states the primary enemy of the sales professional is time.  Sales professionals that build the strongest relationships with a prospect/customer decipher the truth about what a buyer(s) needs to make a decision.  This places the salesperson at a distinct competitive advantage because they discover early in the sales cycle whether they are winning or losing.  Time will not be wasted on those that quickly uncover whether their business opportunity is real or fantasy.    He labels the "heavy-hitter" as owning a finely tuned instrument (their intution) that can read a customer's innermost thoughts and desires through verbal and nonverbal cues.  Some may view human intuition as an instinctive almost, visceral interpretation of reality.  Martin blazes new ground in his definition of intuition.  It is the mind's highly structured database of knowledge, ideas and experience.  The salesperson in Martin's view then compiles this information.  The more experience and wisdom a salesperson has the richer the database.  The sales professional can access this vast reservoir of common customer behaviors and recognize objections and affirmations in any sales situation.  Martin's heavy-hitter is one that can readily retrieve this information in an instant and deliver a credible response to a buyer in the right manner, at the right moment.         Martin correctly asserts that people buy from others where a high level of trust and integrity are established.  This book is not riddled with sales techniques that seek to toss out catch phrases cariacatured by authors in this field today.  Rather, it is a thoughtful study of complex human behavior that must be understood before any persuasive communication or influence can occur.  Martin offers insight into other devices of communication ie through the use of metaphor where, if skillfuly conveyed, can "tunnel" a message beyond the conscious mind of the buyer to his/her innermost thoughts, fears and desires.  Martin concludes that persuasion occurs when congruence of the conscious and subconcious mind is attained.  Martin's book is a fascinating study of the buyer/seller relationship.  The characteristics of the heavy hitter salesperson are universal.  Martin demystifies the "art of selling" to a tangible, measurable system that can be taught to anyone.  It is a must read for any CEO, sales and marketing executive, individual contributor or anyone that has a passion to persuade in an ethical and profitable manner.   Excellent work 
 If you are a Troma fan or a Lloyd Kaufman fan or a Toxic avenger fan or a horror, comedy, gross-out, sci-fi, comic-book...whatever fan, check this lastest offering from Mr. Kaufman out. The man is a genius, all around great guy and the true heart of independent films. This book is outragous fun for everyone. Check it out. 
 I "discovered" Bentley Little through the website of another horror novelist I enjoy, Scott Nicholson.  After seeing Mr. Nicholson's words of praise, I decided to give Little a shot.  I wasn't disappointed.  I checked this book out first because, quite frankly, the idea of a man who did some of his strongest speaking through letter-writing hit close to home for me.  I've been known to register plenty a complaint through written word.  I'm going to think twice about writing those letters now, after reading this book.  The plot is so creative words cannot fully express the effect it had on me.  This isn't your typical horror novel.  It's much, much more.  Mr. Little manages to create a world where a simple letter could lead to more horrifying circumstances than an actual living, breathing monster.  This book made me a fan of Bentley Little's work and I'm sure it'll have the same effect on you.  Great read 
 Those three traits seem to be the overriding factor in the downfall of our 37th president.  The sheer size of corruption exhibited at THE highest level of our executive branch of government is striking and terrifying.  At times, I had difficultly believing that so many intelligent people participated in what seems like endless felonies.  This book is thoroughly researched, from Nixon's tapes to Halderman's diary, and is HIGHLY recommended by this very satisfied reader.  Well worth the price! 
 One of the most extensive and brilliantly documented books I have seen and read about the subject.  Full marks to Tony Nourmand on his latest publication.  Enjoyed it thoroughly and would highly recommend it 
 Stephen Pinker's revolutionary work and the resultant writings stand at the precipice of a new era of understanding into the marvels of being human and what it is that makes us "us". This work, and his most recent ("The Blank Slate") will one day be held out as the first tentative baby steps toward what will certainly be our greater unlocking of the secrets of the brain.  What really makes Pinker's work accessible is his breezy tone (and I mean that as a complement).  Many great scientists are good researchers but very poor writers.  Pinker, on the other hand, knows how to communicate his ideas in a facile and utile manner, allowing even those without a Ph.D. to quickly and effectively grasp his many cogent points and references.  By choosing not to talk down to, or over the heads of his readers, Pinker assures that more and more people will be drawn into his world of grand paradigm-shattering concepts and will grow to marvel and appreciate all that makes us who we are 
 What an amazon collection of songs! This is bar none my favorite cd just because of the variety and the quality of songs on it. I love music from this era, and this cd is the perfect companion to my life. Love it! Buy it, you won't regret it for a moment 
 This book was a prize from a survey questionaire.  I would have never bought the book for myself because I never thought that I would make a watercolor journal but after reading this book and seeing the illustrations, I was so inspired!!!  I had an old sketch pad and headed outside with it and this book, then, sat down and sketched things around my home and town.  This sketching brought so much personal emotion to me as I looked closely at all the beauty around me in my everyday life.  I slowed down my life to see, to really see and now I am taking a journal with me everywhere.  Thanks for opening my eyes with the wonderful book containing beautiful drawings and words!! 
 All the 50's RCA hits by one of the smoothest quartets ever.  The Ames Brothers were as harmonious as they come on everything from novelty tunes to love songs.  All you need is the equally enjoyable CD containing the group's 40's hits for Coral to have the perfect Ames Brothers compilation 
 I've had one of these cups for about three years and it works great. 
 If I was told I could keep only three works on philosophy, my choices would be instant: (1) Aristotle's Complete Works, (2) Hume's Treatise (and other works), and (3) Solomon's "Joy of Philosophy." That is how estimable I hold Solomon and this book.  University of Texas professor Solomon is an unique persona in philosophy. Schooled and trained in the Anglo-American analytic tradition, his favorite philosophers and ideas come from the Continental side of the profession. This hybridization of analytic training and existentialist thinking brings together the best of both possible worlds. Unlike most Continental thinkers, who are often arcane, verbose, free-association, and ideological, Solomon is accessible, concise, and driven by philosophy's "historical" or "grand" themes. And unlike most Anglo-American philosophers, "living" philosophy is the reason to do philosophy. It's not merely a method, it's a way of life. And in his superb dexterity, he's able to articulate Continental themes in the Angl-American style. For those of us demanding rigor, clarity, and logic, he delivers better than most in the analytic tradition.  All of Solomon's books are a joy to read, because he embues philosophy with joy of philosophy itself. Thus, his title for this, his most comprehensive and systematic, work, could not be more appropriate on numerous levels.  Solomon can keep up with the best of analytic rigor that the Ango-American tradition requires, and still reach into the depths and breadths of our humanity to distill vividly those distinctly human features, which really amount to something, that makes the examined life not only worthwhile, but a joyful difference. His conceptions find existentialism the most viable means, the same existentialism which I've always considered outlandish ideology. In Solomon's hands, his own regard for existentialism must be an appropriate response to, and a fulfilling expression of, the human condition. First and foremost, he revels in clarity and lucidity. Second, and no less important, he demands philosophical relevance - indeed, confronting concerns that affect us the most. Third, what could be perceived as Ideological in his bent toward existentialism, he re-presents as an entirely normative response to human reality; no window dressing, no appeals to some particular creed, and no dismissal of the real issues people seeking philosophy expect to receive.  Solomon's unique charter is his ability to dissolve the "charms, wit, and myths" of the human past (in true Wittgensteinian style), face the incontrovertible realities of existence itself (without any Sartrean "exits"), and resolve our dilemmas to the extent to which they can be (each in their own incommensurate manner). Existentialism has met Analytic rigor and has been found to be highly responsive to our inner-most, and outter-most, aspirations. Rather than obfuscate, he's daringly lucid and unequivocally clear. Rather than "provide manna from heaven," he offers realistic analysis of the various options for living a full and authentic life as it only can and must be. Rather than avoid the central concerns of our human existence, he compels us to face them head-on. Rather than devolving into puzzles, or offering pablum, or finding "exits," he insists on context and autonomy, difference and similarity, choice and determinism, freedom and enslavement, not in any Hegelian dialectic that resolves into a thesis, but as true tensions of life itself.   "The Joy of Philosophy: Thinking Thin versus the Passionate Life" is the one book of his that encompasses the most salient and necessary features of life itself, without ambiguity, without inextirpable prose, and without pat answers. His many other books, especially "The Passions" and "Love" are extraordinarily terrific reads, but this single volume presents his over-arching outlook in lucid perspective. Whether one agrees or agrees to disagree with Solomon's ideas, they vivify philosophy, and that makes the "examined life" all that much more joyous.  "The Joy of Philosophy" contents should whet your appetite (my quick annotations bracketed):  I: The Passionate Life (his singular most important theme)  II: The Politics of Emotion (again, the reintegration of reason and emotion)  III: Rationality and Its Vicissitudes (humans are more than a rational animal)  IV: Justice, Sympathy, and Vengeance (sociobiology's contribution to the good life)  V: The Tragic Sense of Life (do we really want to endure this headache?)  VI: Thinking Death in the Face (it's the only human certainty)  VII: Recovering Personal Identity (homage to a key concept of who we are)  VIII: Deception, Self, and Self-Deception (what Truth Tables don't explain)  P.S.: Has Analysis Ruined Philosophy (yeah, and it's time to put "love" and "wisdom" back into it)  As with all of Solomon's books, he is accessible, articulate, concise, and most importantly, exceedingly fun and enjoyable to read 
 "The Sustainability Revolution" is a thorough review of the evolution of sustainability. For a text loaded with facts and details, Andres wrote it so it would be understandable for those who are new to the history and principles of sustainability. The resources section is especially helpful because it lists organizations and contacts mentioned in the book along with brief descriptions about them. I'm sure that many of our customers -- for the DVD "Architecture to Zucchini: The people, companies and organizations pioneering sustainability" -- would be very interested in this book. I highly recommend it to higher education, consultants and business leaders 
  I thought the DVD was excellent from the standpoint of a person not having much experience in lifting or exercising.  It shows great technique and form.  I used to be a wrestler in the highly competitive state of Iowa so over the years I learned many of these pushup and workout techniques.  Pushups and dumbbells used to be my main source of lifting and staying in shape.   I found myself to be too advanced for the Power 10 workout  so the video seemed like common knowledge.  So for beginners and more advanced people looking for a great DVD focusing on developing proper form and technique this is an excellent DVD .  The DVD takes you through many different styles of pushups showing the proper form and setup.  It then does about a set of three of that style pushup to show you the routine in live workout motion.  With the DVD purchase I was hoping to find an exercise program, approximately 30-45 minutes long, that sets up a nice workout routine for people short on time.  I was hoping for a video that combines a variety of different pushups using the Perfect Pushup into a nice timed workout.  A workout that works my chest, back, arms, abs, and some cardio into a nice overall workout that is done in short time.    Something similar to a Tae Bo style video or other timed exercise videos.  The Power 10 Workout isn't that type of video.  It is more specifically a technique video that one can evntually combined into a workout of their own.  I recently wrote some emails to the Body Rev president suggesting the development of a video for more advanced people that provides a fast, effective workout routine that one could get at the gym, but can do at home in 30-45 minutes with their Perfect Pushup.  He seemed pretty impressed by the idea so hopefully BodyRev builds on this DVD like they have for their other products.  
 	"Bull Run" is a great book for kids and adults. It is fast paced at times and slow at others. This book tells the lives of a child, a black man, a general, a doctor, and much more. There are sixteen different characters in the book. Bull Run takes place during the civil war. Some characters are on the Confederate side and some are on the Union side. This book would fit in to two genres. Realistic fiction and Historical fiction. 	I really enjoyed the book "Bull Run" because I learned about the Civil war. My favorite character in Bull Run was A.B Tilbury, because he was full of energy and was  happy a lot of the time. Even when the mood wasn't so joyful! At one time or another all the people are feeling thankful and/or sad. 	After you read this book try to get an audio type of the book. I like listening to the story on tape. It really helped me under stand the story better. After reading this book I want to read more Historical fiction about big wars and fights in history. 	Some reasons I didn't like this book are: At the end of each character you want to read on and see what happens to the person. But you have to read about other people first. Also at the end, I think the author should have kept going and wrote more, or even make a second book to tell how the characters lives end up. 	My three favorite phrase are: "I was eleven years old and desperate to kill a yankee before the supply ran out." From Toby Boyce, "By gravy, it was a glorious feeling! At last we were marching off to battle!" From A.B Tilbury, and "To be a negro living in the midst of whites, unknown to them, is to be a ghost spying on the living." From Gideon Adams. 	I never really enjoyed reading books about history. I learned a lot about the war by reading Bull Run. I didn't like the book when we first started reading it in class. But after we read some of Bull Run, then I started to like it much more. 	 The mood changed in the story a number of times.  First the mood was happy because the war did not start yet. After the war started the mood changed  to sad and hopeless for some people. Some people stayed happy and overjoyed. After the war  the people were happy and overjoyed, and some were still very sad.  	My favorite part of the book was when A.B Tilbury was to go to war because he was hyper. If you need a good book to read. Then you should pick up this book and start reading it. I really liked it and if you read it I think you will too 
 I was fortunate to obtain a copy of this book and read it. Cleckley reveals incredibly interesting details and insight into how a psychopath's mind works. This informtion is invaluable in trying to understand why some oddballs do what they do. 
 A great read ... surely one wud enojoy the arguments given by Amartya Sen about the Argumentative perspective of an Indian.... Each of the essays are just wonderfu 
 This is my favorite Bob Dylan album. The album begins and ends with two of the greatest songs ever, Like a Rolling Stone and my favorite Desolation Row. Sandwiched in between are some fantastic songs. The album is filled with incredible lyrics,wonderful music, and a mean harmonica. If you want to know why Bob Dylan is a legend buy this album 
 This book is challenging, yet accessible, even if the reader does not posses a scientific background. While Wheatley's observations about organizations and their problems are not unique to her, her approach is, and provides an interesting framework to approach organizational development and design 
 This book is the volume one should buy if he or she is searching for the best, consise overvue of the history and processes involved in the military innovations of the Western world 
 Please make this into a movie! This story, by the great Robert Holmes, has been voted by Doctor Who fans to be the very best one. Watching it again, I can easily see why. Coming in the middle of the Hinchcliffe/Holmes years, which is usually referred to as the "gothic horror" period of Doctor Who, The Talons of Weng-Chiang incorporates many aspects of the Tom Baker years: it has the gothic horror and feel of the Hammer horror films, as many of Baker's earlier episodes do, it has a great sci fi story and premise, it has the wonderful period feel to it of Victorian England, which the BBC was so great at pulling off, and it has an excellent villain. At six episodes this story is longer than most, but it sails right along at a lightning pace, easily coming in as one of the most exciting of the Doctor's adventures. The story brilliantly blends elements of Jack the Ripper and Sherlock together, two very popular characters to mix together. Here, the Doctor is dressed in Sherlock attire, and an evil, Chinese magician is prowling the nights with his eerie ventriloquist doll, kidnapping young English women for some nefarious purpose. This is definitely one to own, and watch out for that Peking Homunculus! 
 This book tackles the tricky area of inter-racial violence bravely and with great skill. It paints a shocking picture of the Australia of 100 years ago, and particularly the plight of the aboriginal community. Keneally's economical style is perfectly suited to this dense narative; he makes every word count. One of the best books I've read this year 
 I found this movie to be amazing.  You really connected with the characters.  This is the type of movie that you either hate it or you love it.  I for one loved it.   The scene with Lee Grant screaming at the end is a tear jerker.   I've seen this movie numberous times and still cry during that scene.  I love the closeness he had with his friends and the distance he had with his father.  It was very similar to my family and friends.  If you like emotional movies,  buy it.  If your not into the sappy movies,  don't buy it. 
 This film is treated something like the lost child in the canon of director Woody Allen's career.  As if he would have to apologize for this instead of, say, "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion".  What Allen attempted here in his directorial debut is groundbreaking.  This is the first example I can recall of a director telling his film in mock-documentary style, later employed by Albert Brooks and perfected by Christopher Guest.  Allen proves himself to be not only a great comic visualist but there are great verbal puns here as well.  The conceit of the film is a gas.  We're supposed to believe that Allen's Virgil Starkwell, an inept dweeb of a criminal, if not among the FBI's most wanted does cause Mr. Hoover some sleepless nights.  The gags here are rapidfire but I wouldn't spoil it for those who are uninitiated.  My favorite being,though, is Virgil orchestrating a prison break with a gun he's fashioned out of soap during a rainstorm.  All this failed effort leaves him with is a hand full of soap lather.  Also, noteworthy in the cast is the late Janet Margolin as Virgil's faithful wife.  Margolin basically plays straight woman to Allen but it's a shame this gifted actress who was so good in "David and Lisa" didn't have a more substantial film career 
 I'm not usually a big fan of live music, but this album actually blows away a lot of Their studio recordings. The sound is great, and You get the extra cuts that wer'nt available on vinyl back in the day. The energy level is incredible, if You crank it on a nice stereo it's like You're there 
 Should be required reading for everyone who believes we've evolved from the apes. Clearly, we haven't -- even a chimp would find this book ridiculous. The sad thing is that there are people out there who think this is some sort of docudrama of the world to come, that it's a fictionalized account of what's just around the corner. Badly written, bigoted, anti-scientific, anti-intellectual ... this is what 12th-century illiterates would write about if they could write and if they were less progressive-minded than most of the other barbarians living in the mud huts around them. I'm sure this is what passes for literature in parts of the Deep South, but even Baptists must find this farfetched. If Robertson weren't so dangerous, he'd be laughable ... well, perhaps he's both 
 If you're looking for some uplifting music, this is the album you need to get! Alan Jackson presents these old time hymns with feeling. You can't go wrong when you buy this CD 
 I can't say enough about this book!  It is relavent, easy to ready and full of gems of guidance.  While "In Search of Excellence" is my all time favorite, this book packs the most punch-per-page.  I bought one for my boss who then purchased one for every manager 
 What can you say, it's Faulkner and it's a great set for the price... BUY IT!! 
 This book is a real page turner and the scary thing is that the premise of the story is based on fact. Missing Nazi uranium. If you enjoy a good spy story than I highly recommend this book 
 Hey Now!    If you are/were a fan of Bob Weir and/or the Grateful Dead, or even if you were not ever, you should give this CD a try.  Even my fiance', who's not much of a Dead Fan (except for Workman's Dead and American Beauty)as I admittedly am - and even some of my assoicates and friends who heard this CD fell instantly into a trance with it.  The styles vary from song to song (blues, rock, even Las Vegas showtime styles) - and each one can stand by itself yet seem to be linked to each other.  I can't believe that it took me nearly 4 years to catch this fine set of works even though I knew of Ratdog (and its many variations - Bob Weir and Bob Wasserman, Bobby and the Midnights, etc.) for at least the last 10 years or so.  Really - go out an even borrow it if you can - I can almost guarantee you that you'll want to get your own copy because it will grow on you and soon you'll be thinking of these tunes inside that head of yours for many a time to come.  Great sensibility and style - a lot of meat around the bones - more than just chicken in the soup.  It's really surprising that these guys do not wind up somewhere up there in the charts - but I guess they are happy just playing their music - and that's what makes them so darn creative and unique.   Some may say that this CD is another ego trip for Mr. Weir - but I disagree - it took everyone in this band, not only Mr. Weir, to put together a very cohesive and stunning piece of musical magic that amalgamated into a much magnificent marvel.  Each member is a very talented and creative individual who's unique in their style and at the same time, harmonious with each other.   Truly, these guys belong with the other Unsung Heroes of Rock and Roll (Spirit, Moby Grape, to name a few).  
 I thought that wearing a silk robe was more an affectation than anything else.  Happily, I was wrong.  This robe is well-made, comfortable, and it really looks nice.  
 I have fallen in love with the Tamilee Webb Workouts.  This is a workout that really gets your heart pumping.  It's definitely what I would call High Impact so if you have knee problems this might not be for you.  I have been using this DVD in conjunction with I WANT THAT BODY also by Tamileee.  I have been using these for about 3 months and am losing inches, my clothes are definitely fitting better.  Overall a GREAT workout.     
 The Eagle of the Ninth is a moving adventure tale set in Roman Britain of the 2nd century AD. The straightforward, uncomplicated story was probably intended for children and certainly for young adults. Nevertheless, adults of all ages will find in it much to enjoy. The characterization of life in early Britain is quite convincing. Rome and the Senate are but a distant echo. Here we live the provincial life of a barely pacified country. A young Roman centurion recently injured in battle and so unable to serve in the legions, sets out to find the lost "eagle" (i.e. battle standard) of his father's legion. That legion, the Ninth Hispana, along with his father, had disappeared twelve years previously in Caledonia (the north of modern Scotland). In the course of many adventures the hero will learn of his father's fate. Interestingly, the book reminds me of the works of Rudyard Kipling dealing with the Indian subcontinent. Ironically, instead of English colonizers living among "noble savages", the shoe is on the other foot, and colonial Romans live among the barbarian tribes of Britain. Anyone with an inclination towards historical fiction will enjoy this moving adventure story. Commentators have pointed out that this is probably an apt description of how the British national identity was forged over the centuries 
 It may seem self-indulgent for King to make his protagonist a writer of romantic suspense. King sounded a bit defensive on the promotional tape his publisher sent reviewers. Wambaugh was a cop, and he writes about cops, King says. You have to write about what you know, he goes on, just like he writes about Maine.   There are many themes and mysteries in this book. Some of my favorites are the ideas concerned with recreational reading. King and his editor both suggest that this book owes a lot to Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca. So not surprisingly, it is a ghost story. With some fictional monsters, like vampires or zombies or what ever, our suspension of disbelief in order to enjoy the story may involve considerable effort. But ghosts? For anyone who has ever experienced the loss of a loved one, it is almost impossible not to believe in ghosts. An interesting fact that King's character encounters constantly is that women in this country read more than men. Men characters in the book, when they meet the author, always say something like "You are my wife's favorite writer."   Another story that is referred to frequently is "Mars is Heaven" by Ray Bradbury. I love this story, even more so because it is part of a cycle of stories which Bradbury wrote known as The Martian Chronicles. I am a bit concerned about King's use of the story here, because he summarizes it a bit abruptly, and it is a tale which relies on a surprise ending, so it would benefit readers to find a copy of The Martian Chronicles and read that  first, before reading Bag Of Bones. I believe "Mars is Heaven" is the original title, and the title that was used in several anthologies many years ago. It would be hard for readers to find it with that title now, however, as I think it was published as "The Third Expedition" in The Martian Chronicles.   Bag of Bones, simply summarized, involves a popular writer who's wife dies unexpectedly. Soon, he finds himself griped with a paralyzing writer's block. He flounders through his life, in the course of tying to put things back together, and finally visits their summer house in a tiny village which he has avoided since his wife's death, because of the feeling that it was mainly her place. It is here that he begins to encounter various spirits. Not to mention a young widow and her three year old Shirley Temple-sweet daughter. He soon becomes romantically involved with the widow as he tries to protect them from a rich and evil step father. He begins to unravel secrets that his dead wife has kept from him, which mysteriously involve the history of their summer house and the surrounding community. King conjures enormous suspense and finally resolves the plot with some rather violent incidents and horrible revelations.   I know everyone will be annoyed by my nitpicking, but one bag of bones in the plot is "dissolved" almost instantaneously with a strong solution of lye. I just have to point out that lye isn't very suitable for dissolving bones, as it is an alkaline. A strong acid would have worked better, quicker. King mentions in his promotional tape that he doesn't like doing research, but someone should have been able to point this out.   As I've mentioned, one of the interesting things about this book is the thoughts about recreational reading. Toward the end, King's character deplores violence, even fictional violence like the killings which are frequently the basis of murder mysteries, and by extension part of the violent conclusion of this book. I enjoy analysis of mysteries and detective stories, and I have always wondered why, exactly, murders seem to be a necessary part of a large group of entertaining, memorable stories. I share a bit of the uneasiness that King expresses here. Overall, I think fictional violence is part of a mechanism that writers use to stress the characters they create 
 A well chosen array of talks by Adyashanti, which anyone interested in non-dualistic spirituality will likely find compelling.  Most valuable is Adyashanti's ability to move beyond explanations and walk the reader  through "as-if" versions of awakening, leaving us with at least a clear echo of that experience, and an internalized feeling for what it's all about 
 I like the book. It's very clear and concise 
 I first read this book and this series some 52 years ago...I recently dug them out and had another go.  They are as fun now as they were then.  Burroughs' style is absolutely great and needs to be savored.  The books are action packed and certainly reflet a time in our society long past.  I feel to understand current SiFi and S&S, you really need to start during this time period.  We certainly have come along way, in may ways, but it is very evident that this writer and his contemporaries certainly had a profound influence on what we are getting today.  This are books for little boys and girls and thank goodness I have enough of that little boy in me to still enjoy them 
 This is the book I remember from my childhood, sixty years ago. It was selected by my mother, a children's librarian.   In the past several years, I have given a copy to each of my friends in celebration of their first grandchild and it never fails to please, both for the memories it brings back and the delightful rhythms created by reading aloud. The illustrations are nostaligc but attractive to young eyes, with details to point out, a new one with each reading. And you'll be surprised at the "origins" of many familiar phrases and enjoy hearing these versions of old favorites. (It's as much fun for the grown-ups as the kids.)  I have long advocated reading to babies to get them used to having a book in front of them. If you give a child a love of reading and books, they can teach themselves anything they want to learn.

 I am always surprised that J.A. Jance is able to come up with new mystery's really enjoyed reading and sorry that I am now at the end of the series for the time being 
 The story of one woman's drive to overcome situations which few can imagine, much less survive, is next to unbelievable.  A very worthwhile read 
 i agree with the reviwer who said this was their funkiest album.  i had to listen to it a second time because the first time i was half sleep.  when i listened to it again, my two left feet were moving like i knew how to dance.  it is a bit long, but hey, i enjoyed every extracaricular moment of it.  i love the other albums too, but when i think of them, i think about the HANGING ON A STRINGs and the SLOW DOWNs, which makes me wanna hear an album such as this one, so there!!! 
 Ok this is a very funny concept and makes for great reading on a trip. HOwever it is somewhat short. Some stuff is really true about rock snobbery but to some degree it falls short of its ambitions. Still it is worth a read 
  Among adepts this remarkable book is simply refered to as "Manual No.5" (that was it's old Theosophical Society designation.) When it was penned in 1894 this book was unique. This is because prior to that time all books on the subject were traditionlly written in an obscure and metaphorical manner. Bishop Leadbeater changed all that- he took 19th century scientific objectivism and applied it to the most mystical and subjective of studies. The result is a virtual Baedecker (travel book) of the astral realms. As a result this was the first modern English language text to be included in the permanent collection of the Brotherhood. This book opened, and continues to open, doors.    Briefly, this little volume, covers: scenary, inhabitants, and phenomena of the astral realm. Since this is the realm most closely in contact with our own it can be a most useful and practical guide book. For instance, you will find summarised here more real facts on black magicians, elementals, shades, vampires, and werewolves than in many thicker, more modern volumes. Indeed, a pocket sized hard cover of this manual is quite convenient to carrry at all times as a review, and passport... 
 Dan's book is extremely informative. It is filled with information and guidelines for the author who chooses to self-publish. It is a MUST read. I highly recommend it.Very well written and easy to understand 
 In this book, Kinsey celebrates her 33RD birthday. She moves back to her renovated apartment, gets hired to find an elderly lady supposedly living in the Mojave desert by herself. And then she also manages to make the top of Tyrone Patty's hit list.As much as she hates to admit it, Kinsey realizes she needs help fending this guy off if she is going to survive. This is where Robert Dietz, a Porsche driving bodyguard comes in. He yakes his job very seriously, starting to fall for Kinsey.And then before she knows it, she falls into a gruesome case that will lead her into betrayal 
 Well, John Tradescant was a fascinating person. A botanist and gardener, he served King and Country in the Middle Ages and collected plants that graced royal palaces. But this is not just for gardeners like me. As Gregory always does, there is amazing drama and excitement, and - again, as always - one heart-stopping incident. The characterizations are excellent and there is real tension between John the Elder's blind obedience to the King and his son's refusal to kowtow 
 This installment, like the rest of this series so far, is suspenseful, funny and populated with characters that seem very real.  One new character, Laura Fielding, is admirably faithful to her imprisoned husband, and is, in general, a very likable character (and one that charms both Stephen and Jack).  The Middle Eastern setting of this book is exotic and very vividly described.  Stephen's adventures in his new scientific marvel, the diving bell, are both funny and interesting.  Jack's encounters with Laura's massive dog Ponto are hilarious.  The end of this book is very suspenseful because the reader has come to really care about the characters involved.  The most notable thing about this book is what a great job O'Brian did of keeping this series fresh by bringing in new locations, characters and situations.  O'brian did a great job of not letting this series fall into predictable formulas and repetition.  The only failing of this book is that the very end is just a little disappointing and O'brian leaves the reader hanging much more than in the previous books 
 This book caught my attention because I have several near and dear "Angry White Males" in my life that I just don't understand. To my way of thinking, life has given them everything - good educations, good jobs, nice homes, nice families, nice prospects -  yet they invest an inordinate amount of energy being angry at and fearful of THEM. ("THEM" being pretty much anyone who is not white.) Why, I've wondered, are my near and dear so aggravated by THEM when in truth, the enemy more likely to undermine their peace and prosperity is a white CEO? Why do right-wing talk show hosts wax rabid on the topic of "welfare queens" yet turn a blind eye to (or worse, make excuses for) corporate looters?    Of course, the answer if far too complex to address here, but Melanie Bush provides interesting insights, not the least of which is the basic presumption of "white goodness."  Bush spent five years collecting and documenting perspectives of white students on inequality and found their perceptions of and rationalizations about equality have little basis in reality. Simply put: despite indisputable evidence to the contrary, most white students believe that not only have other races achieved equality, they are now privileged at the expense of white people. (aka "reverse discrimination.")   The first part of the book analyses the ethnographical data collected through interviews and surveys with students at the City University of New York (CUNY) probing attitudes and perspectives about race and class. The final chapter explores "Cracks in the Wall of Whiteness" and presents some consciousness raising activities...a hopeful chapter without which the book would not be complete. The Afterword provides a post 9/11 perspective on notions of race, and had me vigorously nodding in agreement at every page.  This book is clearly written and enlightening 
 "Mornings on Horseback" was an insightful and thorough look into the life of the family that spawned Theodore Roosevelt.  You get the sense that you are privy to the nature of this remarkable through first-hand stories and a great deal of correspondance.  McCullough weaves a fine story and creates dramatic tension where appropriate.  "Truman" is still my favorite, but not by much.  Well worth the time and money 
 Some books make you laugh out loud, and this is one of them.  If you are 'into' physics then you'll probably find it funnier, but I've seen it bring a smile to the face of everyone who flips through it.  I teach an aerodynamics class, and particularly found the book useful in jogging my students' memories regarding their physics fundamentals. However, I'd be really hard pressed to call this text anything more than a fun refresher text. So don't expect exam grade learning from this one.  If it were only as humourous as the Cartoon History series. But then, is it possible to make equations as funny as human behaviour 
 Most of this album was produced by Large Professor and NOT by Eric B. I don't believe he shows up in the production credits though. At the time this became an issue, Large Pro had quit Main Source and laid low for a while, to return a couple of years later on the Tribe Called Quest album 
 I picked up this book because I kept running across it in various bookstores!  It took a couple of chapters to grab you, but once it did, I found drawn the the characters and wanted to know what was going to happen to them.  I read the book and a day and a half and went right out to buy the next one because I have to know what else is going to happen.  This book is definately worth a read!! 
 I'm a committed Berger devotee, owning or having read probably every book he's written. 'Our Faces,' is the book I've returned to most often over the years. I feel enlivened by Berger's language, his passions, his insights into art, the crispness of his poetry, his feeling for form; and this book is so elegantly paced & presented. He communicates his finest perceptions about greatly loved paintings and makes earnest & eloquent efforts in establishing their meaning for him. The process invites the reader into his own heart, deepening the world, making it more palpable. The piece on Caravaggio is astonishing, a set piece of concise art writing, free of jargon(as is all of Berger)and superior, to my thinking, to any of the spate of Caravaggio books that hit the shops at the turn of the century 
 I love this book.  I spent a great deal of time in book stores looking at all the different baby books.  The Baby Book just makes sense.  I am a big fan of baby slings, breastfeeding, co-sleeping and this book offers suggestions, advice and research about all these topics.  It is also wonderfully supportive of bottle feeding - formula or breastmilk, cribs, and working moms.  Right now I have the privledge of staying home with my little guy but I am going back to school in the spring and I was grateful to find a book that approaches parenting from more than one point of view 
 Monument Ave. is probably one of the best films I have ever seen. Instead  of the Hollywood happy ending, we have a dark and grim tale of family  morals and the loyalty between being a stand up guy and a family man. Denis  Leary proves he doesn't always have to play piss and moan roles and he's at  his best as the reluctant Bobby. The cast is excellent with Colm Meaney as  a remorseless crime boss, Ian Hart as Bobby's energetic friend, Famke  Janssen as Bobby's girlfriend, and the rest of the cast are in top form.  Director Ted Demme manages to get down to the bare nub of the script with  the Boston accents and attitudes. This film definitely should've gotten  more notice. Grade: A 
 I am developing a course in the History of Technology in America for my local community college, and find this book an invaluable resource.  There is a hard-back one-volume edition as well as a soft-cover two-volume edition available.  The authors hail from Harvard, Yale and MIT, with backgrounds in history, politics and technology.    This is an American history with a difference.  While the student and instructor will find the basic chronological outline of American history that is familiar, the development of themes here often draws in much more explicitly than the normal text the issues of technological innovation, scientific discovery, manufacturing and business development as engines for growth and progress in the course of American history.  The authors state in their introduction that Americans 'have long considered this penchant for innovation a distinguishing feature of their culture and history.'    Technology in terms discussed here is hardly confined to the modern age.  For example, very early in the text the authors state that the development of maize/corn 'was perhaps the most important plant-breeding achievement of all time' - the creation of a stable staple food crop that was adaptable and resilient spurred the growth of civilisation in dramatic ways.   Technology includes that related to architecture (from the earliest buildings in the Native American cultures to modern skyscrapers, bridges and underground complexes), agriculture (the aforementioned maize development being but the earliest of these examples), transportation technologies (from canals to railroads to automobiles and aircraft), medical technologies (from early hygiene and vaccine developments to modern pharmaceutical and genetic innovations), information technology (telegraph and telephone to digital and internet), and much more.  History is naturally selective, and any history text is going to have to walk the fine line between being thorough in development and being comprehensive in scope.  The whole work weighs in at well over 1100 pages (inclusive of index and appendices), which is a lot of material for a two-semester course that will include supplemental readings.  As an overview of American history, it hits the high points well and develops many sidelines of interest.  My own particular teaching responsibilities for this will be to students who are primarily interested in technical education - this method of developing American history has more appeal for this audience, given its more direct applicability to their courses of study.  In the two volume edition, the first volume covers the pre-Columbian scene in the Americas through to the era of Reconstruction following the Civil War; the second volume goes through the presidency of the current George W. Bush, and includes issues of 9-11 and the issues of ongoing wars against terrorists.   There are CD-ROM supplements that come with the books, which include many helpful elements for the students, as well as some multi-media offerings.  These are keyed to chapters in the text.    The text is written in an interesting and informative manner, with appropriate use of humour and wit as situations permit.  For example, from the text on the exhibition in London's Crystal Palace in 1851, the authors write:  'Among the winners was the New York firm of Day and Newell, manufacturers of locks.  In one of the more flamboyant competitions, an employee of Day and Newell successfully picked the locks of several well-known English lock makers, while an English locksmith failed to pick Day and Newell's locks.  The American won a cash prize for his efforts, while the Bank of England, whose vault he opened, subsequently placed an order with Day and Newell for a new set of locks.'  The text is supplemented by a very generous sampling of graphics, pictures, woodcuts, maps, charts and other colourful elements.  Every page has some element of colour and something to make it visually interesting apart from the text.    This is a wonderful book for undergraduate courses in American history as well as for general readers who want to refresh their knowledge of American history.   
 This was a reread for me. The reason why this is my favorite McCarthy book is because it has absoloutely everything. Chicago heiress, Amanda Delmar, came to Cuttersville Ohio to get her dad's attention (read: A Date With the Other Side).  Her plan backfired and her father ended up cutting her off financially.  So she is stuck in a haunted house with $50 to her name and zero job skills. Danny Tucker works on his family farm.  Danny and Amanda are physically attracted to each other, but neither thinks the other could possibly want the other.  What could an heiress see in a farmer?  What could a farmer see in a spoiled heiress? Danny finds out he has an 8 year old daughter, Piper.  Piper is the heart and soul of this book.  She comes to Danny's farm with some issues.  It'll make you weepy to find out all about Piper.  But it will also warm your heart to see how everyone embraces this little girl. Danny hires Amanda to babysit Piper and do a little house cleaning. Amanda is witty and funny.  She is much more than a spoiled heiress.  She is also sensitive, love starved and lonely. It is an amazing book.  It's a beautiful story, watching Danny, Piper and Amanda fall in love with eachother, heal eachother.   This is a heartwarming tale written with style, humor, sensitivity and such clarity you really feel what the characters feel. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and in the end you'll smile 
 In 1996, Marilyn Manson came about again with his third album entitled, ANTICHRIST SUPERSTAR. This album is the first in a trilogy of Gothic albums, and is one of the best in Manson's catalogue. For this album, Marilyn Manson had added new member, Zim Zum, to the band, for Daisy Berkowitz made his departure from the band while the band was in the midst of writing this album. The new lineup for now features:  MARILYN MANSON (Origin of Marilyn Monroe + Charles Manson): All Vocals TWIGGY RAMIREZ (Origin of Twiggy + Richard Ramirez): Bass + Guitars MADONNA WAYNE GACY (Origin of Madonna + John Wayne Gacy): Keyboards + Synthesizers DAISY BERKOWITZ (Origin of Daisy Duke + David Berkowitz): Guitars GINGER FISH (Origin of Ginger Rogers + Albert Fish): Drums ZIM ZUM: Guitars  IRRESPONSIBLE HATE ANTHEM   Great.  THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE   The first single from the album. Awesome tune. The first time I had heard this, I was instantly hooked. A great song, with a creepy video.  DRIED UP, TIED AND DEAD TO THE WORLD   Great.  TOURNIQUET   The third single from the album. Awesome tune.  LITTLE HORN   Great.  CRYPTORCHID   A great song. I could definitely listen to this song over and over again. My favorite part of this song is the repeated line of: "Prick your finger, it is done, the moon has now eclipsed the sun. The angel has spread his wings, the time has come for bitter things".  DEFORMOGRAPHY   Great.  WORM BOY   Great.  MISTER SUPERSTAR   Awesome tune. Should have been released as a single.  ANGEL WITH THE SCABBED WINGS   I've always avoided this song, but my older brother kept telling me how great the song was. So, I listened to it, and I founded that it is a great song.  KINDERFIELD   Great.  ANTICHRIST SUPERSTAR   The title track. Great song.  1996   Great.  THE MINUTE OF DECAY   Great.  THE REFLECTING GOD   The second single from the album. Great tune.  MAN THAT YOU FEAR   The fourth and final single from the album. Another great song, with a great music video.  UNTITLED HIDDEN TRACK   Creepy.      After the sixteenth track, comes another 83 tracks of silence. So, from tracks 15 to 98 are nothing, but silence. However, track 99 is the Untitled Hidden Track that is very creepy. This album, in my opinion, made Marilyn Manson an even bigger star. It definitely set the stages for his next albums to come 
 I have read many meditation/spiritual books and struggled to maintain a regular practice but often feel overwhelmed, which is why I so appreciate this book. It's brief enough that I actually finished the book, yet every page has some specific, new, helpful idea. The meditations are short enough that I've actually done many of them many times in the few weeks that I've owned the book, and I do feel more relaxed,mentally clear, aware of my world and relaxed in the shoulders. He has no cumbersome spiritual dogma but neither is it a dry, clinical, mechanical treatise. He obviously has many years of experience and has felt the struggles, yet is light, optimistic and reassuring 
 While this book is good--it is not as good as Flynn's previous books.  Does give good background on the Middle East and Special Forces.  Vince Flynn does know how to write a political thriller 
 each track from start to finish....AWESOME! even though i'm a female every now and then i got to have some "grit" in my music collection.  "Easy On The Cut....No Mistakes Allowed. 
 Frederic Wakeman started his academic career as an expert on late Imperial China, and in recent years became a fine historian of 20th-century Shanghai.  Here he and other leading scholars present cutting-edge research on modern China's economic and cultural hub.  Most chapters are superb, and later became full-length books; while they cannot supplant the longer works, this collection may help readers avoid the cost of a shelf full of monographs.  Many topics explored here are the stuff of Shanghai's legendary "Whore of the East" image, such as  prostitution, drugs, gangsters (Brian Martin's study of the Green Gang is especially strong), labor turmoil and political intrigue.  But the in-depth analysis and data shows that for most residents, the city was a place of hard work, struggle and cramped if convivial living.  It was far more than the exotic playground noted by numerous visitors---though the city never lacked opportunities for indulging every kind of taste, and vice.  Clearer maps would help, as would illustrations of this much-photographed city, but this is a superior edited book on a perenially fascinating place 
 Dante had his Inferno.  Odysseus had to get past Scylla and Charybdis.  And Bertie Wooster has to darken the dangerous halls of Totleigh Towers again to avoid the unwelcome bands of matrimony with Miss Madeline Bassett.    Madeline's engagement to that world-class newt lover, Gussie Fink-Nottle, is on the rocks when Madeline insists that the meat-loving Gussie become a vegetarian.  That's dangerous because Madeline has always made it clear that she will have no other man than Bertie as her husband if Gussie isn't available.  So Bertie volunteers to enter that place where all others abandon hope in order to try to repair the engagement.  But he's soon in trouble because Emerald Stoker, daughter of the American millionaire, has taken a temporary job as the cook at Totleigh Towers and is tempting Gussie with steak and kidney pie and ham sandwiches.  Soon love is following the growls of Gussie's stomach, and Gussie insults the sunset and Madeline's favorite fictional character.     At the same time, Stiffi Byng's engagement to Stinker Pinker is on the rocks as well because Pop Bassett won't come through with the vicar's job that Stinker needs to be able to afford to marry.  A rocky day at the school treat makes progress even more problematical.  Jeeves is the source of the all the solutions as he often is, but relations are strained even there by Bertie's new hat which Jeeves feels is unsuitable.    Stiffi also takes to absconding with Pop Bassett's prize gee-gaw, which Bertie's Uncle Tom covets, and matters develop to make Bertie look like a thief again.  Can Bertie escape the goal?    In the best of the Jeeves stories, the plot unfolds in a fairly straightforward fashion that holds Bertie at ransom to fate.  Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves has such a plot.  I highly recommend this book to you.    This book should also remind you to read the Jeeves books in order of their publication.  Many of the best are sequels to the finest of the early stories.  Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves is one of those sequels.  Enjoy!  Are you ready for something to wet the old tonsils 
 I gave this to my 4 year old granddaughter who absolutely loves it and sings and dances with it 
 Tony Robinson, better known from the Brit-com Black Adder (sic), develops a surprisingly scholarly DVD. (Even Terry Jones of Monty Python fame recently co-authored a very important work on Chaucer.) He interviews all the key people one would expect (save Dan Brown who declined) and while he does not approach the relevant questions from a religious point of view, he wishes to state the facts, and does so clearly. Here, we see how seriously flawed the pseudo-scholarship of the Da Vinci Code really is. Michael Baigent and Marg. Starbird both admit that the idea the Jesus was married is based on a guess. Grail historians show how the story of the holy grail was never meant to be taken literally. My only beef with it is that early Gnosticism was not dealt with well enough. Yet even so, I gladly give it 5 stars. 
     It was very eye opening and enlightening to essentially read about myself in the context of Dr. Hallowell's personal and professional experience. Though I have never been diagnosed with ADD, nor pursued a diagnosis this late in life, it did bring my own experience into a place that I could easily understand and accept. It also gave me a basis for helping others in my family deal with ADD at a younger age, hopefully with less of the confusion and anxiety that I endured. The writing was very easy to follow, and indeed, done in a way that any ADD sufferer could readily use 
 I have been skimming through this book for some time now.  I wanted to educate myself on herbs and incense in general but for the most part I wanted learn how to make my own incense because I enjoy crafting things with my hands and I enjoy a good scent.  Here shortly , I will begin experimenting with both the non combustional incense and the more difficult to make combustional incense.  The combustional incense type can be really messy and some of the constituents are difficult to obtain from what I gathered in this book.  The author does state that one must have perserverence when attempting to make the combustional type of incense from scratch.  If you just want to experiment and have fun with different scents and aromas , this book would be of value to you because it has so many different combinations of ideas and mixtures concerning incense , oils and brews.  It also has an interesting topic about homemade soaps as well.    
 I have been a fan of Good Charlotte for a few years now. I liked the Chronicles of Life and Death (so much that i bought 3 copies of the CD to get all the bonus tracks). i eagerly anticipated the release of "Good morning revival". After listening to it i have to say that i am dissapointed. Good Charlotte's new CD "Good morning Revival" shows Good Charlotte straying more from their punk roots and heading towards modern rock. The CD starts out strong, falters in the middle, and gets a little better towards the end.  I have rated each song from 1 to 5, 5 being the best  1.)Good morning revival: its an intro, so i can't really rate it. 2.)Misery: 4/5 pretty good song. one of the few that actually has a guitar solo. 3.)The River: 4/5 I liked this song when it was a single but when i got the album i didn't like it as much. Good Charlotte tried getting a hit with this one. M.Shadows from Avenged Sevenfold helps out on the vocals. 4.)Dance Floor Anthem: 5/5 one of my favorite songs. nice and upbeat. 5.)Keep your hands off my girl: 5/5 my favorite song off the album. doesn't sound anything like Good Charlotte does. One of the few songs of theirs thats really rocking. heavier guitars. 6.)Victims of Love: 5/5 another rocking song. 7.)Where would we be: 2/5 song about losing his love with Hillary Duff. not a fan of this song. 8.)Break Apart her heart:3/5 semi-rocking song that would have been decent but the lyrics are annoying. 9.)All Black: 2/5 People think that something's wrong with him because he wears black and likes the night. didn't really like this one either. 10)Beautiful Place: 2/5 From the first note you could tell that this would be a bad song. blue-grassy? 11.)Something else: 3/5 decent song. kinda reminds me of Girls and Boys 12.)Broken Hearts Parade: 5/5 great song. good guitars. trumpets really add to it. my second favorite song on the album. 13.)March On: 3/5 a pretty good mellow song but not a very good way to end the album.  in conlusion, if you are a fan of Good Charlotte, it is definitely worth it for the 5 or 6 good songs on the cd. just overlook the bad half and you'll enjoy this albu 
 Through Gates of Splendor is a gripping account of the true story of 5 missionaries martyred in the jungles of Ecuador. Sound familiar? That's because it's the same (basically) story recently popularized by the film End of the Spear.  If you watched the movie and the story moved you, you'll love this book. It gives the backdrop of the story; what brought these 5 men to that beach to give their lives for the cause of Christ.  The author was wife to Jim Elliot, one of the 5 men who lost his life. She quotes often from Jim's writings and diaries. Man, that guy could write!  My favorite of Jim Elliot's quotes comes from his diary, reflecting upon trying to serve God in the U.S.:  "The problem of meeting a culture with truth from God is the most difficult kind of thing. Once comes as a renovator, a conditioner of society, and society is in no mood to be conditioned. The fixedness of the human mind is the 'wall of Jericho' to Gospel preaching. God must shake, or there will be no shaking." (p. 20)  It's high time God shook things up...and it's high time we stop getting in the way.  The book is an inspiring source of faith, hope, and sacrifice. God's glory has certainly shone through the tragedy. The blood shed that day has certainly been a seed planted, watered, and cared for to a miraculous fruition of God's love and peace among indigenous tribes.  Read it! You'll be better for it. .  
 This is a gripping novel that probes the breadth of human depravity and perversity while plunging the reader into a malevolent and sinister world. Lester Ballard is a deeply deranged and demented individual with sexually perverse lusts that resides in the Eastern Tennessee countryside. He's accused of rape, imprisoned for a short time, then released after which he commits unspeakable acts against his fellow man. It's doubtful his incarceration had anything to do with his behavior since it's obvious from the start this man is troubled. This is a wonderful novel filled with effective imagery and stunning descriptiveness. I found the chapter where the town sheriff, deputy and old Mr. Wade rowing the boat through the flooded town streets to be quite interesting. A recommended book, but beware the subject matter is quite graphic and might not be suitable for those without strong stomachs 
 Bought two of these to go with the CLX 485 in our house.  Works great as a total system.  The middle-aged adults in our house love the simple and large buttons, as well as the color display (easier to see).  Great to be able to both get alerted to messages on the answering machine (alert light) and to check the messages from this unit without having to walk to the base station where the message machine is...  Sound quality is superior and we like being able to set up distinct ringers for different callers 
 but a lot of people expected it to be and thus the wildly conflicting reviews posted by customers.  The sci-fi in this book is really light and anyone who has even a modicum of interest/knowledge of the genre will understand the basic concepts (tachyons, time travel, etc.). The novel is really about PEOPLE, not the sci-fi, and how they deal with implications of time-travel, ecological disaster, and competition for resources.  The main characters are likable and somewhat tragic, people muddling through their careers, fumbling toward meaning in their lives amidst chaos around them. Though the novel is dated (having been published in 1980), it still has relevant topics for our time.  I would suggest reading this book if you are interested in the human side of sci-fi, but personally, I thought the time-travel aspect was well done and not over the top, with just enough mystery there to make it real.  It reminded me somewhat of The Gods Themselves by Isaac Asimov in which communication between a whole other dimension and humans was tricky at best. 
 This book has its flaws.  As other reviewers have noted, it is rambling and disjointed.  While I believe that his facts are mostly right, there are points where he may have come to the wrong conclusion because of a lack of familiarity with aid processes.  Certainly, he over-generalizes based on anecdotal evidence.  Aid in Somalia is probably not exactly the same thing as aid in Chile.  The existence of some venal people in an organization does not mean that everyone in an organization is venal.  Maren is too quick to dismiss people as acting only in their own self-interest, even to the point of being internally inconsistent.  He spends a lot of time passing out blame, and not always where it belongs.  While he is pretty sure that NGOs should be blamed for carrying out bad projects, he doesn't seem to realize that they are under contract with USAID.  USAID can terminate projects unilaterally; NGO sub-contractors can't, both legally and practically.  On the one hand, he steams about patronizing attitudes towards Africans, and, on the other hand, says that it was "not their fault" that recipients stole aid funds in massive amounts, but the fault of those who made aid available to them.  (What could be more patronizing than assuming that adults can't be held responsible for their own behavior?)  Does the fact that aid workers have to convince Congress to give them funding by pointing out the advantages to the U.S. and legislators' constituents really mean that the aid workers were never serious about their humanitarian goals?  The fact that it sometimes reads more like angry blurting than balanced or reasoned scholarship is a shame, because there is a lot of good material here and good points being made.  But it is important to read, particularly now, where there is  renewed clamoring for more funds for aid to meet the Millennium Development Goals.  Maren clearly, accessibly and authoritatively explains why more money does not equal more development; worse, can be destructive.  These points are made elsewhere by others, but are usually buried in dry academic papers that speak in euphemisms.  Anyone who wants to work in development should read this book.  Maren can be forgiven for being angry.  
 My daughters and I love this CD.  It is fun to sing along and we have a great time listening to it.  I think that the songs provide my children with exposure to older music which is much different from the sounds they usually listen to.  We really enjoy it for how fun and invigorating it is to listen to 
 James Arnt Aune's Selling the Free Market provides a key to the rhetoric of economic correctness and will greatly appeal to college-level students of economics, examining the 'economically correct' language of conservatives and examining how the free market rhetoric has become part of social and political debates across the country. Key principles of free-market economics are provided 
 I have The First Epistle to the Corinthians(Gordon Fee), and The Gospel According to John (Leon Morris) so far. This is the best commentary I have found anywhere! I wish I could afford the whole set at once, but I will collect them all eventually. This will sit alongside Kittel's Theological Dictionary New Testament as some of my most treasured possessions 
 Nora Roberts' blended talents branch into writing romance, mystery, action scenes, etc. and they are all present in this great read. I also loved the feisty 'twin' character who shows how opposite sisters can be as far as personality. There's also a strong portrayal of women as survivors and not just victims. The tension is high, and though I had some ideas, I did not figure out who the killer was until the very end. Chrissy K. McVay author of 'Souls of the North Wind 
 Do buy this book (even if you have the old edition), but also buy the 1995 book The Safe Shopper's Bible (co-authored by Steinman), and when the two disagree on an individual food item (as they do in a number of cases), believe the one with the most toxic rating, rather than believing the new edition. Here's why.  I own the 1990 edition, and the Safe Shopper's Bible, and have just received a copy of this new edition, and while I have only spent an hour or so comparing the three, unfortunately there are definite indications that this update was done in a rather uncareful manner.  Yes, there are differences between the 1990 and present editions; some foods have been moved from one safety category (e.g., Green Light) to another (e.g., Yellow Light). And when this has been done, the reason is usually noted in the book, which is also helpful.  While relatively few entries are affected by such enhancements, they are no doubt valuable enough to justify buying the new edition, even if you already have the old one. And, of course, if you don't have the old one, you absolutely need this book.  However, I do not believe that this new book is the result of a comprehensive re-review of the available government testing results and/or other current information. I say this for the following reason (based on an analysis of the section covering seafood):  1. Most of the entries in the new edition are copied verbatim from the 1990 edition.  2. Updated, and conflicting, information to some of these copied entries appeared in the seafood section of the 1995 book Safe Shopper's Bible (co-authored by Steinman), which indicates to me that new information became available at that time.  3. Despite the changed information in the 1995 book, in many cases the (apparently outdated) information from the 1990 entry is copied, verbatim, into this "twenty-first century" edition of the work, without any note indicating that there was a return back from its status of 1995.  Here are some examples:  1. The Green Light section of this new book lists Halibut as follows:  "Halibut from Alaska, California, and Iceland is virtually pollution free, although your best bet is Alaskan or Icelandic halibut. Halibut is a moderate mercury accumulator. Some Los Angeles-area halibut may be tainted with PCBs."  This entry is identical to the one in the 1990 edition of the book.  However, the 1995 Safe Shopper's Bible lists Halibut from California as a Red Light fish (the worst possible rating). The listed contaminants supporting that rating are DDT, DDE, DDD and PCBs.  This important update is nowhere reflected in the new edition, which has the older (and conflicting) information. Why go back to the original information? Is it possible that California Halibut suddenly got better? Perhaps, but it seems more likely that the text of the old edition was simply thoughtlessly propagated into the new one, despite the availability of new (and conflicting) information.   2. This new edition lists Salmon in its Green Light section as follows:  "Salmon from Ireland and the United Kingdom is virtually pollution free."  "Pacific salmon (chum, king, silver, sockeye) from Alaska, California, Oregon, and Washington is virtually pollution free."  This is, once again, a verbatim copy from the 1990 edition.  However, in the 1995 Safe Shopper's Bible, Salmon (Pacific Coast) and Salmon (Imported) are both listed as Yellow Light fish. The listed contaminants warranting that designation are Benzene Hexachloride, DDT, DDE, DDD, Dioxin, Lindane and PCBs.  I noticed similar discrepancies for Milkfish, Mullet, Striped bass, and Trout, among others. Mullet was particularly disturbing, since the (copied) entry in the new book not only lists imported Mullet as a Green Light fish, but in the Red Light section, where it lists domestic Mullet, it makes a special note that "however, imported mullet is quite clean." By contrast, in the 1995 Safe Shopper's Bible, "Mullet (imported)" is listed as a Red Light fish, due to the presence of "DDT, DDE, DDD."  Perhaps there was some massive improvement in mullet between 1995 and 2006, but more likely, the verbatim repetition of those entries in the new edition was just the result of propagating them with insufficient attention to more recent information, including even information previously published by the author.  Another disappointment is that a large number of fish listed in the Safe Shopper's Bible are nowhere to be found in the new edition of Diet for a Poisoned Planet. Why would the author not have merged the information available from both of his older works? Some examples of missing entries: Anchovies and sardines, both Green Light in the Safe Shopper's Bible.  Hopefully, now you see why you need the Safe Shopper's Bible in addition to this latest edition of Diet for a Poisoned Planet. You can't afford to get into a snit about somehow punishing the author for delivering what may be a sub-par update. This work is too important, and there is nothing else that I have found that could ever replace it. Just give the guy credit for all of the wonderful work he has done in the past, and admit that you slip up from time to time yourself, and then buy both of these books and use them in good health 
 This two disc set rates 5 stars for the music and choreography.  The highlight of the set is the "Rip It Up" dance number from Don't Knock The Rock.  The dancing in this number is absolutely amazing.  I watched this sequence about 5 times over two days.    The second best moment is the "See You Later Alligator" sequence from Rock Around the Clock.  Again, great song and great choreography.  All in all, a great set that didn't disappoint me.  
 This book pits two people against eachother for a house and its tough to decide whom to vote for. A poor woman gets thrown out of her house and her house is bought by an Iranian ex-colonel who is trying to realize the Amercian dream for his family. At first, I yearned for the woman to get her home back but as you lean more and more about the Iranian family, I sympathized with them as well 
 For everyone going on about this "Mortal Coil" song -- it wasn't even in the movie!!!  It was only used in the trailer and a few TV ads.  This soundtrack has the score music that is actually IN the film, and it's awesome, disturbing, moody stuff.  If you like atmospheric music from horror movies, this is a soundtrack for you!  Steve Jablonsky's music gives me the creeps.  And that's a good thing 
 George writes convincingly about the need to remove the landlord from the equation when dealing with industrial ownership and taxation. He argues that the private ownership of land should be the sole source of government revenue, releasing trade from the shackles of corporate taxation, individuals from income and other indirect taxes and shifting the burden to the landed classes. It seems a justifiable premise to charge landlords for the land they occupy as inevitably land values rise only as a consequence of society as a whole and not due to anything the landlord contributes. Businesses pay ever increasing rents to a landlord who cares little whether that business is profitable or not. George proposes a single land tax but fails to answer the socialist question about industrial democracy and worker's particpation and control 
 I have close to thirty Christmas CDs, the "best of the best" I have come across over the years.  This recording, which I have owned at various times on cassette, LP and CD, is one of my all-time favorites.  When Sony f-i-n-a-l-l-y released it and the follow-up Volume 2 on CD, I was ecstatic and snatched up copies right away.  I'm glad I did.  This recording has rightly taken its place as a Sony CD catalog "standard".  Sadly, Sony has not done the same with Volume 2, which is as good if not better in some aspects as Volume 1.  Hopefully continued steady sales of Volume 1 will eventually convince Sony to re-release Volume 2, or, perhaps, create a two-disc "Music of Christmas" collection 
 `Insatiable' is a collection of anecdotal memoirs by Ms. Gael Greene of the overshadowingly broad brimmed hats and long time food writer and restaurant critic of `New York' magazine. While the 51 chapters do touch on Ms. Greene's life before `New York', they generally stay very close to their `New York' wellspring, her column, named `The Insatiable Gourmet' by magazine editor in chief, Clay Felker.  The most immediate comparison which comes to mind is to the three volumes of memoirs by current `Gourmet' editor in chief, Ruth Reichl who, for several years, sat in Craig Claiborne's chair as principle restaurant reviewer for `The New York Times' and whose most recent book, `Garlic and Sapphires' deals entirely with her `New York Times' restaurant reviews and her tactics for maintaining her anonymity while in the hunt for excellence at New York's finer eateries. And, as similar as these two women's careers may be, the differences make both bodies of work that much more interesting.  While Reichl, the younger of the two by at least a decade, grew up in New York City and learned French at a very early age, her professional culinary journalistic career was shaped on the west coast, firmly under the influence of the American food vanguard lead by the California vintners, Alice Waters, Jeremiah Tower, and Wolfgang Puck. Greene grew up in provincial Detroit, but had her culinary instincts formed by the emerging community of French restaurants in New York City. Her center of culinary gravity was in the dining rooms, kitchens, and cellars of the great French culinary establishment. She even admits that she came late to the California culinary movement. To her credit, as soon as she had her first experience of Alice Waters' cuisine at `Chez Panisse', she recognized that there was something important going on by the Pacific coast.  Reichl's first two volumes of memoirs are more strictly biographical than `Insatiable' in that they are strictly chronological. Reichl's revelations about her life are also unusual to me, at the time, for the remarkable candor about her sexual life. Madame Reichl was a Den Mother compared to Ms. Greene, whose title refers not only to her culinary appetites, but to her sexual appetites as well. I won't dwell on this much, but her exploits make me and most average Americans feel like monks or nuns in comparison.  These sexual exploits include dozens of famous figures from the culinary world, but they also include several notables from Hollywood. As a hint, I will reveal that Ms. Greene tells the tales of how she landed in bed with two very big leading men, both of whom appeared together on the cover of `Time' magazine. And yet, Ms. Greene can be remarkably circumspect about the details of many liaisons.  It is interesting to see the difference in reaction to some of the major figures both have met. Danny Kaye appears in both narratives, however, he is a much bigger part in Ms. Greene's story, as does James Beard, Julia Child, Craig Claiborne, Pierre Franey, and M.F.K. Fisher, as Ms. Greene was able to encounter all these people while they were still at or near their prime, unlike Ms. Reichl, who did not arrive in the `big time' at the `Times' until most of these people were retired or gone. The stories regarding Danny Kaye are especially nice, as I have been pining for more information on his culinary abilities ever since I read Ms. Reichl's report of a dinner he prepared in his custom build `kitchen theatre'.  Ms. Greene also fills in a lot of information on some of the more romantically interesting figures in the culinary world. For example, when one reads other accounts of the lives of  `Le Bernardin' founders, Gilbert and Maguy LeCoze, you are left with the feeling that their closeness can only be explained by a particularly `unnatural' sexual relation. Miss Gael assures us in no uncertain terms that both Gilbert and Maguy were decidedly conventional (At least for young French natives) in their sexual behavior, each with their own one or more partners, including, for Gilbert, Ms. Greene herself now and then. She also sheds light on the fact that suspicions to the contrary, Pierre Franey was a complete heterosexual, with no erotic connection to culinary colleague, the well-known homosexual, Craig Claiborne.  One feature of New York dining on which Ms. Greene and Ms. Reichl agree is that most of the high end venues are far too inclined to give preferential treatment to favorite customers, most of which are celebrities. One of the most disagreeable cases appears in the chapter about the literary watering hole, `Elaine's' which became popular among celebs almost by accident, when `Harper's' editor Nelson Aldrich (not even Nelson Algren), wandered in and stayed awhile, bringing a few other literary luminaries along in later visits. And, while we are less likely to be inconvenienced by this, this is just as true of Parisian venues as those in the Big Apple.  Like Ms. Reichl, Ms. Greene sprinkles in a few recipes here and there, after every second or third chapter. These are interesting, but I found her passing remarks about dishes within her text to be far more evocative, as when one New York maestro filled a baked potato with creamed chipped beef and how Gilbert LeCoze prepared such simple fish dishes, because he never received the kind of training which showed him how to do elaborate preparations (Under Eric Ripert, `Le Bernardin' is still a temple to simple, fresh fish cooking).  While Ms. Reichl's last book may be more interesting to the serious foodie as it deals in much more detail with the specific restaurants, reviews, and events surrounding her researches, Ms. Greene's book has far more interesting and far more lascivious information about the lives and loves of the culinary great in New York and France.  A delicious tart of a read! 
 I love this movie. This has got to be one of my all-time favorites. It's hilariously funny and every time I watch it I get this fuzzy feeling inside and it makes me go 'Squee! 
 Guillermo del Toro (who directed last years phenomenal Pan's Labyrinth) seems to be at his best when dealing with the paranormal; indeed, he has the uncommon gift of making the fantastic seem plausible. This film contains some of the most haunting and believable images I've seen on screen, and their efficacy was heightened by the director's understanding of when enough is enough. Ghost stories of any kind fail when the real or imagined ghost is absurdly presented. Most of today's contemporary "Master's of Horror" fail miserably.  It is 1939, and the Spanish Civil War is in its final days. Carmen and Doctor Casares run an orphanage for boys (one does wonder, why no girls?). The institution has a remarkable feature: in the middle of the courtyard is a bomb, the tip of which is embedded firmly in the ground. The bomb fell from the sky during a raid, but never exploded. It sits there, disarmed yet immovable, as a reminder of the violence in the outside world.  Carlos, a ten year old, is left at the orphanage, and though Carmen argues that they have no resources for more children, she accepts him and assigns him to bed number twelve, the bed that Santi slept in until the day he disappeared, which was the same day that the bomb fell from the sky. Carlos, predictably, begins to see visions and shadows, and at first, it isn't understood whether these come from his mind or if they are real. One night, a shadow tempts him from behind a bed curtain, and when Carlos pulls the curtain back, the shadow is gone. But the pitchers of water in the boys' room have fallen from their stands and break, and when the other children awaken, Carlos and Jaime each take a pitcher to refill in the kitchen. Carlos sees footprints in the spilled water. When the boys reach the kitchen, Jaime pumps water for his pitcher, and waits outside for Carlos. As Carlos is pumping, a rack of scissors in the kitchen falls and makes a loud noise. Jacinto (Eduardo Noriega, Open Your Eyes), the young caretaker who was once an orphan himself here, comes to investigate. Carlos flees down into the cellar to hide, and there he encounters the shadow that taunted him. He is touched by his phantom in the cellar, and we see, before anyone else, that this image is real. It is a boy, no older than Carlos, with the upper left portion of his forehead cracked open, and pale, blood seeping upwards as if the body was underwater. After touching Carlos, the ghost quickly disappears, but a voice says, "Many of you will die."  It is a prophecy that demands fulfillment.  There is gold in the orphanage, gold that Carmen and Casares give to those that will be called Nationalists, in support of their cause. Jacinto knows of this gold, and he wishes to steal it for himself. Not only is he bedding Conchita, the beautiful young cook (and Jaime's wide-eyed crush), but he is also taking Carmen as a bedmate. It is an unusual coupling; Carmen was the principal when Jacinto was an orphan there, and she has a wooden leg that she must set aside to accept him. (Some small irony there.) When they partner, Jacinto takes and replaces one key from her large ring of keys to see if it will be the one to open the safe that holds the gold.  With Jacinto, a ghost may be the least of their worries.  This is an excellent film, one better appreciated on the second viewing. I've heard it compared to The Others, but I doubt such comparisons would have been made if the director and writer of The Others, Alejandro Amenabar, was not also Mexican. While they are both ghost stories, they operate under completely different rules. I highly recommend this.  4½ stars rounded up to five for the convincing "paranormals". 
 Wanna know the dirty little secrets of our presidents? This is the book. With 5 or 6 pages on each guy, every president has some tidbits of bad press on them. You know about Bill Clinton, Nixon and JFK. Now you can snark at Taft, FDR and even Lincoln.  This book is a light but fun read. It's style is light hearted and irreverant. Hey, Presidents are human, too, you know 
 Excellent personal facial groomer and easy to use. Nice clean shave and no, your facial hair does not grow back thicker after you have shaved. Make-up foundations and moisterziers go on so much better and look flawless on. I will never wax or use cream hair remover again. 
 I think this is an excellent quality product for the price.  It is very sturdy and extremely lightweight.  It does have a few cons though.  The visor is pretty much useless, as it doesn't fit good enough to block much sun.  Also, I wish it reclined just an inch more.  Otherwise, it is pretty great 
 This book contains some of Orwell's best essays, including "A Hanging" and "Shooting an Elephant", which describe his experiences as a policeman in Burma in the twenties, and "Inside the Whale", in which he discusses Henry Miller's "Tropic of  Cancer" and other literature of the thirties. You can browse through  it and discover what Orwell thought about poverty in England, the Spanish  Civil War, fascism in Europe, the lead-up to the second world war, and  lighter subjects such as what boys' comics were like at the time. The  numerous letters to friends and colleagues provide a fascinating glimpse  into Orwell's private life and his views on a wide range of subjects 
 When I was first interested in learning about Judaism I really didn't know much. This book was recommended to me, so I got it. I kind of liked the first part and found some good information, but I got very bogged down just over half way through when it started to get into the ritual a bit more. I didn't really understand what I was reading so I put it down.   After some years and learning from other sources I picked this up again. I was amazed at how my perspective had changed. It suddenly had meaning and I find myself going back to it again and again for guidance and understanding in many areas.   If you are new to Judaism, you might have a hard time with this book, like I did (I found "To Pray as a Jew" even harder), but if you know a bit from other sources and you are really interested in really understanding and remembering the details this is a very good source.   Here is an excerpt to demonstrate how difficult it can be to understand, but how there are gems therein:   "A Jewish definition of holiness may be put in these terms: Holiness does not lie in the ascetic, saintly withdrawal from life, or in excessive denial to oneself of all human pleasures, of in the repression of all human drives. It consists, rather, of full participation in the stream of human community life, sharing the joyous as well as the sorrowful experiences which life has to offer, denying to oneself no legitimate pleasures; but at the same time so developing one's sense of discernment as to be able to distinguish and choose the right from the wrong, the true from the false, the good from the bad, the sacred from the profane, the pure from the impure, and the clean from the unclean. The greater the sense of ethical-moral-religious discrimination, the greater the holiness of the individual."  If you have trouble with this book I would recommend you skip the parts that are difficult for you or just put it aside for a while, but keep it nearby because it is very useful later. Many think of it as a classic. I don't think you'll find a compilation of information like this anywhere else. There is no book I'd recommend in its place. 
 I read the other posts and I really agree with the reviewers who say this book is great for beginners. It walks you step by step through every feature and function, with cool full-color illustrations. It takes the fear out of a fairly intimidating program.  I learned an amazing amount about the program in less than an hour. The book shows you all of the special effects for audio and video, as well as all of the transitions in a way that's easy to understand. It also shows you how to use all of the panels, which initially I found really confusing.  The book is the perfect primer to help you get started with this software. Adobe should hire Plumer to write their books. It actually makes using the software seem fun! 
 I had been searching web site after web site for a system like this.  I finally found a site where I could purchase seperate parts for a comparable system.  However, the receivers alone were more than this unit( If you wanted a receiver compatible with a plasma).  This works great.  Could not be easier to install.  All components are in my basement.  I ran the eye through the wall and have the eye barely exposed through a single cable face plate, with the blue led light taped to the back of the plate.  The blue light still shines through the faceplate, which is perfect. The faceplate is just below my wall mounted plasma set.  No interference.  This set up allows me to use this system at just about any angle in the room and the adjacent kitchen.  Works great with a basic $20 all in one ir remote. Also, the customer service is like no other.  I had several questions and each e-mail was answered by the next day with great help.  Made this purchase a no brainer. This is one product that far exceeded my expectations even after reading all the great reviews.  I highly recomend this product. 
 I bought the plates, bowls, cups, etc. to go with my fiestaware because I like to mix and match my patterns to create a colorful, festive table to suit my mood for myself or entaining dinner guests.  The colors are actually more vivid and brighter than the pictures show on Amazon and the merchant's website.  I have tangerine, sunflower, cinnabar, persimmon, scarlet and shamrock in the fiesta. This set would also go well with the periwinkle and plum colors as well. Hopefully, they can find a way to create a more accurate picture of the colors. I have had the Santa Fe set for a few weeks now and using them in microwave and dishwasher is no problem. That said, if you like to mix n' match colors with Fiestaware or want a nice sturdy dinnerware set with lots of color, than this santa fe style is it 
 I love this little book. I only wish Mr. Machiavelli had written more - much more. One word says it all: honest. This book tells it like it is. Not for the politically correct, but for those who appreciate an honest take on politics and government. If you love books that say it like it is, no matter the politics, then you'll likely enjoy this small book. Amazingly refreshing for 1530 AD. Like I said above, I only wish Mr. Machiavelli had written more 
 Stephen Kinzer writes a great history book that reads like a spy thriller. He details the rise of oil and the importance it has for the west in the two World Wars and the fact that the British were unwilling to give up control of the Iranian Oil Fields.  Eventually, American policy formulated by the Dulles brothers, leads the American CIA into overthrowing Mossadegh's government in 1953 and putting the Shah into power. For about 26 years the Shah runs Iran, but the inner frustration and anger towards American involvement into Iranian politics results in the 1979 hostages taken in Tehran. Kinzer does an excellent job with the details of the CIA and British intelligence as he clearly describes what was going on with the Iranians, the British and the Americans throughout the overthrow of Mossadegh.  If you want to find out why Iran views the British and the United States governments with such disdain, this book will open your eyes to what occurred 50 years ago and why terrorism today has its roots in our involvement in Iranian political affairs of that time 
 background. I read a copy that was printed in the mid-60's a few years ago. I was a brand new born-again christian coming out of a Roman Catholic background. I understand that things are changing in the catholic church, praise God, but at the time,not much was said about God's grace, and this book helped me out of the religious baggage I had brought with me.Don't get me wrong, I am a bible believing christian, a former youth leader for a Foursquare denomination church, and I plan to do missionary work.This book is not about just doing whatever you feel like, but it is a rich, easy to read explanation of the Book of Romans that examines all the religious things that we do to try to please God so he gets off our backs, or so that we can feel superior to others. This book does a great job of going through Romans and examining our relationship with Christ. It is engaging for the intelligent as it covers the concepts in Romans which are God-breathed, and it is written in an easy to read manner. I have lent this book to many different kinds of people and they were all able to receive from it.It is wonderful for those who came from a legalistic christian background who are just begining to know Christ, so that they can know the freedom that is in Christ 
 Meghan White makes this DVD one of the best workout DVDs I have ever bought. Her personality shines and makes everything flow smoothly. She really connected with me and I just love the way she explains and describes the exercises. 
 The satire isn't as harsh, and the humor isn't as brilliant as you will find in Austen's major works, but don't let that stop you from enjoying this little book.  It's a charming and funny short novel that spoofs gothic fiction and romantic sentiment in a way that is surprisingly modern. Although the novel is full of subtle references to Jane Austen's favorite (and least favorite) books, you don't need to know anything about them to enjoy the story. Think of it as a teen comedy with moments of slapstick, lots of offbeat humor, and social embarassment galore, and you will be right in the spirit of Northanger Abbey.  Some of the customs and vocabulary in the book are out of date, of course. But most of it will be easy to understand even without footnotes, (although it's nice to have them handy if you need them). Austen's wonderful talent for dialogue still makes this little novel a treat to read. I have re-read Northanger Abbey every year since I was a teenager myself, and I still smile all the way through it!  
 I have found the National Geographic Traveler books to be ideal when planning a visit to a city.  The San Francisco book seems up to the usual standards.  These books cover the more interesting attractions, including some great photos, and are organized by area, which makes it easier to select what you want to see and plan your days.  Another feature which should not be overlooked is the section in the back, which recommends some excellent restaurants. 
  I was so happy to find this for my boyfriend, I had shopped at several  local video stores on search of this DVD, which is my boyfriends favorite movie. It was delivered quickly at a great price and we are very happy 
 This was actually the second Tom Waits album that I bought, on the same day as I bought my first (Mule Variations). So when I listened to Mule Variations, then Real Gone, I was intrigued, but also a little intimidated. This music was so out there, so fitting for the title, and being a new Tom Waits fan, I thought I had to give the rest of his work a try to fully understand this album. Now it has been almost a year, and I own almost everything he has released and seen him twice live, and can finally believe that I know enough about him to do this album review justice. This album is incredible, but for completely different reasons as say Rain Dogs, or Bone Machine, this album is another example of Tom Waits never stopping, never changing his style. This album when compared musically to his other albums is completely unique, if compared to his debut Closing Time there is almost no resemblance. The focal point over the years has shifted more towards percussion, to the point where this album actually has beat-boxing on it. Not to mention absolutely no piano, which is a huge turning point in Waits' career. Lyrically, he keeps it rather similar, which proves to work because if the lyrics were as different as the music was, it might be hard for fans to even relate. Some of the craziest vocals of his whole career are found of this album, as well as one of (in my opinion) his most haunting love songs of his career "Green Grass." This song, to me, shows how his thoughts have been shifting, and the thought of death getting between him and his wife-it is brilliant. This album should be in every Tom Waits collection, it is a representative look at how far he has come, and just why he has the cult following that he does. This album is different from any album that I have ever heard, and my only hope is that he continues to make music, because in my opinion he is one of the best songwriters alive, if not the best 
 It is both useful for graduates and for undergraduates.  Explanations are easy to follow but at the same time they don't lack detail or correctness. The book is full of examples and it covers different fields of OR.  For me, the best is Rardin's approach to teach OR: he begins from the base and he builds newer contents over that base. In this way, you feel like "that works!". And for graduates, there are some sections called "primers" where Rardin explains subjects outside the scope of the book, but very useful for beginners.  The book is very well written. A good big effort 
 Very good, with clear and concise language, a must for who's seeking an airline crew job 
 This will be my favorite cookbook along with her other Quick & Healthy Volume II cookbook. My children even like the recipes! Best of all I'm losing weight while enjoying good food. I especially like all of the nutrition information and the Menus and Time Saving Ideas presented in this book. 
 Well written and adequate for the student of pharmacy. However for this audience I would recommend Wilson and Gisvold's Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical chemistry 11th Ed, because the figures and text are more complete providing a clearer more concise and rigorous treatment of the subject 
 Eyewitness Auschwitz is the story of the author's three year journey through the hell that was the gas chambers at Auschwitz.  Although not a literary masterpiece, Eyewitness provides us with an invaluable and in depth look at what life and death were like in the horrific world that was Auschwitz.  How someone was able to survive under these conditions for three years and keep their sanity is a wonder.  The only characters missing in the book were Dante and the Devil, both of whom surely would have felt right at home in this living hell.  This is a book that must be read by all 
 Whoever wrote the "Spotlight" review at the top...Half a Loaf?  Are you kidding me?!  This set is AWESOME!  I don't know what he was expecting!  No Dirtbombs?  Gories?  White Stripes?  Well, the booklet even says that they had to draw the line somewhere and some of these groups will have to be on the GRANDCHILDREN OF NUGGETS collection!!!    Don't let anyone tell ya otherwise, this set (100 songs) is awesome.  The categories "Psychedelic," "Garage" and "Paisley Underground" describe exactly what this set seeks out:  jangling guitars, Byrdsian melodies, and attitude!  I have two other Rhino sets, "Punk Rebellion" and "Left of the Dial," both of which I love.  I find this one even better.  I haven't heard of 90% of these bands (and I THOUGHT I was pretty knowledgable!), and even if I had heard of the band I had only heard a few of the tunes out of all 100 presented (most notably The La's, "There She Goes").  This is a superb set and I really recommend you give it a shot 
 This book was about Sister bear and Brother bear go to school for the first time. Sister bear is in her own class for the first time and she is very scared. I would recommend this story to a 6 or 7 year old because it is good beginner book. The moral of the story is not to be afraid the first time you go to school 
 I use the mattress on a Camp Time roll-a-cot which is the best cot around because it doesn't have end bars. This mattress makes the whole setup like floating on a cloud. I think I'll spend most of my time while camping in bed instead of fishing!! It rolls up pretty big though. The straps work well to make a good bedroll. I bought som 30 inch duffels to use as a storage sack for extra protection 
 I have been buying this brand of boneless and skinless sardines for years and still love to just open a can and eat them for a snack.  I know that being boneless and skinless lowers the calcium level but I've never liked the crunch or taste of eating a whole sardine right from the sea. And they are packed in olive oil which is loaded with Omega 3's too so it's as good for you as are the sardines.  However, I am not so sure about their actual mercury levels.  Buying them from Amazon with their $10. off sale on $49. purchases is a great price.  I've even found that many of the local grocery stores as well as Costco and BJ's NO longer carry this product.  Or their price has skyrocketed.  It's great to be able to stock pile them from Amazon.  If you like sardines, you'll love these! And they are just so nutritious for us all 
 The first one was the best. But this one is pretty good too. At least you get to see John Travolta move his hips along to Elvis' songs around the Baby Gym!  The babies mouths tend to move while Bruce Willis and Roseanne Barr do the voice-overs. Because of that, it can get very distracting.  Other than that, this movies is, as well, a very adorable one and a keeper 
 In this Christian legal novel, several trials take place in and out of the courtrooms.  The central courtroom trial is of a sixteen-year-old girl, Tara Bannister, who has incriminated herself in the death of her abusive stepfather.  This is the first criminal case in which Leslie Connors, the protagonist serves as lead council.  Leslie vacillates in her belief with her client's claim of self defense.  Seeking the truth, she develops various theories, and in her attempts to prove them, she makes some sordid discoveries.  She simultaneously undergoes several personal trials, including the onset of a serious heart condition.  The events in both her professional & personal capacities  present her with consequential, ethical choices.  Her quest for truth extends beyond her criminal case, to consider the claims of Christianity.    Meanwhile, Brad Carson, Leslie's fiancé & legal partner, represents a client claiming to be aggrieved by a staged sham of a reality television show, but this case is of minor relevance in light of the significant trial that transpires in Brad's heart, where the self-incrimination of an innocent man, Jesus Christ, is on trial.  He has difficulty grasping the idea of reparations being made on behalf of others, but comes to learn that this is only possible through unconditional love.  I was surprised that Randy Singer, being a man, chose to write in the first person, present tense for this heroine.  Doing so required detailed depiction of the thoughts, emotions and observations of a woman, which must have been exceptionally challenging.  At the outset, I was unsure if Singer could pull this off convincingly, but I quickly found myself captivated by the heroine, with her eloquent narration from a feminine perspective.  This demonstrated Singer's incredible talent. 
 This album has some great songs that aren't recorded on any other albums. My favorite songs on this album are "History of our love", "Without love", and "Death". This is defintely some of Daniel's best work. I bought this album years ago and listened to it once and threw it in a box. A few months ago, I pulled it out and listened to it again. I couldn't believe I didn't give this gem the listen it deserves before. Here is an example of some great lyrics in "Death".  "I wanted to be free / but the world was like a prison to me / when you're all alone in the darkness you can't see / maybe you can get the gist of me / it hurts to be alone / it hurts to be alone."  Don't listen to the album from the beginning. Listen to the three songs above. You will be hooked then you will give some of the other songs a chance and they really are great like "sublime groove" and "nothing." These songs aren't on any other album. I think this album and "Yip/Jump Music" are Daniel's best albums 
 This isn't my favorite Tracy Chapman album, that will always be her self-titled debut, but this album has lots of good songs on it as well. My favorite thing about this album is that it has "the promise" on it which is my absolute favorite of all her songs. "the promise" is a hauntingly beautiful love song that never fails to bring tears to my eyes, I'd recommend this cd for that track alone, but the rest of the album definitely won't disappoint either 
 Dr. Bob Mendelsohn was a friend.  All three of his books have very useful information.  Read any of them.  Learn very good information from a very good man.   
 The first CD from Reckless Kelly Records (RKs 3rd) seems to have something for everyone.  A couple of almost balladesque songs and a couple that lean more toward the rocking side of what the band calls their "hick rock" sound.  Regardless, every song has that Reckless Kelly touch.  Willie writes some great (some sad and some hilarious) lyrics about heartache from both sides of the coin, all to that great RK sound

 LIKE MANY READERS WHO SEEK TO IMPROVE THEMSELVES I OWN DOZENS OF THESE SELF HELP, PHILOSOPHICAL, INSPIRATIONAL, NEW AGE BOOKS AND THIS IS ONE OF THE THREE I CONSTANTLY GO BACK TO. I`M ON THE WEB NOW ORDERING ANOTHER  COPY. MY ORIGINAL COPY IS SO WORN IT`S FALLING APART. AT FIRST THE NAME OF  THIS BOOK KIND OF TURNED ME OFF BUT SOMETHING LED ME TO BUY IT (DIVINE  INTERVENTION?). I`LL CUT TO THE CHASE AND SIMPLY SAY THIS BOOK IS FULL OF  EYE OPENING, THOUGHT PROVOKING AND INVALUABLE INFORMATION. I CONTINUE TO  USE IT DAILY FOR MEDITATION-INSPIRATION. I DON`T SUGGEST MANY BOOKS BUT  THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST FOR ANYONE SEEKING THEIR OWN DIVINITY.      AS YOU  READ EARLIER REVIEWS YOU WILL NOTICE SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS HAVE REMARKED THE  BOOK TO BE "BLASPHEMOUS", "TERRIBLE" AND  "FALSE". MANY TRADITIONALISTS MAY FIND IT TO BE AND MANY  TRADITIONALISTS HAVE SIMPLY ACCEPTED THEIR FAITH WITHOUT QUESTION. HOW  UNFORTUNATE. THIS IS A BOOK THAT CHALLENGES YOU TO BE EVERYTHING YOU`VE  EVER IMAGINED AND SHOWS YOU HOW. THE DECISION IS UP TO YOU. THE OTHER TWO  BOOKS I SUGGEST TO READ ALONG WITH THIS IS, DISCOVER THE POWER WITHIN BY  ERIC BUTTERWORTH AND MANIFEST YOUR DESTINY BY DR. WAYNE DYER. TERRIFIC  STUFF. HAPPY READING NAMAST 
 "Mad scientist" Dr. Edward Pretorius has created a resonator machine which can reveal a parralel dimension by stimulating the pineal gland in the brain which perceives the lurkers beyond who lie in wait. Parasitic creatures swim through the ether attracted by movement and light. It is claimed that the pineal gland in the cerebrum is responsible for sixth sense function, and is essentially the parapsychological bit of grey matter.  When Dr. Katheryn McMichaels discovers Pretorius' assistant Crawford Tillinghast who was misdiagnosed with schizophrenia, incarcerated in a mental hospital, she remands him into her custody to recreate the experiment. Together with cop Buford 'Bubba' Brownlee, the dimension is opened and they are greeted by a nude and subsequently malformed Dr. Pretorius who takes a strong liking to Katherine - both to her horror and ecstasy, for it seems the process also enhances sexual sensitivity as well, and she is awakened to her primal self.  Considering the procedure is largely experimental yet, the scientific method of trial and error is employed to disasterous results, as various creatures who range from eel-like beings to huge worm-like monsters are attracted to the massive electro-magnetic vibrations, and eventually overcome the participants. Pretorius is himself a transmutating beast who attempts to absorb Tillinghast and Katherine, until they eventually barely escape with their lives, though Tillinghast is dramatically effected by this encounter as his pineal stem emerges from his forehead like a "third eye", through which his psychic abilities are amplified, but is also afflicted with an insatiable hunger for brains.  Despite becoming a patient herself scheduled for shock therapy at the hands of a sadistic and resentful rival doctor, Katheryn escapes and returns to the attic of the blighted house to destroy the resonator, but is surprisingly met by Tillinghast who restrains her. He struggles to regain control of his mind, but is eventually ingested by Pretorius, creating a hellish struggle from within the bowels of the creature.  She barely emerges from the nightmare with her life, but at the cost of her own sanity.  For those who enjoy the writings of Lovecraft, From Beyond is both a psychological and horror thriller filled with impressive pyrotechnics and FX creations 
 I've got this limited edition.I Totally enjoyed the movie and the special features but I think you have wrongly advertised this edition because this edition comes in 2 discs. It is also comes with the limited edition signed poster and the letter from the producer. You guys should be more alert and careful in giving the right information to customer next time.  
 The second season of Flintstones is now out on DVD. This set collects the 32 episodes of season 2 (versus the 28 of season 1) onto one set of four DVDs. There's so much great content that one of the DVDs is even double sided!  First off, I have to come clean. I didn't have time to watch all of the episodes. I mean, come on! There's 32 episodes, about 20 minutes long apiece. That's over ten hours, and that doesn't even include the bonus features. What I did instead was watch a couple of episodes, then check out the bonus features.  The episodes themselves have not been remastered or anything, which is good. They still have the film artifacts on them, just as they have in reruns for years. And, unlike Lucas with his movies, I wouldn't have it any other way with the Flintstones.  Of special note for those who haven't picked up season one is the opening theme song. The song wasn't changed to the familiar "Flintstones, meet the Flintstones" until the third year. However, when the episodes were distributed for syndication, the original beginning was stripped off the first and second season episodes, and replaced with the more familiar theme song. So it was neat to hear this old classic.  The bonus features were great as well. The best one was the feature Carved In Stone: The Flintstones Phenomenon. I also enjoyed the classic commercials and Flintstone Art. Oh, and in the Carved In Stone feature they also showed the original pilot, The Flagstones.  All in all, this is a great set for any animation fan to pick up. And if you're a Flintstones fan, it's a must have 
 "Death Comes to the Archbishop" is one of the most moving books I have ever experienced.  In many ways the American Southwest has never been protrayed better than in this Willa Cather.  Quiet as the desert itself, this story evokes the all that is best about the people and the places of that area.  Magical is the best word I can use for this book.  Magical in its evoking of the American Frontier.  Magical in its representation of a humble servant of God.  Magical in Cather's language and images.  Magical in its use of language.  One of my favorite novels.  My introduction to Cather and her unique style.  Whatever happened to writers like this?  Any Cather book is also a treat in audio forms.  The beauty of the language is even more apparent when you can hear the words and the images.  Magic 
 Terence Trent D'Arby is an impressive musician with an expressive, powerful voice.  This CD is an uneven effort, but when the tunes hit, they really hit.  Standouts such as "Turn the Page," "Delicate," and "Frankie and Johnny" more than make up for the weaker tunes 
 One has to read Zubrin to understand the future of manned space flight. He charts out an achievable path to reclaim our destiny, which has been otherwise derailed by self serving politicians and our own success in the cold war.   The Case for Mars is a readable and easily understandable exposition of the Mars Direct plan which will allow us to bootstrap our way to the red planet and beyond without neccessarily depending on bloated agencies of a government which is choking itself in red ink. Mars Direct relies on proven twentieth century technology to launch proven nineteenth century fuel and air plants to achieve a cheap and self perpetuating colony in space.  But his most brilliant exposition is his simple plan to make people WANT to return to space.  We already see the early results of his vision on how to to give incentive for space to private enterprise, via compeditive prizes for reaching stepwise goals. In 2004 we have seen NASA take second place in space related achievement to Burt Rutan's commercial enterprise, Scaled Composites. Following Rutan's successful launch of the X-Prize winning Spaceship One he unveiled his plans for placement of a commercial space station and so we are finally back on the path to space. If Rutan and other commercial adventurers continue to follow Zubrin's steps we may well see our children opening the Martian frontier 
 We loved the movie...Hubby has watched it several times...ONE of the best we have bought in a while. 
 Great handycam.  Fast and easy to use.  We received it at 5pm and used it at 7pm to record a concert.  
 SPIN CONTROL, the sequel to the book Royally Jacked, is awesome. I picked it up expecting it to be your typical, not-as-good-as-the-original sequel, but I enjoyed it just as much as Royally Jacked.  SPIN CONTROL takes place in Vienna, Virginia this time, and it focuses more on the relationship that Val has with her mom and how she deals with her mom's new girlfriend. When Val's friends find out the real reason her parents got divorced, she's surprised to see that they're all supportive of her mom's decision, and they promise not to tell anyone else until Valerie is ready.  Valerie isn't really sure what's going on between her and Georg, but when her friend Christie tells her that she has an opportunity to go out with her longtime crush, David, Val seizes the opportunity. But when the date goes better than expected, Val has to make one of the toughest decisions yet: David or Georg?  SPIN CONTROL is hilarious, cute, and refreshing. Although you know how it will end, it's still a great read.  Overall grade - B 
     The big issue is the statistics. The way the preview read was that the Cardinals batting and pitching stats would be in the book each year. Not so. Just the leader in categories so you do not know a certain players stats like batting average, homers, RBI etc. Same for the pitchers, only top winner, ERA etc. If all the players stats could have been given, at least the years they could be found, this book would be out of sight.  
 This really is a wonderful book. While much of this author's current writing are complete garbage, this book tells the story of the Holocaust like none before it. The language, the illustrations, the expressiveness of the writing, are unmatched. This book can be read and enjoyed by children and adults alike. Everyone should own this quick read 
 This is a wonderful collection of new Celtic music.  It is not a beer-chugging sing-along, but rather a refreshing assortment of reels, jigs and ballads sung by the beautiful voices of these Ladies...I do cherish them 
 They are an excellant value for the price.  They hold alot!  However, due to the size they need to have a little more reinforcement to hold their shape/up 
 I got this for Christmas, and I love it.  In addition to what many others here have said, it's a dreamlike (sometimes nightmarish) rendition of a tour of a haunted Victorian mansion.  It is mostly done with what sounds like classically trained musicians using the most modern of instruments, creating the effect of the Romantic period invading our modern world 
 I really liked The War with Grandpa. I think the book is a good book because I like the part when Peter took Grandpas teeth and Grandpa said "ma fief ma miffing." And I have one question did they make a movie of The War of Grandpa?          
 With just 266 pages of conceptual clarity  the mild and unassuming Friedrich Hayek reveals the bogeyman, Karl Marx, to be the brutish boor that he was.   Marx had no concept of human nature or more specifically, of individual psychology.  Individuals did not exist for Marx, only "classes".  And Marx had no interest in human beings as they now exist, but only as they will come to exist in his imagined utopian future.  In Hayek one senses a genuine fondness for humanity as it now exists.  Hayek realizes that human nature is not perfect and is not perfectible, yet he has a genuine desire to make life better for all people. His humanitarian impulse is behind the political economy he finds necessary and sufficient for the betterment of humankind: capitalism.   I've wrestled with Marx for many years without being able to get a theoretical grip that would pin him down.  The wiry and sinuous thought of Hayek has provided a hammer-lock that Marx can't break. I plan to read, and re-read this little book and will purchase a hard-back edition to better stand up to the wear and tear.  Those readers without some background in economic theory may find this book a bit difficult at times.  My advice, just keep plowing through the pages, skimming where you must.  For the most part the book is quite readable.  And there are so many gems of wisdom the book is well worth the time and expense even if you read and understand just a few pages.  Having said all this, I have not touched on Hayek's economic theory and why I think it superior to Marxist theory.  In the social sciences, as well as the hard sciences, a theory displaces another theory when it better explains the facts.  History is the laboratory of economic theory. Marx's theory that a classless society, communism, would grow out of and replace capitalist society has been proved wrong by the facts of the 19th and 20th centuries.  Hayek's theory that a capitalist economy (given the limits of human nature) is the best system yet known to humanity, has proved to be true.  
 Whether it was because of a low budget or lack of major Hollywood star power, the writing and acting in this movie is phenominal and really hits you every time you watch it. I know that every year when I watch around the beginning of December, it always gives me that warm feeling. Must have for any Christmas movie lover. Harry Deen Stanton is brilliant and really lets you believe he is an angel. Mary Steenburgen plays her stubborn best and it really gets you yelling at the scream, "BELIEVE!!!!" The kids are great and take on very emotional roles and you believe them. Great movie 
 to one of the most multi-layered works of art in existence.  I have wanted to see this opera series for over 20 years, ever since I saw an opera properly prepared by a Wagner fanatic.  Finally, I was in a place where I could, so I turned to the various preparations that I could find.    This short book was indisputably one of the best, and it doesn't shy from bold pronouncements and interpretations.  Lee is a classical scholar of great learning and brings together a huge range of sources in this 100plus-page book.    First, he gives a synopsis.  Then, he interprets it, with full awareness that the reader may disgree.  While the content is covered by other reviewers here, I wanted to say that this added immensely to my experience of this uniquely complex work of near-modern art.  Plus, it is aimed that at erudite admirers, but to those (like me) desperate for an anchor as I approach the unique intensity of Wagner.    While it relies a bit too heavily on depth psychology, which places this interpretation at a certain time, it is never dogmatic and addresses many of the other philosophical ideas that underlie it.  This is my only caveat.  Truly great works of art are re-interpreted by every age, and this one will be too.  In addition, it cannot be the only source one approaches - you need to listen to the music as well, so this is one supplement.  Warmly recommended. 
 This is a book of epic proportions, playing off -- often humorously --the pomposity of British colonials and the grim onset of occupation by the Japanese.  The blindness of the colonials, their arrogance, their disregard of native peoples is delicious, in that the reader know that humility in the form of a ruthless invading Japanese war machine is just over the horizon.  Farrell's ability to place the reader in pre-war Singapore is well-executed.  In the final analysis, nobody comes out looking good -- not the Japanese, not the Brits, not the capitalists, not the communists.  My only criticism is the endless detail the author goes into about the rubber market. I ended up skipping over most of that.  But that did not detract from a wonderful novel 
 Well, the list of games is below so I'm not going to go through it. Having a Commodore 64/128 as a child I played these games in their day. I have a console collection so I loved video games since I was a child. How many levels and full games you could fit in just 64K of memory and 350K disks back then.  Anyway, this collection has some of the most beloved games of that era, at least the ones they could license for use on it. The Epyx games were some of the best of their time, games like Impossible Mission are fun to solve and finish and they are not that easy to solve either. Jumpman, the International Karate and the Epyx games will test your reflexes and abilities to perform exact moves and joystick commands to get higher scores.  I have fun playing with this little piece of gaming history, games are not only about flashy graphics (though they make a difference) but how much fun you get from a game. When I was a kid, I used to dream of the days I could see graphics on games like the ones we see today.  These units can be hacked if you wish to take flash drives with more games, change the game list or even add joysticks and keyboards but that's something you will have to search for and know how to do. A few programmers and technicians who worked with Commodore computers back then found out how to do this and even provide instructions on how perform these modifications if you're skillful enough.  I really like this product and is part of my collection now, the games are not emulated as the C64 motherboard was reengineered and shrunk to the size of a small chip so you're playing the games with 100% reproduction accuracy, I wish I could give it the whole five stars but I'll give it four because the joystick could be a bit more responsive or perhaps like a user mentioned it could be that I have the first version and perhaps this was addressed on the new version.  Overall, a great fun product 
 I love Fiestaware, and I enjoy the cobalt more than any other color.  These Jumbo Cups are lovely and match the rest of my cobalt Fiestaware completely.  They are large enough to hold a great amount of tea.  My only disappointment is that they come just shy of holding an entire standard can of soup.  If you do not remove about four tablespoons worth of soup before cooking in the microwave, the soup will spill.  If the cups had been just a little larger, I wouldn't have to worry about wasting soup.  Otherwise, they are fantastic 
 I love this book. How wild is it that somebody out there came up with the genius idea of teaching us how to be Batman? The Caped Crusader! The leader of the Dynamic Duo! The Dark Knight! Half of World's Finest! The reluctant member of the Justice League!   You get the idea.  How ideal. Bruce Wayne being what Marx would consider a "normal human being," left a magnificent gateway wide open for all of us losers. Sitting around in your underwear all day, unemployed and fat? If you apply yourself, you can be Batman. Getting bullied around by your boss and wife and overbearing friends? Work hard and you too can be Batman. Getting smacked around by sissies smaller than you while women point and laugh? Get your self-respect back by being Batman! This book, written as believably and precisely as possible, does indeed give you everything you could possibly need and more in your quest to stop being the town clown and become the feared vigilante Bob Kane invented you to be....Batman!  It analyzes exactly what you would need and need to do to fashion your own batcave. This book tells you what to put in your utility belt and where to get one. It coaches you on the specifics of training a sidekick and contributing to juvenlie deliquence. You will find out exactly what are the best and most important martial art forms for you to learn in a ten year span and why. Get a cool car! Make your outfit something to be feared! Become an expert detective! Dude...BE BATMAN!! 
 I remember watching Voltron in the mid 80's.  This is one of the best cartoons I've ever seen.  It is a timeless classic! I think it would be just as popular if they aired it on tv today as it was in the mid 80's. They don't make great cartoons like this anymore 
 I found this book to be very enjoyable.....it has humor and a message. We all say things that we don't think will be paid attention but this story tells us that sometimes we say something and when it's repeated we are appalled. When we are respected for it later is a bonus. I think women of all ages would enjoy this story 
 I have read only one of Mr. Grisham's novels, but the nature of this horrible story compelled me to purchase it and devour it in on a recent flight from LA to NYC. This well-told tale of a frightening miscarriage of "justice," occuring not in some third-world country under a despotic military ruler, but in late 20th-century Oklahoma, will leave you shaken to the core of your being. If you are at all familiar with the criminal justice system, and not, as some of the reviewers of this book seem to be, simply by watching "CSI" or other such drivel on television, you will appreciate the skill with which Mr. Grisham researched his material and presented it clearly, concisely, and with a minimum of finger-pointing. That is rare indeed today in the world of non-fiction writers. I also do not understand why some of the reviewers of this book have called is "depressing," or "dark" - it's not a novel, it's real life, folks! And yes, it is about some of the most miserable of human beings, our death row inmates - and there are no clean-cut Hollywood stars, or pretty locations, or sexy starlets to pepper its pages. This is a dirty, blood and guts story out of the heartland of America and should strike fear into the heart of anyone who reads it, as we are all potential victims of a system than can sometimes go terribly awry. As an attorney, I applaud Mr. Grisham for making Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz's story more widely available to the public. It shames the jurisdiction of Ada, Oklahoma and the corrupt police force, prosecutors, and judges who sentenced these innocent men to over ten years behind bars on the flimsiest of evidence while neglecting to pursue the most likely suspect in the crime. Justice? Absolutely not, for even after their charges were dismissed, the only apology they received from the great state of Oklahoma was in the nature of a monetary settlement, and then only after a civil rights suit had been filed on their behalf. This story should be compulsory reading for every law student and attorney in this country - a reminder how much power can corrupt and sway "reasonable men" to commit atrocitices in the name of justice. I rarely give any book a five-star rating, but "The Innocent Man" clearly deserves to be read 
 anyway, yeah, this movie is very well made for the time period(early 80's). it's a literist's and horror aficionados mixed bag of goodies with gore galore and symbolism aplenty! The usual female coming of age story of first experiences with womanhood and the opposite sex and how to tame them and man's eternal struggle with the voracious beast within that wants to "eat" blossoming females.  i could go on, but i think you get the point.  the screenplay was actually written by famed author angela carter who deals with such subjects as children's fairy tales and adult "fairy tales" of sexual politics.  in the end, what difference does it make?  either you become a wolf yourself or become the prey. either way you're dammmmmmnnnnneeddd.... 
 It seems that listeners don't understand that this album is NOT Greg Dulli, nor is it Fila Brazillia.  It is an entirely new and synergistic beast, and this is why it is not called "Fila Brazillia plays Dulli" or something of the like.  This is one of the few albums that I can listen to for hours upon hours, and this is entirely the result of experimentation, collective vision, and a superb analogy between lyric, instrumentation and production.  Somehow, the Twilights are able to combine racking heartache and betrayal with appropriate bittersweetness to create a masterpiece of ephemera.  I constantly feel after listening that I have lost something deep inside -- but found the marrow of myself nevertheless.  Of the songs abounding in the soundtrack I play inside my head, tracks from Twilight invariably pop up out of the blue, and I find myself humming for hours.  It's a truly complex album too -- I'm always finding a note here or there that I never noticed, without which the songs wouldn't quite be the same -- the hallmark of an excellent work.  Quite frankly, this is a beautiful album of true and unfettered emotion -- the layering of sounds only serves to further amplify -- and the segues are fantastic, rivaling perhaps the second side of Abbey Road.  The irony here is the album's ability to make you feel as if you're falling in love despite lyrics such as "tell me where you were."  Again, a bittersweetness that always leaves me wanting more 
 Prime Cuts: There Are No Accidents, They Say Love Is Blind, I'm Not Lisa  Wasting no time, recent high school graduate Erika Jo releases her debut CD in less than a couple of months after she has been crowned 2005 Nashville idol.   On this eponymous record, Jo ups the ante on contemporary pop-country with a state of the art production with an occasional nod to the ancient tones of rustic country.  Save for the occasional fiddling and steel, stinging guitars and forceful percussions over bubbly pop tunes are the order of the day.  Pride of place is also given to the chockablock lineup of songwriters on this record, this includes fellow artists such as Katrina Elam and Rachel Proctor plus tried and true hit writers Danny Mayo, Sunny Russ, Blair Daly, Stephony Smith, Dave Berg to name a few.  Nevertheless, the spotlight is Jo's energized and spirited vocals:  Jo has the vocal tenacity of LeAnn Rimes and the mellifluousness of a young Brenda Lee.  Hence, it's no surprise Jo has been the darling of the million plus viewers of Nashville idol.     In the spirit of Nashville idol, where contestants tend to sing their heads off, Jo's full throated voice is on full display on the midtempo "Good Day for Goodbye."  Refusing to take the mediocre as an excuse for a dying romance, "Good Day for Goodbye" finds a determined Jo finally calling it quits with her paramour.  Such a strong-willed woman theme resurfaces again on the Sunny Russ' penned "Strong Enough."  A popish anthem dedicated to stating over again, there's camaraderie that ought to identify with anyone who has had been emotionally sliced and diced.  Written by Jim Collins and Stephony Smith, "Go" continues the theme of taking chances. "Go" has an inherent Tanya-Tucker bluesy grit that makes it quite an experience to be beheld.   However, Jo is even better in the album's slower and more subdued moments.  From the first tinkling of the piano on Jessi Colter's "I'm Not Lisa" (which is also covered by Elizabeth Cook on her "Hey Y'all" and Faith Hill on her forthcoming "Homefires" CD lately) every note of this cheating ballad is mesmerized with an emotional intensity that wouldn't let go.  The plangent "They Say Love is Blind" brings to mind Lorrie Morgan's "I Guess You Had to Be There," as Jo witnesses her former boyfriend kissing a new love on a romantic street.  This is heart rending stuff at its best.  On the other hand, "There Are No Accidents," is a gorgeous love ballad that finds Jo philosophizing on the epitome of her relationship.  Listen especially to how her astringent voice imparts wisdom as she sings: "I used to talk about coincidence/And how true love is only found by chance/Now I look at you and I'm convinced/There are no accidents."    Nevertheless, there are a few tracks that veer on the contrived side. Lead single "I Break Things" has perhaps one of the most cliché and trite lyrics: "Rain is wet/The desert is dry/That's the way it'll always be/Fire is hot/It's dark at night/The sun comes up in the east."  I am sure an eight year-old can come up with better lyrics than that.  Perhaps befitting to Jo's age, "Love Is" is at best juvenile and it sounds out of place with the abovementioned gems.  "Who You Are," one of those inspirational type uptempo numbers, about searching for one's identity is so blend that one gets lost straightaway as the first note strikes.  "Erika Jo" is a promising debut from a young lady who can sing and when she wants she is able to burn vocally with vivid passion that is hard to resist.  Nevertheless, she's often let down by some of her songs.  Perhaps, they were hastily chosen and if she has had more time, this CD would have had been even better.  Jo is a name to match and with such a copious crowd of fans behind her, over a million can't be wron 
 I used to have a yogurt maker that had one chamber to make yogurt in. This product comes with 7 jars, which makes it easy to make different flavored yogurts. I also used Euro Cuisines yogurt starter, which made it easier to get a batch going. The first batch I made was a little on the loose side, so I added a little powdered milk to the second, and it came out great. It is a very clean and easy machine to use, and I highly recommend. At first I was a little disappointed that it did not have a timer to shut it off, but I realised that it is better to not have one, this way if it doesn't look ready after the alotted time, you can let it run a little longer. 
 What can I add to these excellent reviews?  I am a 45-year old divorced father of two daughters, 10 and 7.  I want to make sure my kids get exposure to young women with good values.  I also want them to appreciate good, edgy, music.  I get all of this and more with BarlowGirl.  Yes - Evanescence is a good comparison, but as my girls put it, BarlowGirl has better lyrics, meaning - not so dark and dreary.  I took the them to see BarlowGirl at KenockeeFest last weekend, and boy was I impressed and amazed.  Playing all their own instruments, making such a great sound, rocking the fast numbers and tugging at your heart with the slow!  These girls rival any of the great rock acts in my collection, and I have a lot of CDs!  And then when it came time for autographs, they smiled and treated every fan like they were best friends - something else you don't get from the typical Hollywood performer.  My girls are still sky-high from the concert!  Thank God for BarlowGirl - and I pray they continue down the straight and narrow, and keep putting out excellent music!  Amazon - Can I give them 6 stars 
 I read this book when it first came out. It turned some of my views upside down. It is welll written, reasoned and researched 
 That was Paul Newman's response to Jack Warden, as Warden massages Mr. Newman's back and tries to assuage him by telling him there will be other cases. ( Pardon me, I always wanted to use the word ASSUAGE in a review ). I live in Connecticut, and my wife and I drive thru Westport regularly, on our way to Trader Joe's. I know exactly where Mr. Newman lives,( I'll never tell ) and I always kid to my wife,  " I wonder what Paul is doing today? " Then I jokingly say that maybe we'll see him at Trader Joe's ( grocery store ) or at Mario's ( great place for lunch or dinner). Of course if I ever did actually meet him, I'd be stammering and babbling just like Jackie Gleason used to do in his old Honeymooner's television show. But enough of my dreaming. So, how was the movie? Sometimes there are events or moments in a movie that stay with you for a long time. In this movie, those times were: " There are no other cases..This is the case! " and the confrontation Mr. Newman had with the judge, when he proclaims, " I know about you! " as he taps his fingers on the judge's desk. Classic moments. If I ever had a chance to become an actor, and had my pick of   acting coaches, one of them would be Paul Newman. I'm not sure how he does it, but somehow, after watching him on screen for a few moments, I forget he is Paul Newman, and believe he is the character he is portraying.I guess that's the " magic " of great acting. They make it look so effortless. And now onto Jack Warden. He is perhaps one of the most under-rated actors in history. A great performance from a great actor.  Back to Paul Newman. The next time you watch one of his movies, watch the pauses...the times when he's not speaking. It's the entire package that makes an actor great. It's the phrasing, the reaction, the eye movements, the pauses and how long he holds them. ( Sure the director has a lot of input too)- but just watch him. What you are witnessing is a STAR in action. As I write this ( June 29, 2006 ) Paul Newman is 81 years old. He may be a little slower, a little more wrinkled, but his acting just gets better with age. ( Watch Empire Falls ). I truly hope he makes more movies. And who knows, perhaps one day I WILL run into him at Trader Joe's or Mario's place. And in true Jackie Gleason form, say to him, " Hubba, Hubba, Hubba. " And that, my friends, will be no act.          
 this book, following from the events in 'traitor general,' deals with the return of gaunt & co to the empire. their mishandling (surely there was a protocol worked out for gaunt to follow which would avoid this if they were able to get out) and near-execution, subsequent investigation and near-execution for suspected taint are interesting.  the personality alterations in all of the returned were well-done.  the somewhat predictable ending (gaunt ending up with command of the unit which included the remnants of his old one) was somewhat cliche, but overall a good read.  i actually enjoyed traitor general more 
 When you first hear this album from the first song 'Warning", and you hear passages like, "The child of centuries, forgotten in time/You talk in circles of rhyme/Seer of places future and past/The warning you gave us is surely our last/...Warning!" You know this isn't the newer Queensryche that a lot of people are used to from the mid-nineties on up, absolutely not...it's far better!  Well, what can I say that most of the other people haven't said? This particular Queensryche disc, will in my opinion, always be my favorite for the incredible range that Geoff's vocals exude, and the abundant melodical guitar passages on this album. It has a very special meaning to me and many others that grew up with this incredible band back when they first came out of nowhere and opened up our minds to a whole new genre of metal! I don't think I would've gotten into a band back then if it wasn't for this album!  True, many people praise 'Operation Mindcrime' as their best work. I agree to only some extent, because it's a different beast; "Mindcrime" is a concept album fueled by modern day atrosities in religion, politics, and greed. "The Warning" is also a concept album, which takes you on a futuristic journey detailing what happens to mankind in the future when he eventually realizes his own demise from the very machines he has created, essentially, the computer age. As evident in the song 'N M 156', "Uniform printout reads end of line/Protect code intact leaves little time/Erratic surveys, free thinking not allowed/My hands shake, my push buttons silence/The outside crowd/One world government has outlawed war among nations/Now social control requires population termination."  Where did these hauntingly surreal lyrics come from? George Orwell's book, 1984! This served as a catalyst for the mood and imagery on this album.  Moving on, I still get chills sometimes when I lay there and listen to 'Roads To Madness' (topping out at almost 10 minutes) in the way that it takes you through an incredible array of powerful and emotional vocals that make you wonder how Geoff Tate get's enough energy to make it through this in live performances! After a little over 7 minutes into the song, it's tempo takes off and shreds through about another 2 minutes to end leaving you feeling like you really were there in the story line. A song like this is a fine example of why he will always have a top position as one of the best rock vocalists in history.  But that's only a couple songs out of many great tunes on this album! I think what really stands out on this album (besides Geoff Tate's vocals of course) is the incredible emotions displayed by guitarist's Chris DeGarmo and Michael Wilton, with their dual-lead guitar structures and beautiful melody lines along with Scott Rockenfield's extremely fluent and solid percussion work you can't ignore the incredible sonic journey it takes you through.  I'm very impressed with the new '24 bit Remastered' version I just received! It is definately an improvement over the original disc! I've started re-collecting all of the new 24 bit remastered versions now because of the better quality.  So, in closing, if you really want to know where Queensryche started their journey (besides their first EP from 1983 which is great, but more raw sounding of course) and hear them before they changed into a more commercial sound, buy this and put the headphones on and prepare to experience the beginnings of the Progressive Metal era from one of the masters!  
 FarCry rates as great with my other most memorable gaming titles.(see below)  FarCry was a true step forward in visual quality and the intelligence of the adversaries.  FarCry is great mix of indoor levels and also large outdoor landscapes to travel over.  A great game really takes you in and you feel like you have been in the game's world after playing for an hour or so.    Other games I rate as great:  Unreal Quake II Halflife - I and II MDK Descent II Hitman Ghost Recon Splinter Cell Max Payne Deus Ex Myst  
 IT IS A BEAUTIFUL SELECTION OF ELEGANT AND MODERN WEDDINGS.  I LIVE IN PUERTO RICO AND WORK WITH A WEDDING PLANNER, THIS BOOK IS FULL OF IDEAS FOR WEDDINGS IN AN ISLAND LIKE OURS 
 Those who come to A HAPPY DEATH after THE STRANGER tend to note the similarities in plot and theme that relegate they believe the former to the latter as a juvenile attempt--not bad maybe, but not the real thing either. Such a judgment is overhasty. The Mersault of A HAPPY DEATH may or may not be the Mersault of THE STRANGER. Both live in Algiers and both wander aimlesslessly in life, seeking a philosophical underpinning.  Both kill a man, and both suffer for it.  But such a facile comparison omits a great deal that suggests when Camus took up the pen again a decade later, he has more in mind than a handy earlier book from which he could self-[...].  The Mersault of A HAPPY DEATH has a first name, Patrice, who is poor and seeks a way to battle a losing effort with time that his poverty proves a hindrance. He finds a rich cripple and kills him, and steals his money, which he uses to work out the details, however bizarre, of a philosophy that involve his finding happiness. The other Mersault seeks happiness too, but with him he already is "happy" in the sense that he knows his place in the universe, which he sees as a disordered self-contained field of entropy from which he concludes that nothing makes sense and everything is meaningless. This Mersault does not need to steal money to reach a higher state. Patrice Mersault seeks to elevate himself to reach a higher state that he feels money is the key and murder is the means. His later counterpart would find it amusing that his namesake would bother to look outside himself for anything. Patrice, could he but jump into HIS counterpart's book, would feel, not amusement, but rage at someone who has no purpose in life except to keep doing what he is doing.  Both Mersaults share some surface traits, but in the final analysis, they are no more than two distinct individuals who share a name and a few piddling details of their surface lives.  And perhaps this is what caused Camus to take up the pen with his twin Mersaults: to show his readers that the universe cannot mean more than what you put into it or what you don't. 
 This review is certainly long over-due, as Mary Gaitskill's BAD BEHAVIOR has become one of my favorite books and has greatly influenced my own short fiction.  Unfortunately, many people insist on comparing the book (mainly the short story, "Secretary"), to the movie Secretary.  Yes, yes, the movie was fantastic, again one of my favorites, but Gaitskill's collection and vision focuses on much darker tones.  Her writing is not meant to be erotic, but rather plays up on some of the sexual violence that some people misunderstand as affection.  Anyway, comparing BAD BEHAVIOR to the movie is like comparing apples and oranges.  You should base your expectations of one based on the other or else you'll probably be disappointed.   BAD BEHAVIOR features nine stories involving protagonists who feel incomplete and are constantly searching for some human connection.  The collection opens up with the daring story, "Daisey's Valentine", involving two very unlikely lovers who work together in a used bookstore.  Daisey is a very incompetent girl, who has very good intentions, but is constantly cheating on her boyfriend.  She is immature and certainly dull-witted, but likeable.  Her co-worker, Joey, becomes infactuated with her after he has become disillusioned with his own relationship to his house-bound, drug taking girlfriend.  Though both characters are completely reliant on thier significant others for financial support, they get involved are left on their own to defend for themselves.  It is Daisey who suffers the most, realizing that her poor decisions have left her in the loving arms of a worthless drug addict.  Like most of the stories, "Daisey's Valentine" ends rather abruptly, as the mix-matched couple is loitering on the front steps of a rather expensive apartment complex.  An upper-class couple is disgusted by them and warns that if the two are not gone by the time they return, they will call the police.  Joey's solution is to ignore the threat and thinks about getting high while Daisey feels insulted/threatened by this and has suddenly lost all sense of dignity.    The book features two brothel stories, which I think are excellent additions to Gaitskill's themes of isolation, human connection and our need to mentally create a safe haven.  In one of the stories, a prosititute tells her clients that all the girls there are working "temporarily", waiting for their big break as an actress or a writer.  This is a very common psyche of most of Gaitskill's characters, who all desperately cling to the hope that better things are on the way.  This certainly correlates with the writer's personal experience, having run away from home in her teens to work as a stripper and later being hospitalized for a short time.  In "Secretary", the BDSM fairy tale aspect of the movie has been forsaken to illustrate a very homey girl's seduction by her deviant employer.  Orginally, Debbie had used the secretary position as an escape from her dysfunctional family, but finds that the lawyer tries to involve her with his s/m fantasies and occassionally spanks her over his desk for any typos.  Debbie is torn between the feelings of molestation and her general lust for the lawyer.  However, as he pushes her further than she is willing to go, Debbie abruptly quits her job and hides her secretive guilt of the affair from her family.  She is however left with a new understanding of the time she spent seeing her childhood psychologist.  BAD BEHAVIOR is shocking, sexual and very intimate.  Mary Gaitskill writes stories of  affairs, deviant sex and obscure relationships with very real characters.  This book is certainly not for children, but to an open-minded adult who is willing to step behind the eyes of a masochist for a change.  Her stories deal with extraordinary situations but almost anyone can relate to the characters' aggressions and longings. If you haven't read it - you're missing out 
 This book is really good because it contains powerful insights from the life of a man who not only saw struggle, but was able to overcome them. However, I would recommend reviewing the society and culture of Egypt before or while reading this book because it contains many references to the region and society of the country that may be unfamiliar to people from other countries or non-muslim readers. Overall, very good book. 
 As an elementary teacher, I have a great love for children's literature.  I choose Harry Horrible books frequently in my classroom.  I read this book to my students at the beginning of the school year.  The adventures of Harry and his friends throughout the Horrible Harry adventures are engaging its readers.  These are some of the first chapter books that they pick up.  It is a great simple chapter book to help hook your students into reading.  They will relate to Harry and his friends, and find that reading is funny.  I recommend this book to everyone. I found that this book was funny and suspenseful altogether.  My students were begging me to read more.  In this book we find Harry wearing a mini-microscope necklace to school.   Horrible Harry tells his classmates that they can use during recess time to find a secret mushroom kingdom.  However knowing the playground rules, will Horrible Harry and his buddies break the rule and outside the fence to look in the mud? The author engages the readers in suspense, climax, and the issue of right and wrong.   
 I got this single, basically, becuase I'm a completionist, but it turned out to be pretty cool. I was dreading my first listen, cuase it was the original track from NOTB, and live versions of Number Of The Beast and Hallowed be Thy Name, which are on all of the live albums. It turned out to be nice though. The 2 live tracks are from the original Clive Burr charity gig in 2002 
 It's reading such a book we can understand how powerfull was the 19th Century scientific thought. Maxwell, was a genius as was Newton and Einstein, his book is didactic and clear. A must have 
 Quick shipping/ but poor packaging. There was obvious chips of metal from the structure in the packaging and one of the main SCREW and BOLTS pagackages were already open (lucky i found all) Bad packaging BUT EXCELLENT bench. It takes a decent bit of assembly but it fit perfect in my 2 car garage and still lets 1 car in. Great multi-function product. You can do all core lifts and also do lats and curls to build the minor muscles for definition. Pretty sturdy structure but seems a tad bit hallow (no problems yet) for a hundred fifty five bucks with free shipping (another 155 value) It was REALLY worth it. I say to anyone who likes it, its worth it. Just get it. Wether your a pro or beginnger its good for getting stronger and adding mass 
 Picking up on a few key theoretical points not included in other reviews. Harvey is pressing an academic point within the broad Marxian tradition-- a point which also has broad practical consequences for confronting imperialism's latest incarnation. A central contention is that the capitalist world has been experiencing a crisis of overaccumulation since about 1973, as evidenced by a lack of opportunities for profitable investment (for which, by the way, he offers no statistical data, but which is not at issue here). Growth prior to the 1973 watershed, he argues, was driven by expanded reproduction with the US exercising hegemonic authority as a result of its WWII reorganization of  old European colonialism. However, for various reasons (chiefly Vietnam era inflation) this regime broke down. At that point, he argues, the much-marginalized neo-liberal thinking of von Mises and von Hayek began to get a sympathetic hearing and commenced its long march through the institutions of the capitalist world. This new strategy utilizes neo-liberal  measures, such as trade and finance liberalization (IMF, World Bank, GATT, et al.) to force open hitherto closed or regulated foreign markets, thereby helping to employ  surplus capital. A related tool is to force devaluation upon a target economy, enabling foreign investors to buy cheaply and improve opportunity for increased profit margins. Thus, in broad outline, a new form of imperialism has arisen, one that remains similar to its classic colonial predecessor in that it still seeks to relieve accumulation problems at home by shifting profitability problems abroad, sometimes forcibly so.  Harvey descibes this new imperialism as accumulation by dispossession, a controversial description since dispossession in classic Marxist thinking is supposed to be restricted  to the primitive forms of accumulation of times gone by. Still, the evidence is considerable given the wave of privatization of formerly public assets (water and education, in particular) in many parts of the world, (think also of recent attacks on Social Security). Indeed, these institutional measures  inside and outside the US, do in fact resemble the classic "enclosues" of capital's earlier, more primitive stage. Recent attacks on formerly state-sponsored economies such as Yugoslavia's and Iraq's amount to further cases in point. But, again, this revived dispossession need not depend on military invasion; the subtler form attacks through the avenues of capital markets and state-sponsored privatization. Though the current period is dominated by dispossession, Harvey points out that accumulation by reproduction still continues. In fact, he asserts, the two are `organically' related and `dialectically' connected, for which however he offers scant elaboration.   The practical upshot of imperialism by dispossession is to force a  shift in anti-imperialist thinking away from the familiar strategies that challenged the pre-1973 expanded reproduction regime. That earlier response stressed organizing the proletariat into a political force in order to seize state power in behalf of socialist principles. Movements outside that exclusive strategy were considered secondary at best, and counter-revolutionary at worst. Though this effort failed in its primary task, the author points out that it's hard to conceive of Europe's social democracies or America's New Deal as taking place without the single-minded drive of communist party politics. However, these methods are now clearly inadequate for confronting  neo-liberalism and its capacity to bypass both organized labor and state power (consider neo-liberalism's sabotage of France's Mitterand in his effort to deepen socialist programs in the 1980's). Instead, current forms of resistance are much more diverse and localized, as evidenced by Mexico's Zapatista movement or Bolivian resistance to water privatization schemes. If there's a central rallying cry among these diverse groups, it's opposition to `globalization', at least in neo-liberal form. Generally, the central challenge facing anti-imperialists, as Harvey sees it, is to combine the wisdom of former strategies with the developing modes of today-- a not inconsiderable task, to say the least.   All in all, this is a stimulating read. There is much to digest, especially in grappling with the theoretical aspects. It's important to point out that Harvey approaches the topic as a critical observer and not as an economist, a fact which some may count as a fault since many of the conclusions rest on economic data. Still and all, the work remains an important prism for examining current trends 
 I received the exact item I ordered, and quicker than I thought I would get it.  The price was right, too 
 If you liked Norman Luboff's Song's of the Sea's "Shenandoah", the price of this CD is worth it alone.  That's why I ordered the CD.  I heard Chanticleer's version and immediately ordered it.  The rest is just the icing on the cake.  Then there is the one Kiri Tekanawa (sp?) offering, which is the only female voice on the recording 
 I really appreciated that this book points out that "Grief is not an emotion but a process with a host of emotions." Some people think that after a certain period of time that a person should be over their grief. This is a realistic and helpful book.   I also recommend another book I found helpful and healing to use. The title is, Write From Your Heart, A Healing Grief Journal. 
 This is a fantastic collection - a must have for any home library. I just wish it was hardbound! I really think that's all that needs to be said 
 This book touches upon issues that everyone is aware of but chooses to ignore.  The author makes this obvious but in an non-condescending way which is much appreciated.  He ties the biases of the food industry in with other industries such as the pharmaceutical and tobacco industries.  Drawing the connections between these three and the governmental regulatory agencies that work with/against them respectively (USDA, FDA, ATF), the author illustrates just how much of a problem this is.  Not only was I fascinated by the issue, but I found the writing very accessible.  Well done and it's too bad more haven't read it

 At first I was going to just review the book because I enjoyed it so much. Seeing life perspectives from so many different writers with different backgrounds and even writers with similar backgrounds but such different stories to tell, gave me hope and made me feel less alone. It's not that I related to every story. Of course not, how could I? It's that I related to some thoughts and feelings of most every woman and I was blown away by the honesty. I strive to be a writer as fearless and vulnerable as these women. So, yes, I was just going to speak about that. But then I saw another reviewer's comment that threw me. He or she was appalled that an author would write these things down, let alone feel this way and that one of the writers should be "sent away to an institution."   I knew then that I had to write this review. I had to write it for all the woman who are afraid that what they are feeling is "wrong" or "bad" or "not fit for a woman or mother." It's only now coming to the surface that no matter what the economic background, no matter what the color of the skin, no matter whether a woman works or stays home, we all struggle with many of the same dark thoughts and I refuse to live in those dark thoughts alone. So thank you for writing this book 
 I remember watching Anne of Green Gables when I was a little girl with my sister, over and over again. Laughing everytime Anne broke her slate on Gilberts head, or when she accidently dyed her hair green, or when she waxes poetic about her "bosom friend". It made me smile and laugh then and still does now as a 25 year old. I would recommend this movie for anyone young or old. It is a beautiful heartwarming movie, with gorgeous scenery, unforgettable characters, and plenty of moments to laugh and cry 
 There are a few CDs that I don't listen with my ears but my heart. This is one. If you go to the fourth track, you'll get the best song, under my point of view. The "Suite: Clouds, Rains" has both the melody and the lyrics that make this CD valuable. But then we have "Lorilee" and "Soap (I Use The)". In the sense, you'll get a lot buying this 
 We are now in another one of those periods of revival of interest in, and appreciation of, Jane Austen. There have been at least two films, one cable one commercial, released over the past several years that are based on one of her better novels, The Pride and Prejudice. Ordinarily I have found that films made for cable are inferior to those produced for the commercial film market. Not here. The A&E production is far superior in presentation not the least of which is that it is truer to the Austen story line than the commercial film. Moreover, as an added treat, the film itself is over five hours long and therefore can get a leisurely treatment to Austen's themes of love and life, horse riding and letter writing among the early 18th century English `squirearcy'. Despite the length the film moves along with few dull spots.  And what of the story line? Well it seems that certain very rich young landowner, a Mr. Darcy, with just the right connections and, Miss Elizabeth Bennett, one of five daughters of a country squire who estate has been entailed away from any ability to provide for his wife and daughters are smitten with each other. However both parties must endure many trials and tribulations, to speak nothing of personal misunderstandings between them, before the romantic tensions can be resolved and they can snuggle down in Mr. Darcy's little mansion. On a personal level this is about overweening pride (naturally) -his- that stood for a long time in the way of unleashing his feelings is an adult way. The prejudice part comes from both parties as both are very class-conscious and committed to the, frankly, unseemly and irrationally snobbish nature of the English gentry. In the end, (since we know that the couple will ride happily into the sunset) Austen's looks at English morals, mores and manners just before the full effects of the Industrial Revolution hit that society is what drives one to watch the movie. Ms. Austen had a very good ear for picking up the language of these `gentle' people.  Damn it though, those times were tough for an independent-minded intelligent young woman with no means. Kudos to Miss Elizabeth Bennett.                   
 This my favourite book in the series.  With all the unexpected twists in an amazing plot I can see why Louisa May Alccott is so popular I am 14 and have just finished yr10 at high school and completed an Author review for  english where I had to read all the books written by 1 author and I found  that this was easily my favourite of the Little women series 
 This product is a good choice for a reasonable price. My cons for this product are: Its as wide as a dvd player.  I have seen other products out there that are smaller if you are looking for a compact design. The other issue I encountered is every great while a song will skip.  This could be due to the fact that there are five wireless networks in range. I have not spent too much time investigating this issue b/c its not that big of a deal.  Over I am happy with this purchase 
 My daughter just recently fell in love with Barbie movies, and this boxed set of the older ones was a great deal! The stories are all so cute and have good morals to them, I don't feel bad about letting her watch them. Very highly recommended!! 
 I have nothing to add to the reviews of those who have found this a superlative, moving 'gesamtkunstwerk'.  All four soloists are excellent, as is the orchestra and dramatic interpretation of what is, after all, an oratorio.  I have just found out that Helen Hunt Lieberson died of cancer on July 3, 2006.  A life all too short!  Her performance in this production shows just what was lost with her passing.  This is yet another reason to obtain it and witness for yourselves.  
 I bought this book twenty years ago while in college because it was so well illustrated, and it did such a great job of answering questions I had about how castles were built and arranged.  I haven't looked at it since, but save dit because I knew someday my kids would love it as much as I did.  This week my 2nd grade son checked out a perfectly good book on castles from his school.  He poured over the illustrations and read the captions, but he couldn't get answers to his questions: "Dad, what's a 'keep'?.... How did they get up so high to build the towers?  ...."    We pulled out Macaulay and he was enthralled.  The art work, the text, and the whole flow of the book are all just so well done.  Glad I kept this 
 I think this book is an enlightment to one's spiritual stage in life and teaches us the true faith of christianity. Whether people may think it is anti-semetic or not, the truth remains. The fact that it occured can not be hidden nor would it be forgotten to the christians. Overall to me the book was a good guide to those saught to learn. I give great credit to the author 
 This film is a collection of short clips (taken from newsreels, propaganda films, and mainstream movies) made by/for/about the Vichy government from 1940 until the liberation of Paris in 1944.  This is a modern (1993) attempt to paint a picture of the Vichy government that they may have painted of themselves.  I found this to be a fascinating window into how the Vichy government viewed themselves.  The style of the film is, in many ways, similar to `Triumph of the Will'.  There are fiery speechs about duty, honor, hard work, basic/traditional values, sacrifice, etc.  There is clearly some effort to create a personality cult around Petain as well.  An effort was apparently made to place Petain above petty political machinations of individual parties (i.e. he was above partisan politics and only represents France's interests).  Complex issues of the day are framed very simply, with an `us-versus-them' dogma.  Many of the clips are blatant racist, anti-Semitic propaganda (i.e. during discussion of the `Jewish Question' there is video of rats coming out of a sewer).  There is also a great emphasis on the energy of the youth, how they will be the saviors of the future.  One thing I found particularly interesting about this film was the repeated line of argument taken by Petain and the other Vichy functionnaires that France will suffer less pain by siding with Germany than against, so France should work with them.  Finally, I found it interesting how, as the war progressed, the justifications of the Vichy regime to support Germany became progressively more ridiculous.  The place in history for the Vichy regime is still a hotly disputed subject several generations after the war.  This film certainly does not explore many of the moral ambiguities of the Vichy era, it paints the Vichyites simply as Nazis.  I give it four stars simply because it is a propaganda film and there is only so much to be learned from this type of film.  I am not an expert on the Vichy era, but this film left me with more questions than answers (perhaps this was the point of the film?).  The film itself is fast paced and the various clips are seamless woven together.  There is some English commentary, but most of the discussion is French with English subtitles.  Overall, a good inside into Vichy France and highly recommended for anyone interested in WWII or French History in general.  Finally, if you are looking for a good (French) film that actually explores some of the complexities of the occupation check out the film `Uranus' 
 This is yet another great reissue from the Bluenote catalog.  Highly recommended for blues lovers like me, it is jazz with a heavy duty dose of blues right from the starting cut "I Want a Little Girl."  Also,  "Since I fell For You" is very tasty as is the title cut.  The 2  disc set features very tight support from the Three Sounds (Gene Harris -p;  Andrew Simpkins -b; Bill Dowdy -d).  But Turrentine's rich tone is the  star.  Check out the nice groove Turrentine carves out on "Blue  Riff" then Harris jumps in with some smokin' work on the 88s.  There  isn't a weak tune on either disc.  The session details indicate the  recording dates as two in 1960 (Dec 16 & June 29), and it was digitally  transferred using 24-bit resolution for maximum depth and fidelity.  This  is classic hard bop at its very best 
 In this book, Rene Girard tries to propound a new theory of sacrifice, religion, myth, tragedy, incest, and taboo. His basic thesis is that sacrificing a scapegoat was the way primitive societies overcame the natural lawless violence (mimetic desire) of their societies by re-directing it on a sacrifical victim.  To explain his thesis, Girard studies sacrifical rites of the world and especially the ancient world and primitive societies, as also the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripedes, particulary those that pertain to Oedipus and Dionysos. He gives a radically new interpretation of Oedipal tragedy taking Freud into a radical new direction, and explains why incest was feared because of its effect of leveling distinctions. His interpretation of Dionysos is singularly brilliant.  According to Girard, leveling distinctions or eliminating differences removes the safegaurds that contain violence in primitive societies (he states that our safegaurd - law - is itself based on the concept of sacrifice to restore order) and hence anything that levels distinctions was feared. He also shows how the various sacrifical animals or men have the chracteristics of inside/outside with respect to the community.  The book does have its drawbacks, but is intellectually stimulating. The main hallmark of this work is that it de-mystifies religion and especially represents the most convincing theory of sacrifice and tragedy I have read.  As far as the drawbacks are concerned, the theory is rigorously argued in the beginning but thins out towards the end of the book. As a theory of sacrifice, his evidence supports him. As an interpretation of certain myths and as an explanation of incest and African kingship rites, he is close. However when he streches it to explain origin of religion, kinship rules, all kinds of rites etc., his argument often wears thin.  There is also a question of unanswered ethical import - is sacrifice legitimate because it prevents communities from collapsing 
 		The Haunting of Alaizabel Cray   A young witch-hunter, Thaniel Fox, is searching for witch kin that lurks in the depths of London that are over-throwing, and taking lives. So Thaniel and his mentor/friend, Cathline Bennet are on a journey to find out about and destroy the witch kin that have being terrorizing the people of London for 20 years since the bombing of the Prussians.  When they find a girl, Alaizabel Cray, who is being possessed by a powerful, and dangerous spirit, their search is more intensified by her, and they find out maybe more than they need to know. 	I really liked this book; it had plenty of mystery, and things that keep you wondering.  I think it is a book for all ages and a story that you won't want to put down because of all of the action around every corner. I don't think that girls can't read it because I read it, and I think girls will love the action and the bit of romance in this "ghost-busting" novel by Chris Wooding 
 Donald Davis, in his book Lightning Strike, has made an effort to clarify the historical record by providing details that demonstrate, once and for all, who was responsible for shooting down the bomber that carried Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto over Bougainville in April 1943.  Much of the book focuses on events leading up to the mission to find & shoot down Yamamoto's aircraft.  This first portion of the book introduces the members of the strike team that was responsible for intercepting & destroying the target.  Tom Lanphier, one of the pilots on the mission, claimed that he was solely responsible for shooting down the aircraft carrying Yamamoto, but Davis brings forth the new evidence that was not available to contemporary historians immediately following the war demonstrating that Lanphier not only did not shoot down Yamamoto's plane by himself, but probably had no involvement whatsoever in shooting down the aircraft.  The book is an easy read & certainly does provide new insights into the 60+ year old controversy over who was responsible for ending Yamamoto's involvement in World War II.  I would change only a couple of things about the book - the first is very minor: at the conclusion of the book, Davis tells us that Rex T. Barber was responsible for the destruction of Yamamoto's bomber, but then he ends the book by writing "In 2004...Rex Barber deserved 100 percent credit for shooting down Admiral Yamamoto.  The resolution was accompanied by legislation to clear the path for Congress to finally award Barber the Medal of Honor."  Unfortunately, he does not tell the reader whether or not the deserved medal was ever awarded (as it turns out, the legislation was still pending as of the publication date of the book).  The 2nd thing I would change is a little more significant - I would have changed the length of the book by removing some of the pre-mission background information about the members of the strike team.  The details presented make for interesting reading, but (in my opinion), don't really add to the understanding of the  mission itself.  I would strongly recommend this book to anyone looking for an understanding of what happened to Admiral Yamamoto on that fateful day 
 My recent order of Avery Half-Fold greeting cards was a good price and good quality

 Until I was sixteen, I went to Mardi Gras every year. I was therefore fascinated to read James Gill's account of the twisted and bizarre history of New Orleans' biggest tourism cash cow (albeit one which should not be kept alive through longstanding racist shibboleths), and see what sort of  political and social struggles underpinned the history of the old-style  Krewes (which, incidentally, I never got to see, my family--and eventually  myself--preferring the big flashy ones like Endymion and Bacchus). Gill's  accompanying history of New Orleans is even better, yielding many  interesting and little known facts. Unfortunately, one gets so wrapped up  in stirring episodes like the checkered postbellum career of James  Longstreet that the occasional Mardi Gras asides actually get to be  irritating (which surely was not the point of the book). Fortunately,  Gill's concluding focus on the "battle for Mardi Gras" between  Councilwomen Dorothy Mae Taylor and Peggy Wilson brings the story into an  exciting present day context which will be unsurprising to anyone familiar  with the running circus of lunacy that is Louisiana politics (although it's  nice to have confirmation that female politicians can be almost as boorish  and intolerant as male politicians). This book, along with John Kennedy  Toole's A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES and Jerry Strahan's MANAGING IGNATIUS, is  essential reading for anyone looking to learn about New Orleans 
 I went to this show at the Luther Burbank Center for the Arts, here in Santa Rosa California. When I saw that they had made an album out of it, I immediatly went out and bought it.  Every single bit is a comedic gem here. One of the things I always love about Lewis Black is that he never repeats himself, I have never heard him do the same bit twice. All of the material here was new and fresh, with much of the subject matter having happened within a couple of months. this was by far the best time I ever had watching stand up comedy, and it is a must have for any Lewis Black fan and anyone who jsut wants to laugh 
 These days it's really hard to find trading knowledge that is practical & simple to understand.   Most of the info outhere is full of the same thecnical analysis jargon that makes you lose a lot of times. Basically most tehcnical trading books tell you the same story but organized in different chapters using different words and charts as examples.   Some places on the web have pretty practical information. One site that I recommend is StressFreeTraders com. They have a pretty clear way for trading stocks with momentum using easy to understand strategies. This is also one place where you can understand why knowing how to approach the rally is critical for your stock trading success. 
 I have always been raised in the church and in a good home. So I am reviewing this to show what kind of impact Kirk Franklin had on my life.  Stomp inspired a lot of teens to go back to the church. That it was okay to have fun and STILL be a Christian. My Life is in your hands, Love, and The Storm is over now are all heart stirring gospel classics that make the listener inspect their own life. All in all, a must have for any slightest gospel fan. Favs: Love, Sweet Spirit, Stomp, and More than I can bear 
 I really enjoyed this book.  I found myself empathizing with Darcy from the middle of the book until the end.  A great read 
  I bought this book when I was working as a copywriter. I often had 10 different topics to write about in a day, and so, needless to say, I would often get writer's block. This book was a godsend for those situations. It is divided into various categories of words like "Financial Advertising" or "Emotional Words" etc. It was simple to find the right word. And I also noticed that I often got compliments for a lot of copy I wrote with the help of the book, so I can only give it a definitive thumbs up! One piece of advise...if you can, buy it together with Part 1, so to speak, of the book : "Words that Sell" by the same author. Very labor-saving stuff! 
 This is a classic. I bought one for myself and read it and then sent a copy to my son when he was stationed in Iraq. This should be a "must read" for military of all ranks and branches as well as the politicians who send them in harms way. 
 This excellent book is a sequel to the Frahm's first book, and is written for anyone who wants to develop healthy lifestyle choices, especially in the area of nutrition.  It is practical, well written, and easy to  understand and implement 
 An excellent sequel to "The Other Side of Midnight."  If you've  read that book before, yep, there's more to excitement to come.  If you  haven't read the book before, I suggest you read it before you read this  book.  In short, this is another great book from Sidney Sheldon 
 This book was key in helping me prepare for the American History I CLEP test. I also used REA's CLEP prep book and some of the AP quizzes from historyteacher.net. I highly recommend this book 
 Told from the perspective of a young girl growing up in a war-ravaged village, Harris depicts the simplicity and straightforwardness of childhood, the complexities and confusion of coming-of-age and the weariness of dysfunction of family in adulthood.  Through it all, terrible secrets are harboured and slowly revealed.  The characters will haunt you for days after finishing this book 
 I am twice unqualified to review this work. I am not part of the target audience as I am not a woman, and am not a student of Kabbalah or Jewish mystical practices.  Still I read the work out of my interest in Jewish life and experience, and in my concern for the Jewish future.  I therefore strongly recommend that the reader of my review take it not as any kind of definitive statement, but rather as a subjective view which needs to be complemented by the views of others. The book is  a strange amalgam, but not an ineffective one . It is at once a kind of spiritual autobiography, and introduction to Jewish mystical teaching and practice. It is also and the second part of the work is devoted to this a set of exercises or teachings on how to achieve the meditative and spiritual aims which are Besserman's goal. In this last part of the work there are four Paths given, a Path of Letters, of Emanations, of Sounds, of Song and Dance. My review does not relate to these paths, and whether they are practically useful or not.  The story which is told by Perle Besserman is of a girl who found herself confined, and not understood in a traditional religious framework. Her  desire for a closer connection and understanding with God she felt was thwarted all through her time of religious studies. She especially felt that the Judaism she lived and learned was primarily for men. And that women were to be their footstools.  She rebelled against this and went on a path of spiritual exploration. As I understand it she abandoned Halachah,  living by Jewish law and instead searched to find her own spiritual truth and way in life. This led her to seek out some of the great Jewish teachers of modern times. And there is an interesting section on her experience with Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda Kook in Israel. There is also most importantly for her the story of her friendship and learning with the Rabbi and Teacher who is considered most responsible for the revived contemporary  Jewish interest in meditation and  mystical practice, Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan. Even with him she was not content with the traditional emphasis on seeing things from the male point of view , and was urging toward his developing or revealing a way of feminine relation to the Divinity, or perhaps the feminine aspect of the Divinity. Kaplan tragically died before her course of learning with him could be completed, and she thus had to strike out on other paths. These included ways of mystical practice which do not have their source in the Jewish tradition. One central source of her learning has been the Buddhist tradition.  All of this leads her to finding her own way of transforming mystical teaching which brings her to a deeper and more fulfilling sense of her own spirituality.  My  summary  does not do justice to the richness of Besserman's language and learning. She has studied for years and in a way the most valuable part of the book is the knowledge that she does convey about Kabbalah.  With all this,  I found her story a not very encouraging one.  On one level, on the level of an individual's struggle and effort and attainment of learning, I admire what she has done. But on the level of a contribution to the world which she comes from, to Jewish communal life, and to the Jewish future I find her enterprise seriously lacking.  For what I see in it is simply another individual rejection of Jewish communal responsibility and feeling.  There is one incident in the book in which Besserman returns to visit an old friend. This friend was with her a 'rebel' against the narrow 'Beis Yakov' religious school  world. But instead of like Besserman getting out of , she went back deeper into it. She even married the boy Besserman had a youthful crush on. When Besserman visits her she is an ultra-orthodox woman tied down by her growing family, sunk in the traditional woman's role. Their meeting results not in a renewal of friendship but in a misunderstanding in which Besserman is unfairly chased away.  Yet the picture presented here, and the drastic dichotomy between the two women and the future seems to me a false one. The fact is that the Jewish people today are suffering from a ' birth dearth.'. We are after the Shoah in demographic decline. And the burden of having a family is not something which is as presented here , a somehow ' valueless limiting thing'.  Today far too many  Jews are escaping into either 'no Jewishness at all ' or a kind of ' non- historical selfish individual spiritualism' which contributes nothing to Jewish community, history and future.  There is a Jewish people also. And the absence of relation to it is felt most strongly in this work.  
 Bugliosi details all of the mistakes made during the prosecution of OJ Simpson.  He describes outlandish mistakes by both the prosecution and the defense and how, given the volume of damning evidence, the case should have been a slam-dunk.  Lawyers are too much like politicians--getting caught up in the media coverage and focusing way too much on appearances, forgetting the substance of the situation.  You'll see exactly why this was the most famous and most screwed-up trial in American history.  Fie on the whole lot of them, including Simpson.  Great reading! 
 One of my favorite books ever! I have read and reread Eagan's novel and continue to find myself completely wrapped up in Phoebe's journey always wanting, always waiting to discover the truth just like Phoebe. This haunting novel is definately a must read 
 This is the most adorable bike ever.  My granddaughter loves it.  We needed a replacement for a defective part and it was immediately sent to us from the manufacturer.  Great product...Great service...Great value 
 _I have heard this book dismissed as "just another space cadet story." Check the date of publication (1948), this is THE first space cadet story. It started the genre. I've also heard it dismissed as a "kid's book." A "kid's book" would not have stuck in my memory for four decades now and provided me with inspiration and a model when I most needed it. A "kid's book" wouldn't have inspired me to stick out high school and college physics and mathematics instead of just throwing in the towel. It was remembering the example of this book, and _Starman Jones_, that got me through Calculus. I just wish the rest of the world would have lived up to the high ideals expressed in these books....   _I recently reread this tale after many years. I was amazed at how "nondated" it was. Heinlein has a perfect description of cell phones and cell towers. Something else finally hit me too- this is where Gene Roddenbury got most of his ideas for Star Trek. Heinlein actuallly uses the term "the Federation." His Interplanetary Patrol is obviously the inspiration for Star Fleet with it's noble ideals, multi-cultural make-up (in 1948), it's commitment to keeping the peace, and it's 100 year record of keeping the peace (a phrase right out of Trek.) The importance of the Academy and its naval style of organization came from Heinlein, the Annapolis graduate. The way that the organization is entirely composed of officers and officers in training- that's also pure Star Trek. Heinlein wrote of all this almost 20 years before the television show aired....   _It used to bother me that the Heinlein that wrote this book and the Heinlein that wrote _Stranger in a Strange Land_ and all that came afterward seemed like two different men. I now think that I understand that too. 
 The authors did an excellent job of writing and presenting an accurate description of sexual practices in our country, including its history - obviously, an extremely difficult undertaking.  In early America, the main deterrent to premarital sex was the fear of pregnancy and the severe consequence of social ostracization.   However, sexual desire was always there for both men and women, regardless of social class or standing.  Control over casual sex lay in the hands of family and/or the mores of society.  Premarital sex was not permissible for anybody.  In practice however, this sexual taboo applied mostly to women.   Men - on the other hand - had choices!  They were the creators (always with god's help - of course) and enforcers of the rules and laws governing our social behavior!  Talk about one-way streets!   Margaret Sanger (born 1883) was a nurse who fumed over this grossly unfair treatment between the sexes and began the search for a dependable means of birth control.  She needed a means or device that women could use to counter their fear of unintended pregnancy.  She locked horns, clanged heads with the law (mainly the Comstock laws), and ended up with a number of warrants issued for her arrest.  She fled to Europe while a number of her friends and associates kept the ball rolling in search of a positive, reliable means of birth control for women. In 1915, she announced she was returning to America to surrender and stand trial on the charges against her.  As soon as the courts heard of this, all charges against her were dropped; the bureaucrats feared her like no other woman. For the first time, women got reliable birth control devices, and could begin to enjoy sex outside of marriage, without fear, just as surely as men did.   By the turn of the century, in order to finish leveling the sexual playing field, women needed a place to go and a means of getting there.  Two World Wars, one in 1914 and the other in 1941, would provide the answers. 
 -A stunning sequel to the brilliant "Birth of the Firebringer"... Meredith Ann Pierce has the ability to paint incredible scenes, with a satisfying dialect for effect... 
 Stop the presses!!! Look no further all ye students of culinary arts!! You have reached the highest plateau of education!!  Ms. Garrett has compiled and indexed and joyfully created the encyclopedia of baking skills for anyone to study, and learn, and she has done so by teaching as straight forward and honestly as possible. While some high-priced bakers write books in the guise of having you think they will share their guarded secrets, Ms. Garrett actually delivers on her promise. You will feel that you have wisely chosen a great teaching tool as you realize the knowledge you hold in your hands, courtesy of Toba.    This labor of love, which was borne out of the need and requests of family, friends, and students, will take you from the initial step to the final step of cake baking, assembly, and decorating. I cannot think of anything that she has forgotten in bringing this craft to you in a book form.   I have many cake decorating books, and I truly feel that this effort far surpassed any of the volumes that are sitting on my shelves. It is comprehensive and thorough, and if at some point, you wish to get more detailed, all you would need is your imagination to guide you.   My grandest wish was to undertake the knowledge necessary for the skill of piping and design; it is an old world art from England and Australia and mastery of this will put you in league with those who catered to aristocracy of centuries gone by. This skill involves creating all those thread-thin lines of icing that are shaped into delicate lace-like pieces that you gently place upon a cake; the crisss-cross patterns or bridge-like paper thin lines that connect to one another to form trellis' and such; fleurs-de-lis with drop strings; brush embroidery and...........oh the inpsiration is endless! Therefore in lesson 11 of this tome, she divulges and devotes her knowledge to impart to you this fabulous skill. For me, this chapter alone was worth the price!! Lace designs, trellis works, ring designs.  And of course she teaches the basic skills of flower making or animal shaped ideas; marzipan shaped into fruit; how to decorate cookies that go way beyond frosting and more.  Her chapters are:  Basic piping skills FLoral piping skills Intermiediate piping skilss Advanced border skills The art of writing Royal icing piped flowers Royal icing design skills The art of icing a cake  Hand modeling skills Marzipan and chocolate modeling Advanced royal icing piping and design skills Rolled icing design skills Pastillage construction Gumpaste flowers; basic floral skills Advanced gumpaste flowers Miniature cakes and decorated cookies Cake borders, color charts, painting, and more techniques Cake and confectionary gallery Recipes Patterns Measurement Bibiliography Index  She has covered every aspect of making a cake from the recipes to the actually physical construction of the cake to the decorations you place on it. She provides plenty of detailed instruction along with excellent photographs and idea's; there is a chapter that goes into both the English and metric version of batter and icing amounts; patterns to use for the designs as well as for cutting the cake, wonderful recipes for deliciously flavored cake batters, all the frostings and icings you can think of and so much more.   You will not be disappointed in this grand presentation from one of the finest instructors this country has to offer!! She is an esteemed member of the Institute of Culinary Education in New York City, and she more than proven herself by the devotion of her students as well as the growing multitude of admirers and "home" students who has been trained as well. A profound thank you Ms. Garrett! 
 "Over Sea Under Stone" is perhaps the weakest of the classic "Dark is Rising" series, though in itself it's quite a good book. In this, Susan Cooper kicks off her epic fantasy sequence with doses of Celtic legend, a good vs. evil battle, and a hunt for a mysterious, magical treasure.      Simon, Jane and Barney Drew have arrived at their great-uncle Merriman's seaside house for a vacation -- and rapidly become quite bored with the seaside village. But when exploring the attic, they unearth a very, very old map that is somehow connected with the legendary King Arthur. As anyone else would do, the kids begin the search to find a golden grail that is somewhere nearby.      But they soon find that they are not the only ones who want the map. A seemingly genial pair of vacationers are being slightly too inquisitive, and someone breaks into Merriman's house in search of the map. And Merriman reveals the origins of the map -- and an ages-old conflict between good and evil that hinges on who finds the grail first.      Taken alone, "Over Sea Under Stone" is a solid, even excellent fantasy story. But it's a little out of sync with the rest of the series. However it  sets excellent groundwork, has an intriguing storyline and a good mix of folklore and Arthuriana, and offers us one of the most mysterious and likable "magic mentors," Merriman Lyon. It starts off with every kid's fantasy -- treasure maps and ancient kings -- and rapidly blossoms into something much more.      One of the most noticeable differences between this and Cooper's later books is the writing; the writing in her later books becomes much more verbose and descriptive and magical. Here it's quite stark and plain, without a great deal of detail or mystical mind-blowing. "Over Sea" is mostly very prosaic and very rooted in our world, and many important concepts in the series aren't even touched on.       The Drew kids are the sort of siblings that pop up in old E. Nesbit books -- plucky, chirpy and on vacation. There isn't a lot of difference between their individual personalities, although they are quite likable. Their "uncle" Merriman is pleasant, humorous, but at the same time Cooper implies that still waters run deep. The malevolent Mr. and Miss Withers are initially very jovial and kindly, but you can sense something rotten underneath.      The first of the "Dark is Rising" books is somewhat out of sync with the novels that follow, but taken alone it's still an excellent, well-written fantasy adventure 
 This book is the closest thing to the "diffinitive" work of its type that you're going to find. Period. It just is. It's all been said: the photos are gorgeous, the anecdotes are priceless, the writing is sharp, and so on, etc. It's an indispensable resource and you'd be an absolute fool to not own this. Ken Bloom and Frank Vlastnik clearly know what they're talking about and I know I am not alone in looking forward to their next collaboration 
 This is the most authoritative collection of Kafka's immortal short fiction; it includes the most respected translations of each story (mostly by Willa and Edwin Muir), and a fair introduction from John Updike.   Kafka was the greatest writer of short fiction of the modern era. Such stories as 'The Metamorphosis,' 'In the Penal Colony,' 'The Hunger Artist,' and 'The Great Wall of China' encapsulate the tyrannical, dehumanizing regimentation of the modern world. Kafka may be difficult to read, and the allegorical form is not enjoyable for everyone. However, it is impossible to not be drawn into the strange madness of 'The Hunger Artist,' or 'The Country Doctor,' surely two of the most terrifying works of literature of the period.   In many ways, Kafka was a precursor to the sort of self-reflexive artistry that would later be found in Beckett, Sartre, and Brecht; Kafka is always aware that he is working within the literary realm, and he knows that he cannot escape it. Therefore, (brilliantly), he turns it into an advantage, by intoning the mystical, the metaphysical, and the surreal. His characters are often animals, metaphors, or simply moods. This approach has its strengths, but only in the hands of a true master. Fortunately for us, Kafka was just that, in the truest sense: a master of form, and unity of content. 
 If you are into collecting old computers (mainly the 8bit era), this is a must own.  It has the specs and approximate prices for each machine from the first minicomputers to the mid 90's with the Amigas and soforth.  Some x86 architecture items, mainly the revolutionary items for any 486/Pentium items since they are ... well the industry standard practically.  I recommend in a heartbeat 
 Great book! It is small and compact (though not light) but I feel like it has everything-- explanations, easy-to-read charts, great diagrams, all in one place. I heard that Big Moore has better explanations but I think Baby Moore does a fine job; all the information is in one concise book. 
 My six year old daughter loved this book.  The words were easy enough for her to read and the repetition reinforced her early reading skills.  We used this book as an introduction to perspective, maps, and self-awareness.  The pictures were fresh, clean, and uncluttered.  We plan on getting the rest of the series 
 This book is really great .I really disagree with the people who badmouthed it.I mean this is when they get Emily.And that is very inportant.I think that people who wrote those bad things about it did not even read it .And decided to make trouble .And write bad things.keep writing Ann M. Martin.If she stops it will be your fault 
 TCMNG is a love it or hate it black comedy that isn't for everybody, but I loved it! The funny opening monologue, the robotic leg, the pizza, the stuffed state trooper...!  It's all a scream 
 This book is excellent for all the information you may want to know on dutch ovens, how they are manufactured, seasoning, storage, care, how to cook (several ways), etc.  There are only a few recipes which are good.  I would buy this book again as a reference book.  It is great to give as a gift with a dutch oven 
 DO WHATEVER YOU MUST TO GET THIS BOOK 
 The cancellation of this short lived but highly acclaimed series is perhaps the biggest mistake made by a network. Ever. Fox executives broadcast the series out of order, it was preempted several times for baseball...it didn't have a chance.  *The DVD box set of Firefly has been in the top 20 boxed sets in Amazon sales since its release in 2003. Not too shabby for a series that was limited to 14 episodes. Must be something to it, huh?  Give this series the chance it deserves. Download #1 Serenity and try it on for size. It's space westerny goodness all around.  If you find you are drawn to this series, come visit us at fireflyfans.net. We'll be waiting for you with Mudder's Milk and Strawberries.    
 Reading this book is work -- in the Donald Hall definition, for to read it is to become absorbed in each word to the exclusion of all else.  Hall writes of his ancestors, of the rocky farms of New England, a small dairy,  his father's early death, his wife's gardening, and then quite suddenly as  his colon cancer recurs, of the possible end to life and the very prosaic  tasks of cancelling readings, putting papers in order for survivors.   Throughout, he achieves a sense of time, place and self which crosses  generations.  He charts both the constants and the increasing changes of  the farm which has been in his family for more than a hundred years and the  country around it.  Hall, like God, love and grace--all of which are found  in abundance in this book, abides 
 I love my teapot it pours beautifully. And the shape is wonderful! It is one of the best teapots I have ever owned 
 The remarkable thing about this book is it contains so much wisdom in so few words.  It truly lives up to its title - A Manual For Living.    If there is any fault to be found with the book it would be in its brevity.  I have read many books that say less in four times the number of words.  It is really amazing that so many of the truths of living a purposeful life filled with happiness have been around for so long.  We struggle with day to day problems because we fail to seek the answers contained in this book.  It is also amazing that most of todays graduates of institutions of higer learning do not possess the wisdom that Epictetus did.  We seem to have become a nation concentrating on acquiring knowledge without learning how to apply that knowledge.  Epictetus shows us the way to achieve our purpose in life. To achieve freedom, which he says is the ultimate way to live.  Some of the better lessons are: You become what you give your attention to. Think things through and fully commit! A half-hearted spirit has no power.  Tentative efforts lead to tentative outcomes. Wise people on the other hand realise that we are the source of everything good or bad.  It you want all the wisdom without an excessive amount of reading, this book is for you.  It is short enough you can read it weekly and let the concepts sink into your subconscious mind where they can lead you to the life you were designed to live 
 A good children's novel that doesn't have a "message" of the left or right to force down kids' throats.  Kids can actually read this for fun.  What a unique concept in this genre 
 This book is a great read, and although it was written some 92 years ago the basic message is as true today as it was then, And as it said in the first edition "Handbook for Instruction in Good Citizenship" still applies, so read it and apply the ideas for a better world 
 This is a wonderfully funny book to share with young girls.  It's a perfect book to teach persuasion-if you're a teacher.  
 As it stands today, John Hersey's "Hiroshima" is a two-layered book. Written in 1946, the first four chapters, comprising 90 pages, describe the experiences of six inhabitants of Hiroshima, from the morning of August 6, 1945 when the bomb was dropped, through the following year. Added in 1985, chapter 5 adds a further 60 pages that enable the reader to trace the long-term consequences of the bomb on the lives of these six people, as well as Japan and the world in general.  The witnesses chosen by Hersey, "who were among the luckiest in Hiroshima" (p87), insofar as they were not instantly vaporized, burned to a cinder or flayed alive, are wonderfully diverse. Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto was a Methodist minister; Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, a war widow and mother of three; Miss Toshiko Sazaki, a clerk about 20 years old; and Fr. Wilhelm Kleinsorge, a 38-year-old German Jesuit.  The last two, Mazakazu Fujii and Terufumi Sasaki, were both doctors, a profession much in demand in the aftermath of the bombing, as only 65 of the 150 doctors in the city had survived, and most of them were so severely wounded that they could not be of any assistance to anyone. As for the 1,780 nurses, 1,654 were either dead or incapacitated, resulting in massive overwork for the small and virtually helpless remaining staff.  "Hiroshima" is of value mostly as a testimony, adding six more life stories to the existing literature, and enabling the reader to form a more complete picture of the aftereffects of the blast. Unlike "Children of the A-Bomb" though, a volume which I recently reviewed, it gains strength from its interweaving of the individual stories, as people meet and lose sight of each other, giving the book a unity and a dramatic construction that is reminiscent of the familiar disaster-movie pattern.  Quite unobtrusively, the author also manages to give us the big picture, through the sparse, judicious use of statistics and other general information. The book thus answered some of the questions I had left after my previous readings on the subject, such as the role of charitable institutions after the bombing, Dr. Sasaki illustrating the work of the Red Cross for instance.  I also wondered whether the Japanese had suffered the same fate as some German civilians in the firestorms of WWII (as described by Jorg Friedrich in "The Fire : The Bombing of Germany 1940-1945"): getting stuck and burned alive in boiling asphalt. Hersey partially answered this question by mentioning that in the afternoon of August 6, "the asphalt of the streets was still so soft and hot from the fires that walking was uncomfortable." So some of the horrors endured by the Germans must have been repeated there too.   This book may well be the best introduction on the market to Hiroshima as seen by the victims. It can be helpfully complemented by the aforementioned "Children of the A-Bomb: Testament of the Boys and Girls of Hiroshima" edited by Dr. Arata Osada; Keiji Nakazawa's 10-volume manga "Barefoot Gen" (a rather ugly but powerful series, which is much superior to the two movie adaptations); Paul Wilmshurst's 2005 BBC documentary on the subject; and Koreyoshi Kurahara and Roger Spottiswoode's brilliant "Hiroshima" (1995), which seamlessly blends stock films and reconstructions in a dispassionate narrative of the events leading up to the dropping of the bomb. 
 I bought this for Christmas for my 83 year old mom--She ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT! It brings back so many wonderful memories for her.  
 ...reading delight.  Whenever I get depressed or feel like I can't start another book, I re-read some passages of this book written by Charles Dickens.  It is one of the best books written in English.  Intentionally syrupy and over-sweet, Dickens writes so perfectly as to make the reader wonder how anyone could ever write so gorgeously.  If you pass this one up, you're cheating yourself.  I couldn't put the book down.  It's a rare and special novel that keeps me in bed over the weekend reading from dawn to sleep 
 Louie Bank's life is great, but all that changes with a blink of an eye.  Louie has great friends, a fabulous girlfriend and football.  He has some bad things though like a messed up football coach and a bully that wants to beat him up.  Louie has been training hard all off season of football.  He just wants a starting position.  He trains with his best friend Carter.  Carter is a big, strong, and smart guy.  Louie makes a starting position on the eight man football team with Carter at quarter back.  There is one more guy for mention Boomer Cowans.  He is the starting running back.  Boomer is big and strong, but as dumb as a log.  Louie has the most popular girlfriend in the whole school.  Her name is Becky Sanders.  She means the world to Louie.  Then something happens that will turn his life around.  Will Louie ever survive what happened? This is a great book about a high school kid.  This book is great for a few reasons.  The first one is it keeps you guessing on what will happen next.  The second reason is this could happen in real life.  I recommend this book to anyone that likes football, a little romance and a lot of fun.  This book scores my vote for the player of the game. 
 My wife likes mysteries -- I don't. I find them contrived and artificial. Ms. Winspear writes stories. "Messenger of Truth" is a riveting tale of postwar England. The characters have flesh; the locations have color and the prose is wonderful. The mystery is only the plot.  I will be reading more of Ms. Winspear, but I am looking forward to the next Masie Dobbs mystery 
 I was born into the park service and lived the tourist experience. This book really helped me form a  perspective about  my early years growing up in western tourist and resort environments.  Western history is fascinating, but this angle on western history really gives another intriguing dimension to america's perception of the mythic frontier 
 This second installment in the Coyote trilogy was every bit as enjoyable as the first.  In "Coyote" Mr. Steele presents the story of the first interstellar colonization, cast in a light similar to that of the American Revolution.  The intrepid colonists have managed to escape a repressive right-wing government only to find that they must now defend their freedoms against the efforts of a left-wing government (that has arisen to power in the 200 or so years that have passed on earth) to subjugate the colonists and reap the benefits of the new world via slave labor.  Owing to time-dilation inherent in the travel between the stars, Steele is able to have his original colonists face yet another repressive government and he makes excellent use of the themes and characters presented in Coyote.  The Coyote trilogy belongs to the adventure genre rather than that of  science-fiction.  Sure, there are some elements of science fiction, but this is purely a story of colonization and discovery--discovery not only of geography but of the importance of good government and leadership.  Adventure seems to have fallen out of favor.  Our world is too well understood to support adventure tales.  Honestly, can anyone even get lost anymore?  If so, where is your cell phone?  No, adventure these days requires either an alternate history, a third-world militaristic setting, or going beyond the moon.  Want to go to Everest?  Hire a guide and get in line.  Want to go to space?  Join the crowds.  How about the exotic South Pacific--boring, Survivor has been there and done that.  Our world has lost the spirit of discovery.  We have become more worried about disturbing the local flora and fauna than seeing new sights and paving new trails.  Accordingly, we need to get our butts into space and recapture the spirit of the western expansion.  But enough philosophizing...  Not only has discovery become passe, we have also forgotten the importance of fighting for what we believe in.  In our astonishingly successful economy it has become more important to consume than to discover--more important to celebrate diversity than to seek after truth.  Too many have bought into the fallacy that all forms of government are acceptable--as long as our oil remains cheap.  In the adventure genre our heroes fight for important things--they take risks and explore new places and ideas.  We need much more of this kind of literature 
 Very informative and well-written. This book is well worth the money. Explict, modern and specific 
 Marguerite Henry is truly one of the best writers of all time. She writes wonderful, timeless stories which will delight animal lovers of all ages. In this book, a brother and sister Paul and Maureen capture a wild mare named the Phantom as well as her foal Misty. It has some adventure, combined with a wonderful storyline and a great ending which is suitable for younger children and sensitive readers. Some parts are intense but nothing too scary or sad happens. It's a very well paced story and full of fun and has a few laughs along the way. I loved this story as a kid and still love it as an adult. I have no children of my own but I would love to read this to my nieces who are 4 and 8 years old. I think they would love this book! 
 Maybe this book does not contain so many "hits" as others, but  it is still a good old Gary Larson Classic. I am a huge fan of his work and  I think it is worth buying and reading. Among other things to find out,  what REALLY happened with Dorothy and co., when they enetered the yellow  road 
 The book, Miss Rumphius, is one of my favorite books.  I love the colorful illustrations and the touching story.  This story is about a woman who is called Miss Rumphius by everyone she knows.  Miss Rumphius travels the world with one mission- to find a place to live and make it beautiful.  I believe that this story takes place somewhere in New England, specifically Maine, because of the sceneary in the illustrations.  I recommend this story for kids between the ages of 5 to adults.
